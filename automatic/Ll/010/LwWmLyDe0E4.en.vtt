 pitching exercise 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.160
 a rope that makes opposition we can 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.230
 locate at the height that each one creates 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.119

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.029
 centimeters where we're going to demand the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.330

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.220
 expect him to use several profiles in 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.830
 some occasions also to use 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.360
 at once go straight to the ball and what 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.550

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.950
 front towards the rope knee jump to the 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.630
 chest or if I catch the ball 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.890
 laterally using both profiles 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.890
