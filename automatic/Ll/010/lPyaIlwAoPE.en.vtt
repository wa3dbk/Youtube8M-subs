attack so you have to be careful oh look
at<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.729> Pez<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.950> serve<00:01:11.189> now<00:01:11.460> used

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
at that Pez this is the serve now used

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.340 
at that Pez this is the serve now used
to<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.150> advantage<00:01:12.900> when<00:01:13.049> you're<00:01:13.140> serving

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
to be advantage when you're serving

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.050 
to be advantage when you're serving
because<00:01:13.710> you're<00:01:13.890> dictating<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.580> pace<00:01:14.610> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
because you're dictating the pace and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.120 
because you're dictating the pace and
the<00:01:15.119> placement<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.689> spin<00:01:16.049> but<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.979> don't

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
the placement and spin but you don't

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.620 
the placement and spin but you don't
have<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.430> rhythm<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.850> five<00:01:18.060> serves<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.540> you

have the rhythm of five serves that you
used<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.170> that's<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> real<00:01:19.680> difference
