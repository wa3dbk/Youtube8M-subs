and everything are straight the other
the<00:01:11.010> interesting<00:01:11.460> thing<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.030> camera<00:01:12.240> does

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the interesting thing is the camera does

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.780 
the interesting thing is the camera does
have<00:01:12.900> actually<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> level<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.340> both<00:01:14.490> for

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
have actually a level in it in both for

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.179 
have actually a level in it in both for
horizontal<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.630> vertical<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.770> can

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
horizontal and vertical so you can

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.300 
horizontal and vertical so you can
actually<00:01:18.110> keep<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.320> camera<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.860> get<00:01:20.009> your

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
interesting feature pentek's always

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.340 
interesting feature pentek's always
thinks<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.770> these<00:01:41.009> things<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.570> holder

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350

thinks of these things is the holder
will<00:01:43.560> carry<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.950> spare<00:01:44.280> card<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.030> right

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
will carry a spare card for you right

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.569 
will carry a spare card for you right
here<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.720> battery<00:01:46.140> container<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.280> that

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
here in the battery container so that

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.130 
here in the battery container so that
allows<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.640> have<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:51.479> extra<00:01:51.930> bit<00:01:52.079> of

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
allows you to have that extra bit of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.710 
allows you to have that extra bit of
insurance<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.270> reasons<00:01:54.659> for

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
insurance and one of the reasons for

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.749 
insurance and one of the reasons for
that<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.170> because<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.710> camera<00:01:56.040> actually

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
that is because this camera actually

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.499 
that is because this camera actually
takes<00:01:57.659> Tube<00:01:58.350> cards<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.820> can<00:01:59.850> pre-program

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
takes Tube cards and you can pre-program

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.289 
takes Tube cards and you can pre-program
four<00:02:01.500> different<00:02:01.890> ways<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.280> believe<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:03.090> can

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
four different ways I believe you can

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.469 
four different ways I believe you can
program<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.380> camera<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.700> will<00:02:05.909> send

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
program the camera so that it will send

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.910 
program the camera so that it will send
a<00:02:06.890> raw<00:02:07.890> image<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:09.209> one<00:02:09.450> car<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.110> JPEG<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
a raw image to one car the JPEG to the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.220 
a raw image to one car the JPEG to the
other<00:02:11.069> or<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.910> can<00:02:12.030> use<00:02:12.209> one<00:02:12.569> card

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
other or it can use one card

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.680 
other or it can use one card
we<00:02:13.319> fill<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.040> then<00:02:14.190> move<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.760> other<00:02:14.970> so
