 again I was puzzled I do not know 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.869
 explain to the child how to proceed 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.419
 wanted to ask you 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:26.960

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:32.990
 some dinosaur food 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.170

 here they lived lived 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.610

 disaster planet 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.670

 whether it was icing 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.510
 but very sharply 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.580
 like the same to my dinosaurs 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.200
 statistics 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.420
 maybe it 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.610
 it was like a prelude to the appearance on earth 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.960
 human dinosaur because there was a case 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.610
 such large animals damn him 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.970
 did not cope 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.140
 and remained tsr in Lithuania feeding 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.070
 the original request remained only 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.109
 little 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:26.490
 crows lizards creeping there 

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:29.270
 percent 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.130

 tons there are such dry theories 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.250
 and how it was really clear recall 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.660
 that it is rather difficult for us 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.750
 the right way 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.600
 in this thickness of time 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.700
 separates us for hundreds of millions of years 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.990
 this figure 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.119

 person
