then<00:06:01.120> it<00:06:01.420> would<00:06:01.540> amplify<00:06:01.870> him<00:06:02.170> as<00:06:02.290> well<00:06:02.440> but

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
then it would amplify him as well but

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.160 
then it would amplify him as well but
that's<00:06:03.130> just<00:06:03.550> to<00:06:03.700> polish<00:06:04.030> it<00:06:04.170> um<00:06:06.960> so<00:06:07.960> that's
