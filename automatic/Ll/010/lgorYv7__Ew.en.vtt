rock or when you're preparing I think
that<00:01:23.950> breathing<00:01:24.490> is<00:01:24.670> definitely<00:01:25.450> something

that breathing is definitely something

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.150 
that breathing is definitely something
that's<00:01:26.140> really<00:01:26.680> really<00:01:26.710> important<00:01:28.920> before<00:01:29.920> I

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
that's really really important before I

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.830 
that's really really important before I
try<00:01:30.700> for<00:01:30.759> something<00:01:31.180> that's<00:01:31.509> really

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
try for something that's really

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.290 
try for something that's really
difficult<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.649> have<00:01:33.009> to<00:01:33.220> be<00:01:33.340> aware<00:01:33.640> of<00:01:33.700> my

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
difficult I have to be aware of my

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
before I start climbing I find myself

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.680 
before I start climbing I find myself
maybe<00:01:45.340> holding<00:01:45.789> my<00:01:45.940> breath<00:01:46.149> while<00:01:46.479> I'm

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
maybe holding my breath while I'm

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.169 
maybe holding my breath while I'm
climbing<00:01:46.990> or<00:01:47.649> getting<00:01:48.100> really<00:01:48.460> tired<00:01:48.729> because

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.070 

if<00:01:56.800> I<00:01:57.010> can<00:01:57.220> control<00:01:57.430> that<00:01:57.790> breath<00:01:58.330> before<00:01:58.840> I

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
if I can control that breath before I
