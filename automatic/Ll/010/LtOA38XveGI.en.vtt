00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:08.430 
well it's been five days and our beer is

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.760 
well it's been five days and our beer is
ready<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.910> be<00:00:09.000> transferred<00:00:09.360> from<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.840> 6.5

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:10.770

carboy here so I'm going to use my auto
siphon<00:00:16.349> again<00:00:19.760> try<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.789> keep<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.180> off<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
siphon again try and keep that off the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.140 
siphon again try and keep that off the
bottom<00:00:22.020> where<00:00:22.410> all<00:00:22.530> this<00:00:22.710> sediment<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.340> right

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
bottom where all this sediment is right

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.510 
bottom where all this sediment is right
down<00:00:24.330> here

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.250 

when<00:00:29.090> you<00:00:29.180> transfer<00:00:29.600> the<00:00:29.690> beer<00:00:29.870> you<00:00:29.900> want<00:00:30.050> to

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
when you transfer the beer you want to

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.010 
when you transfer the beer you want to
agitate<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.950> beer<00:00:31.280> at<00:00:31.820> this<00:00:32.029> phase<00:00:32.330> as<00:00:32.690> little

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
agitate the beer at this phase as little

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.280 
agitate the beer at this phase as little
as<00:00:33.110> possible<00:00:33.730> so<00:00:34.730> you'll<00:00:34.910> notice<00:00:35.210> that<00:00:35.240> the<00:00:35.630> to

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
as possible so you'll notice that the to

as possible so you'll notice that the to
go<00:00:36.530> holding<00:00:36.890> on<00:00:37.010> at<00:00:37.130> the<00:00:37.190> bottom<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:38.000> beer

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
go holding on at the bottom and the beer

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.900 
go holding on at the bottom and the beer
spoon<00:00:38.510> from<00:00:38.720> the<00:00:38.840> bottom<00:00:39.110> out<00:00:39.760> as<00:00:40.760> we're

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
spoon from the bottom out as we're

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.120 
spoon from the bottom out as we're
before<00:00:41.239> we<00:00:41.420> wanted<00:00:41.660> to<00:00:41.690> aerate<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:42.080> beer<00:00:42.380> so

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
before we wanted to aerate the beer so

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.890 
before we wanted to aerate the beer so
we<00:00:43.250> were<00:00:43.400> splashing<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:44.239> beer<00:00:44.420> round<00:00:44.720> from

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
we were splashing the beer round from

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.290 
we were splashing the beer round from
the<00:00:45.020> top<00:00:48.489> we're<00:00:49.489> getting<00:00:49.550> real<00:00:49.790> close<00:00:49.820> to<00:00:50.210> the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
the top we're getting real close to the

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.880 
the top we're getting real close to the
end<00:00:50.450> of<00:00:50.600> this<00:00:50.690> here<00:00:50.989> so<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:51.500> have<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:51.739> be<00:00:51.860> very

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
end of this here so you have to be very

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.410 
end of this here so you have to be very
careful<00:00:52.340> to<00:00:53.500> not<00:00:54.500> pick<00:00:54.860> up<00:00:55.210> much<00:00:56.210> of<00:00:56.239> the

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
careful to not pick up much of the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.960 
careful to not pick up much of the
sediment<00:00:56.870> yeah<00:00:57.230> I<00:00:57.500> brown<00:00:58.340> stuff<00:00:58.610> in<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.790> back

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
sediment yeah I brown stuff in the back

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.620 
sediment yeah I brown stuff in the back
is<00:00:59.150> on<00:00:59.300> the<00:01:00.130> sediment<00:01:01.270> then<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:02.360> beer<00:01:02.540> was

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
is on the sediment then the beer was

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.730 
is on the sediment then the beer was
sitting<00:01:02.960> here<00:01:02.989> for<00:01:03.500> about<00:01:03.530> two<00:01:04.130> weeks<00:01:04.160> and

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
sitting here for about two weeks and

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.870 
sitting here for about two weeks and
hope<00:01:06.740> this<00:01:06.979> in<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.220> flavors<00:01:07.610> are<00:01:07.670> going<00:01:07.820> to

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
hope this in the flavors are going to

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.950 
hope this in the flavors are going to
mellow<00:01:08.090> out<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:09.520> by<00:01:10.520> siphoning<00:01:11.330> it<00:01:11.690> from

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
mellow out and by siphoning it from

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.280 
mellow out and by siphoning it from
Maine<00:01:12.950> carboy<00:01:13.399> into<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.759> secondary<00:01:14.270> we<00:01:15.140> also

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
Maine carboy into the secondary we also

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.880 
Maine carboy into the secondary we also
lost<00:01:15.680> a<00:01:15.860> lot<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.100> that<00:01:17.200> stuff<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.410> trout<00:01:18.649> we

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
lost a lot of that stuff the trout we

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.440 
lost a lot of that stuff the trout we
don't<00:01:19.040> want<00:01:19.220> floating<00:01:19.670> around<00:01:19.759> in<00:01:20.119> our<00:01:20.149> beer

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
don't want floating around in our beer

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.440 
don't want floating around in our beer
and<00:01:20.720> it<00:01:21.440> should<00:01:21.590> be<00:01:21.619> clear<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.270> taste<00:01:23.270> a<00:01:23.360> lot

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
and it should be clear and taste a lot

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.810 
and it should be clear and taste a lot
better<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:24.290> it's<00:01:24.560> been<00:01:24.740> two<00:01:24.950> weeks<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.460> I've

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
better so it's been two weeks and I've

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.410 
better so it's been two weeks and I've
taken<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.420> specific<00:01:27.110> gravity<00:01:27.500> reading<00:01:27.800> and<00:01:28.420> the

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
taken a specific gravity reading and the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.870 
taken a specific gravity reading and the
beer<00:01:29.630> is<00:01:29.869> at<00:01:30.140> its<00:01:30.320> final<00:01:30.680> gravity<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.490> it's

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
beer is at its final gravity and it's

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.550 
beer is at its final gravity and it's
not<00:01:32.030> going<00:01:32.119> to<00:01:32.210> get<00:01:32.330> any<00:01:32.630> more<00:01:32.869> sugars

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
not going to get any more sugars

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.760 
not going to get any more sugars
fermented<00:01:34.069> into<00:01:34.220> beer<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:35.750> we<00:01:36.350> are<00:01:36.470> ready<00:01:36.679> to

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
fermented into beer so we are ready to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.660 
fermented into beer so we are ready to
transfer<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.399> into<00:01:37.610> our<00:01:38.649> five<00:01:39.649> gallon<00:01:40.100> so

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
transfer it into our five gallon so

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.139 
transfer it into our five gallon so
decayed<00:01:40.940> here<00:01:41.440> and<00:01:43.000> we're<00:01:44.000> going<00:01:44.119> to

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
decayed here and we're going to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.359 
decayed here and we're going to
pressurize<00:01:44.569> this<00:01:44.780> with<00:01:44.990> co2<00:01:45.259> which<00:01:46.009> is<00:01:46.160> going

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
pressurize this with co2 which is going

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:58.240 
pressurize this with co2 which is going
to<00:01:46.459> create<00:01:46.700> force<00:01:47.090> carbonation

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.790 

alright<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.060> again<00:01:59.300> we<00:01:59.510> start<00:02:00.200> our<00:02:00.380> site<00:02:00.620> thing

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
alright so again we start our site thing

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.320 
alright so again we start our site thing
going<00:02:01.070> here

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.550 

all<00:02:05.330> right<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.720> can<00:02:05.750> see<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.050> beer<00:02:06.230> filling

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
all right you can see the beer filling

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.300 
all right you can see the beer filling
up<00:02:06.650> there<00:02:07.869> nice<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.080> steady<00:02:09.259> well<00:02:09.950> we're<00:02:10.160> down

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
up there nice and steady well we're down

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.840 
up there nice and steady well we're down
to<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.610> very<00:02:10.729> bottom<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:12.250> crucially<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.280> try

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
to the very bottom and crucially I try

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.400 
to the very bottom and crucially I try
not<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.060> stir<00:02:14.420> up<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.600> yeast<00:02:14.900> as<00:02:15.080> much<00:02:15.260> as

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
not to stir up the yeast as much as

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.610 
not to stir up the yeast as much as
possible

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.399 

but<00:02:20.190> now<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.430> our<00:02:20.580> beer<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.360> almost<00:02:22.110> at<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
but now that our beer is almost at the

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.500 
but now that our beer is almost at the
top<00:02:22.440> here<00:02:22.890> we've<00:02:23.400> got<00:02:23.549> about<00:02:23.610> exactly<00:02:24.299> five

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
top here we've got about exactly five

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
top here we've got about exactly five
Aeons<00:02:25.430> snap<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.549> lid<00:02:26.700> out<00:02:26.879> here<00:02:27.530> just

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
Aeons snap the lid out here just

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.320 
Aeons snap the lid out here just
dropping<00:02:28.799> some<00:02:29.159> sanitizer<00:02:29.580> solution<00:02:29.879> right

there out run out of gas and we're going

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.730 
there out run out of gas and we're going
to<00:03:11.569> fill<00:03:11.780> up

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
okay so once we fill it up a 302 lat

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.730 
okay so once we fill it up a 302 lat
some<00:03:17.860> that<00:03:17.980> pressure<00:03:18.250> out<00:03:18.490> I<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:20.470> want<00:03:20.650> make

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
some that pressure out I just want make

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.470 
some that pressure out I just want make
sure<00:03:20.800> absolutely<00:03:21.220> no<00:03:21.670> air<00:03:21.910> in<00:03:21.940> there<00:03:22.300> what's

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480

okay okay so now we have the kid and the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.890 
okay okay so now we have the kid and the
co2<00:03:47.750> both<00:03:48.739> in<00:03:48.920> refrigerator<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:50.359> we<00:03:50.719> need<00:03:50.840> to

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
co2 both in refrigerator and we need to

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.170 
co2 both in refrigerator and we need to
force<00:03:51.140> carbonate<00:03:51.590> beer<00:03:51.950> so<00:03:52.670> first<00:03:53.060> thing

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
force carbonate beer so first thing

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.679 
force carbonate beer so first thing
we're<00:03:53.269> going<00:03:53.359> to<00:03:53.450> do<00:03:53.540> is<00:03:53.689> connect<00:03:54.159> gas<00:03:55.159> line

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
we're going to do is connect gas line

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.539 
we're going to do is connect gas line
and<00:03:57.010> then<00:03:58.010> we're<00:03:58.340> going<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.519> turn<00:03:58.790> back<00:03:58.969> on<00:03:59.319> co2

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
and then we're going to turn back on co2

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.069 
and then we're going to turn back on co2
we<00:04:01.549> use<00:04:01.790> these<00:04:01.969> adjusting<00:04:02.450> screw<00:04:02.659> the<00:04:02.840> front

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
we use these adjusting screw the front

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.979 
we use these adjusting screw the front
the<00:04:03.590> dial-in<00:04:04.010> are<00:04:04.189> correct<00:04:04.430> pressure<00:04:04.870> so<00:04:05.870> I'm

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
the dial-in are correct pressure so I'm

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.920 
the dial-in are correct pressure so I'm
going<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.200> use<00:04:06.319> about<00:04:06.500> 20<00:04:06.859> to<00:04:07.010> 30<00:04:07.599> pounds<00:04:08.599> of

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
going to use about 20 to 30 pounds of

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.050 
going to use about 20 to 30 pounds of
