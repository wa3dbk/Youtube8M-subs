going<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.620> turn<00:04:15.920> your<00:04:16.130> features<00:04:16.609> off<00:04:16.910> when<00:04:17.630> the

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
going to turn your features off when the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.720 
going to turn your features off when the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
phone gets lower because we can consume

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.360 
phone gets lower because we can consume
more<00:04:19.910> bet<00:04:20.120> can<00:04:20.359> sit<00:04:20.600> can<00:04:20.900> serve<00:04:21.200> more<00:04:21.919> battery

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
more bet can sit can serve more battery
