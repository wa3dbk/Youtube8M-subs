00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
everything they did was cool to the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.670 
everything they did was cool to the
point<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.229> she<00:01:11.100> went<00:01:11.610> through<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> phase<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
point of she went through a phase of

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.800 
point of she went through a phase of
dyeing<00:01:13.680> yarn<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.549> she<00:01:15.420> had<00:01:15.570> all<00:01:15.600> these

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
dyeing yarn so she had all these

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.660 
dyeing yarn so she had all these
beautiful<00:01:16.290> hand<00:01:16.560> dyed<00:01:16.890> yarns<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.400> think

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
beautiful hand dyed yarns and we think

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.640 
beautiful hand dyed yarns and we think
gosh<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.360> can't<00:01:18.570> even<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> grape<00:01:19.619> juice

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
gosh we can't even do the grape juice

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.219 
gosh we can't even do the grape juice
we're<00:01:20.159> being<00:01:20.340> lazy<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.479> we're<00:01:21.659> making<00:01:21.810> grape

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
we're being lazy so we're making grape

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.200 
we're being lazy so we're making grape
juice<00:01:22.530> I've<00:01:22.890> never<00:01:23.100> done<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.909> hope<00:01:24.090> it

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
juice I've never done this I hope it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.600 
juice I've never done this I hope it
turns<00:01:24.330> out<00:01:24.600> well<00:01:24.810> I'm<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.590> sure<00:01:25.650> how<00:01:26.040> long<00:01:26.100> you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
turns out well I'm not sure how long you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.240 
turns out well I'm not sure how long you
keep<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.060> stored<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.200> get<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> flavor<00:01:28.710> correct

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
keep it stored to get the flavor correct

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.929 
keep it stored to get the flavor correct
I've<00:01:30.150> read<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> week<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.460> guess

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
I've read as little as a week so I guess

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.219 
I've read as little as a week so I guess
I'm<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.270> planning<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> month

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
I'm just planning on about a month

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.730 
I'm just planning on about a month
called<00:01:34.650> tet<00:01:34.890> maybe<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.970> two<00:01:36.180> weeks

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
called tet maybe just one in two weeks

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.280 
called tet maybe just one in two weeks
also<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.979> did<00:01:38.310> use<00:01:38.610> organic<00:01:39.060> cane<00:01:39.540> sugar<00:01:39.570> you

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
also I did use organic cane sugar you

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.800 
also I did use organic cane sugar you
can<00:01:40.470> use<00:01:40.710> regular<00:01:41.159> sugar<00:01:41.450> honey<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.659> you'd

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
can use regular sugar honey if you'd

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.389 
can use regular sugar honey if you'd
like<00:01:42.990> though<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:44.630> probably<00:01:46.159> wouldn't<00:01:47.159> after

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
like though I probably wouldn't after

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.190 
like though I probably wouldn't after
reading<00:01:47.909> about<00:01:48.090> cooking<00:01:48.479> honey<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.899> kind<00:01:49.140> of

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
reading about cooking honey I kind of

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.380 
reading about cooking honey I kind of
regret<00:01:49.320> cooking<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.040> honey<00:01:50.220> now<00:01:50.430> it's<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.329> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
regret cooking with honey now it's not a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.090 
regret cooking with honey now it's not a
big<00:01:51.479> deal<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.619> don't<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
big deal it's just you don't get the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.560 
big deal it's just you don't get the
nutrient<00:01:53.549> value<00:01:53.790> from<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.869> honey

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
nutrient value from the honey

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.600 
nutrient value from the honey
so<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.630> got<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.079> boiling<00:01:59.009> water<00:01:59.280> about<00:01:59.430> this

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
so you got the boiling water about this

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.920 
so you got the boiling water about this

screw<00:03:21.330> things<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.900> rust<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.590> also<00:03:23.159> if<00:03:23.489> there

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
screw things to rust and also if there

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.280 
screw things to rust and also if there
was<00:03:23.940> any<00:03:24.180> type<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.450> food<00:03:24.690> particle<00:03:25.140> in<00:03:25.200> the

was any type of food particle in the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.170 
was any type of food particle in the
water<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:26.129> can<00:03:26.340> get<00:03:26.489> in<00:03:26.610> there<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:26.849> cause<00:03:26.970> it

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
water it can get in there and cause it

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.380 
water it can get in there and cause it
to<00:03:27.269> mold<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:28.260> that's<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.590> best<00:03:28.709> way<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.920> do<00:03:29.159> it

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
to mold so that's the best way to do it

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.970 
to mold so that's the best way to do it
and<00:03:30.390> then<00:03:30.540> once<00:03:30.750> they're<00:03:30.900> cold<00:03:31.170> kind<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.530> flick

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
the seal with your finger now

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.550 
the seal with your finger now
it<00:03:35.299> should<00:03:35.659> be<00:03:35.810> tough<00:03:36.019> it<00:03:36.260> shouldn't<00:03:36.530> just

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
it should be tough it shouldn't just

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.179 
it should be tough it shouldn't just
come<00:03:37.280> off<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:38.620> that's<00:03:39.620> how<00:03:39.829> you'll<00:03:39.980> know<00:03:40.040> if

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:40.189 
come off and that's how you'll know if

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.520 
come off and that's how you'll know if
it<00:03:40.370> feels<00:03:40.700> well<00:03:41.090> or<00:03:41.299> not<00:03:41.480> if<00:03:41.719> it<00:03:41.870> comes<00:03:42.109> off<00:03:42.290> it
