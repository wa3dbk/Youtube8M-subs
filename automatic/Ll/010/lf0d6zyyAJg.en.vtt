could test the equipment to try out the
projectors<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> computer<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.759> make

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
projectors and and the computer and make

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.209 
projectors and and the computer and make
sure<00:01:56.909> everything<00:01:57.390> was<00:01:57.509> running<00:01:57.659> smoothly

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
sure everything was running smoothly

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and they duplicated my entire studio Oh

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.510 
and they duplicated my entire studio Oh
from<00:02:05.700> from<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> Bronx<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.380> they<00:02:08.190> brought<00:02:08.399> it

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
from from the Bronx and they brought it

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.720 
from from the Bronx and they brought it
out<00:02:08.610> here<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.599> felt<00:02:10.590> really<00:02:10.770> comfortable<00:02:11.129> at

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
out here so I felt really comfortable at

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.190 
out here so I felt really comfortable at
the<00:02:12.060> studio

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the studio

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.390 
the studio
because<00:02:13.680> that's<00:02:13.860> my<00:02:14.099> exact<00:02:14.670> studio<00:02:15.270> in<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
because that's my exact studio in the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.380 
because that's my exact studio in the
Bronx<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:17.610> combine<00:02:17.819> sometimes<00:02:18.300> you

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
Bronx so you combine sometimes you

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.720 
Bronx so you combine sometimes you
combine<00:02:18.690> after<00:02:19.140> effects<00:02:19.470> with<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.489> actual

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
combine after effects with the actual

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.790 
combine after effects with the actual
live<00:02:21.090> drawing<00:02:21.420> at<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.959> same<00:02:22.140> time<00:02:22.319> when<00:02:22.769> I

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
live drawing at the same time when I

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.070 
live drawing at the same time when I
first<00:02:23.040> started<00:02:23.190> using<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.510> slate<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:24.989> the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
first started using the slate in the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.860 
first started using the slate in the
chalkboard<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.800> wanted<00:02:26.099> it<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.370> be<00:02:26.519> just<00:02:26.780> had<00:02:27.780> to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
chalkboard I wanted it to be just had to

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.050 
chalkboard I wanted it to be just had to
be<00:02:27.989> pure<00:02:28.470> chalkboard<00:02:29.310> drawings<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.940> know<00:02:29.970> I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
be pure chalkboard drawings you know I

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.449 
be pure chalkboard drawings you know I
couldn't<00:02:30.360> have<00:02:30.540> any<00:02:31.140> computer<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:31.890> used<00:02:32.160> at

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
couldn't have any computer is used at

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.979 
couldn't have any computer is used at
all<00:02:32.640> but<00:02:34.130> eventually<00:02:35.130> as<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.849> as<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.510> progressed

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
all but eventually as I as I progressed

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.220 
all but eventually as I as I progressed
I<00:02:37.680> realized<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.519> needed<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:39.269> there's

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
I realized that I needed that there's

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.710 
I realized that I needed that there's
strengths<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:40.799> computers<00:02:41.370> have<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:42.150> just

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
strengths that computers have that just

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.930 
strengths that computers have that just
drawing<00:02:43.200> by<00:02:43.410> hand<00:02:43.709> don't<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.519> was<00:02:44.640> actually

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
drawing by hand don't it was actually

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.190 
drawing by hand don't it was actually
interesting<00:02:45.269> because<00:02:45.299> as<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.930> was<00:02:46.049> watching

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
interesting because as I was watching

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.190 
interesting because as I was watching
him<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:46.650> were<00:02:46.709> watching<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:47.040> few<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.340> them<00:02:47.459> I

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
him and we were watching a few of them I

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.330 
him and we were watching a few of them I
would<00:02:49.200> be<00:02:49.319> like<00:02:49.530> without<00:02:49.890> them<00:02:50.160> with<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
would be like without them with the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
would be like without them with the
after-effects<00:02:50.819> do<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:50.970> be<00:02:51.060> like<00:02:51.180> no<00:02:51.329> I

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
after-effects do you be like no I

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.880 
after-effects do you be like no I
actually<00:02:51.569> died<00:02:51.900> actually<00:02:52.230> do<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.650> I'd<00:02:52.799> be

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
actually died actually do that I'd be

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.589 
actually died actually do that I'd be
like<00:02:53.099> that<00:02:53.549> one<00:02:53.730> was<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.090> right<00:02:54.329> you'd<00:02:54.510> be

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
like that one was you right you'd be

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.850 
like that one was you right you'd be
like<00:02:54.720> no<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:55.019> was<00:02:55.110> after<00:02:55.230> effects<00:02:55.590> right

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
like no that was after effects right

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.030 
like no that was after effects right
yeah<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.430> it's<00:02:56.790> really<00:02:57.000> seamless<00:02:57.540> Lewis<00:02:58.079> my<00:02:58.650> my

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
yeah so it's really seamless Lewis my my

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.830 
yeah so it's really seamless Lewis my my
assistant<00:02:59.549> that's<00:02:59.970> doing<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.269> after-effects

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
assistant that's doing the after-effects

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.600 
assistant that's doing the after-effects
he<00:03:01.290> was<00:03:01.530> able<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.799> do<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.040> in<00:03:02.190> just<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.489> couple

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
he was able to do it in just a couple

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.550 
he was able to do it in just a couple
you<00:03:03.329> know<00:03:03.420> just<00:03:03.599> a<00:03:03.690> couple<00:03:03.870> minutes<00:03:04.079> it's

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
interesting because as you watch them in

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.750 
interesting because as you watch them in
a<00:03:06.530> leica<00:03:07.530> gallery<00:03:07.799> you<00:03:08.069> watch<00:03:08.250> them<00:03:08.459> back<00:03:08.610> to

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
a leica gallery you watch them back to

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.690 
a leica gallery you watch them back to
back<00:03:08.880> like<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.239> um<00:03:10.049> you<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:11.099> get<00:03:11.310> used<00:03:11.549> to

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
back like that um you you get used to

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.610 
back like that um you you get used to
the<00:03:11.790> technique<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.900> kind<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.260> blurry<00:03:13.440> and

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
the technique and the kind of blurry and

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.289 
the technique and the kind of blurry and
then<00:03:13.739> all<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:14.010> sudden<00:03:14.040> when<00:03:14.400> one<00:03:14.610> part<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.180> it

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
then all of a sudden when one part of it

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.089 
then all of a sudden when one part of it
pops<00:03:15.630> out<00:03:15.870> it's<00:03:16.530> like<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.709> neat<00:03:16.980> little

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.940 
your toes as your as you're watching
them<00:03:20.760> back<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.030> back<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.510> know<00:03:21.600> they're<00:03:21.810> 15<00:03:22.290> to

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
them back to back you know they're 15 to

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.819 
them back to back you know they're 15 to
40<00:03:23.400> seconds<00:03:23.819> long<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.299> you<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:25.049> walk<00:03:25.230> in<00:03:25.500> and

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
40 seconds long and you can walk in and

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.580 
40 seconds long and you can walk in and
if<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.130> catch<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.639> end<00:03:26.819> of<00:03:27.060> one<00:03:27.569> then<00:03:28.319> you're

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
if you catch the end of one then you're

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.530 
if you catch the end of one then you're
gonna<00:03:28.650> start<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.100> new<00:03:29.130> one<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.609> intensity<00:03:30.480> I

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
gonna start a new one in intensity I

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.580 
gonna start a new one in intensity I
probably<00:03:30.780> end<00:03:30.930> up<00:03:30.989> watching<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.410> whole<00:03:31.560> thing
