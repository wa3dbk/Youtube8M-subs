about<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.490> long<00:00:14.700> despite<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.809> there<00:00:16.020> are<00:00:16.139> a

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
about that long despite that there are a

about that long despite that there are a
few<00:00:16.320> traditions<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.859> have<00:00:16.920> really

continued for a long time
one<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.380> nicest<00:00:19.650> ones<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.980> think<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.630> dates

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
one of the nicest ones I think is dates

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.849 
one of the nicest ones I think is dates
from<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> very<00:00:22.080> earliest<00:00:22.410> days<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.800> the

president<00:00:25.650> Edgar<00:00:25.890> Lovett<00:00:26.189> decided<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.330> he

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
president Edgar Lovett decided that he

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.929

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.450 
fact that we we all have a rice ring is
a<00:07:27.000> wonderful<00:07:27.720> tradition<00:07:27.870> and<00:07:28.410> that<00:07:28.979> those

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 
a wonderful tradition and that those

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.700 
a wonderful tradition and that those
rice<00:07:29.700> rings<00:07:29.970> basically<00:07:30.870> have<00:07:31.020> been<00:07:31.050> unchanged

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
rice rings basically have been unchanged

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.690 
rice rings basically have been unchanged
for<00:07:31.919> all<00:07:32.040> the<00:07:32.220> years<00:07:32.430> that<00:07:32.490> they<00:07:33.000> exist<00:07:33.390> and

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:34.700 
for all the years that they exist and

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.820 
for all the years that they exist and
when<00:07:35.700> you<00:07:35.850> see<00:07:36.330> one<00:07:36.540> out<00:07:36.930> in<00:07:37.229> the<00:07:37.320> world<00:07:37.530> it's

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:37.830 
when you see one out in the world it's

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.370 
when you see one out in the world it's
it's<00:07:38.340> a<00:07:38.520> very<00:07:39.150> clear<00:07:39.479> and<00:07:39.750> obvious<00:07:39.930> signal

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380 
it's a very clear and obvious signal

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.080 
it's a very clear and obvious signal
that<00:07:40.710> there's<00:07:41.220> someone<00:07:41.550> else<00:07:41.700> who's<00:07:41.880> been

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.090 
that there's someone else who's been

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.250 
that there's someone else who's been
some<00:07:42.300> of<00:07:42.390> the<00:07:42.479> through<00:07:42.780> some<00:07:42.930> of<00:07:43.050> the<00:07:43.110> same

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:43.260 
some of the through some of the same

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.850 
some of the through some of the same
things<00:07:43.500> that<00:07:43.560> you<00:07:43.680> have<00:07:43.919> been<00:07:44.180> someone<00:07:45.180> who's

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:45.860 
things that you have been someone who's

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.260 
things that you have been someone who's
had<00:07:46.860> those<00:07:47.070> same<00:07:47.250> experiences<00:07:47.430> and<00:07:48.090> some

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:48.270 
had those same experiences and some

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.550 
had those same experiences and some
someone<00:07:48.690> with<00:07:48.840> whom<00:07:48.930> you<00:07:48.990> have<00:07:49.169> something<00:07:49.470> in

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 
someone with whom you have something in

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.380 
someone with whom you have something in
common<00:07:49.770> and<00:07:50.130> that's<00:07:50.460> the<00:07:50.669> value<00:07:50.789> of<00:07:51.000> tradition

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:51.390 
common and that's the value of tradition

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.990 
common and that's the value of tradition
whatever<00:07:51.570> that<00:07:51.900> tradition<00:07:52.289> is<00:07:52.729> it's<00:07:53.729> hard<00:07:53.940> to

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 
whatever that tradition is it's hard to

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.430 
whatever that tradition is it's hard to
know<00:07:54.150> since<00:07:54.419> I've<00:07:54.539> been<00:07:54.660> at<00:07:54.810> rice<00:07:54.960> a<00:07:54.990> long<00:07:55.229> time

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 
know since I've been at rice a long time

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.290 
know since I've been at rice a long time
it's<00:07:55.620> hard<00:07:55.830> to<00:07:55.890> know<00:07:56.070> if<00:07:56.640> things<00:07:56.880> your<00:07:57.060> lives

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.300 
it's hard to know if things your lives

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.779 
it's hard to know if things your lives
are<00:07:57.510> truly<00:07:57.990> unique<00:07:58.289> or<00:07:58.590> all<00:07:59.039> schools<00:07:59.520> have

00:07:59.779 --> 00:07:59.789 
are truly unique or all schools have

00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:01.909 
are truly unique or all schools have
some<00:08:00.060> version<00:08:00.570> of<00:08:00.660> this<00:08:00.780> I<00:08:01.020> really<00:08:01.650> don't<00:08:01.770> know

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 
some version of this I really don't know

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:03.800 
some version of this I really don't know
but<00:08:02.070> I<00:08:02.130> do<00:08:02.220> I<00:08:02.520> do<00:08:02.610> think<00:08:02.970> this<00:08:03.090> is<00:08:03.270> really<00:08:03.570> true

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:03.810 
but I do I do think this is really true
