00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.070
 tsonga 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.710
 and justice logically because 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.930
 injustice from all sides by the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.440
 result of injustice for what 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.440
 it happened 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.640
 we have a clear analysis of what was 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.190
 we have the analysis a great match that 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.720
 was superior to the rival that we will have to 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.490
 to have finished with a result I think I 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.230
 bulky and we end up losing what's not 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.860
 then what you get the most anger and what 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.300
 weirder that we do not find it and 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.370
 logically they were all determinant 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.090
 the mistakes 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.190
 of the arbitrators in the doubtful for it 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.690
 there is no doubt about the criminal in the area of 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.590
 they are no doubt again that for 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.280
 he was not criminal 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.949
 we are not this player two goals there are ones 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.519
 that we saw it is almost one meter and 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.559
 means enabled of which when 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:59.089
 then second goal raises online 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.899
 raise the poker flag good not what 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.250
 we can understand two very clear hands 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.729
 inside the girl area with a shot 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.820
 long the player raising the arms 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.320
 minimally it is imprudence I do not know if it will be 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.590
 casual or not him but imprudent 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.869
 there is a career penalty 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.789
 I do not know the truth I do not have much to 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.789
 analyze what I want to measure with what 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.020
 I want I want to be measured I do not want 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.210
 pass me because I really have a lot 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.890
 of things but I think it does not correspond 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.530
 because it would be 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.580
 add much more to all this that 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.580
 has been happening in our soccer 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.040
 lately and there we have 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.350
 try not to contribute so much if we have 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.540
 that mark the things that happen but of 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.460
 one way the best by measuring the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.090
 words and the truth that is difficult to 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.990
 me measure the words at this moment 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.789
 but but good, I'll change you next time 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.200
 change the question you were surprised what 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.899
 He passed 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.680
 I was surprised if the truth because 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.000
 mistake 5 times or 6 times of 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.610
 way that is with situations 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.310
 determinant in the game for a single 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.360
 side 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.470
 and with very clear situations because there 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.319
 what finite 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.730
 I do not know what is a meter and a half and there was no 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.350
 no other player in the middle like 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.100
 why 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.290
 interpose in the line view 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.330
 then you saw us make a 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.500
 great effort to match mouth 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.470
 we have to make a match like the one 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.940
 we made today beating the good and 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.980
 then we ended up losing because 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.330
 mouth is that mouth the best after you 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.460
 take advantage with a play and finished in 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.470
 some party and that feeds even more 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.540
 our anger the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.670
 the feeling of injustice for the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.950
 result and for all that happened the 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.290
 party is already the party was finished in 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.270
 the three points are brought mouth that 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.850
 stop will happen in the arbitration short list one 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.020
 date two dates here to finish 45 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.330
 parties direct us again and hopefully 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.820
 that they direct us because the truth that I 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.340
 with bad I have I have very good 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.060
 relationship do not speak very well but good 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.850
 I had not seen a game for a long time 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.430
 of this with so many errors that were 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.900
 so decisive in the result a 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.240
 result that for me there should be 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.459
 been bulked in favor of belgrano already in 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.400
 the first clear time by the 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.870
 situations canceled but but good that 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.240
 is going to be and then this does not happen 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.070
 some make a goal about the time and what 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.090
 we ended up losing that logically not 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.090
 it hurts even more
