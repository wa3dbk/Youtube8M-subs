this<00:00:04.140> is<00:00:04.290> my<00:00:04.410> driving<00:00:04.740> speakers<00:00:05.430> that<00:00:05.670> I've

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
this is my driving speakers that I've

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.870 
this is my driving speakers that I've
restored<00:00:08.630> I've<00:00:09.630> added<00:00:10.099> some<00:00:11.099> modifications

to it you can see also that I've added a
stand<00:00:21.769> and<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.920> pole<00:00:24.949> when<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.010> purchased<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
stand and a pole when I purchased the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.019 
stand and a pole when I purchased the
speakers<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:28.349> junction<00:00:28.890> box<00:00:29.070> that's<00:00:29.820> all

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
speakers and the junction box that's all

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.740 
speakers and the junction box that's all
I<00:00:30.500> got<00:00:31.500> was<00:00:31.830> just<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.309> speaker<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
I got was just the speaker in the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.350 
I got was just the speaker in the
junction<00:00:34.200> box<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.770> added<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.820> pole<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
junction box and I added the pole and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.630 
junction box and I added the pole and
the<00:00:36.480> stand<00:00:37.910> also<00:00:38.910> I've<00:00:39.120> added<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:40.640> little

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the stand also I've added a little

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.549 
the stand also I've added a little
amplifier<00:00:43.250> that's<00:00:44.250> built<00:00:44.640> into<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.559> junction

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
amplifier that's built into the junction

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.690 
amplifier that's built into the junction
box<00:00:47.539> that<00:00:48.539> will<00:00:48.809> allow<00:00:49.079> me<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.379> plug<00:00:49.950> my<00:00:50.219> mp3

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
box that will allow me to plug my mp3

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.400 
box that will allow me to plug my mp3
player<00:00:51.829> into<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.039> junction<00:00:53.879> box<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.600> also

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
player into the junction box and also

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.299 
player into the junction box and also
into<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.010> amplifier<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.989> can<00:01:00.989> listen<00:01:01.379> with

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
into the amplifier and I can listen with

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.780 
into the amplifier and I can listen with
music<00:01:02.789> through<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> speakers<00:01:03.799> or<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> can

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
music through the speakers or I can

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.690 
music through the speakers or I can
listen<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:07.369> drive<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.640> movie<00:01:08.820> commercials

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700

through<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> speakers<00:01:15.740> that's<00:01:16.740> what<00:01:16.920> we'll

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
through the speakers that's what we'll

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.850 
through the speakers that's what we'll
show<00:01:17.130> next<00:01:17.610> I'll<00:01:17.790> show<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.180> internal

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
transformer I mean this human amplifier

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.089 
transformer I mean this human amplifier
may<00:02:21.810> be<00:02:21.870> about<00:02:22.079> ten<00:02:22.379> to<00:02:22.680> ten<00:02:22.860> dollars<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.930> then

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099

the output to the speaker's comes out of
here<00:02:37.040> this<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.549> output<00:02:42.079> to<00:02:43.079> the<00:02:43.230> battery

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
here this is the output to the battery

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:54.480 
here this is the output to the battery
that<00:02:45.690> operates<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.730> there's<00:02:47.730> uh

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:05.750 

three<00:02:55.270> batteries<00:02:55.690> in<00:02:55.960> here<00:02:58.920> DC<00:02:59.920> batteries<00:03:04.380> and

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
three batteries in here DC batteries and

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.800 
three batteries in here DC batteries and
also<00:03:06.760> I've<00:03:07.450> added<00:03:07.750> an<00:03:08.470> off-and-on<00:03:08.860> switch<00:03:09.810> to

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
also I've added an off-and-on switch to

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.210 
also I've added an off-and-on switch to
the<00:03:10.930> box<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:12.010> save<00:03:12.220> on<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.520> batteries<00:03:14.220> and

the box to save on the batteries and

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.120 
the box to save on the batteries and
there's<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.460> little<00:03:15.610> button<00:03:15.850> under<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.480> bottom

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
there's a little button under the bottom

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.170 
there's a little button under the bottom
up<00:03:18.130> underneath<00:03:18.670> that<00:03:19.240> I<00:03:19.290> put<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.670> turn<00:03:21.910> it<00:03:22.060> on

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
up underneath that I put the turn it on

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.610 
up underneath that I put the turn it on
and<00:03:22.360> turn<00:03:22.570> turn<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.080> speaker<00:03:23.590> on<00:03:23.710> and<00:03:24.010> off

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
and turn turn the speaker on and off

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.010 
and turn turn the speaker on and off
amplifier<00:03:26.620> on<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.130> off<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.880> also<00:03:30.880> I<00:03:31.120> added<00:03:31.570> a

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
amplifier on and off and also I added a

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.870 
amplifier on and off and also I added a
bulb<00:03:33.240> there<00:03:34.240> is<00:03:34.420> a<00:03:34.450> lamp<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:35.170> night<00:03:35.500> lamp<00:03:35.880> over

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
bulb there is a lamp a night lamp over

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:44.810 
bulb there is a lamp a night lamp over
on<00:03:37.330> this<00:03:37.540> side<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:39.100> we'll<00:03:39.460> show<00:03:39.700> that<00:03:39.940> later

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.180 

but<00:03:46.230> let's<00:03:47.230> go<00:03:47.380> ahead<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.800> put<00:03:47.980> everything

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
but let's go ahead and put everything

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:56.960 
but let's go ahead and put everything
back<00:03:48.550> down<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:55.000> we'll<00:03:55.150> just<00:03:55.360> put<00:03:55.600> it<00:03:55.690> on<00:03:55.810> here

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
back down and we'll just put it on here

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:09.780 
back down and we'll just put it on here
temporarily

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.039 

I'm<00:04:10.790> gonna<00:04:10.909> reach<00:04:11.150> down<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:11.480> grab<00:04:11.780> the

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
I'm gonna reach down and grab the

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:28.800 
I'm gonna reach down and grab the
speaker's<00:04:19.690> place<00:04:20.690> them<00:04:21.049> on<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.530> junction<00:04:22.310> box

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:36.219 

now<00:04:29.810> at<00:04:30.380> this<00:04:30.590> point<00:04:30.919> I<00:04:34.270> have<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.300> cord<00:04:35.780> coming

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
now at this point I have a cord coming

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.700 
now at this point I have a cord coming
out<00:04:36.410> of<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:37.840> amplifier<00:04:38.840> which<00:04:39.110> is<00:04:39.259> in<00:04:39.410> the<00:04:39.500> box

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
out of the amplifier which is in the box

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.070 
out of the amplifier which is in the box
and<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:40.610> cord<00:04:40.880> comes<00:04:41.120> out<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.539> goes<00:04:41.750> to<00:04:41.960> my

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
and the cord comes out and goes to my

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.550 
and the cord comes out and goes to my
mp3<00:04:42.500> player<00:04:46.389> I'm<00:04:47.389> left<00:04:47.660> reach<00:04:48.199> under<00:04:48.470> the

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
mp3 player I'm left reach under the
