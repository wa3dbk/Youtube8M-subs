it's<00:00:21.680> a<00:00:21.830> beach<00:00:22.150> very<00:00:23.150> easy<00:00:23.360> to<00:00:23.570> identify

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
it's a beach very easy to identify

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.550 
it's a beach very easy to identify
because<00:00:25.009> it's<00:00:25.160> smooth<00:00:25.579> gray<00:00:25.970> bark<00:00:26.329> and<00:00:26.599> the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
because it's smooth gray bark and the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.819 
because it's smooth gray bark and the
shape<00:00:27.829> of<00:00:27.950> the<00:00:28.070> leaves<00:00:28.630> in<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:30.290> very<00:00:30.500> early

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
shape of the leaves in the very early

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.650 
shape of the leaves in the very early
spring<00:00:31.070> when<00:00:31.579> these<00:00:31.759> leaves<00:00:32.000> first<00:00:32.300> come<00:00:32.540> out

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
spring when these leaves first come out

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.600 
spring when these leaves first come out
they're<00:00:33.320> absolutely<00:00:33.770> delicious<00:00:33.890> they<00:00:34.399> can<00:00:34.520> be

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
they're absolutely delicious they can be

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.970 
they're absolutely delicious they can be
used<00:00:34.850> as<00:00:35.090> an<00:00:35.180> alternative<00:00:35.270> to<00:00:35.750> lettuce<00:00:36.200> but

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
used as an alternative to lettuce but

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.440 
used as an alternative to lettuce but
this<00:00:37.130> time<00:00:37.309> of<00:00:37.430> year<00:00:37.579> they're<00:00:37.760> so<00:00:37.910> dark<00:00:38.210> and

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
this time of year they're so dark and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.240 
this time of year they're so dark and
fibrous<00:00:38.899> they<00:00:39.140> really<00:00:39.710> don't<00:00:39.830> taste<00:00:40.070> very

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
fibrous they really don't taste very

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.450 
fibrous they really don't taste very
good<00:00:40.340> at<00:00:40.520> all<00:00:40.730> now<00:00:41.540> beech<00:00:41.810> trees<00:00:42.340> create<00:00:43.340> one

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
good at all now beech trees create one

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.030 
good at all now beech trees create one
of<00:00:43.490> the<00:00:43.670> finest<00:00:44.090> forests<00:00:44.600> for<00:00:44.750> bushcraft

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
of the finest forests for bushcraft

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.290 
of the finest forests for bushcraft
because<00:00:46.040> there's<00:00:46.220> very<00:00:46.400> little<00:00:46.550> undergrowth

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
because there's very little undergrowth

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.420 
because there's very little undergrowth
so<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:48.080> tannin<00:00:48.500> in<00:00:48.650> the<00:00:48.740> leaves<00:00:48.950> the<00:00:49.250> dead

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
so the tannin in the leaves the dead

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.250 
so the tannin in the leaves the dead
leaves<00:00:49.640> as<00:00:49.850> it<00:00:49.970> breaks<00:00:50.120> down<00:00:50.330> prevents<00:00:51.140> any

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
leaves as it breaks down prevents any

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.500 
leaves as it breaks down prevents any
growth<00:00:51.560> on<00:00:51.740> the<00:00:51.830> ground<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:52.340> also<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.090> canopy

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
growth on the ground and also the canopy

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.300 
growth on the ground and also the canopy
during<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.140> summer<00:00:54.380> months<00:00:54.440> provides<00:00:55.040> such<00:00:55.280> a

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
during the summer months provides such a

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.250 
during the summer months provides such a
lot<00:00:55.550> of<00:00:55.579> shade<00:00:55.910> you<00:00:56.420> get<00:00:56.570> very<00:00:56.810> little<00:00:56.930> light

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
lot of shade you get very little light

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.350 
lot of shade you get very little light
so<00:00:57.740> beech<00:00:57.950> forests<00:00:58.400> tend<00:00:58.610> to<00:00:58.760> be<00:00:58.850> very<00:00:59.000> clear

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
so beech forests tend to be very clear

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.069 
so beech forests tend to be very clear
and<00:00:59.570> easy<00:00:59.870> to<00:01:00.110> work<00:01:00.260> in<00:01:01.870> now

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
and easy to work in now

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.380 
and easy to work in now

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
to see it around the wood of Sycamore

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.810 
to see it around the wood of Sycamore
has<00:01:41.390> been<00:01:41.510> used<00:01:41.659> for<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.840> long<00:01:42.020> time<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.560> make

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
has been used for a long time to make

has been used for a long time to make
utilitarian<00:01:43.820> items<00:01:44.119> like<00:01:44.330> bowls<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.900> spoons

utilitarian items like bowls and spoons

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.500 
utilitarian items like bowls and spoons
it's<00:01:46.159> actually<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.640> traditional<00:01:47.150> wood<00:01:47.299> for

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
it's actually the traditional wood for

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.630 
it's actually the traditional wood for
making<00:01:47.780> Welsh<00:01:47.960> love<00:01:48.229> spoons<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:49.280> reason<00:01:49.549> it

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
making Welsh love spoons the reason it

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.250 
making Welsh love spoons the reason it
makes<00:01:49.820> such<00:01:50.030> good<00:01:50.210> eating<00:01:50.600> utensils<00:01:51.140> is

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
makes such good eating utensils is

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.980 
makes such good eating utensils is
because<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.680> wood<00:01:51.860> has<00:01:52.100> no<00:01:52.340> toxic<00:01:52.880> resins<00:01:53.360> so

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
because the wood has no toxic resins so

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.500 
because the wood has no toxic resins so
