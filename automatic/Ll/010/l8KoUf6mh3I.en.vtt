00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.850 
but it's also very very soft and you can
definitely<00:04:44.690> put<00:04:45.020> this<00:04:45.050> in<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.560> washing

definitely put this in the washing
machine<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.580> would<00:04:46.760> believe<00:04:46.910> where<00:04:47.210> you<00:04:47.300> might

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
machine I would believe where you might

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.760 
machine I would believe where you might
want<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.660> hand<00:04:47.810> wash<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.140> so<00:04:48.260> that<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.530> velcro

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
want to hand wash it so that the velcro

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.330 
want to hand wash it so that the velcro
stays<00:04:49.730> out<00:04:50.060> Brody<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.800> but<00:04:51.800> this<00:04:52.040> is<00:04:52.190> pretty

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340
