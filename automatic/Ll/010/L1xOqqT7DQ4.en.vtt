00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.929
 Memories of Gunpla Kit Review Collection Turn A Gundam Flat 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.929
 Follow 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:15.590
 Turn A Gundam is a work of the world masterpiece theater or Ghibli animation, with a style like Tomino Grand 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:20.060
 It is a Gundam work that is said to be a compilation of Gundam works 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:25.950
 Normal anime fans and ordinary people look out for the part of Gundam work's peculiar poisonousness 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:30.840
 I Gundam of healing can enjoy the peace of mind element packed does not cause allergy symptoms 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.850
 Flat is the Diana used by Lorans to return to Earth for environmental adaptation testing 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.440
 It is a counter variable mobile suit 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.610
 I have the ability to enter the atmosphere, but surprisingly there is no high or medium ability 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 After being descended to the earth, it was hidden in the ground but Keith got the money for the bakery 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.940
 It has been sold to Milli, then 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.630
 Red painted on the fuselage Joseph is riding 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:54.670
 I fought but there was no strong image 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:59.860
 The characteristic of this airframe is that it is equipped with an acoustic weapon and generates high frequency throughout the travel 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:03.070
 By operating as a shield , screening into the atmosphere as well as in the ground and high school underwater 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.100
 So you can prevent attacks from enemies with hyper vibration 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.620
 It could be diverted to attack as Sonic Blade. 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:15.330
 I only use a hand-held weapon by interior weapon is not about for the 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:19.530
 It's an impressive in you has been the use of a taste aircraft for each scene in the play 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.820
 Surely the price is 500 yen. The distinctive design psychic name of the Sid Mead reproduced. 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.280
 It's a kit 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.930
 Oh dear 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.479
 The misfortune of flats has not appeared in aliens or movies over there, so far away 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.740
 Was the mon was Nante appeared in Japan of your child-like animation 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.280
 Guy has been used in over there Hey I exhausted to the point were few who can understand the goodness of design 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.640
 If 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.080
 sf The design must have been a fan's crazy 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.450
 Yet Oh 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:46.540
 Yet, depending on the person'd Yes surely shit I'm sure this guy'm handling fucking 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.340
 Gundam kept copying and reworking with much practice 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.360
 Chit 500 yen of such live if seems the design you want to elaborate Nante ze has rotten Tanaka eye 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.320
 I can buy it for 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.850
 Japan is important 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.990
 Beans assistant also is the tail joy 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.630
 The kit of the collection size of Turn A Gundam is a trademark right measure section other than Gundam 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.890
 I'm a kettle, but I'm putting Bill on my head 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.520
 This is also adopted in the collection size kit of Gundam seed 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.560
 But it just was simply confusing 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:20.790
 As a feature of the kit with the Kura, the belt-like joint in the play is not reproduced though 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.570
 The movable range itself is the whitest kit-proportions are flat by any means 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.580
 Why 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.230
 It is very nice that there are few collapses even if it is transformed . Collection of these days 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.540
 Unusually for size kits 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.610
 Nde hand parts such ze soooo by I Made of plastic 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.300
 I did not do it as it is 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.930
 A lot of unusual designs The design of the work of a mobile suit of a Gundam in particular 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:46.240
 The fact that a flat is three-dimensional is just fine. 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:49.150
 It is possible to change the color while replacing some parts, and if it is finished by painting it properly, it is recent 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:53.630
 I existence not be outdone even in total to Gunpla 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:57.130
 Bought out of now if there is a kit that remain in the path not Hey near field of plastic Mori field 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.130
 Kit of Da'd suggest 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.209
 Or Heck
