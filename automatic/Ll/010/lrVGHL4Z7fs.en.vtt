00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.930
 I have had the 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.320
 official photos made for Landstede 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.389
 volleyball and basketball and those pictures that 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.980
 will be used for the 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.320
 presentation guide 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.789
 internet use and also on the 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.099
 screens during competitions 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.839
 the great thing about this assignment is that of me 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.699
 I can have two passions of myself 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.830
 namely , that is combining photography 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.810
 and sports 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.980
 well with us in an anser have one 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.300
 training is called design and 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.310
 entertainment is part of it 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.830
 photography and design that is leon 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.420
 student in photography and design 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.680
 so the land side has very good ones 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.690
 photographer at home 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.310
 leon is one of the boys there 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.950
 third-year students already have a lot of experience 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.790
 there or internships and he can do such 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.320
 job done 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.230
 at the same time for leon also one 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.970
 considerable challenge to complete the whole 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.090
 picture of what a photographer must do 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.770
 in the box that you think you can do 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.420
 he is no longer interested in their internship 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.950
 guide but with a real job 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.080
 give that journey has that expectation 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.269
 has a saying of i want you 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.409
 it controls and leon it must rain 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.360
 in that sense 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.460
 He learns a lot of it, he also 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.920
 it is doing and there yes come the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.330
 curtains together 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.280
 yes the two things i put in the 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.940
 particularly difficult were the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.100
 elements so how the sun and there is 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.870
 one also for the sun so then all must 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.010
 settings can be done again 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.420
 and the second piece was 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.860
 human factor so people who 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.450
 blink eyes and you have 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.850
 mainly if you are with a large group 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.320
 works then you are simply at the mercy of 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.570
 the mark of several large ones before there 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.310
 a suitable picture and between Landstede 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.680
 supports these two teams 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.270
 landside balance in the foil ball and that 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.580
 we do this by many students, among others 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.080
 also to bet 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.720
 around all activities with these two 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.340
 teams and today an example our one 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.320
 of our photography students 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.820
 made official team photography but you 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.470
 can also think of the deployment of 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.300
 students around our competitions that the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.730
 our competitions organize students 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.010
 those around our competitions behind the 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.840
 bar and from our hospitality training 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.730
 We also provide security students with us 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.260
 and play a role in our competitions 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.210
 this way we try as much more as possible 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.040
 create workplaces for students and 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.720
 because then they also surround these two 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.590
 top sport first their talents as well 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.590
 possible to develop
