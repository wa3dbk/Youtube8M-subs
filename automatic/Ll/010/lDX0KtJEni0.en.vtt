both knitting and crochet and it's work

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.560 
both knitting and crochet and it's work
from<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> right<00:00:19.080> side<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:20.000> it<00:00:21.000> gives<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.480> an

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
from the right side and it gives you an

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.529 
from the right side and it gives you an
invisible<00:00:22.199> scene<00:00:22.529> once<00:00:23.039> you've<00:00:23.250> finished<00:00:23.539> so

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
working from the right side means that

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.240 
working from the right side means that
you<00:00:26.490> can<00:00:26.730> not<00:00:26.880> only<00:00:27.090> match<00:00:27.740> stitch<00:00:28.740> patterns

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
you can not only match stitch patterns

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.179 
you can not only match stitch patterns
but<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.730> also<00:00:29.880> match<00:00:30.240> stripes<00:00:31.189> Farrell

but you can also match stripes Farrell
jacquard<00:00:32.880> etc<00:00:33.450> etc<00:00:33.739> so<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:35.100> definitely<00:00:35.579> my

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
jacquard etc etc so it's definitely my

preferred<00:00:36.480> method<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:37.380> choice<00:00:37.890> when<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.309> comes

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
preferred method of choice when it comes

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.209 
preferred method of choice when it comes

stitch<00:02:46.780> loop<00:02:49.050> okay<00:02:50.050> so<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.530> our<00:02:51.040> garter

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
stitch loop okay so that is our garter

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.810 
stitch loop okay so that is our garter
stitch<00:02:52.300> border<00:02:52.720> joined<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.250> should<00:02:54.550> look

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
stitch border joined and it should look

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.160 
stitch border joined and it should look
pretty<00:02:55.320> well<00:02:56.700> continuous<00:02:57.700> throughout<00:02:58.390> right

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
pretty well continuous throughout right

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.240 
pretty well continuous throughout right
we've<00:02:59.350> now<00:02:59.590> reached<00:02:59.970> our<00:03:00.970> stocking<00:03:01.870> stitch

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
we've now reached our stocking stitch

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.320 
we've now reached our stocking stitch
main<00:03:03.250> part<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.750> sample<00:03:05.320> so<00:03:06.220> we<00:03:06.490> go<00:03:06.910> back<00:03:06.940> to

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
main part of the sample so we go back to

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.250 
main part of the sample so we go back to
your<00:03:07.420> side<00:03:07.720> one<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:08.290> we<00:03:09.220> put<00:03:09.430> our<00:03:09.640> needle<00:03:10.600> just

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
your side one and we put our needle just

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.160 
your side one and we put our needle just
above<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.650> garter<00:03:12.160> stitch<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.820> out<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.420> the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
above the garter stitch and out of the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.120 
above the garter stitch and out of the
next<00:03:14.500> stitch<00:03:15.989> that's<00:03:16.989> side<00:03:17.350> one<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.890> we<00:03:17.980> do

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
next stitch that's side one and we do

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.699 
next stitch that's side one and we do
the<00:03:18.250> same<00:03:18.550> for<00:03:18.850> side<00:03:19.150> too<00:03:19.450> so<00:03:20.290> it's<00:03:20.440> in<00:03:20.590> the

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
the same for side too so it's in the

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.690 
the same for side too so it's in the
first<00:03:21.010> stitch<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.700> up<00:03:22.300> out<00:03:22.630> of<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:24.280> second

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
first stitch and up out of the second

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.240 
first stitch and up out of the second
stitch<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.650> pull<00:03:26.950> through<00:03:28.650> then<00:03:29.650> we<00:03:29.800> go<00:03:29.950> into

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
stitch and pull through then we go into

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.860 
stitch and pull through then we go into
the<00:03:30.489> second<00:03:30.940> stitch<00:03:31.239> on<00:03:31.480> side<00:03:31.750> one<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.430> out<00:03:33.430> of

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
the second stitch on side one and out of

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.780 
the second stitch on side one and out of
the<00:03:34.870> third<00:03:35.170> stitch<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:39.100> same<00:03:39.370> for<00:03:39.550> side

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
the third stitch and the same for side

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.040 
the third stitch and the same for side
too<00:03:40.150> we<00:03:40.930> go<00:03:41.110> into<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.620> second<00:03:42.070> stitch<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:43.050> up

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
too we go into the second stitch and up

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.790 
too we go into the second stitch and up
out<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.920> third<00:03:45.580> stitch<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.930> we<00:03:47.290> continue

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
out of the third stitch and we continue

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.390 
out of the third stitch and we continue
doing<00:03:48.100> that<00:03:48.130> all<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.660> way<00:03:49.989> up<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:50.739> into<00:03:51.250> the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
doing that all the way up so into the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.500 
doing that all the way up so into the
third<00:03:52.300> and<00:03:52.570> out<00:03:52.690> of<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:52.989> fourth<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:55.120> repeat

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
third and out of the fourth and repeat

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.000 
third and out of the fourth and repeat
that<00:03:55.750> for<00:03:55.989> side<00:03:56.290> too

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.250 

there<00:04:03.010> we<00:04:03.130> go<00:04:03.310> now<00:04:04.060> if<00:04:04.330> you're<00:04:04.540> finding<00:04:04.959> that

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
there we go now if you're finding that

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.520 
there we go now if you're finding that
working<00:04:05.980> right<00:04:06.280> on<00:04:06.550> the<00:04:06.760> edge<00:04:06.880> is<00:04:07.720> proving<00:04:08.440> a

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
working right on the edge is proving a

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.190 
working right on the edge is proving a
little<00:04:08.560> bit<00:04:09.069> tricky<00:04:09.550> it's<00:04:10.150> quite<00:04:10.420> acceptable

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
little bit tricky it's quite acceptable

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.430 
little bit tricky it's quite acceptable
to<00:04:12.160> just<00:04:12.430> separate<00:04:12.970> your<00:04:13.030> first<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:13.990> second

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
to just separate your first and second

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.449 
to just separate your first and second
stitch<00:04:14.800> and<00:04:15.870> work<00:04:16.870> by<00:04:17.140> picking<00:04:17.560> up<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:18.190> ladder

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
stitch and work by picking up the ladder

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.030 
stitch and work by picking up the ladder
and<00:04:18.880> some<00:04:19.600> people<00:04:19.900> call<00:04:20.140> this<00:04:20.320> ladder<00:04:20.590> stitch

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
and some people call this ladder stitch

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.450 
and some people call this ladder stitch
for<00:04:21.640> that<00:04:21.850> reason<00:04:22.260> now<00:04:23.260> ladder<00:04:23.530> stitch<00:04:23.890> will

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
for that reason now ladder stitch will

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.390 
for that reason now ladder stitch will
give<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.450> slightly<00:04:26.440> bigger<00:04:26.770> seam<00:04:27.190> on<00:04:27.220> the

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
give you a slightly bigger seam on the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.150 
give you a slightly bigger seam on the
inside<00:04:27.940> but<00:04:28.419> it's<00:04:28.780> still<00:04:29.140> a<00:04:29.200> very<00:04:29.560> very<00:04:29.890> neat

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
inside but it's still a very very neat

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.020 
inside but it's still a very very neat
seam<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:31.830> certainly<00:04:32.830> until<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.520> get<00:04:33.700> up<00:04:33.850> to

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
seam and certainly until you get up to

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.190 
seam and certainly until you get up to
speed<00:04:34.590> it's<00:04:35.590> worth<00:04:36.040> practicing<00:04:36.810> by<00:04:37.810> picking

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
speed it's worth practicing by picking

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.950 
speed it's worth practicing by picking
up<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.530> ladder<00:04:38.740> so<00:04:39.669> I<00:04:39.700> do<00:04:39.790> just<00:04:40.330> do<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.540> few

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
up the ladder so I do just do a few

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.030 
up the ladder so I do just do a few
stitches<00:04:42.360> of<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.900> ladder<00:04:44.110> stitch<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:45.010> then

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
stitches of the ladder stitch and then

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.420 
stitches of the ladder stitch and then
I'll<00:04:45.310> show<00:04:45.610> you<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.940> back<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.840> work<00:04:47.430> now

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
I'll show you the back of the work now

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.420 
I'll show you the back of the work now
because<00:04:48.790> when<00:04:49.000> I<00:04:49.030> made<00:04:49.360> these<00:04:49.570> samples

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
because when I made these samples

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.100 
because when I made these samples
there's<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.550> same<00:04:51.850> number<00:04:52.120> of<00:04:52.300> rows<00:04:52.690> from

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
there's the same number of rows from

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.550 
there's the same number of rows from
here<00:04:53.410> to<00:04:53.590> here<00:04:53.890> and<00:04:54.070> there<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.760> there<00:04:55.380> when<00:04:56.380> we

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
here to here and there to there when we

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.640 
here to here and there to there when we
reach<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:57.010> top<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.640> tops<00:04:58.480> will<00:04:58.870> be

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
reach the top the tops will be

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.740 
reach the top the tops will be
completely<00:05:00.160> level<00:05:01.620> right<00:05:02.620> so<00:05:02.890> let's<00:05:03.070> do<00:05:03.370> a<00:05:03.750> few

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
completely level right so let's do a few

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.690 
completely level right so let's do a few
rows<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.410> mean<00:05:06.340> a<00:05:06.370> few<00:05:07.770> more<00:05:08.770> stitches<00:05:09.100> in

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
rows I mean a few more stitches in

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.960 
rows I mean a few more stitches in
ladder<00:05:10.000> stitch<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:10.780> then<00:05:10.810> we'll<00:05:11.140> look<00:05:11.320> at<00:05:11.970> the

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
ladder stitch and then we'll look at the

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.460 
ladder stitch and then we'll look at the
back<00:05:14.669> okay<00:05:15.669> so<00:05:16.150> let's<00:05:16.330> turn<00:05:16.600> it<00:05:16.660> over<00:05:16.900> now<00:05:17.050> and

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
back okay so let's turn it over now and

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.490 
back okay so let's turn it over now and
look<00:05:17.650> at<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.890> back<00:05:18.040> so<00:05:18.640> this<00:05:18.880> is<00:05:19.090> where<00:05:19.390> I<00:05:19.720> was

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
look at the back so this is where I was

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.100 
look at the back so this is where I was
working<00:05:20.770> just<00:05:21.340> right<00:05:22.210> in<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.750> edge<00:05:22.870> of<00:05:22.990> the

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
working just right in the edge of the

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.110 
working just right in the edge of the
same<00:05:23.350> and<00:05:23.500> it's<00:05:23.590> almost<00:05:23.950> flat<00:05:24.340> the<00:05:24.910> ladder

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
same and it's almost flat the ladder

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.659 
same and it's almost flat the ladder
stitch<00:05:25.510> gives<00:05:25.780> you<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:25.960> slightly<00:05:26.320> deeper<00:05:27.250> scene
