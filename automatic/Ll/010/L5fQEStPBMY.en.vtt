dark blue as they're selected and when

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.760 
dark blue as they're selected and when
you<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.260> these<00:01:11.159> new<00:01:11.840> menus<00:01:12.840> open<00:01:13.560> up<00:01:13.650> at

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
you do that these new menus open up at

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.620 
you do that these new menus open up at
the<00:01:13.860> top<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.790> want<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> use<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.420> batch

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the top the one we want to use is batch

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.070 
the top the one we want to use is batch
tools<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.710> click<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.930> we've<00:01:18.930> got

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
tools so if we click on that we've got

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.990 
tools so if we click on that we've got
two<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.530> want<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.770> use<00:01:19.920> their<00:01:20.130> battery<00:01:20.729> size

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
two we want to use their battery size

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.100 
two we want to use their battery size
and<00:01:21.270> battery<00:01:21.630> name

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and battery name

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.969 
and battery name
so<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.680> start<00:01:22.950> by<00:01:23.130> doing<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.790> battery<00:01:24.210> size

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
so if we start by doing the battery size

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.620 
so if we start by doing the battery size
it<00:01:25.979> brings<00:01:26.189> up<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.369> new<00:01:26.490> dialog<00:01:26.909> box<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.479> can

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
it brings up a new dialog box we can

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.450 
it brings up a new dialog box we can
actually<00:01:27.750> set<00:01:28.110> whatever<00:01:28.500> size<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.250> want

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
actually set whatever size here we want

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.580

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the photos to be you can set it by

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.230 
the photos to be you can set it by
percentage<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.640> original<00:01:33.000> size<00:01:33.210> and

for pixel size because I work on the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.429 
for pixel size because I work on the
internet<00:01:38.400> quite<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.610> bit<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:39.840> again<00:01:40.200> I'm<00:01:40.320> going

compression<00:02:21.180> compression<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.560> I'm<00:02:22.650> going<00:02:22.770> to

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
compression compression and I'm going to

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.050 
compression compression and I'm going to
put<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.040> at<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.160> best<00:02:23.370> quality<00:02:23.820> just<00:02:24.000> because

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
put it at the best quality just because

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.850 
put it at the best quality just because
I<00:02:24.300> like<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.570> images<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.990> be<00:02:25.020> top-notch<00:02:25.350> on<00:02:25.740> my

I like the images to be top-notch on my

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.790 
I like the images to be top-notch on my

there we go I'm gonna actually remove

there we go I'm gonna actually remove
and<00:02:33.150> replace<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.570> original<00:02:33.960> files<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.380> the

and replace the original files for the
purpose<00:02:34.710> of<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:34.920> tutorial<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:36.000> if<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.210> select

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
purpose of this tutorial so if I select

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.020 
purpose of this tutorial so if I select
that<00:02:36.570> option<00:02:37.310> what<00:02:38.310> will<00:02:38.400> happened<00:02:38.670> now<00:02:38.820> is

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
that option what will happened now is

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.210 
that option what will happened now is
all<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.510> these<00:02:39.660> original<00:02:40.170> JPEGs<00:02:40.860> will<00:02:41.040> get

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
all of these original JPEGs will get

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.850 
all of these original JPEGs will get
reduced<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:42.150> maximum<00:02:42.840> 600<00:02:43.470> width<00:02:43.680> and

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
reduced to a maximum 600 width and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.940 
reduced to a maximum 600 width and
height<00:02:44.120> now<00:02:45.120> if<00:02:45.480> we<00:02:45.630> start<00:02:46.020> resizing<00:02:46.590> now

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
height now if we start resizing now

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.670 
height now if we start resizing now
you'll<00:02:47.220> see<00:02:47.400> what<00:02:47.520> happens<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:49.170> very<00:02:49.260> very

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
you'll see what happens it's very very

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.080 
you'll see what happens it's very very
fast<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.070> program<00:02:50.520> it'll<00:02:50.700> work<00:02:50.850> through

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
fast this program it'll work through

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.090 
fast this program it'll work through
them<00:02:51.380> resizing<00:02:52.380> as<00:02:52.500> they<00:02:52.650> go<00:02:54.800> now<00:02:55.800> bear<00:02:56.010> in

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
them resizing as they go now bear in

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.410 
them resizing as they go now bear in
mind<00:02:56.250> here<00:02:56.460> I'm<00:02:56.550> actually<00:02:56.790> resizing<00:02:57.300> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
mind here I'm actually resizing the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.960 
mind here I'm actually resizing the
originals<00:02:58.010> normally<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.220> would<00:02:59.370> set<00:02:59.580> up<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.790> new

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
originals normally I would set up a new

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.180 
originals normally I would set up a new
false<00:03:00.270> folder<00:03:00.930> for<00:03:01.080> web<00:03:01.200> use<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.710> send<00:03:02.040> them

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
false folder for web use and send them

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.160 
false folder for web use and send them
there<00:03:02.370> keeping<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.880> original<00:03:03.030> JPEGs<00:03:03.690> but

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
there keeping the original JPEGs but

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.240 
there keeping the original JPEGs but
like<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.320> said<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.830> just<00:03:04.860> for<00:03:05.070> the

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
like I said this is just for the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.730 
like I said this is just for the
purposes<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:05.970> this<00:03:06.060> tutorial<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:07.170> that's<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
purposes of this tutorial and that's the

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.980 
purposes of this tutorial and that's the
last<00:03:07.890> one<00:03:08.100> so<00:03:08.580> they're<00:03:08.730> done<00:03:08.970> hit<00:03:09.540> done<00:03:09.780> and

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
last one so they're done hit done and

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.890 
last one so they're done hit done and
you<00:03:10.860> can<00:03:11.010> see<00:03:11.040> now<00:03:11.420> if<00:03:12.420> we<00:03:12.570> hover<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.810> cursor

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
you can see now if we hover the cursor

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.460 
you can see now if we hover the cursor
over<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.440> photo<00:03:13.680> it's<00:03:14.100> changed<00:03:14.490> the<00:03:14.640> size<00:03:15.630> to

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
over the photo it's changed the size to

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.330 
over the photo it's changed the size to
400<00:03:17.010> by<00:03:17.130> 600<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.880> severely<00:03:18.870> reduced<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.590> file

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
400 by 600 and severely reduced the file

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.300 
400 by 600 and severely reduced the file
size<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.790> 267<00:03:21.750> kilobytes<00:03:22.200> they're<00:03:22.920> all<00:03:23.040> great

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
size to 267 kilobytes they're all great

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.390 
size to 267 kilobytes they're all great
for<00:03:24.000> web<00:03:24.150> use<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:25.100> they've<00:03:26.100> already<00:03:26.220> been

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
for web use and they've already been

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.850 
for web use and they've already been
processed<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.320> they're<00:03:28.320> much<00:03:28.440> easier<00:03:28.500> to

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
processed and they're much easier to

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.340

scroll<00:03:29.220> through<00:03:29.300> so<00:03:30.300> that's<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.810> first<00:03:31.110> stage

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350

doing this kind of batch processing I

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.060 
doing this kind of batch processing I
never<00:05:01.680> use<00:05:01.889> it<00:05:01.919> for<00:05:03.830> changing<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:04.919> raw

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070
