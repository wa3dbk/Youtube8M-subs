00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
forests at the moment we chop down trees

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.929

to<00:01:27.990> grow<00:01:28.200> more<00:01:28.590> soy<00:01:28.829> bean<00:01:29.040> which<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.549> then<00:01:29.700> feat

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
to grow more soy bean which we then feat

to grow more soy bean which we then feat
a<00:01:29.970> cattle<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.960> put<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.170> more<00:01:31.500> mass<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.400> make

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
a cattle so put on more mass but we make
