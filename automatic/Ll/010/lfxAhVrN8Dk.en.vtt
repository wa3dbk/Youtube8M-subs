00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 breast milk is really amazing 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.620
 did you know that the composition of milk 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.480
 maternal changes depending on the age of 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.519
 your baby this is because the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.130
 needs for growth and development 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.340
 Your baby change over time 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.539
 key element that changes is the protein 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.109
 did you know that it is the most 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.210
 abundant in the body after water 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.519
 this unique quality of proteins from 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.720
 breast milk is what makes it so 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.029
 special 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.279
 at the beginning the breast milk contains 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.829
 more protein since your baby 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.020
 You need to grow very fast and more 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.149
 late the amount of protein in the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.090
 breast milk is reduced because the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.579
 Your baby's growth slows down 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.590
 it's amazing medical experts and 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.530
 researchers consider proteins 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.360
 as the most important nutrient not only 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.820
 for the growth of your baby but 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.280
 also for your health and development is 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.590
 so crucial that they say that quality and 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.199
 amount of protein your baby receives 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.199
 in their first two years they will influence their 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.450
 health for the rest of your life 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.509
 much research has been done about the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.590
 breast milk and in mixture we have been 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.789
 researching for more than 50 years 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.549
 We know that milk proteins 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:20.660
 maternal play a key role when you 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.160
 baby is growing and developing 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.860
 contributes to the body's growth 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.830
 the muscles and even the brain of your 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.560
 baby helps reduce the risk of your 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.960
 baby to develop allergies and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.940
 new scientific advances demonstrate 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.370
 that the proteins of breast milk 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.909
 they also help reduce the risk of 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.579
 Being overweight in the future 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.079
 It is also important for good 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.460
 functioning of the immune system 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.460
 and digestive 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.430
 the protein in breast milk plays a 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.789
 key role in the future health of your 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.369
 baby so if the proteins of the 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.219
 breast milk are the best because their 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.320
 quality is so high that its quantity is 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.080
 perfectly fits the age of your 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.840
 Baby and your needs at each stage 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.239
 of its development to know more about 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.160
 how amazing is breast milk 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.380
 or how important are the 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.260
 proteins for health and development 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.860
 of your baby ask your pediatrician or
