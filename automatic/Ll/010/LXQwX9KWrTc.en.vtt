00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
the part that I liked at the end was

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.950 
the part that I liked at the end was
sort<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.470> nami<00:01:46.740> being<00:01:47.310> happy<00:01:47.909> about<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.720> kids

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
doflamingo shows up and possibly how

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.840 
doflamingo shows up and possibly how
could<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.560> everyone's<00:03:04.980> saying<00:03:05.160> it's<00:03:05.310> al<00:03:05.490> kg

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.580 
could you everyone's saying it's al kg
he<00:03:06.480> was<00:03:06.600> probably<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:07.170> looks<00:03:07.320> like<00:03:07.440> he<00:03:07.500> was

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
he was probably it looks like he was

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.990 
he was probably it looks like he was
riding<00:03:07.740> on<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.950> bird<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.430> really<00:03:08.640> didn't<00:03:08.880> notice

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
riding on a bird I really didn't notice

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.700 
riding on a bird I really didn't notice
that<00:03:09.270> last<00:03:09.420> time<00:03:09.690> but<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.930> agree<00:03:10.230> with<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.410> he

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
that last time but I agree with that he

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.470 
that last time but I agree with that he
looked<00:03:10.890> like<00:03:10.920> he<00:03:11.070> was<00:03:11.160> on<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.280> bird<00:03:11.490> and<00:03:12.270> it

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
looked like he was on a bird and it

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.270 
looked like he was on a bird and it
could<00:03:12.690> be<00:03:12.720> out<00:03:12.960> kg<00:03:13.260> said<00:03:13.440> he<00:03:13.530> was<00:03:13.680> asleep<00:03:13.860> but

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
could be out kg said he was asleep but

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.400 
could be out kg said he was asleep but
if<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.090> traveling<00:03:15.510> across<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.750> ocean<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.350> a

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
if you traveling across the ocean on a

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.350 
if you traveling across the ocean on a
bird<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:17.250> probably<00:03:17.580> take<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.730> little<00:03:17.880> while<00:03:18.090> and

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
bird it probably take a little while and

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.729 
bird it probably take a little while and
I<00:03:18.420> would<00:03:18.540> imagine<00:03:18.690> anyone<00:03:19.020> wanna<00:03:19.380> go<00:03:19.440> sleep

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
I would imagine anyone wanna go sleep

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.610 
I would imagine anyone wanna go sleep
but<00:03:20.300> it<00:03:21.300> might<00:03:21.690> be<00:03:21.810> alka<00:03:22.050> G<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.440> would<00:03:22.530> be

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
but it might be alka G and that would be

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.800 
but it might be alka G and that would be
cool<00:03:22.800> because<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:24.000> would<00:03:24.150> break<00:03:24.480> up<00:03:24.540> the

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
cool because that would break up the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.449 
cool because that would break up the
fight<00:03:24.959> between<00:03:25.230> luffy<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.709> doflamingo<00:03:25.890> and

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
wouldn't make either one of them win or

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.080 
wouldn't make either one of them win or
lose<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.400> obvious<00:03:29.400> obviously<00:03:29.940> don't
