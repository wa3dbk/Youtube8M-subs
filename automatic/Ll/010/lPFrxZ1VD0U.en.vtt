00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
well and I actually think we've done

well and I actually think we've done
that<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.369> year<00:00:23.640> but<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> team<00:00:24.570> knew<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
that this year but the team knew the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.839 
that this year but the team knew the
stakes<00:00:25.170> were<00:00:25.410> very<00:00:25.590> very<00:00:25.769> high<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.010> year<00:00:26.189> for

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
stakes were very very high this year for

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:27.890 
stakes were very very high this year for
us<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.029> deliver<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.420> kind<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.599> need<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.810> go

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900

outside<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.439> box<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.189> focused<00:00:29.310> on

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
outside of the box so we focused on

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.820 
outside of the box so we focused on
three<00:00:29.849> pillars<00:00:30.060> compete<00:00:30.990> customize<00:00:31.619> and

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
combat training was actually something

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.870 
combat training was actually something
as<00:03:00.200> they<00:03:00.350> mentioned<00:03:00.680> was<00:03:00.800> a<00:03:01.040> development<00:03:01.760> tool

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
as they mentioned was a development tool

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.580 
as they mentioned was a development tool
that<00:03:02.450> actually<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.870> see<00:03:03.020> how<00:03:03.170> multiplayer

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
that actually to see how multiplayer

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.020 
that actually to see how multiplayer
works<00:03:03.770> on<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.010> enemies<00:03:04.280> thinks<00:03:04.940> we're

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
works on the enemies thinks we're

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.730 
works on the enemies thinks we're
behaving<00:03:05.360> with<00:03:05.450> in<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.630> world<00:03:05.870> now<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.590> way

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
behaving with in the world now the way

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.900 
behaving with in the world now the way
that<00:03:06.770> it<00:03:07.010> works<00:03:07.100> is<00:03:07.280> if<00:03:07.430> there's<00:03:07.580> different

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
that it works is if there's different

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.220 
that it works is if there's different
levels<00:03:07.940> within<00:03:08.300> combat<00:03:08.750> training<00:03:08.960> so<00:03:09.200> a

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
levels within combat training so a

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.080 
levels within combat training so a
beginner<00:03:09.590> level<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:10.280> AI<00:03:10.460> is<00:03:10.670> gonna<00:03:10.880> move<00:03:11.000> a

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
beginner level the AI is gonna move a

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.880 
beginner level the AI is gonna move a
little<00:03:11.210> bit<00:03:11.330> slower<00:03:11.660> give<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.440> basic<00:03:12.650> idea

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
little bit slower give you a basic idea

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.680 
little bit slower give you a basic idea
of<00:03:13.100> like<00:03:13.250> okay<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:13.610> is<00:03:13.700> how<00:03:13.820> my<00:03:13.970> guns<00:03:14.180> work<00:03:14.450> I

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
of like okay this is how my guns work I

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.030 
of like okay this is how my guns work I
want<00:03:14.960> to<00:03:15.020> get<00:03:15.080> familiarity<00:03:15.530> with<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.770> map

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
want to get familiarity with the map

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.700 
want to get familiarity with the map
what<00:03:16.580> I<00:03:16.610> don't<00:03:17.240> know<00:03:17.390> what<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.840> Willie<00:03:18.230> Pete<00:03:18.530> is

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
what I don't know what a Willie Pete is

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.620 
what I don't know what a Willie Pete is
or<00:03:18.950> what<00:03:19.070> a<00:03:19.100> flashbang<00:03:19.640> is<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:20.210> can<00:03:20.300> just<00:03:20.480> try

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
or what a flashbang is you can just try

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.720 
or what a flashbang is you can just try
those<00:03:20.810> out<00:03:20.990> so<00:03:21.290> it's<00:03:21.710> really<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.130> idea<00:03:22.280> of

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
those out so it's really this idea of

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.370 
those out so it's really this idea of
creating<00:03:23.540> this<00:03:23.660> environment<00:03:23.810> where<00:03:24.260> it's

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
creating this environment where it's

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.510 
creating this environment where it's
safe<00:03:24.650> for<00:03:24.770> you<00:03:24.860> to<00:03:24.890> play<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:25.280> get<00:03:25.370> your

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
safe for you to play and get your

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.370 
safe for you to play and get your
bearings<00:03:27.640> now<00:03:28.640> as<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:28.940> actually<00:03:29.600> level<00:03:29.870> up<00:03:30.080> or

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
bearings now as you actually level up or

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.860 
bearings now as you actually level up or
actually<00:03:31.040> change<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.430> difficulty<00:03:32.210> level<00:03:32.480> in

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
actually change the difficulty level in

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.780 
actually change the difficulty level in
combat<00:03:33.410> training<00:03:33.620> it's<00:03:33.980> actually<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.340> great

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
combat training it's actually a great

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.430 
combat training it's actually a great
warm-up<00:03:35.150> at<00:03:35.300> least<00:03:35.450> for<00:03:35.600> me<00:03:35.720> before<00:03:36.140> I<00:03:36.290> go

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
warm-up at least for me before I go

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.720 
warm-up at least for me before I go
online<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.830> always<00:03:37.010> think<00:03:37.160> about<00:03:37.280> one<00:03:37.580> or<00:03:37.700> two

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
online I always think about one or two

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.640 
online I always think about one or two
matches<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.210> kind<00:03:38.360> of<00:03:38.390> get<00:03:38.510> my<00:03:39.020> bearings<00:03:39.410> and

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
matches to kind of get my bearings and

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.380 
matches to kind of get my bearings and
everything<00:03:39.920> ready<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.910> that's<00:03:41.120> one<00:03:41.270> of<00:03:41.300> the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
everything ready and that's one of the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.850 
everything ready and that's one of the
things<00:03:41.450> that<00:03:41.660> combat<00:03:42.020> training<00:03:42.200> can<00:03:42.380> do<00:03:42.500> the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
things that combat training can do the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.290 
things that combat training can do the
other<00:03:42.980> cool<00:03:43.190> thing<00:03:43.250> about<00:03:43.460> commenting<00:03:43.910> it's<00:03:44.210> a

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
other cool thing about commenting it's a

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.240 
other cool thing about commenting it's a
really<00:03:44.420> a<00:03:44.570> co-op<00:03:44.990> mode<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:45.830> you<00:03:45.890> and<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.190> could

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
really a co-op mode so you and I could

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.830 
really a co-op mode so you and I could

a few and two other BOTS and I give you
with<00:03:56.150> my<00:03:56.270> buddy<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:56.600> three<00:03:56.810> other<00:03:56.930> BOTS<00:03:57.170> you

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
with my buddy and three other BOTS you

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.530 
with my buddy and three other BOTS you
basically<00:03:57.830> create<00:03:58.130> matches<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:59.060> try<00:03:59.390> them

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
basically create matches and try them

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.150 
basically create matches and try them
out<00:03:59.630> with<00:03:59.810> you<00:04:00.230> know<00:04:00.290> a<00:04:00.350> lot<00:04:00.620> of<00:04:00.650> bots<00:04:00.890> against

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
out with you know a lot of bots against

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.740 
out with you know a lot of bots against
the<00:04:01.280> very<00:04:01.430> small<00:04:01.700> team<00:04:01.910> so<00:04:02.240> there's<00:04:02.480> a<00:04:02.540> lot<00:04:02.720> of

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
the very small team so there's a lot of

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.000 
the very small team so there's a lot of
variability<00:04:03.140> that<00:04:03.320> you<00:04:03.470> can<00:04:03.620> do<00:04:03.740> i'm<00:04:03.890> actually

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
variability that you can do i'm actually

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.890 
variability that you can do i'm actually
think<00:04:04.280> that<00:04:04.310> this<00:04:04.490> mode<00:04:04.790> will<00:04:05.180> be<00:04:05.510> a<00:04:05.540> great

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
think that this mode will be a great

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.540 
think that this mode will be a great
sort<00:04:06.200> of<00:04:06.290> taster<00:04:07.040> for<00:04:07.070> people<00:04:07.430> there

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
sort of taster for people there

sort of taster for people there
