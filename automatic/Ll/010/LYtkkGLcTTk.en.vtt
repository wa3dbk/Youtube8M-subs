00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.589
 advice on how to choose or waste 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.570
 I talk about how to have it soft then 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.010

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.080
 with the smooth part that there are two 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.020
 parts the smooth side is positioned 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.150
 above I tell you when you start a 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.390

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.040
 because it is very good what you do is 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.500
 nice even at the restaurant would come 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.570
 the other person in the house you want to do 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.030
 just do it your way then we do 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.680
 many many experiments indeed we want 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.310

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.090

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.659
 the perfected 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.359
 it characterizes it so it is very beautiful 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.369
 funny leon or miss here like 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:01.890
 always position a small bowl with a little 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.049
 of cold water to wet your hands seeds 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.299
 sticky of rice I recommend this 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:12.720
 tricks know so I put my face here 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:14.640
 over and then started to crush it 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.750
 see if not to stick with them 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.019
 hands so I bathe my hands a little 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.900
 in cold water I dry slightly and 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.549
 I go and rice doesn't stick to me 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.739
 in fact at the beginning I couldn't do it 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:34.380
 discovered it trick now I go 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:37.680
 shipped and then crushes nancy not 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.870
 eating lawyer is a year I like it 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.090
 the lawyer too much to such a throat as if 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.099
 we don't get so many I received 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.099
 the lawyer will be centers that tastes 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.379
 of nuts too good yummy and then it does 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.980
 so much good girls the lawyer really 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:56.609
 it does very well is a rich food rich in 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.340
 healthy food nutrients for 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:02.010
 excellence and should be cut into slices 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.609
 thin subtle dreaming marassi it very much 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.609
 thin 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.440
 when I am covered with is fixed to this 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.599
 point I go to work and put 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.250
 Salmon this morning also thinly cut 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:27.180
 try to place so usually 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.160
 I make two is a half slice that I am 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.530
 standard these sheet sizes e 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.140
 like cement, the cut apple avocado 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.819
 thin good if the number 1 that 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.190
 abundant as we have said before that 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.410
 however facts are this year they were 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.150
 with the voted in this way it is even more 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.160
 simple to wrap but since there 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.110
 we want to complicate life because there 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.870
 like just vote knows nothing 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.280
 together we do so so if 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.040
 maybe the first time you do it 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.739
 put it or only I am alone so it is 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.549
 easier at this point you see it is done 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:08.459
 so he shakes himself with his hands and presses himself 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:10.769
 here it is pressed then it is removed is easier 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.890
 and more difficult to explain than to do 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:16.799
 then he turns around a little more and bends over 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.950
 still so and this way it wraps itself 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.229
 you see this here just for you 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.260
 wrap your placemat there 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.600
 used to wrap the roll 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.990
 here it is I then saw him doing the 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.400
 mamma mia restaurant are fast you are 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.289
 very good 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.300
 however, in short, there is also calia 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.760
 now that so much time that we do it 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.430
 here it is, this is your roll 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.440
 go as nice and at this point before 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.630
 to cut it I always put it a little bit 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.430
 first in the refrigerator so pro when it 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.650
 so it is more compact and does not open 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.409
 so I put it in the fridge here which 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.050
 our brands this is part of the classic 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.849
 from outside with a knife a knife 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.089
 come true disturbing of the size 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.459
 important that it be a little wet 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:06.929
 with cold water here is the way to vent 

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:09.580
 which slides better cut first in half 

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:15.039
 and the knife be very sharp 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:20.800
 then i do this half i do this 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:24.339
 half to those who speak that oar where to give a 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.189
 I recommend these from 8 to wet 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:29.289
 secret he told me wander 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:33.129
 no because of putting the dishcloth 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:35.079
 dull to pass it so it cuts 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:37.419
 better the knife I am is sticking 

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:39.969
 then rice more in the mountains then 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.860
 I'm going to cut all the roms I've made 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.559
 go and cut half and half then 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.729
 this we have all done 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:48.489
 our individual rolls 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.919
 if you see that it sticks so you see there 

00:05:48.489 --> 00:05:52.629
 pass the wet cloth or 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.519
 in short, rinse it with cold water 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:58.959
 as you wish 

00:05:54.519 --> 00:06:01.539
 in this way they cut themselves perfectly 

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:05.679
 mind you notice how magnificence they are 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:09.849
 those are not too beautiful 

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:13.479
 here is the expensive ever who who would be the 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:15.579
 sushi are classic yummy to me 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.129
 we like our version a lot because 

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:19.719
 when I go to the Japanese restaurant 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:22.209
 accessory salmon that only a 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:24.729
 local instead these are deserved 

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:26.379
 things therefore not sabrina bomb delicious 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.239
 so this is all girls me 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:30.129
 I recommend watching the other videos that 

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:32.679
 we leave the information boxes there 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:35.019
 We did so many other types of sushi 

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:36.789
 followed all the links in the training boxes 

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:38.190
 I recommend if you make the garage 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:41.000
 on instagram 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.000
 we have a big kiss
