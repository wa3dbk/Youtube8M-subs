color<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.450> what<00:02:40.110> we<00:02:40.200> found<00:02:40.319> out<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:40.739> they

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
color and what we found out is that they

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.920 
color and what we found out is that they
were<00:02:41.790> made<00:02:42.090> with<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.269> combination<00:02:42.870> of

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
were made with a combination of

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.750 
were made with a combination of
semi-precious<00:02:43.349> stones<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.099> rare<00:02:44.340> clays

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
semi-precious stones and rare clays

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.570 
semi-precious stones and rare clays
heated<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.780> mixed<00:02:46.050> with<00:02:46.170> minerals<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.980> no

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
heated and mixed with minerals and no

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.430 
heated and mixed with minerals and no
organic<00:02:47.970> material<00:02:48.120> was<00:02:48.660> used<00:02:48.690> at<00:02:48.959> all<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.290> it

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
organic material was used at all in it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.440 
organic material was used at all in it
so<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:50.040> like<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.670> frescoes<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.150> you'd<00:02:51.239> see<00:02:51.390> in

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
so I like the frescoes that you'd see in

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.970 
so I like the frescoes that you'd see in
other<00:02:51.540> parts<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.959> Europe<00:02:52.290> where<00:02:52.500> they<00:02:52.650> used

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
other parts of Europe where they used

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.890 
other parts of Europe where they used
egg<00:02:53.220> white<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.610> kind<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.850> be<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> binder<00:02:54.510> they

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
egg white to kind of be a binder they

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.289 
egg white to kind of be a binder they
didn't<00:02:55.110> use<00:02:55.200> any<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.799> was<00:02:55.860> all

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
didn't use any of that it was all

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.460 
didn't use any of that it was all
inorganic<00:02:57.299> materials<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.049> that's<00:02:58.260> why

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
inorganic materials and so that's why

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.930 
inorganic materials and so that's why
the<00:02:58.530> colors<00:02:58.860> are<00:02:59.010> still<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.310> vivid<00:02:59.489> today
