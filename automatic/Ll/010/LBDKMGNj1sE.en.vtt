00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 list however at the heart of building 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.809
 planned training 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:17.190
 the idea of supercompensation was laid 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:18.840
 here you can see that there is a representation 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.119
 bulwarks something or stack 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.710
 performance 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.539
 it decreases after execute 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.189
 the training process then goes 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.890
 recovery 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.669
 then it goes down again 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.880
 recovery goes excess which 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.000
 underground supercompensation well 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.899
 and began to come up with different options 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.879
 associated with the implementation you are the most 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.489
 supercompensation for example came up with 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.460
 super compensation that goes with the week 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.820
 recovery of the germans to compensation but 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:59.879
 after three workouts awaits a huge 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.100
 supercompensation the question is who 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.420
 in general were experimentally shown that 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.540
 that's how it really happens 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.430
 This is the file collection and what 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.340
 health without measuring it measured 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.790
 change in glycogen concentration in 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.710
 muscles and liver in rats that swam in 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.340
 Gurion current for several hours 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.820
 and hours later the rat was taken out of the water 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.830
 they were gradually killed to watch 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.260
 stock is restored quickly through 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.479
 day there was a full recovery 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.970
 glycogen stores and the second or third 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.950
 day who watched super compensation 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.260
 glycogen glycogen is hermit 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.619
 ability and Nikolay Nikolaevich allegedly 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.770
 took her to change the words glycogen to 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.500
 performance 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.250
 this is a gross methodological error 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.170
 Is it possible that science is called 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.840
 substitution of concepts 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.899
 the frame is called whether to sort out 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.180
 which is very strong linen 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.520
 but im from matthew and after that took 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.160
 this term arbat ability or 100 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.350
 come up with such phenomena in fact 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.140
 business 10 is also known from practice 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.130
 that brigade he stops for 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.700
 two or three days before 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.310
 but so people do not train national teams 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.250
 the teams are given three days afterwards the rest day 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.630
 so here to justify this here 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.790
 came up with this option 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.290
 microcycles will be screaming people 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.390
 train snow recovery 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.790
 glycogen then rest me 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.830
 relies supercompensation it seemed to them 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.810
 that so everything will pass us no one nothing 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.459
 shot down 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:43.940
 so the whole introduction of supercompensation 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:46.370
 it's built on a false ground a little 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.700
 Moreover, the sports result does not depend on 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.299
 brigade depends on myofibrils income 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.640
 but after training the mass of myofibrils and 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.520
 mars mitochondria 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.860
 eggs remain the same and therefore 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.630
 if suddenly someone fast smoke line 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.690
 the country you will love on through 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.850
 half an hour repeat in any sport 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.170
 the project after can repeat that 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.780
 same very result no difference even 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.090
 enough long competition we 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.430
 for example if the cyclist drove 25 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.650
 kilometers and thriller friend wanted that 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.030
 I will once again drove cavities he rules 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.360
 and the result will be one 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.060
 and what is the reality because no 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.760
 no decrease in performance 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.709
 since out of glycogen reserve so here 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.280
 giraffe until the muscles is all he has 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.100
 will show absolutely free truth 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.920
 trembled hand roads piled high and 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.830
 so you gave a ban they share so that's why 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.010
 all ideas are false if they supercompensation 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.540
 built on false massive 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.420
 There is once again children Sergeevsky 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.480
 they also drew some mushrooms but 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.160
 in fact, what is shown here is not 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.340
 corresponds to what was really 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.380
 In fact, he depicted it 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.170
 concentration changes for caeta 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.840
 second pink super condensation accounts 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.549
 on the restoration of mitochondria myths dishes 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:15.030
 after very hard 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:19.650
 of the meaning of general loss so 1 and this 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:23.460
 applies that is, it turns out 14 15 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.850
 days after the rowers were forced to 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.419
 Denisov run 40 kilometers 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:34.290
 with an interval of rest 5 they drove 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:37.500
 there tips 70 all got evil yes 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.440
 I speak the same paper and now after that 15 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.970
 days in a row they removed versions 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.210
 discovered that sneak forest utilization 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.710
 about the greek genes and the muscle itself i.e. 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.620
 normal structure 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.110
 microphone and i love casually sap through 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.820
 two weeks some kind of it no one even 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.430
 by don't take about so far 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.710
 because they want all cargo 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.669
 some kind of abstraction associated with the morning 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:05.460
 compensator there are no ships 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:11.070
 pockets says there will be nothing 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:13.260
 no one dreamed of that whole problem 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.550
 periodization it is built on a false 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.669
 islands and basically they change along 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.669
 training process
