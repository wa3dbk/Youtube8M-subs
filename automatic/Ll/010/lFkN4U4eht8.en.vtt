professionals<00:00:10.809> and<00:00:10.900> we're<00:00:10.990> gonna<00:00:11.080> take<00:00:11.320> a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350 
professionals and we're gonna take a

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.740 
professionals and we're gonna take a
look<00:00:11.620> at<00:00:11.860> editing<00:00:12.639> a<00:00:13.030> photo<00:00:13.180> inside<00:00:13.629> of

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
look at editing a photo inside of

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.420 
look at editing a photo inside of
Lightroom<00:00:13.900> mainly<00:00:14.680> with<00:00:14.830> the<00:00:14.860> adjustment

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
Lightroom mainly with the adjustment

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.950 
Lightroom mainly with the adjustment
brush<00:00:15.580> because<00:00:15.879> I<00:00:16.270> think<00:00:16.510> one<00:00:16.660> of<00:00:16.690> the<00:00:16.810> things

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
brush because I think one of the things

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.109 
brush because I think one of the things
that<00:00:17.140> you're<00:00:17.260> gonna<00:00:17.350> find<00:00:17.710> is<00:00:18.039> that<00:00:18.430> the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
that you're gonna find is that the

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.730 
that you're gonna find is that the
sliders<00:00:19.630> give<00:00:19.869> us<00:00:19.990> a<00:00:20.109> great<00:00:20.320> start<00:00:20.680> but

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
sliders give us a great start but

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.439 
sliders give us a great start but
they're<00:00:21.010> global<00:00:21.369> when<00:00:21.939> we<00:00:22.060> use<00:00:22.300> the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
they're global when we use the

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.120 
they're global when we use the
adjustment<00:00:22.839> brush<00:00:23.080> we<00:00:23.499> can<00:00:23.529> get<00:00:23.740> in<00:00:23.859> there<00:00:24.009> and

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
adjustment brush we can get in there and

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.189 
adjustment brush we can get in there and
be<00:00:24.220> really<00:00:24.429> selective<00:00:24.789> with<00:00:25.300> it<00:00:25.449> so<00:00:25.929> here<00:00:26.109> we

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
be really selective with it so here we

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.200 
be really selective with it so here we
have<00:00:26.289> a<00:00:26.320> photo<00:00:26.619> of<00:00:26.710> Christine<00:00:27.429> files<00:00:27.789> it's<00:00:28.060> in

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
have a photo of Christine files it's in

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.659 
have a photo of Christine files it's in
Washington<00:00:28.929> State<00:00:29.169> and<00:00:29.439> we'll<00:00:30.339> just<00:00:30.519> go

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
Washington State and we'll just go

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.190 
Washington State and we'll just go
through<00:00:30.699> the<00:00:30.999> basic<00:00:31.329> panel<00:00:31.539> settings<00:00:31.839> here

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
through the basic panel settings here

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.260 
through the basic panel settings here
I'll<00:00:32.590> probably<00:00:32.860> add<00:00:33.130> some<00:00:33.400> warmth<00:00:33.760> to<00:00:33.970> it<00:00:34.000> just

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
I'll probably add some warmth to it just

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.390 
I'll probably add some warmth to it just
to<00:00:34.360> warm<00:00:34.600> it<00:00:34.720> up<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:35.079> maybe<00:00:35.680> add<00:00:35.950> a<00:00:35.980> little<00:00:36.250> bit

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
to warm it up and maybe add a little bit

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.150 
to warm it up and maybe add a little bit
of<00:00:36.489> green<00:00:37.199> increase<00:00:38.199> the<00:00:38.350> exposure<00:00:38.680> just<00:00:39.070> a

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
of green increase the exposure just a

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.889 
of green increase the exposure just a
hair<00:00:39.370> but<00:00:39.609> one<00:00:39.910> of<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.210> things<00:00:40.660> that<00:00:40.809> I'm

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
hair but one of the things that I'm

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.990 
hair but one of the things that I'm
gonna<00:00:40.989> battle<00:00:41.289> with<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.680> sliders<00:00:42.100> is<00:00:42.309> that

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
gonna battle with the sliders is that

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.849 
gonna battle with the sliders is that
once<00:00:43.210> I<00:00:43.359> add<00:00:43.510> some<00:00:43.750> contrast<00:00:44.289> and<00:00:44.410> try<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.620> pull

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
once I add some contrast and try to pull

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:46.529 
once I add some contrast and try to pull
back<00:00:44.890> on<00:00:45.070> highlights<00:00:45.789> which<00:00:46.000> I<00:00:46.120> think<00:00:46.359> this

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
back on highlights which I think this

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.540 
back on highlights which I think this
bottom<00:00:46.930> area<00:00:47.079> is<00:00:47.260> too<00:00:47.500> bright<00:00:47.769> a<00:00:48.010> lot<00:00:48.340> of<00:00:48.489> the

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
bottom area is too bright a lot of the

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.340 
bottom area is too bright a lot of the
areas<00:00:48.820> on<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.030> side<00:00:49.300> are<00:00:49.480> too<00:00:49.629> bright<00:00:49.870> if<00:00:50.260> I

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
areas on the side are too bright if I

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.259 
areas on the side are too bright if I
pull<00:00:50.620> back<00:00:50.800> too<00:00:51.129> far<00:00:51.519> on<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.789> highlights<00:00:52.149> I

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
pull back too far on the highlights I

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.529 
pull back too far on the highlights I
make<00:00:52.780> the<00:00:52.929> waterfall<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:53.649> back<00:00:53.890> too<00:00:54.609> dull<00:00:54.940> all

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
make the waterfall and back too dull all

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.360 
make the waterfall and back too dull all
right<00:00:55.719> so<00:00:56.140> we're<00:00:56.440> not<00:00:56.530> really<00:00:56.769> gonna<00:00:56.949> do<00:00:57.190> that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
right so we're not really gonna do that

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.259 
right so we're not really gonna do that
here<00:00:57.519> because<00:00:57.670> that's<00:00:57.969> where<00:00:58.120> we're<00:00:58.210> gonna

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
here because that's where we're gonna

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.930 
here because that's where we're gonna
get<00:00:58.510> selectively<00:00:59.399> maybe<00:01:00.399> increase<00:01:00.760> our

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
get selectively maybe increase our

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.490 
get selectively maybe increase our
shadows<00:01:01.300> a<00:01:01.359> little<00:01:01.660> bit<00:01:01.780> I<00:01:01.809> always<00:01:02.199> hold<00:01:02.350> down

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
shadows a little bit I always hold down

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.490 
shadows a little bit I always hold down
the<00:01:02.620> option<00:01:02.649> key<00:01:03.339> on<00:01:03.370> Mac<00:01:03.699> alt<00:01:04.030> on<00:01:04.269> PC<00:01:04.300> and<00:01:04.960> I'll

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
the option key on Mac alt on PC and I'll

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.130 
the option key on Mac alt on PC and I'll
press<00:01:06.130> on<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.460> whites<00:01:06.700> I<00:01:07.030> drag<00:01:07.750> that<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.990> the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
press on the whites I drag that to the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.600 
press on the whites I drag that to the
right<00:01:08.260> until<00:01:08.560> I<00:01:08.680> see<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:08.860> couple<00:01:09.070> little<00:01:09.370> dots

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
right until I see a couple little dots

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.460 
right until I see a couple little dots
here<00:01:09.880> I<00:01:09.909> mean<00:01:10.150> I<00:01:10.180> have<00:01:10.329> a<00:01:10.390> white<00:01:10.630> point<00:01:10.900> and<00:01:11.110> I

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
here I mean I have a white point and I

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.990 
here I mean I have a white point and I
do<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.770> same<00:01:11.979> thing<00:01:12.220> with<00:01:12.369> the<00:01:12.460> blacks<00:01:12.700> but<00:01:12.970> I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
do the same thing with the blacks but I

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.789 
do the same thing with the blacks but I
drag<00:01:13.270> it<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.600> left<00:01:13.900> because<00:01:14.439> it<00:01:14.560> means<00:01:14.710> I

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
drag it to the left because it means I

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:15.630 
drag it to the left because it means I
have<00:01:14.920> a<00:01:14.950> black<00:01:15.220> point

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
have a black point

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.640 
have a black point
well<00:01:16.630> I'd<00:01:16.689> a<00:01:16.750> little<00:01:17.020> bit<00:01:17.140> of<00:01:17.229> clarity<00:01:17.619> here

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
well I'd a little bit of clarity here

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.460 
well I'd a little bit of clarity here
just<00:01:18.009> for<00:01:18.159> some<00:01:18.340> detail<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:19.030> some<00:01:19.810> vibrance

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
just for some detail and some vibrance

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.990 
just for some detail and some vibrance
just<00:01:20.770> kind<00:01:20.950> of<00:01:20.979> pushes<00:01:21.399> a<00:01:21.430> little<00:01:21.610> bit<00:01:21.820> more

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
just kind of pushes a little bit more

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.719 
just kind of pushes a little bit more
color<00:01:22.299> so<00:01:22.710> after<00:01:23.710> we've<00:01:23.890> done<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.280> basic

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
color so after we've done the basic

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.429 
color so after we've done the basic
sliders<00:01:25.270> this<00:01:25.540> is<00:01:25.689> where<00:01:25.869> we<00:01:25.990> can<00:01:26.079> get<00:01:26.229> really

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
sliders this is where we can get really

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.170 
sliders this is where we can get really
creative<00:01:26.740> with<00:01:27.040> it<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.399> to<00:01:27.490> me<00:01:27.670> want<00:01:27.970> one<00:01:28.149> of

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
creative with it and to me want one of

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.969 
creative with it and to me want one of
the<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.630> biggest<00:01:28.990> steps<00:01:29.259> from<00:01:29.500> taking<00:01:29.860> a

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
the the biggest steps from taking a

tablet here and I'm pressing lighter on

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.520 
tablet here and I'm pressing lighter on
some<00:02:00.520> areas<00:02:00.969> which<00:02:01.479> means<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:02.079> it's<00:02:02.320> not

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
some areas which means that it's not

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.679 
some areas which means that it's not
applying<00:02:03.070> as<00:02:03.340> much<00:02:03.729> of<00:02:03.939> an<00:02:04.060> effect<00:02:04.149> when<00:02:04.600> I'm

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
applying as much of an effect when I'm

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.630 
applying as much of an effect when I'm
using<00:02:04.899> a<00:02:05.109> mouse<00:02:05.289> it's<00:02:05.710> it's<00:02:06.219> a<00:02:06.310> hundred

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
using a mouse it's it's a hundred

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.760 
using a mouse it's it's a hundred
percent<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.240> effect<00:02:07.539> all<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.810> time<00:02:08.259> but

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
percent of the effect all the time but

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.260 
percent of the effect all the time but
when<00:02:08.890> I'm<00:02:09.009> using<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.399> pen<00:02:09.580> and<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.789> tablet<00:02:10.180> I

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
when I'm using the pen and the tablet I

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.160 
when I'm using the pen and the tablet I
can<00:02:10.479> control<00:02:10.899> that

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
can control that

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.780 
can control that
so<00:02:11.500> maybe<00:02:11.710> want<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.040> get<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.340> here<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:12.730> don't

I think it's way too bright and there's
a<00:02:49.349> lot<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.650> texture<00:02:49.950> down<00:02:50.160> there<00:02:50.370> but<00:02:50.550> we<00:02:50.670> can't
