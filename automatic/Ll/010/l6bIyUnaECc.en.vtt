00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.899
 Hello everyone, everything good 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.150
 in this video we'll see how to do 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.150
 nails decorated using the stamp 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.740
 so the one that is my stamp he has 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.020
 a bigger side and a smaller side for you 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.260
 use depending on the size of the drawing 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.900
 done comes with this scraper zinho that 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.689
 a plaque that has a little piece of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:33.750
 metal where you shave so I bought the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.120
 scraper zinho and the stamp together and there 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.700
 then we need the molds that 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.920
 are the metal inserts with the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.110
 drawings we'll do 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.300
 so my template molds I 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.000
 I bought separately but usually when 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.700
 You buy the three young men together only 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.350
 A plate comes, only a plate comes. 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.239
 stamp and in comics the good that the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.070
 mold this template you can 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.510
 buy separately and you can buy 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.329
 how many do you want to do 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.369
 drawings of your preference that I am 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.000
 showing you some of the drawings 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.000
 that I have 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.259
 so as you can see there are several 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.909
 different designs various things 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.470
 different things you can do with the 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.990
 stamp and makes it much easier 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.860
 especially for those who have difficulty 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.860
 to draw 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.659
 So people are going to start here for a 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.539
 very important tip when you buy 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:35.079
 the mold the mold plate normally 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:37.210
 It comes with the plastic protector and you 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.479
 You have to remove this plastic before 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.060
 You use mine rather easily. 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.069
 because it comes with a blue plastic then 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.090
 It is clear that there is a plastic 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.920
 to be thrown away 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.630
 but often this plastic it is 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.149
 transparent but to do well 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.310
 attention and you have to take out 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.649
 because if you do not take away the plastic 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.959
 Your drawing will work. 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.890
 so here I already took plastic from my 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.179
 karekinha 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.590
 and I'll show you how it works 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.720
 so the first one does not explain to you 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.149
 What I'm going to do because it has to be a 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.220
 process to do the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.970
 I will apply the enamel on 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:21.569
 up the drawing I want I'm going to scratch 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:24.190
 I'm going to stamp and then the stamp on the nail 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.959
 Only when you want to pack on the nail I 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.389
 I will not put the correct stamp of this 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.400
 Here's how this test is not correct. 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.100
 You have to do it from side to side. 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.880
 other 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.340
 so before you start here 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.109
 I'll give you another tip if you 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.540
 to think that your neighbor's face does not 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.489
 is working well because sometimes the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.859
 fence and is not made of metal is 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.500
 plastic then you can use a card 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:54.230
 credit that works super good too 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.120
 so I 'll start here I'll do this 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:08.760
 butterfly then look I applied the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:15.480
 I'm going to scrape or stamp and I'm going 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:17.670
 apply the mother from one lake to another and 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.530
 have to put a certain amount of pressure 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.190
 I do not know the drawing then the butterfly 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.190
 right skirt 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.230
 so personal another very hint 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.260
 important is every time you do the 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.860
 drawing you have to clean the snipe 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.319
 you have to clean the mold plate and the 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.390
 every time I can not let go 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.560
 traces of enamel because otherwise it 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.560
 the next drawing 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.800
 so I'm going to make here on the other finger a 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.670
 another drawing for doing this here that 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.670
 looks like a little flower 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.480
 so I put on the enamel I dragged this 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:04.290
 process has to be faster 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.709
 possible so that in addition to evoking enter 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.709
 in the usa 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.239
 and if not left without super perfect but I 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.610
 I thought okay then I will also 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.650
 leave that has to have enough 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.060
 patience with a stamp because sometimes 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.280
 does not work 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.150
 it's really a matter of patience and 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.780
 then practice with commitment to all 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.750
 cotton and acetone and is ready to 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.100
 make my next joins in the other thing 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:40.360
 this drawing is kind of a shame 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:45.690
 So I put the glaze I like, I'll go 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.690
 stamped good on a 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.190
 So I thought it was cool. 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:56.410
 It was perfect then the staff here 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.030
 In the little finger I made a drawing that did not 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.850
 I thought it was very cool. 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.639
 so I'm going to take it, I do not need to take it 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.430
 the enamel all silva made a drawing 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.979
 that does not work, you can use the toothpick 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.680
 cotton and acetone and only get access in 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.590
 So I'll try again, I'll go 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.160
 make this drawing that stars of the 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.160
 little finger 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:27.870
 so I put on the enamel I dragged the 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.870
 stamped and stamped 1 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.840
 and that's how I liked the stars 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.129
 so this is personal I hope you 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.620
 have learned a little bit with this video 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:45.629
 so how can you see the stamp he 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.819
 can make your life a lot easier if 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:50.370
 you know how to use and really 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:52.409
 much easier for those who do not have it. 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.259
 practice with drawing for those who do not have 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:58.319
 much skill and is also an option 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.789
 faster more practice is very quickly 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.870
 to do once you get the 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.789
 little way 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.830
 So these people if you want 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:08.370
 share their experiences with the 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.710
 nail stamping tips difficulties let 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.270
 a comment for us and if you liked 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.639
 this video do not forget to take a 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.770
 young man had and subscribe to the channel and I

 I see you in the next video a super 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.889
 kiss
