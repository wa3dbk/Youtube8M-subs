00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.400
 Shepherding has been an economically viable 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.019
 small and medium-sized rural producers 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.309
 controlled brand has the advantage of being able to feed as many mothers as 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.390
 separately may be able to route the matrices during the day to the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.590
 six pastures so kids worm health program do not find the 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.029
 lion on walks misfit element 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.689
 controlled breastfeeding also stimulates the consumption of solid foods by 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.610
 who remain for long periods without suckling 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.030
 the cards can remain closed and provide them with quality food 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.550
 to improve meat production are made cross between the holy breeds 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.030
 inÃªs and pantaneira 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.190
 this cross-breeding better performance and at precocity the finish of the carcass of the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.240
 animals 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.730
 there was a sound ruminant animals should be fed concord 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.970
 of good quality produced at low cost 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.830
 they have also been of animal production with large number of their color 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.870
 produced all year long requires good quality food 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.329
 which can be achieved through a vegetable production coefficient 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.900
 in calculating a dietary diet, one should think about how to attend 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.390
 the nutritional requirements of animals as well as in the most economical way to 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.970
 to finish, since the higher cost of production is with the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.410
 food 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.420
 The management carried out at the school davi farm was made from the 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.300
 implantation of small ones in the areas where the sheep will remain 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.140
 of grazing with silage we now say we 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.620
 same
