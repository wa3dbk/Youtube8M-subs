yo<00:00:00.269> yo<00:00:00.599> girl<00:00:00.960> is<00:00:01.439> math<00:00:01.829> class<00:00:02.250> that's<00:00:03.030> as<00:00:03.300> clear

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
yo yo girl is math class that's as clear

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.039 
yo yo girl is math class that's as clear
as<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.899> glass<00:00:04.440> women<00:00:04.859> yo<00:00:05.069> dawg<00:00:05.460> it's<00:00:06.060> math<00:00:06.690> past

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
as a glass women yo dawg it's math past

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:25.450 
as a glass women yo dawg it's math past
not<00:00:07.620> time<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.189> be<00:00:08.250> smelling<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.269> grass<00:00:11.870> ok<00:00:12.870> so

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.439 

today<00:00:26.460> I'm<00:00:26.699> here<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.939> tell<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.210> about

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
today I'm here to tell you about

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.419 
today I'm here to tell you about
scientific<00:00:28.050> notation<00:00:28.680> what<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.250> do<00:00:29.400> a

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
scientific notation what you do a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.189 
scientific notation what you do a
scientific<00:00:29.820> notation<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.810> take<00:00:30.990> this

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
scientific notation is you take this

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.280 
scientific notation is you take this
number<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.329> you<00:00:33.329> move<00:00:33.570> your<00:00:33.719> decimal<00:00:33.899> point

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
number and you move your decimal point

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.560 
number and you move your decimal point
over<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.800> many<00:00:35.010> page<00:00:35.309> places<00:00:36.000> pretty<00:00:36.329> much

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
over that many page places pretty much

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.700 
over that many page places pretty much
it's<00:00:37.469> not<00:00:37.649> much<00:00:37.950> more<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.820> problem<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.590> is

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
it's not much more to so problem this is

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.290 
it's not much more to so problem this is
what<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.250> help<00:00:41.370> me<00:00:41.550> out<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.879> move<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
what I do to help me out I move the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.490 
what I do to help me out I move the
decimal<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.789> and<00:00:44.789> insert<00:00:45.149> zeros<00:00:45.600> where

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
decimal like this and insert zeros where

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.319 
decimal like this and insert zeros where
I<00:00:46.770> move<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> decimal<00:00:47.250> place<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:48.000> decimal

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
I move the decimal place my decimal

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.470 
I move the decimal place my decimal
there<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:49.050> that's<00:00:49.200> your<00:00:49.289> number<00:00:49.469> so

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.960 

your<00:00:54.480> answer<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.370> that's<00:00:56.370> it
