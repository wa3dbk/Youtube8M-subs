00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.490
 this is a new eight impulse to know predicted from sailing 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.940
 some of the features that I found particularly interesting to 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.360
 but is also present in the fishing tokyo where we can 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.269
 see here 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.810
 a much cleaner view since he does not share a window anymore 

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:19.550
 and yes it is dedicated 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.539
 as also 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.819
 find other options 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.409
 in the other interesting point since we are talking about a brain is what 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.419
 Changed your office 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:29.380
 first 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.240
 how much gain integration has multiple servers so now the 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.370
 top of dealing with multiple servers 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.050
 as with the only server at a time 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.600
 so for example if you want to create a group of servers I can come here in 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.550
 to be arrested 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.700
 add new servers at any time by placing new servers 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.450
 and also placing other other figures and so on a server 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.640
 that I have ever seen 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.910
 also the consolidated view of a group pin 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.170
 so I see is that all server events 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.660
 the services of all of them 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.660
 how is each one performing? 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.460
 the bes by its agent already integrated in the screen the list of children of each server 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.080
 and so on 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.080
 note that all features that opinion saw I also have by the advice 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.790
 where I travel the resources of my local machine beyond the already known 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.759
 server manager here on the top I have also very low one 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.140
 consolidation 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.270
 services name 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.270
 the main effects 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.200
 bc needs to appear 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.690
 performance alerts 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.410
 and here at the end of the defeat and I too 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.710
 the simon figures that are installed 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.990
 every administration can now be centralized then for example to 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.229
 add a new heading however I can do that of this size 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.400
 here also in the menu 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.780
 I can add a fine 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.940
 on my local server 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.049
 or add to health 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.049
 on multiple servers this is an interesting resource 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:12.719
 and me too 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.759
 the well is there based on scenarios then for example 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:20.839
 I can choose as the last club the crisis scenario is not 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:21.840
 gesture 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.170
 and automatically after it all the services needed the same thing to 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.639
 the biosul the breeders and so on and b 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.689
 resources are installed based on a scenario that does not 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:35.999
 in sequence 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.449
 I can choose 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.189
 Where I'm going to scale 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.189
 where I can scale both to the playful server 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.199
 How can I climb to the people? 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.899
 so I can for example that is installing a certain done 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:51.829
 another server what many servers 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.039
 which is also very interesting 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:59.439
 efec the selection of fitness and I say loures now also joined a beautiful soup 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:03.679
 so these are some of the new features of course here still 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:08.509
 known in the field what every resource brings back 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:09.699
 21 20 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.909
 but it already gives a good idea of ​​the usability of the 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.729
 also in the usability part 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:19.429
 the audax interesting questions is how to make great passwords 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:24.669
 it's enough here, on the contrary, they did not start I started to digital what I 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:25.829
 I want to search 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.829
 he already showed me the side menu 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.689
 and the applications that talked to that particular goal 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:34.549
 A word that we have for example 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.949
 or your interest 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.279
 He showed me the pet bottle. 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:39.220
 they also 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.620
 is the resource of this very interesting novelty 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.099
 and a much cleaner screen is easier to use
