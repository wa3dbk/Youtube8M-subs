00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
over to the I staff and do this little

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.480 
over to the I staff and do this little
pattern<00:01:16.440> that<00:01:16.530> I'm<00:01:16.620> doing<00:01:16.710> right<00:01:16.920> here<00:01:16.980> this

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
pattern that I'm doing right here this

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.800 
pattern that I'm doing right here this
is<00:01:17.550> actually<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> really<00:01:18.000> good<00:01:18.150> spot<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.480> cycle

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
is actually a really good spot to cycle

is actually a really good spot to cycle
if<00:01:18.870> you're<00:01:18.960> actually<00:01:19.200> stuck<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> crazy

riese<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:43.260> we're<00:01:43.410> gonna<00:01:43.500> be<00:01:43.620> in<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.740> Thompson

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
riese and we're gonna be in the Thompson

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.680 
riese and we're gonna be in the Thompson
River<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.400> reason<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.730> is<00:01:44.850> number<00:01:45.030> four<00:01:45.450> is

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
River the reason this is number four is

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.360 
River the reason this is number four is
similar<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.409> crazy<00:01:46.650> places<00:01:47.070> because<00:01:47.340> you

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
similar to the crazy places because you

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.130 
similar to the crazy places because you
really<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:47.909> kind<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.180> avoid<00:01:48.480> it<00:01:48.659> as<00:01:48.780> long<00:01:49.050> as

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
really can kind of avoid it as long as

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.210 
really can kind of avoid it as long as
you're<00:01:49.260> smart<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.650> sort<00:01:49.830> of<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:49.980> map

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
you're smart and sort of have map

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.500 
you're smart and sort of have map
awareness<00:01:50.730> if<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.240> you'll<00:01:51.390> be

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
awareness if you have that you'll be

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.450 
awareness if you have that you'll be
fine<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.260> area<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.650> right<00:01:52.890> here<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.310> right

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
fine but the area is right here so right

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.950 
fine but the area is right here so right
when<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.670> actually<00:01:53.970> run<00:01:54.150> into<00:01:54.510> the<00:01:54.600> Thompson

much attention to where exactly we're on

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.120 
much attention to where exactly we're on
the<00:02:03.270> map<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.840> might<00:02:03.990> scoot<00:02:04.320> too<00:02:04.530> far<00:02:04.800> over<00:02:04.950> and

the map you might scoot too far over and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.080 
the map you might scoot too far over and
you<00:02:05.190> might<00:02:05.310> actually<00:02:05.400> get<00:02:05.640> caught<00:02:05.880> by<00:02:06.030> this

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
you might actually get caught by this

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
the zombies because if you do that

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.770 
the zombies because if you do that
you'll<00:02:26.790> be<00:02:26.910> fine<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.270> won't<00:02:27.420> have<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.600> worry

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
about it but say you don't do that you

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.440 
about it but say you don't do that you
actually<00:02:29.220> might<00:02:29.550> run<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.760> risk<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.120> backing

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
actually might run the risk of backing

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.760 
actually might run the risk of backing
up<00:02:30.570> into<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.900> little<00:02:30.960> area<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.740> very

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
up into this little area this is a very

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.230 
up into this little area this is a very
dangerous<00:02:32.070> pop<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.640> usually<00:02:32.910> once<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.120> get

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
dangerous pop and usually once you get

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.520 
dangerous pop and usually once you get
caught<00:02:33.360> right<00:02:33.540> there<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.840> spend<00:02:34.110> like<00:02:34.230> 1<00:02:34.410> or<00:02:34.440> 2

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
caught right there you spend like 1 or 2

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.020 
caught right there you spend like 1 or 2
SEC's<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.040> turn<00:02:35.160> around<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.520> actually<00:02:35.700> look

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
SEC's and turn around and actually look

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.460 
SEC's and turn around and actually look
at<00:02:36.180> what<00:02:36.330> caught<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.930> by<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.110> time<00:02:37.380> you

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
at what caught you and by the time you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.510 
at what caught you and by the time you
actually<00:02:37.590> do<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.100> zombies<00:02:38.430> have

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
actually do that the zombies have

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.500 
actually do that the zombies have
already<00:02:38.730> caught<00:02:38.850> up<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.270> this<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.480> a

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
already caught up to you so this is a

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.000 
already caught up to you so this is a
very<00:02:39.780> dangerous<00:02:40.110> spot<00:02:40.320> just<00:02:40.680> don't<00:02:40.920> go

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
very dangerous spot just don't go

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.900 
very dangerous spot just don't go
backwards<00:02:41.220> when<00:02:41.550> you're<00:02:41.640> walking<00:02:41.760> through

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
backwards when you're walking through

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.700 
backwards when you're walking through
this<00:02:42.090> area<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.750> know<00:02:42.780> face<00:02:43.080> forward<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.620> as

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
this area you know face forward and as

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.960 
this area you know face forward and as
soon<00:02:43.890> as<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.040> pass<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.340> little<00:02:44.430> pole<00:02:44.670> turn

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
soon as you pass that little pole turn

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.920 
soon as you pass that little pole turn
around<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.330> you'll<00:02:45.420> be<00:02:45.510> fine

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
around and you'll be fine

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.080 
around and you'll be fine
so<00:02:46.140> let's<00:02:46.260> go<00:02:46.380> ahead<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.650> go<00:02:46.710> number<00:02:46.920> three

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
so let's go ahead and go number three

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.370 
so let's go ahead and go number three
all<00:02:48.090> right<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.420> coming<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:48.780> number<00:02:48.960> three<00:02:49.230> is

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
all right and coming in number three is

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.810 
all right and coming in number three is
going<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.680> mob<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.160> dead<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:50.700> is

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
going to be mob of the dead and this is

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.190 
going to be mob of the dead and this is
going<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.030> be<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.240> area<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:51.690> actually<00:02:51.780> leads

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
going to be the area that actually leads

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.570 
going to be the area that actually leads
up<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.620> top<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:52.950> roof<00:02:53.130> it's<00:02:53.310> going<00:02:53.430> to

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
up to the top of the roof it's going to

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.910 
up to the top of the roof it's going to
this<00:02:53.640> little<00:02:53.910> staircase<00:02:54.270> room<00:02:54.960> area<00:02:55.320> this<00:02:55.770> is

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
this little staircase room area this is

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.950 
this little staircase room area this is
actually<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.250> very<00:02:56.550> dangerous<00:02:56.760> room<00:02:57.240> only<00:02:57.600> if

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
actually a very dangerous room only if

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.030 
actually a very dangerous room only if
it's<00:02:58.110> moving<00:02:58.500> around<00:02:58.590> if<00:02:58.800> it's<00:02:58.920> at<00:02:59.010> the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
it's moving around if it's at the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.200 
it's moving around if it's at the
beginning<00:02:59.490> of<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.640> round<00:02:59.820> or<00:02:59.910> the<00:02:59.970> middle

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
beginning of the round or the middle

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.730 
beginning of the round or the middle
around<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.540> might<00:03:00.690> probably<00:03:01.050> be<00:03:01.110> fine<00:03:01.320> but<00:03:01.650> if

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
around you might probably be fine but if

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.020 
around you might probably be fine but if
it's<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.950> middle<00:03:02.190> around<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.550> really<00:03:02.910> would

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
it's the middle around I really would

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.430 
it's the middle around I really would
not<00:03:03.060> recommend<00:03:03.540> running<00:03:03.930> through<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.170> area

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
not recommend running through this area

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.630 
not recommend running through this area
just<00:03:04.470> wait<00:03:04.830> till<00:03:04.980> whatever<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.310> have<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.460> do

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
just wait till whatever you have to do

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.680 
just wait till whatever you have to do
wait<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.030> end<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.210> the<00:03:06.270> round<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.510> get<00:03:06.630> it

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
wait to the end of the round and get it

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.040 
wait to the end of the round and get it
done

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
done

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.420 
done
because<00:03:07.410> there's<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:07.710> many<00:03:07.830> spawn<00:03:08.130> points

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
because there's so many spawn points

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.130 
because there's so many spawn points
around<00:03:08.550> these<00:03:08.820> stairs<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.300> plus<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.870> really

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
around these stairs and plus you really

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.420 
around these stairs and plus you really
just<00:03:10.290> can't<00:03:10.590> see<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.100> might<00:03:11.280> have<00:03:11.370> a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
just can't see so you might have a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.680 
just can't see so you might have a
zombie<00:03:11.640> on<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:11.910> other<00:03:12.120> side<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.480> stairs

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
zombie on the other side of the stairs

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.660 
zombie on the other side of the stairs
behind<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.170> wall<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.680> can't<00:03:14.040> see<00:03:14.280> him

you try to back up and the zombie behind
you<00:03:20.400> gets<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:21.239> really<00:03:21.420> if<00:03:21.540> you're<00:03:21.660> on<00:03:21.720> a

high<00:03:21.900> ground<00:03:22.140> just<00:03:22.290> don't<00:03:22.500> try<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.709> go<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:22.920> the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
high ground just don't try to go to the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
have like the blundergat and you feel

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.900 
have like the blundergat and you feel
like<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.890> could<00:03:26.010> do<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.280> because<00:03:26.520> a<00:03:26.670> lot<00:03:26.880> of

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
like you could do it because a lot of

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.160 
like you could do it because a lot of
the<00:03:27.030> time<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.420> zombies<00:03:27.660> going<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.840> block<00:03:28.020> your

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
the time so zombies going to block your

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.270 
the time so zombies going to block your
path<00:03:28.230> from<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.590> stairs<00:03:28.830> even<00:03:29.040> if<00:03:29.190> you're

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
path from the stairs even if you're

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.890 
path from the stairs even if you're
going<00:03:29.430> up<00:03:29.670> or<00:03:29.880> down<00:03:29.910> as<00:03:30.239> always<00:03:30.510> going<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.660> get

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
going up or down as always going to get

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.210 
going up or down as always going to get
in<00:03:30.959> your<00:03:31.050> way<00:03:31.080> he's<00:03:31.650> going<00:03:31.770> to<00:03:31.830> block<00:03:32.010> your

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
in your way he's going to block your

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.680 
in your way he's going to block your
path<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.580> have<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.820> stop<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.239> shoot<00:03:33.450> them<00:03:33.600> and

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
path you have to stop to shoot them and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.330 
path you have to stop to shoot them and
by<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.930> time<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.320> do<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.470> another<00:03:35.130> zombie

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
by the time you do that another zombie

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.860 
by the time you do that another zombie
would<00:03:35.580> have<00:03:35.670> probably<00:03:35.850> spawned<00:03:36.270> in<00:03:36.420> up<00:03:36.600> top

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
would have probably spawned in up top

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.660 
would have probably spawned in up top
blocking<00:03:37.290> your<00:03:37.350> path<00:03:37.500> again<00:03:37.980> or<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.520> guys

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
blocking your path again or the guys

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.770 
blocking your path again or the guys
behind<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.120> would<00:03:39.209> have<00:03:39.330> caught<00:03:39.450> up<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.630> you

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
behind you would have caught up to you

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.120 
behind you would have caught up to you
so<00:03:39.840> this<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.140> very<00:03:40.350> dangerous<00:03:40.680> spot<00:03:40.920> and

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
so this is a very dangerous spot and

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.380 
so this is a very dangerous spot and
unlike<00:03:41.370> number<00:03:41.610> five<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:41.910> number<00:03:41.940> four<00:03:42.270> this

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
unlike number five and number four this

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.060 
unlike number five and number four this
really<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:42.989> can't<00:03:43.260> be<00:03:43.440> avoided<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:44.010> you

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
really just can't be avoided so you

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.440 
really just can't be avoided so you
actually<00:03:44.400> have<00:03:44.550> to<00:03:44.670> get<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.060> roof<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:45.420> you

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
actually have to get to the roof so you

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.880 
actually have to get to the roof so you
actually<00:03:45.630> need<00:03:45.930> something<00:03:46.230> on<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.470> roof<00:03:46.620> and

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
actually need something on the roof and

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.990 
actually need something on the roof and
you<00:03:46.980> have<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.160> actually<00:03:47.370> run<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:47.730> area<00:03:47.940> to

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
you have to actually run to this area to

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.040 
you have to actually run to this area to
get<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.300> roof<00:03:48.480> which<00:03:48.630> is<00:03:48.660> actually<00:03:49.019> a

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
get to the roof which is actually a

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.960 
get to the roof which is actually a
pivotal<00:03:49.350> point<00:03:49.560> in<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.860> map<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:50.250> really<00:03:50.820> just

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
pivotal point in the map so really just

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:51.949 
pivotal point in the map so really just
be<00:03:51.090> cautious<00:03:51.269> when<00:03:51.570> you're<00:03:51.630> going<00:03:51.780> through

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
be cautious when you're going through

be cautious when you're going through
here<00:03:52.140> don't<00:03:52.320> really<00:03:52.530> go<00:03:52.620> through<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:52.950> middle

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
here don't really go through the middle

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.440 
here don't really go through the middle
around<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.640> if<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.850> do<00:03:54.000> make<00:03:54.180> sure<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.390> at

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
around and if you do make sure you at

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.430

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
spawn in drop down from the roof and

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.190 
spawn in drop down from the roof and
it'll<00:04:35.760> just<00:04:35.910> cut<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.270> off<00:04:36.450> and<00:04:36.750> by<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.020> time

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
it'll just cut you off and by the time

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.660 
it'll just cut you off and by the time
he<00:04:37.350> hits<00:04:37.500> you<00:04:37.620> once<00:04:37.800> or<00:04:37.980> twice<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.370> actually

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
he hits you once or twice you actually

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.040 
he hits you once or twice you actually
notice<00:04:38.910> them<00:04:39.060> turn<00:04:39.420> around<00:04:39.540> and<00:04:39.750> shoot<00:04:39.930> them

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
notice them turn around and shoot them

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.210 
notice them turn around and shoot them
and<00:04:40.170> then<00:04:40.260> zombies<00:04:40.650> would<00:04:40.710> probably<00:04:41.070> caught

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
and then zombies would probably caught

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.220 
and then zombies would probably caught
up<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.580> or<00:04:41.760> another<00:04:42.000> one<00:04:42.150> with<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.270> spawn<00:04:42.570> so

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
up to you or another one with a spawn so

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.750 
up to you or another one with a spawn so
my<00:04:43.350> advice<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.740> you<00:04:43.800> is<00:04:43.890> just<00:04:43.920> do<00:04:44.190> not<00:04:44.340> stop<00:04:44.640> in

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
my advice to you is just do not stop in

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.370 
my advice to you is just do not stop in
this<00:04:44.880> room<00:04:45.060> always<00:04:45.300> run<00:04:45.630> completely<00:04:46.080> through

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
this room always run completely through

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.050 
this room always run completely through
it<00:04:46.530> or<00:04:46.860> if<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:47.190> are<00:04:47.310> going<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.580> stop<00:04:47.760> make<00:04:47.940> sure

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
it or if you are going to stop make sure

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.220 
it or if you are going to stop make sure
you<00:04:48.150> at<00:04:48.210> least<00:04:48.300> running<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.780> opposite<00:04:49.170> way

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
you at least running the opposite way

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.570 
you at least running the opposite way
from<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.560> stage<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.100> dressing<00:04:50.460> room

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
from the stage to the dressing room

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.500 
from the stage to the dressing room
because<00:04:50.640> if<00:04:50.820> you're<00:04:50.910> running<00:04:51.030> that<00:04:51.240> way<00:04:51.390> the

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
because if you're running that way the

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.150 
because if you're running that way the
spot<00:04:51.750> isn't<00:04:52.050> really<00:04:52.230> that<00:04:52.260> dangerous<00:04:52.770> but<00:04:53.010> if

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
spot isn't really that dangerous but if

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.740 
spot isn't really that dangerous but if
you're<00:04:53.250> running<00:04:53.340> from<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.610> FT<00:04:53.880> 40<00:04:54.210> room<00:04:54.390> to

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
you're running from the FT 40 room to

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.880 
you're running from the FT 40 room to
the<00:04:54.840> dressing<00:04:55.170> room<00:04:55.320> it's<00:04:55.440> going<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.620> be<00:04:55.680> kind

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
the dressing room it's going to be kind

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.110 
the dressing room it's going to be kind
of<00:04:55.920> dangerous<00:04:56.070> because<00:04:56.370> that<00:04:56.640> zombie<00:04:57.000> will

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
of dangerous because that zombie will

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.310 
of dangerous because that zombie will
spawn<00:04:57.420> there<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:57.870> really<00:04:58.050> just<00:04:58.170> can't

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
spawn there and you really just can't

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.630 
spawn there and you really just can't
see<00:04:58.560> if<00:04:58.650> he<00:04:58.740> spawns<00:04:59.010> or<00:04:59.130> not<00:04:59.250> so<00:04:59.340> you<00:04:59.370> really

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
see if he spawns or not so you really

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.830 
see if he spawns or not so you really
won't<00:04:59.760> know<00:05:00.000> until<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.240> actually<00:05:00.480> turn<00:05:00.690> that

won't know until you actually turn that

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.060 
won't know until you actually turn that
corner<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.320> once<00:05:01.500> you<00:05:01.590> turn<00:05:01.710> that<00:05:01.860> corner

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
corner and once you turn that corner

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.650 
corner and once you turn that corner

origins<00:05:21.960> taking<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.350> number<00:05:22.560> one<00:05:22.710> spot<00:05:22.980> this

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
origins taking the number one spot this

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.650 
origins taking the number one spot this
is<00:05:23.550> actually<00:05:23.820> a<00:05:23.880> different<00:05:24.180> spot<00:05:24.330> from<00:05:24.600> a

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
is actually a different spot from a

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.330 
is actually a different spot from a
crazy<00:05:24.960> place<00:05:25.230> but<00:05:25.500> in<00:05:25.650> my<00:05:25.800> opinion<00:05:26.130> this<00:05:26.190> is

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
crazy place but in my opinion this is

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.680 
crazy place but in my opinion this is
actually<00:05:26.700> more<00:05:26.880> dangerous<00:05:27.090> than<00:05:27.420> the<00:05:27.480> crazy

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
actually more dangerous than the crazy

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.160 
actually more dangerous than the crazy
place

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
place

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.480 
place
so<00:05:28.500> this<00:05:28.620> spots<00:05:28.860> going<00:05:29.010> to<00:05:29.100> be<00:05:29.160> this<00:05:29.280> long

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
so this spots going to be this long

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.010 
so this spots going to be this long
little<00:05:29.850> pathway<00:05:30.090> that<00:05:30.360> leads<00:05:30.570> you<00:05:30.690> actually

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
little pathway that leads you actually

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.690 
little pathway that leads you actually
from<00:05:31.170> generator<00:05:31.590> two<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:32.040> three<00:05:32.280> to<00:05:32.490> pack<00:05:32.670> a

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
from generator two and three to pack a

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.340 
from generator two and three to pack a
punch<00:05:33.000> now<00:05:33.480> the<00:05:33.540> reason<00:05:33.960> this<00:05:34.050> is<00:05:34.110> so

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
punch now the reason this is so

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.930 
punch now the reason this is so
dangerous<00:05:34.560> is<00:05:34.890> because<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:35.340> zombies<00:05:35.490> spawn

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
dangerous is because the zombies spawn

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.910 
dangerous is because the zombies spawn
on<00:05:36.090> both<00:05:36.300> sides<00:05:36.630> of<00:05:36.750> this<00:05:36.810> area<00:05:37.170> and<00:05:37.410> at<00:05:37.680> one

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
on both sides of this area and at one

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.650 
on both sides of this area and at one
point<00:05:37.950> in<00:05:38.400> this<00:05:38.550> area<00:05:38.940> it's<00:05:39.150> only<00:05:39.300> big<00:05:39.540> enough

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
point in this area it's only big enough

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.900 
point in this area it's only big enough
for<00:05:39.780> one<00:05:40.050> person<00:05:40.080> to<00:05:40.470> run<00:05:40.620> through<00:05:40.830> aka<00:05:41.250> if<00:05:41.580> you

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
for one person to run through aka if you

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.550 
for one person to run through aka if you
try<00:05:42.090> to<00:05:42.150> run<00:05:42.300> past<00:05:42.540> a<00:05:42.660> zombie<00:05:42.960> the<00:05:43.080> zombies<00:05:43.410> not

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
try to run past a zombie the zombies not

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.720 
try to run past a zombie the zombies not
going<00:05:43.740> to<00:05:43.800> let<00:05:43.890> you<00:05:44.010> run<00:05:44.130> through<00:05:44.370> and<00:05:44.580> he's

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
going to let you run through and he's

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.340 
going to let you run through and he's
gonna<00:05:44.850> stop<00:05:45.150> you<00:05:45.360> so<00:05:45.810> this<00:05:45.870> is<00:05:45.990> a<00:05:46.080> very

gonna stop you so this is a very

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.990 
gonna stop you so this is a very

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
dangerous spot now the only real way you

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.060 
dangerous spot now the only real way you
can<00:05:48.210> avoid<00:05:48.510> the<00:05:48.660> spot<00:05:48.900> is<00:05:49.410> the<00:05:49.650> store<00:05:49.860> to<00:05:49.950> keep

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
can avoid the spot is the store to keep

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.650 
can avoid the spot is the store to keep
the<00:05:50.220> zombies<00:05:50.520> behind<00:05:50.700> you<00:05:50.970> so<00:05:51.090> I<00:05:51.150> pathetically

if<00:05:51.720> you're<00:05:51.810> running<00:05:51.990> this<00:05:52.200> strategy<00:05:52.620> that<00:05:52.740> I'm

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
if you're running this strategy that I'm

if you're running this strategy that I'm
running<00:05:53.070> right<00:05:53.160> now<00:05:53.370> you<00:05:53.820> really<00:05:54.120> don't<00:05:54.390> want

running right now you really don't want

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.910 
running right now you really don't want
to<00:05:54.690> go<00:05:54.810> too<00:05:54.870> fast<00:05:55.230> you<00:05:55.470> want<00:05:55.620> to<00:05:55.650> take<00:05:55.800> your

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
time and you want to make sure the

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.730 
time and you want to make sure the
zombies<00:05:57.600> are<00:05:57.720> right<00:05:57.900> behind<00:05:58.080> you<00:05:58.350> because<00:05:58.620> by

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
the time you actually fall down and get

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.240 
the time you actually fall down and get
near<00:06:00.690> generator<00:06:01.110> to<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.590> zombies<00:06:02.130> are<00:06:02.220> all

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
near generator to the zombies are all

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.380 
near generator to the zombies are all
going<00:06:02.430> to<00:06:02.490> be<00:06:02.610> right<00:06:02.820> up<00:06:02.910> next<00:06:03.030> to<00:06:03.180> you<00:06:03.300> they

going to be right up next to you they

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.300 
going to be right up next to you they
all<00:06:03.570> have<00:06:03.690> spawned<00:06:03.990> in<00:06:04.230> so<00:06:04.650> you'll<00:06:04.770> be<00:06:04.890> fine<00:06:05.100> as

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
all have spawned in so you'll be fine as

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.620 
all have spawned in so you'll be fine as
long<00:06:05.370> as<00:06:05.460> you<00:06:05.580> don't<00:06:05.670> try<00:06:05.850> to<00:06:05.910> run<00:06:06.150> past<00:06:06.390> the

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
zombies because if you get so far away

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.380 
zombies because if you get so far away
from<00:06:08.160> the<00:06:08.250> zombies<00:06:08.550> will<00:06:08.640> start<00:06:08.820> spawning<00:06:09.150> in

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
from the zombies will start spawning in

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.940 
from the zombies will start spawning in
again<00:06:09.630> and<00:06:09.990> that's<00:06:10.140> not<00:06:10.290> something<00:06:10.440> you<00:06:10.650> want

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
again and that's not something you want

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.020 
again and that's not something you want
you<00:06:11.010> don't<00:06:11.160> want<00:06:11.250> the<00:06:11.430> zombies<00:06:11.760> that<00:06:11.850> start

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
you don't want the zombies that start

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.910 
you don't want the zombies that start
spawning<00:06:12.300> in<00:06:12.630> so<00:06:12.870> you<00:06:13.200> kind<00:06:13.410> of<00:06:13.500> want<00:06:13.560> to<00:06:13.740> get

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
spawning in so you kind of want to get

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.410 
spawning in so you kind of want to get
nice<00:06:14.160> and<00:06:14.190> slow<00:06:14.610> make<00:06:14.820> sure<00:06:14.910> the<00:06:15.030> zombies<00:06:15.300> are

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
nice and slow make sure the zombies are

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.400 
nice and slow make sure the zombies are
sort<00:06:15.690> of<00:06:15.750> behind<00:06:16.050> you

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
sort of behind you

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.660 
sort of behind you
and<00:06:16.560> just<00:06:16.860> run<00:06:16.980> straight<00:06:17.220> through<00:06:17.280> this<00:06:17.460> and

and just run straight through this and
yet<00:06:17.820> don't<00:06:17.970> stop<00:06:18.240> into<00:06:18.450> because<00:06:18.690> a<00:06:18.720> zombie

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
yet don't stop into because a zombie

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.270 
yet don't stop into because a zombie
might<00:06:19.200> spawn<00:06:19.440> on<00:06:19.590> you<00:06:19.620> that's<00:06:19.890> not<00:06:20.070> really

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
might spawn on you that's not really

might spawn on you that's not really
something<00:06:20.460> you<00:06:20.580> want<00:06:20.850> so<00:06:21.180> this<00:06:21.270> area's<00:06:21.540> very

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
you really might want to be careful

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.530 
you really might want to be careful
