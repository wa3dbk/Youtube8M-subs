spread all my lashes out because it

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:53.889 
spread all my lashes out because it
really<00:01:51.409> does<00:01:51.619> extend<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:52.999> much<00:01:53.299> if<00:01:53.569> you<00:01:53.600> just

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
really does extend so much if you just

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.800 
really does extend so much if you just
put<00:01:54.109> them<00:01:54.319> on<00:01:54.499> the<00:01:54.679> tips<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.600> spread<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.719> out

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
put them on the tips and spread it out

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.879 
put them on the tips and spread it out
as<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:57.439> go<00:01:57.590> along<00:01:59.079> see<00:02:00.079> how<00:02:00.200> much<00:02:00.319> length<00:02:00.649> I'm

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:00.889 
as you go along see how much length I'm

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:03.719 
as you go along see how much length I'm
getting<00:02:01.219> just<00:02:01.399> by<00:02:01.670> applying<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.869> primer

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
getting just by applying the primer

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.279 
getting just by applying the primer
that's<00:02:04.729> why<00:02:04.849> I<00:02:04.909> feel<00:02:05.090> like<00:02:05.149> you<00:02:06.109> know<00:02:06.229> you

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
that's why I feel like you know you

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.800 
that's why I feel like you know you
don't<00:02:06.499> really<00:02:06.709> need<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:07.009> mascara<00:02:07.939> but<00:02:08.270> it<00:02:08.539> still

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
don't really need a mascara but it still

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.080 
don't really need a mascara but it still
works<00:02:09.110> well<00:02:09.500> with<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:09.860> mascara<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.910> could

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
works well with the mascara you could

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:19.350 
works well with the mascara you could
use<00:02:11.209> any<00:02:11.480> mascara<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.980> she<00:02:13.160> want<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.490> use

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.390 

so<00:02:20.360> that's<00:02:20.600> what<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.930> looks<00:02:20.960> like<00:02:21.320> just<00:02:22.250> with

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
so that's what it looks like just with

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.490 
so that's what it looks like just with
the<00:02:22.490> primer<00:02:22.760> I'm<00:02:23.420> going<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.810> use<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.110> forever

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
the primer I'm going to use the forever

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:36.200 
the primer I'm going to use the forever

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.589 

you
