hi<00:00:00.539> guys<00:00:00.780> in<00:00:01.110> today's<00:00:01.380> tutorial<00:00:01.770> I<00:00:02.220> want<00:00:02.429> to

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hi guys in today's tutorial I want to

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.749 
hi guys in today's tutorial I want to
show<00:00:02.669> you<00:00:02.850> how<00:00:03.120> you<00:00:03.179> can<00:00:03.419> build<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.780> full<00:00:04.290> FK<00:00:05.069> cow

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
show you how you can build a full FK cow

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.450 
show you how you can build a full FK cow
farm<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.319> kind<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.859> proof<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.250> concept

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
farm this is kind of a proof of concept

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.250 
farm this is kind of a proof of concept
that<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:08.849> developed<00:00:09.300> in<00:00:09.420> my<00:00:09.690> video<00:00:10.019> craft

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
that I developed in my video craft

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.070 
that I developed in my video craft
series<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.059> now<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.330> show<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.570> how<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:12.870> can

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
series and now to show you how you can

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.560 
series and now to show you how you can
build<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.410> yourself<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.309> let's<00:00:14.639> start<00:00:15.150> right

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
build it yourself so let's start right

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.160 
build it yourself so let's start right
away<00:00:16.310> so<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.340> would<00:00:17.640> start<00:00:18.060> with<00:00:18.210> our<00:00:18.630> cow

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
away so we would start with our cow

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.410 
away so we would start with our cow
holding<00:00:19.710> chamber<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.369> therefore<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.240> can

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
holding chamber and therefore you can

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.330 
holding chamber and therefore you can
just<00:00:21.720> place<00:00:22.020> any<00:00:22.320> kind<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.859> block<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.070> you

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
just place any kind of block that you

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.040 
just place any kind of block that you
like<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.699> would<00:00:23.880> use<00:00:24.029> glass<00:00:24.300> for<00:00:24.630> better<00:00:24.840> with

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
like I would use glass for better with

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.670 
like I would use glass for better with
ability<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.630> then<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:28.019> want<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.289> have<00:00:28.529> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
ability and then we want to have a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.460 
ability and then we want to have a
piston<00:00:29.490> here<00:00:29.789> facing<00:00:30.449> into<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:30.990> block<00:00:31.320> of

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
piston here facing into this block of

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.920 
piston here facing into this block of
our<00:00:31.650> holding<00:00:32.009> chamber<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.270> later<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.660> to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
our holding chamber this is later on to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.830 
our holding chamber this is later on to
drop<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> cows<00:00:34.469> out<00:00:34.770> then<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.940> surround<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
drop the cows out then just surround the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.190 
drop the cows out then just surround the
thing<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:38.450> dispenser<00:00:39.450> right<00:00:39.629> here<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.140> is

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
thing and a dispenser right here this is

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.639 
thing and a dispenser right here this is
for<00:00:40.530> getting<00:00:40.710> water<00:00:41.100> into<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:42.649> holding

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
for getting water into this holding

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.119 
for getting water into this holding
chamber<00:00:43.879> then<00:00:44.879> more<00:00:45.329> surroundings<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.829> this

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
chamber then more surroundings like this

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.860 
chamber then more surroundings like this
and<00:00:48.410> then<00:00:49.410> back<00:00:49.890> here<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:51.059> need<00:00:51.360> two<00:00:51.840> more

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
and then back here we need two more

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.790 
and then back here we need two more
sticky<00:00:52.620> pistons<00:00:53.360> pushing<00:00:54.360> into<00:00:54.899> glass<00:00:55.320> blocks

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
sticky pistons pushing into glass blocks

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.790 
sticky pistons pushing into glass blocks
so<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.449> divide<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.350> cows<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.710> are

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
so we can divide the cows that are

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.740 
so we can divide the cows that are
standing<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.219> here<00:00:59.399> by<00:00:59.640> two<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.300> dropping

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
standing in here by two and dropping

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.630 
standing in here by two and dropping
half<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.140> them<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.530> through<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.250> block<00:01:04.640> next

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
half of them out through this block next

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.280 
half of them out through this block next
we<00:01:05.790> want<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.000> take<00:01:06.180> care<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.900> we<00:01:07.080> always

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
we want to take care of that we always

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.219 
we want to take care of that we always
have<00:01:07.650> enough<00:01:08.159> wheat<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.510> standing<00:01:09.869> on

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
have enough wheat we will be standing on

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.910 
have enough wheat we will be standing on
this<00:01:10.590> end<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.790> farm<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:13.200> place<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
this end of the farm so we just place a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.100 
this end of the farm so we just place a
block<00:01:14.850> where<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.270> are<00:01:15.330> standing<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.900> right

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
block where we are standing on right

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.570 
block where we are standing on right
here<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.650> were<00:01:16.740> facing<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.340> direction

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
here we were facing to this direction

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.230 
here we were facing to this direction
and<00:01:19.189> then<00:01:20.189> we're<00:01:20.520> place<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.689> drop<00:01:22.409> us<00:01:23.240> like

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and then we're place to drop us like

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.140 
and then we're place to drop us like
this<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.900> replace<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.009> with<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.490> hopper<00:01:26.939> so

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
this and replace this with a hopper so

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.719 
this and replace this with a hopper so
the<00:01:27.299> stuff<00:01:27.540> gets<00:01:27.810> picked<00:01:28.170> up<00:01:28.320> again<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.890> then

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the stuff gets picked up again and then

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.789 
the stuff gets picked up again and then
we<00:01:29.939> need<00:01:30.090> some<00:01:30.360> surroundings<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.560> our

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
we need some surroundings here so our

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.130 
we need some surroundings here so our
wheat<00:01:32.250> doesn't<00:01:32.579> drop<00:01:32.820> out<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.930> just

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
wheat doesn't drop out so we can just

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.929 
wheat doesn't drop out so we can just
play<00:01:34.439> some<00:01:34.710> blocks<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.310> side<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.759> over

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
play some blocks on this side and over

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.319 
play some blocks on this side and over
here<00:01:36.390> we<00:01:36.840> will<00:01:37.020> place<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.619> door<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.090> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
here we will place a door to get in and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.399 
here we will place a door to get in and
out<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:40.250> like<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.909> now<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.840> need<00:01:43.170> a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
out just like this and now we need a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.600 
out just like this and now we need a
clock<00:01:44.100> down<00:01:44.430> below<00:01:45.799> therefore<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:47.070> will<00:01:47.250> place

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
clock down below therefore we will place

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.520 
clock down below therefore we will place
a<00:01:47.939> block<00:01:48.600> right<00:01:49.640> next<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.030> lower<00:01:51.530> dropper

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
a block right next to the lower dropper

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.859 
a block right next to the lower dropper
here<00:01:52.799> place<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> redstone<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:54.060> top<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
here place a redstone on top then a

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.130 
here place a redstone on top then a
block<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:55.470> redstone<00:01:56.189> torch<00:01:56.610> then<00:01:57.509> we<00:01:57.899> will

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
block here redstone torch then we will

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.920 
block here redstone torch then we will
go<00:01:58.350> down<00:01:59.250> let's<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:02.930> place

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
go down let's do it like this and place

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.139 
go down let's do it like this and place
a<00:02:04.200> redstone<00:02:04.680> here<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.790> grab<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
a redstone here so we can grab the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.109 
a redstone here so we can grab the
signal<00:02:06.829> then<00:02:07.829> we<00:02:07.979> will<00:02:08.190> go<00:02:08.369> into<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.759> few

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
signal then we will go into a few

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.479 
signal then we will go into a few
repeaters<00:02:09.690> it's<00:02:10.020> three<00:02:10.590> on<00:02:10.619> four<00:02:11.009> delay<00:02:11.250> in

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
repeaters it's three on four delay in

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.700 
repeaters it's three on four delay in
total

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
total

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.820 
total
a<00:02:12.770> block<00:02:13.400> here<00:02:13.760> then<00:02:14.720> another<00:02:15.140> repeater<00:02:15.620> the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
a block here then another repeater the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.000 
a block here then another repeater the
third<00:02:16.070> one<00:02:16.310> right<00:02:16.580> here<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.330> at<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.590> redstone

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
third one right here and at a redstone

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.310 
third one right here and at a redstone
here<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.970> we<00:02:20.120> start<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.570> clock<00:02:20.780> so<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.050> can

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
here that we start the clock so you can

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.220 
here that we start the clock so you can
fill<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.860> wheat<00:02:22.430> into<00:02:22.880> these<00:02:23.110> droppers<00:02:24.110> if

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
fill and wheat into these droppers if

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.140 
fill and wheat into these droppers if
you<00:02:24.350> have<00:02:24.440> more<00:02:24.650> wheat<00:02:24.890> than<00:02:24.920> slots<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
you have more wheat than slots and the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.850 
you have more wheat than slots and the
droppers<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.840> can<00:02:26.990> just<00:02:27.170> place<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.470> hopper

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
droppers you can just place a hopper

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.820 
droppers you can just place a hopper
with<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.040> chest<00:02:28.340> on<00:02:28.460> top<00:02:28.490> here<00:02:28.910> on<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.150> side<00:02:29.420> and

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
with a chest on top here on the side and

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.350 
with a chest on top here on the side and
now<00:02:30.830> we<00:02:30.890> want<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.190> stop<00:02:31.490> this<00:02:31.700> clock<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.120> course

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
now we want to stop this clock of course

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.510 
now we want to stop this clock of course
so<00:02:32.570> we<00:02:32.690> will<00:02:32.810> just<00:02:32.990> place<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.290> block<00:02:33.740> here<00:02:34.040> grab

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
so we will just place a block here grab

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.370 
so we will just place a block here grab
ourselves<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:35.420> lever<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:37.120> activate<00:02:38.120> its<00:02:39.080> so

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
ourselves a lever and activate its so

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.990 
ourselves a lever and activate its so
that<00:02:39.620> will<00:02:39.830> stop<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.310> clock<00:02:40.430> for<00:02:40.670> us<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:40.910> we

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
that will stop the clock for us so we

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.800 
that will stop the clock for us so we
can<00:02:41.120> exit<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.510> from<00:02:42.110> in<00:02:42.350> here<00:02:42.830> easily<00:02:43.810> from

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
can exit it from in here easily from

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.900 
can exit it from in here easily from
time<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.200> time<00:02:45.230> we<00:02:45.620> want<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:45.950> activate<00:02:46.460> the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
time to time we want to activate the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.570 
time to time we want to activate the
dispenser<00:02:47.570> down<00:02:47.750> here<00:02:47.990> which<00:02:48.200> we<00:02:48.440> get<00:02:48.710> a<00:02:48.920> water

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
dispenser down here which we get a water

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.810 
dispenser down here which we get a water
bucket<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.800> cows<00:02:52.040> are<00:02:52.310> jumping<00:02:52.610> up<00:02:52.700> and

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
bucket so the cows are jumping up and

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.580 
bucket so the cows are jumping up and
down<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.240> we<00:02:53.360> can<00:02:53.570> hold<00:02:53.930> right<00:02:54.110> click<00:02:54.170> in<00:02:54.440> this

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
down and we can hold right click in this

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.340 
down and we can hold right click in this
direction<00:02:54.770> without<00:02:55.520> wasting<00:02:56.390> we<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.870> sing<00:02:57.260> a

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
direction without wasting we to a sing a

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.490 
direction without wasting we to a sing a
cow<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.100> not<00:02:59.000> having<00:02:59.210> a<00:02:59.390> partner<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.350> we

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
cow that is not having a partner so we

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.530 
cow that is not having a partner so we
only<00:03:00.680> want<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:01.130> cows<00:03:01.490> to<00:03:01.730> jump<00:03:01.910> out<00:03:02.060> from<00:03:02.240> time

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
only want the cows to jump out from time

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.600 
only want the cows to jump out from time
to<00:03:02.690> time<00:03:02.720> therefore<00:03:03.200> we<00:03:03.590> have<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:04.040> dispenser

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
to time therefore we have the dispenser

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.240 
to time therefore we have the dispenser
there<00:03:04.790> was<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.090> water<00:03:05.210> bucket<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:05.920> we<00:03:06.920> place

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
there was the water bucket and we place

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.950 
there was the water bucket and we place
in<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.550> circuit<00:03:07.940> which<00:03:08.090> will<00:03:08.330> count<00:03:08.690> our

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
in the circuit which will count our

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.470 
in the circuit which will count our
pulses<00:03:09.560> here<00:03:09.770> so<00:03:10.400> we'll<00:03:10.580> just<00:03:10.760> place<00:03:11.120> a

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
pulses here so we'll just place a

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.760 
pulses here so we'll just place a
dropper<00:03:12.320> next<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.250> this<00:03:13.400> block<00:03:13.820> a<00:03:14.770> hopper

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
dropper next to this block a hopper

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.130 
dropper next to this block a hopper
facing<00:03:16.040> into<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:18.310> then<00:03:19.310> we<00:03:19.580> will<00:03:19.960> have<00:03:20.960> a

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
facing into it and then we will have a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.660 
facing into it and then we will have a
little<00:03:21.560> circuit<00:03:22.340> here

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
little circuit here

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.610 
little circuit here
which<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:23.060> actually<00:03:23.270> one<00:03:23.630> of<00:03:23.750> my<00:03:23.960> tutorials

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
which is actually one of my tutorials

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.660 
which is actually one of my tutorials
it's<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.640> pulse<00:03:26.000> counter<00:03:26.690> so<00:03:27.560> therefore<00:03:28.130> we

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
it's the pulse counter so therefore we

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.060 
it's the pulse counter so therefore we
want<00:03:28.820> to<00:03:28.970> have<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.440> repeater<00:03:30.440> facing<00:03:30.710> into<00:03:31.040> the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
want to have a repeater facing into the

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.020 
want to have a repeater facing into the
block<00:03:31.370> underneath<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:32.180> hopper<00:03:32.810> there<00:03:32.990> then<00:03:33.650> a

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
block underneath the hopper there then a

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.510 
block underneath the hopper there then a
comparator<00:03:35.030> coming<00:03:35.420> out<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.950> dropper

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
comparator coming out of the dropper

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.720 
comparator coming out of the dropper
then<00:03:40.510> blocks<00:03:41.510> like<00:03:42.050> this<00:03:42.770> was<00:03:43.100> a<00:03:43.340> redstone

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
then blocks like this was a redstone

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.310 
then blocks like this was a redstone
here<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:44.120> get<00:03:44.240> the<00:03:44.360> signal<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.930> repeater

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
here to get the signal to the repeater

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.700 
here to get the signal to the repeater
then<00:03:46.220> another<00:03:46.820> block<00:03:47.090> on<00:03:47.210> top<00:03:47.450> of<00:03:47.600> here<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.170> a

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
then another block on top of here and a

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.500 
then another block on top of here and a
comparator<00:03:49.310> facing<00:03:49.760> out<00:03:49.880> of<00:03:50.000> there<00:03:50.270> a

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
comparator facing out of there a

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.370 
comparator facing out of there a
redstone<00:03:51.410> torch<00:03:51.560> on<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.400> side<00:03:52.730> here<00:03:53.290> given<00:03:54.290> a

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
redstone torch on the side here given a

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.170 
redstone torch on the side here given a
signal<00:03:54.590> into<00:03:55.130> this<00:03:56.230> comparator<00:03:57.230> then<00:03:57.550> a<00:03:58.550> block

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
signal into this comparator then a block

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.280 
signal into this comparator then a block
in<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.870> end<00:04:00.050> another<00:04:00.500> redstone<00:04:01.010> torch<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:02.290> a

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
in the end another redstone torch and a

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.480 
in the end another redstone torch and a
block<00:04:04.040> on<00:04:04.220> top<00:04:04.430> with<00:04:04.730> a<00:04:04.970> redstone<00:04:05.300> here<00:04:05.990> and

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
block on top with a redstone here and

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.990 
block on top with a redstone here and
that<00:04:07.490> is<00:04:07.640> our<00:04:07.820> parts<00:04:08.210> counter<00:04:08.630> so<00:04:08.930> now<00:04:09.760> we<00:04:10.760> can

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
that is our parts counter so now we can

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.710 
that is our parts counter so now we can
connect<00:04:11.330> it<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:13.120> dispenser<00:04:14.120> here<00:04:14.330> and

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
connect it to the dispenser here and

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.300 
connect it to the dispenser here and
that's<00:04:14.990> pretty<00:04:15.200> simple<00:04:15.410> replace<00:04:15.920> this<00:04:16.130> block

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
that's pretty simple replace this block

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.479 
that's pretty simple replace this block
with<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.580> solid<00:04:17.000> block<00:04:17.210> and<00:04:17.980> then<00:04:18.980> we'll<00:04:19.160> have

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
with a solid block and then we'll have

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.440 
with a solid block and then we'll have
some<00:04:19.940> blocks<00:04:20.239> like<00:04:20.570> this<00:04:20.810> a<00:04:21.160> repeater<00:04:22.450> right

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
some blocks like this a repeater right

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.570 
some blocks like this a repeater right
here<00:04:23.870> on<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.230> second<00:04:24.560> delay<00:04:24.800> repeater<00:04:25.280> there

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
here on the second delay repeater there

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.110 
here on the second delay repeater there
on

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
on

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.680 
on
Namie<00:04:26.300> delay<00:04:26.630> and<00:04:26.930> a<00:04:27.199> redstone<00:04:27.940> dust<00:04:28.940> right

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
Namie delay and a redstone dust right

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.640 
Namie delay and a redstone dust right
here<00:04:29.930> so<00:04:30.050> we<00:04:30.169> don't<00:04:30.290> power<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:32.440> piston<00:04:33.440> sia

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
here so we don't power the piston sia

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.590 
here so we don't power the piston sia
and<00:04:33.919> you<00:04:34.310> can<00:04:34.520> replace<00:04:34.880> it<00:04:35.060> one<00:04:35.180> more<00:04:35.300> time<00:04:35.389> so

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
and you can replace it one more time so

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.250 
and you can replace it one more time so
the<00:04:35.720> waters<00:04:36.050> off<00:04:36.260> again<00:04:37.630> now<00:04:38.630> we<00:04:38.690> will<00:04:38.990> place

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
the waters off again now we will place

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.159 
the waters off again now we will place
32<00:04:40.190> items<00:04:40.610> in<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:41.360> stopper<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:42.139> set<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:44.169> path

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
32 items in the stopper to set the path

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.580 
32 items in the stopper to set the path
counter<00:04:45.500> so<00:04:45.650> every<00:04:45.979> 32<00:04:46.580> items<00:04:46.820> this<00:04:47.389> one<00:04:47.660> will

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
counter so every 32 items this one will

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.450 
counter so every 32 items this one will
change<00:04:49.100> its<00:04:49.850> state<00:04:50.389> and<00:04:51.070> we're<00:04:52.070> talking<00:04:52.400> the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
change its state and we're talking the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.820 
change its state and we're talking the
water<00:04:52.669> maybe<00:04:52.910> I<00:04:53.000> can<00:04:53.180> turn<00:04:53.360> it<00:04:53.479> on<00:04:53.600> so<00:04:54.169> we<00:04:54.470> will

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
water maybe I can turn it on so we will

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.770 
water maybe I can turn it on so we will
see<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.340> in<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.580> moment<00:04:55.910> in<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.090> meantime<00:04:56.330> we

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
see it in a moment in the meantime we

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.779 
see it in a moment in the meantime we
will<00:04:56.930> take<00:04:57.139> care<00:04:57.440> of<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:58.040> circuit<00:04:59.020> which<00:05:00.020> is

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
will take care of the circuit which is

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.390 
will take care of the circuit which is
controlling<00:05:01.789> the<00:05:02.120> Pistons<00:05:02.660> and<00:05:03.400> that's

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
controlling the Pistons and that's

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.520 
controlling the Pistons and that's
pretty<00:05:04.729> easy<00:05:05.030> we<00:05:05.419> can<00:05:05.660> just<00:05:05.930> knock<00:05:06.199> out<00:05:06.320> these

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
pretty easy we can just knock out these

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.760 
pretty easy we can just knock out these
corner<00:05:06.919> blocks<00:05:07.130> here<00:05:07.370> again<00:05:07.699> and<00:05:08.380> place<00:05:09.380> down

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
corner blocks here again and place down

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.540 
corner blocks here again and place down
a<00:05:10.300> block<00:05:11.300> right<00:05:11.539> here<00:05:11.770> this<00:05:12.770> one<00:05:13.010> will<00:05:13.190> have<00:05:13.340> a

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
a block right here this one will have a

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.090 
a block right here this one will have a
redstone<00:05:14.150> torch<00:05:14.300> on<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:14.900> side<00:05:15.530> which<00:05:15.919> will

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
redstone torch on the side which will

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.950 
redstone torch on the side which will
power<00:05:16.400> then<00:05:16.729> and<00:05:17.030> redstone<00:05:17.510> here<00:05:17.539> and<00:05:18.850> then

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
power then and redstone here and then

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.590 
power then and redstone here and then
from<00:05:20.960> the<00:05:21.110> back<00:05:21.289> we<00:05:21.560> will<00:05:21.590> I<00:05:22.100> have<00:05:22.850> to<00:05:23.060> replace

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
from the back we will I have to replace

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.370 
from the back we will I have to replace
this<00:05:23.930> block<00:05:24.199> to<00:05:24.320> a<00:05:24.620> repeater<00:05:25.520> here<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:26.690> this

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
this block to a repeater here and this

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.860 
this block to a repeater here and this
will<00:05:27.680> power<00:05:28.610> our<00:05:30.430> Pistons<00:05:31.430> on<00:05:31.700> top<00:05:32.000> of<00:05:32.240> here<00:05:32.570> so

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
will power our Pistons on top of here so

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.339 
will power our Pistons on top of here so
just<00:05:33.110> place<00:05:33.560> redstone<00:05:33.800> on<00:05:34.190> top<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:34.990> then<00:05:35.990> as

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:36.349 
just place redstone on top and then as

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:42.279 
just place redstone on top and then as
well<00:05:36.680> as<00:05:36.800> that<00:05:38.020> we<00:05:39.020> will<00:05:39.289> have<00:05:39.620> I<00:05:41.169> need<00:05:42.169> to

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
well as that we will have I need to

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.279 
well as that we will have I need to
place<00:05:42.590> that<00:05:42.830> one<00:05:43.669> more<00:05:43.820> down<00:05:43.970> so<00:05:44.539> we<00:05:44.690> can<00:05:44.930> place

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
place that one more down so we can place

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.010 
place that one more down so we can place
another<00:05:45.650> line<00:05:45.919> here<00:05:45.950> get<00:05:46.910> this<00:05:47.060> down<00:05:47.360> and<00:05:47.599> have

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
another line here get this down and have

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.600 
another line here get this down and have
the<00:05:48.200> repeater<00:05:48.500> on<00:05:48.680> for<00:05:48.919> delay<00:05:49.130> and<00:05:49.310> if<00:05:49.460> we

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
the repeater on for delay and if we

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.860 
the repeater on for delay and if we
place<00:05:49.910> a<00:05:50.120> stone<00:05:50.630> button<00:05:51.260> on<00:05:51.470> the<00:05:51.590> front<00:05:51.830> here

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
place a stone button on the front here

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.290 
place a stone button on the front here
we<00:05:53.870> can<00:05:54.080> just<00:05:54.490> target<00:05:55.490> this<00:05:55.760> and<00:05:56.000> these

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
we can just target this and these

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.120 
we can just target this and these
persons<00:05:56.750> were<00:05:56.960> herd<00:05:57.349> the<00:05:57.530> cows<00:05:57.740> in<00:05:57.919> place

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
persons were herd the cows in place

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.800 
persons were herd the cows in place
they're<00:05:58.400> standing<00:05:58.639> on<00:05:58.729> this<00:05:58.880> side<00:05:59.120> and<00:05:59.389> the

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
they're standing on this side and the

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.200 
they're standing on this side and the
cows<00:06:00.020> will<00:06:00.229> just<00:06:00.440> fall<00:06:00.740> down<00:06:00.979> on<00:06:01.310> this<00:06:01.610> side<00:06:01.940> so

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
cows will just fall down on this side so

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.000 
cows will just fall down on this side so
we<00:06:02.240> have<00:06:02.510> half<00:06:02.750> of<00:06:02.870> the<00:06:03.020> cow<00:06:03.199> still<00:06:03.530> in<00:06:03.770> there

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
we have half of the cow still in there

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.420 
we have half of the cow still in there
and<00:06:05.110> that's<00:06:06.110> already<00:06:06.410> it<00:06:06.620> let<00:06:07.099> me<00:06:07.130> show<00:06:07.220> you

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
and that's already it let me show you

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.659 
and that's already it let me show you
this<00:06:07.940> in<00:06:08.240> action<00:06:08.389> one<00:06:08.780> more<00:06:08.960> time<00:06:09.400> so<00:06:10.400> I<00:06:10.430> have

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
this in action one more time so I have

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.420 
this in action one more time so I have
my<00:06:10.849> inventory<00:06:11.120> blocked<00:06:11.780> with<00:06:12.349> blocks<00:06:13.250> and

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
my inventory blocked with blocks and

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.909 
my inventory blocked with blocks and
only<00:06:13.639> the<00:06:13.760> first<00:06:13.940> slot<00:06:14.240> has<00:06:14.630> wheat<00:06:15.440> in<00:06:15.620> it<00:06:15.740> and

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
only the first slot has wheat in it and

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.460 
only the first slot has wheat in it and
when<00:06:16.460> I<00:06:16.490> have<00:06:16.760> the<00:06:17.419> first<00:06:17.660> or<00:06:17.870> completely<00:06:18.320> fed

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
when I have the first or completely fed

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.710 
when I have the first or completely fed
up<00:06:18.500> with<00:06:18.740> wheat<00:06:19.039> the<00:06:19.970> weed<00:06:20.090> will<00:06:20.270> just<00:06:20.539> get

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
up with wheat the weed will just get

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.510 
up with wheat the weed will just get
back<00:06:20.960> into<00:06:21.110> the<00:06:21.289> system<00:06:21.650> and<00:06:21.740> I<00:06:21.860> can<00:06:22.070> just<00:06:22.250> hold

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
back into the system and I can just hold

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.730 
back into the system and I can just hold
right<00:06:22.760> click<00:06:22.820> onto<00:06:23.810> the<00:06:23.960> block<00:06:24.199> on<00:06:24.440> the<00:06:24.590> other

side and as soon as the system triggers

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.800 
side and as soon as the system triggers
I<00:06:28.460> will<00:06:28.760> feed<00:06:29.030> the<00:06:29.240> cows<00:06:29.479> with<00:06:30.349> the<00:06:30.650> wheat<00:06:30.830> and

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
I will feed the cows with the wheat and

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.560 
I will feed the cows with the wheat and
we<00:06:32.810> will<00:06:32.930> get<00:06:33.080> baby<00:06:33.740> cows<00:06:34.070> so<00:06:34.610> let's<00:06:35.120> watch
