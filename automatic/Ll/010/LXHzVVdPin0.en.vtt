ones slim this is something that I've

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.369 
ones slim this is something that I've
been<00:00:14.639> thinking<00:00:15.269> about<00:00:15.389> for<00:00:15.839> quite<00:00:16.020> some<00:00:16.350> time

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
been thinking about for quite some time

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.779 
been thinking about for quite some time
and<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.640> made<00:00:17.880> sort<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:19.010> concept<00:00:20.010> puzzle<00:00:20.609> I

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
and I made sort of a concept puzzle I

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.900 
and I made sort of a concept puzzle I
guess<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.330> while<00:00:21.900> ago<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:23.250> thing<00:00:23.460> became

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
guess a while ago and this thing became

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.290 
guess a while ago and this thing became
really<00:00:24.300> popular<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.140> decided<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.970> finish<00:00:26.970> it

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
really popular so I decided to finish it

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.830 
really popular so I decided to finish it
make<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> new<00:00:28.199> one<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.730> you<00:00:29.730> know<00:00:29.880> shorten<00:00:30.539> both

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
make a new one and you know shorten both

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.910 
make a new one and you know shorten both
of<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> sides<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:32.090> make<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.239> thing<00:00:33.920> now

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
of the sides and make this thing now

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.680 
of the sides and make this thing now
basically<00:00:35.219> what<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.540> normal

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
basically what it is is it a normal

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.410 
basically what it is is it a normal
square<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.500> works<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.100> same<00:00:38.219> way<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:39.030> any

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
square one it works the same way as any

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.860 
square one it works the same way as any
other<00:00:39.570> square<00:00:40.079> one<00:00:40.579> except<00:00:41.579> I've<00:00:41.820> cut<00:00:42.629> down

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
other square one except I've cut down

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.529 
other square one except I've cut down
the<00:00:43.079> top<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.559> bottom<00:00:43.770> layers<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.120> much

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
the top and bottom layers that it's much

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.920 
the top and bottom layers that it's much
much<00:00:45.989> shorter<00:00:46.050> than<00:00:46.820> a<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.600> normal

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
much shorter than a you know normal

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.630 
much shorter than a you know normal
square<00:00:49.079> one<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.440> basically<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.309> idea<00:00:50.340> is

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
square one and basically the idea is

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.490 
square one and basically the idea is
this<00:00:51.090> will<00:00:51.300> fit<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.600> your<00:00:51.690> pocket<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.230> lot

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
this will fit in your pocket a lot

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.979 
this will fit in your pocket a lot
easier<00:00:52.710> than<00:00:53.120> you<00:00:54.120> know<00:00:54.559> this<00:00:55.559> thing<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.960> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
easier than you know this thing so I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.729 
easier than you know this thing so I
spent<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.739> lot<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.949> time<00:01:00.170> shaping<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.379> pieces

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
spent a lot of time shaping the pieces

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.000 
spent a lot of time shaping the pieces
and<00:01:02.100> sending<00:01:02.969> them<00:01:03.059> down<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:03.690> nicely<00:01:04.010> so

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and sending them down really nicely so

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.840 
and sending them down really nicely so
that<00:01:05.810> they<00:01:06.810> look<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.140> lot<00:01:07.290> better<00:01:07.470> than<00:01:07.850> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that they look a lot better than the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.719 
that they look a lot better than the
other<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.860> I'm<00:01:10.860> pretty<00:01:11.280> pleased<00:01:11.700> with

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
other one and I'm pretty pleased with

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.480 
other one and I'm pretty pleased with
the<00:01:12.060> results<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:13.290> caps<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.950> put<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.310> these

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the results the caps that I put on these

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.719 
the results the caps that I put on these
pieces<00:01:14.790> are<00:01:15.210> not<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.680> caps<00:01:16.950> recycled<00:01:17.610> from

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
pieces are not the caps recycled from

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.910 
pieces are not the caps recycled from
the<00:01:17.909> original<00:01:18.299> puzzle<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.840> threw<00:01:19.710> those<00:01:19.830> away

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the original puzzle I threw those away

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.700 
the original puzzle I threw those away
and<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.850> cap<00:01:21.420> these<00:01:21.659> using<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.990> same<00:01:22.200> method<00:01:22.590> as

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
and I cap these using the same method as

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.060 
and I cap these using the same method as
my<00:01:23.189> octagon<00:01:24.119> barrel<00:01:24.210> guide<00:01:24.840> describes<00:01:25.530> and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
my octagon barrel guide describes and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.429 
my octagon barrel guide describes and
the<00:01:27.060> result<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:28.259> really<00:01:28.950> nice<00:01:30.140> now<00:01:31.140> if

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the result is really really nice now if

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.469 
the result is really really nice now if
there<00:01:31.560> was<00:01:31.650> one<00:01:31.770> thing<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:33.090> kind<00:01:33.420> of

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
there was one thing I one kind of

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.940 
there was one thing I one kind of
complaint<00:01:33.900> I'd<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.170> about<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.500> puzzle<00:01:34.829> is

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
complaint I'd have about this puzzle is

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.050 
complaint I'd have about this puzzle is
I<00:01:35.220> didn't<00:01:35.400> really<00:01:35.490> spend<00:01:35.759> too<00:01:35.909> much<00:01:36.000> time

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
I didn't really spend too much time

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.260 
I didn't really spend too much time
cutting<00:01:36.600> these<00:01:37.040> stickers<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.759> doesn't

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
cutting these stickers and it doesn't

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.050 
cutting these stickers and it doesn't
look<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.479> great<00:01:40.280> but<00:01:41.280> maybe<00:01:41.549> I'll<00:01:41.729> come<00:01:41.880> back

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
look that great but maybe I'll come back

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.030 
look that great but maybe I'll come back
and<00:01:42.560> make<00:01:43.560> nicer<00:01:43.950> stickers<00:01:44.399> later<00:01:45.950> aside<00:01:46.950> from

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
and make nicer stickers later aside from

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.560 
and make nicer stickers later aside from
that<00:01:47.130> though<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.700> think<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.030> turned<00:01:48.240> out<00:01:48.360> just

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
that though I think it turned out just

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.219 
that though I think it turned out just
awesome<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.520> I'm<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:50.549> really<00:01:51.229> pleased

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
awesome and I'm really really pleased

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.209 
awesome and I'm really really pleased
with<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.470> results<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:54.740> guess<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.070> show

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
with the results I guess just to show

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.709 
with the results I guess just to show
you<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.670> fully<00:01:56.909> functional<00:01:57.180> I'll

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
you that it is fully functional I'll

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.389 
you that it is fully functional I'll
scramble<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.229> up<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.409> little<00:01:58.530> bit<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.950> try<00:01:59.340> to

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
scramble it up a little bit and try to

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.420 
scramble it up a little bit and try to
do<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> soul<00:01:59.880> now<00:02:00.780> i<00:02:00.840> haven't<00:02:01.079> sold<00:02:01.619> square<00:02:02.250> one

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
do a soul now i haven't sold square one

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.630 
do a soul now i haven't sold square one
really<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.590> yeah<00:02:04.590> seven<00:02:05.130> months<00:02:05.460> or<00:02:05.579> something

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
really in yeah seven months or something

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.529 
really in yeah seven months or something
so<00:02:06.210> i<00:02:06.479> won't<00:02:07.229> be<00:02:07.320> very<00:02:07.680> fast<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.759> was<00:02:09.179> pretty

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
so i won't be very fast I was pretty

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.150 
so i won't be very fast I was pretty
good<00:02:09.690> at<00:02:09.840> square<00:02:10.200> one<00:02:10.349> at<00:02:10.470> one<00:02:10.649> point<00:02:10.860> there

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
good at square one at one point there

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:33.840 
good at square one at one point there
but

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:53.980 

ok

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990
