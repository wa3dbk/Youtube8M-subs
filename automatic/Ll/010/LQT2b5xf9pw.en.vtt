 10 reasons to eliminate milk and cheese 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.090
 1 dairy products destroy bones 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.720
 the countries in the world where more milk is drunk have more osteoporosis and fractures 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.059
 of the basin 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.779
 hand in hand with the increase in the consumption of dairy milk and calcium bar 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.279
 risk factors for osteoporosis and bone fractures also increase 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.919
 high levels of sodium and animal protein give the body acidosis 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.349
 metabolic in practice the blood becomes cyto 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.559
 to compensate for this the body extracts minerals from the bones and including calcium 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.640
 precisely to exploit their great alkalizing effect and then eliminate them 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.770
 urine 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.490
 in summary, more milk and dairy products are assumed to have more losses or 6 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.610
 there are excellent vegetable sources of calcium that do not cause acidosis 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.860
 metabolic 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.890
 indeed they are alkalizing they help bone health 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.540

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.280
 the cabbage the other green leafy vegetables the sesame seeds the tofu themes 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.750
 with added calcium and plant milks and fortified fruit juices 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.080
 year adequate amount of calcium that meet the daily requirement 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.450
 the absolute most important factor for the health of moving bones 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.550
 to increase and maintain bone density it is necessary to put under tension 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.500
 bones regularly 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.140
 to increase mass and prevent osteoporosis, introduce workouts of 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.680
 resistance and some activities like walking I joking 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.409
 this factor is far more important than any component 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.250
 nutritional

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.640
 the box the main milk protein causes psychological dependence 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.909
 you have noticed that more cheese is eaten 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.520
 more if desired 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.730
 in the brain 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.450
 when drinking milk or eating cheese, the morphine case is formed 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.960
 these are similar or like substances that produce euphoria hey make you feel the 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.379
 need to ingest another milk bar cheese 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.650
 the only way to stop this cycle of addiction quit 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.179
 completely 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:18.439

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.629
 casein is a potent carcinogen 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.749
 the ducts colin campbell author of the china study in decades of research I have 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.200
 discovered that casein is a powerful cancer promoter 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.090
 dairy products produce high levels of saturated fat and cholesterol 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.549
 night causes atherosclerosis 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.439
 this leads to heart disease 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:43.759

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:47.799
 Vitamin D is also an important role in bone health 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.169
 regardless of the amount of calcium consumed 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:58.290
 air absorbing it the vitamin d is also the 70 97% of the population a 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:01.289
 insufficient or deficient vitamin D levels 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.759
 ask your doctor for a 25-hydroxyvitamin de se examination 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:13.089
 level turns out to be below 35 50 mg bar milliliters add one 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:17.699
 daily dose of sunlight takes just a few minutes in the central hours of the 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.379
 day without sunscreens 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.790
 if this does not improve your vitamin D levels you need a 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.149
 supplement 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:27.459

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.499
 we are the only beautiful species of another's lactation secretions 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:33.509
 species 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:38.149
 not that it is the only species that continues to drink milk after weaning 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.179
 night 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:43.829
 in addition to being unhealthy in itself to promote disease 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.639
 Dairy products are full of pesticide hormone antibiotics though 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:55.019
 from organic farming and steroids heavy metals and other toxins 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.639
 administered to the specimens to increase milk production 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.639

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.559
 70% of the world population is lactose intolerant 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.169
 the fact 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.409
 that most humans react with painful symptoms 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.439
 gastrointestinal consumption of dairy products shows that the human body 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.809
 it is not made for the consumption of milk and dairy products 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:24.759
 currently dieticians doctors push for the use of infima lactase and others 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.549
 medicines that relieve symptoms to ensure adequate intake of 

00:04:29.549 --> 00:04:31.129
 dairy products 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:36.349
 but if we have to force our body to accept something it doesn't want not 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:37.670
 it is perhaps a sign 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.009
 that there is something wrong
