of<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.740> album<00:02:07.130> I<00:02:07.189> thought<00:02:07.369> it<00:02:07.460> was<00:02:07.520> going<00:02:07.639> to

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
of the album I thought it was going to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.719 
of the album I thought it was going to
be<00:02:07.819> even<00:02:07.969> better<00:02:08.269> but<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.440> was<00:02:09.649> alright<00:02:10.369> like<00:02:10.700> I

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
be even better but it was alright like I

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.000 
be even better but it was alright like I

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
one of incorporated other artists better

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.569 
one of incorporated other artists better

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
there and I guess it's different than

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.629 
there and I guess it's different than
what<00:03:41.060> he<00:03:41.120> originally<00:03:41.239> thought<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:41.930> was<00:03:42.169> um<00:03:42.639> but

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
what he originally thought it was um but

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.250 
what he originally thought it was um but
yeah<00:03:43.849> just<00:03:44.239> not<00:03:44.540> I<00:03:44.599> thought<00:03:45.019> it<00:03:45.079> would<00:03:45.169> be

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
yeah just not I thought it would be

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.720
