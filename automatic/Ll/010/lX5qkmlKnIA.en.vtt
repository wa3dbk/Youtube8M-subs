00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.299
 congratulations is little or you made a 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.510
 election in the fourth summer his canelo 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:18.689
 different the trump himself said no 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:22.460
 I expected this kind of fighter no one would 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.539
 wait all be below the king is 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.789
 different not down the ring always 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.830
 we see things easier when you're 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.390
 up fighting with a fighter is 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.460
 different is no longer the same as being 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.800
 down the ring and say ah I can I 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.180
 this is what I think when you're 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.420
 above the ring is when you see 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.570
 the things 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.730
 and it brings lip and hard lip today so it's 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.239
 we were waiting for you this kind of 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.760
 Fight 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.430
 if I did wait for it if I did 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.039
 I hoped I knew this was a fighter 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.809
 very difficult but I always said it 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.269
 between among the harder I get 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.250
 put the I'm going to put it more between 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.629
 faster the I'll do more 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.390
 fast I will be winning round by round 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:07.130
 and so it was good 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:10.490
 this goes to the bar and the chef is very close 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.130
 of our obviously 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.189
 in my opinion today you graduate you leave 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.740
 the doubts that many people had mexico 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.210
 I think that if you had won the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.860
 title that if you had been supported 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.860
 too much today 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.630
 However 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.960
 why 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.780
 yang longing was signed on occasion of 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.360
 two organizations 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.900
 what would you like in the next six 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.320
 months face the best I said 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.430
 I'm ready for the best 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.200
 I think that's how I keep affirming it between 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.630
 more good is my best rival I'll 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.270
 do me but do not believe it and in the 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.770
 head as I have I have many for 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.350
 skin that I want is floyd 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.090
 mayweather is the best and if not then 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.830
 there are other rivals that already have 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.530
 practice with my team your 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.679
 had asked that floyd sign the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.530
 commitment to fight before floyd step 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.630
 but the living believes that everything will depend 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.660
 how is floyd going at the fair of 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.600
 May 4th, I do not know, I hope I hope 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.570
 go well this but we are with 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.160
 obviously with a warrior and you have to 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.850
 wait you have to wait and see what happens 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.850
 in that fight 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.500
 if I felt the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.590
 of the foot this I do not know if because it is a 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.810
 little bit weighed to the canvas the start is 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.920
 recharging me so much in me in my room 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.770
 tired 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.130
 but since hot and I could move 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.900
 well at some point 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.520
 perhaps the only moments were is 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.040
 this is round 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.770
 you had a bit this edge taken care of now 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.830
 this can arrive 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.680
 to policies to place not because I was 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.180
 moving the waist very well was throwing 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.620
 many blows but he always threw the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.740
 then it was easy to dodge the 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.990
 we have to 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.500
 and repeat the living Mexico with what 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.690

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.940

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.190

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.000
