hard to get stores on or anything like
that<00:00:59.719> so<00:01:00.719> pretty<00:01:01.320> early<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:02.010> knew<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.430> you

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
that so pretty early on we knew we you

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.359 
that so pretty early on we knew we you
know<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.180> war<00:01:03.390> wasn't<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.369> one

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
know this war wasn't going to be one

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.620 
know this war wasn't going to be one
that<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.580> had<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.850> worry<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.119> whole<00:01:06.330> lot<00:01:06.510> about

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
that we had to worry a whole lot about

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.630 
that we had to worry a whole lot about
we<00:01:06.930> had<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> still<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.680> our<00:01:07.799> thing<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.280> get<00:01:08.549> our

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
we had to still do our thing and get our

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.940 
we had to still do our thing and get our
taxi<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.330> our<00:01:09.420> stars<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.770> see

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
taxi and get our stars but you can see

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.859 
taxi and get our stars but you can see
they<00:01:11.130> they<00:01:11.580> used<00:01:11.760> half<00:01:12.000> their<00:01:12.210> attacks<00:01:12.540> I

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
they they used half their attacks I

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.070 
they they used half their attacks I
guess<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.470> gave<00:01:13.680> up<00:01:13.920> at<00:01:14.130> some<00:01:14.310> point<00:01:14.610> and

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
guess they gave up at some point and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.899 
guess they gave up at some point and
decided<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.500> wasn't<00:01:16.710> worth<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.220> resource

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
decided it wasn't worth the resource

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.700 
decided it wasn't worth the resource
cost<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.390> even<00:01:18.570> attack<00:01:18.869> us<00:01:19.080> because<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.560> were

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
cost to even attack us because we were

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.530 
cost to even attack us because we were
we<00:01:20.430> were<00:01:20.520> pretty<00:01:20.759> much<00:01:20.909> beating<00:01:21.240> from<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
we were pretty much beating from the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.859 
we were pretty much beating from the
get-go<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.820> attacks<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.240> they<00:01:24.390> did<00:01:24.600> use

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
get-go the attacks that they did use

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.850 
get-go the attacks that they did use
were<00:01:25.110> less<00:01:25.890> than<00:01:25.920> impressive<00:01:27.470> they<00:01:28.470> had<00:01:28.680> some

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860

my think he got most of the clan couple
troops<00:04:30.660> there<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:30.870> gets<00:04:30.960> kind<00:04:31.200> of<00:04:31.260> crowded
