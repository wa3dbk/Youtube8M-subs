00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
to need flame guys did that because I

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.110 
to need flame guys did that because I
did<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.609> in<00:00:38.850> 11<00:00:39.660> layers<00:00:40.190> but<00:00:41.190> move

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
did this in 11 layers but move

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.400 
did this in 11 layers but move
everything<00:00:42.359> around<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.019> can<00:00:43.109> see<00:00:43.379> how

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
everything around so you can see how

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.430 
everything around so you can see how
it's<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.980> there<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:45.239> indented<00:00:45.780> shield<00:00:46.140> what

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
it's on there the indented shield what

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.430 
it's on there the indented shield what
you<00:00:46.589> see<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:46.949> right<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.670> use<00:00:47.999> that<00:00:48.440> little

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
you see is right here use that little

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.389 
you see is right here use that little
curve<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:51.420> drop<00:00:51.809> which<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.440> also<00:00:52.649> need<00:00:53.069> for

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
curve the drop which you also need for

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.049 
curve the drop which you also need for
the<00:00:53.489> inside<00:00:53.999> curve<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.749> see<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:55.109> right<00:00:55.379> there

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
the inside curve you see is right there

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.860 
the inside curve you see is right there
there<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> square<00:00:57.749> that<00:00:58.499> I<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.850> right<00:01:00.479> here

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.100 

where<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.770> square<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.130> had<00:01:05.520> to<00:01:05.820> use<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.840> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
where the square I had to use that to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.860 
where the square I had to use that to
fill<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.620> little<00:01:07.830> bit<00:01:08.150> ship<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.450> was<00:01:09.600> in

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
fill in a little bit ship that was in

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.500 
fill in a little bit ship that was in
there<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.410> use<00:01:10.560> anything<00:01:11.210> whatever<00:01:12.210> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
there you can use anything whatever you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.000 
there you can use anything whatever you
want<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.810> use<00:01:14.630> trying<00:01:15.630> wide<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.620> one<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.980> up

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
want to use trying wide that one is up

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.640 
want to use trying wide that one is up
here<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.940> to<00:01:18.090> overlay<00:01:18.660> it<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:19.850> the

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
here you have to overlay it with the

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.950 
here you have to overlay it with the
lieutenant<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.100> get<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> right<00:01:23.610> angle<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
lieutenant to get the right angle the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.290 
lieutenant to get the right angle the
top<00:01:25.230> and<00:01:25.470> bottom<00:01:25.650> triangles<00:01:26.610> are<00:01:26.790> obviously

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
top and bottom triangles are obviously

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.330 
top and bottom triangles are obviously
different<00:01:27.570> because<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.470> need<00:01:28.710> two<00:01:29.010> different

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
different because you need two different

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.230 
different because you need two different
angles

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.899 

and<00:01:33.720> triangle<00:01:34.680> medium<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.250> down<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
and triangle medium is down here in the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.030 
and triangle medium is down here in the
bottom<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.659> pretty<00:01:36.899> damn<00:01:37.170> big<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.829> just

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
bottom it's pretty damn big you just

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:46.340 
bottom it's pretty damn big you just
kind<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.509> work<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.930> there<00:01:44.540> just<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.810> triangle

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
kind of work it in there just a triangle

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.830 
kind of work it in there just a triangle
medium<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.799> your<00:01:47.009> top<00:01:47.280> triangle<00:01:47.670> once<00:01:48.479> again

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
medium is your top triangle once again

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.570 
medium is your top triangle once again
it<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.770> overlaid<00:01:50.399> with<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.860> lieutenant

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
it is overlaid with the lieutenant

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.960 
it is overlaid with the lieutenant
rectangle<00:01:54.539> your<00:01:55.439> rectangle<00:01:55.950> medium<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.700> right

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
rectangle your rectangle medium is right

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.200 
rectangle your rectangle medium is right
here<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:58.200> don't<00:01:58.409> need<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.679> use<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.850> whole

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
here you don't need to use the whole

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.169 
here you don't need to use the whole
thing<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.100> just<00:02:02.100> say<00:02:02.280> most<00:02:02.520> people<00:02:02.640> go<00:02:03.000> up

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
thing and just say most people go up

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.090 
thing and just say most people go up
here<00:02:03.450> with<00:02:03.720> it<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.049> try<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.320> make<00:02:04.530> another<00:02:04.860> one

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
here with it and try to make another one

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.490 
here with it and try to make another one
go<00:02:05.250> down<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.179> just<00:02:06.420> put<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.259> right

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
go down but if you can just put a right

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.020 
go down but if you can just put a right
at<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.679> bottom<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.250> lieutenant<00:02:08.880> that

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
at the bottom of the lieutenant that

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.740 
at the bottom of the lieutenant that
works<00:02:09.299> just<00:02:09.450> fine<00:02:10.790> then<00:02:11.790> your<00:02:12.090> lieutenants

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
works just fine then your lieutenants

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.520 
works just fine then your lieutenants
are<00:02:12.810> obviously<00:02:13.610> right<00:02:14.610> here<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:16.650> make<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.340> f

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
are obviously right here to make the f

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.110 
are obviously right here to make the f
you<00:02:19.530> stack<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.549> that<00:02:22.730> then<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
you stack it on like that then the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.370 
you stack it on like that then the
circle<00:02:24.870> that's<00:02:25.230> my<00:02:25.500> background<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:27.260> there<00:02:28.260> you

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
circle that's my background so there you

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.970 
circle that's my background so there you
go<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.250> how<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.640> make<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:31.170> famous<00:02:31.680> stars

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
go that is how you make the famous stars

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.360 
go that is how you make the famous stars
and<00:02:32.130> straps<00:02:32.310> emblem

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:45.589 

it's<00:02:37.239> all<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.569> same<00:02:37.750> color<00:02:38.110> again<00:02:39.390> because
