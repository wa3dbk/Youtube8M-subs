on<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.080> cover<00:05:11.320> system<00:05:11.560> because<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.130> player

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
on the cover system because the player

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.850 
on the cover system because the player
will<00:05:12.610> spend<00:05:12.820> a<00:05:12.910> lot<00:05:13.090> of<00:05:13.120> time<00:05:13.240> using<00:05:13.690> it<00:05:13.930> but

will spend a lot of time using it but

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.350 
will spend a lot of time using it but
you<00:05:14.950> have<00:05:15.100> to<00:05:15.220> be<00:05:15.310> careful<00:05:15.520> because<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:16.120> cover

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
you have to be careful because the cover

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.570 
you have to be careful because the cover
can<00:05:16.630> often<00:05:17.080> be<00:05:17.170> easily<00:05:17.560> destroyed<00:05:18.040> so<00:05:18.490> if
