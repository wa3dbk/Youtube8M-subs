00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.150
 this technical from youtube puts 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.130
 this tax before and where to buy them 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.130
 I'll show you that for now 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.460
 The forehead light you can on Amazon 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.850
 to order 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.410
 There it costs 95 now and will 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.230
 delivered free with an order 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.400
 from 29 euro the link to the product break 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.810
 stood as always in the text box under the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.760
 video we just click on it 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.810
 Amazon should be forwarded this time 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.300
 can not operate that no 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.059
 Comment and post in this carton 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.460
 probably the headlamp delivered and the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.770
 I'll park in the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.190
 Packaging was once a 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:45.600
 manual multilingual and 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.980
 then the lamp itself is the lamp 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.989
 Quickly explained we have this back 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.879
 once a flexible headband with here 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.170
 such a led headlights lettering 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:04.080
 this adjustable once here and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.510
 Once there, the lamp can be adjusted 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.229
 it now seems straight and then 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.990
 you still have it here until 90 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.670
 grad down processing is very 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.060
 well , there's nothing to it 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.060
 find fault 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.920
 you see the leds 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.920
 These are red leds 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.649
 I can open the front here 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.700
 Now zack and so it looks there 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:43.520
 inside out that's how it starts again 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:50.720
 we would have to collect the best here 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:52.539
 again so exactly so now yes one 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.229
 it has to meet exactly 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:02:00.310
 but now it is solid again yes batteries 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.429
 right here are the batteries in it 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:09.950
 you have to open this once and that 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:11.650
 so over there and then come three times aaa 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.959
 batteries purely 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.640
 best runs directly packed but if 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.319
 he uses this here and it fits 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.709
 not spinning directly is just like that 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:25.640
 little bit until then this little track 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:29.090
 in this mob rhine almost batteries can 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:35.650
 also use because I still if so the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:38.920
 function and here is the button 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.920
 a led 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.510
 the ring around the led and the third stage 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.099
 then all are on 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:53.290
 and then there is this link 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:55.390
 function and then she's back from the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.819
 team has again on is actually 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.250
 super easy to set this up now 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.319
 how she got supplies that pulls 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.909
 then just here so it's not over 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.769
 She turns her head on in the back 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.879
 bit back and that 's it 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.769
 could have been here 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.629
 shake a bit 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.519
 she does not pretend that falls too 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.359
 not down, we can say girlfriend 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.129
 you just always understand it like that 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:20.400
 Crack down and so she does 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:26.909
 all the way down 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.909
 and so it looks from the back 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:35.799
 now we go to the dark as well as in the 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:42.030
 garden everything I pitch dark times the 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:46.239
 first level at first level second level 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:51.030
 third stage and yes it looks the camera 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.030
 really nice illuminate 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:02.549
 there is my mushroom umbrella tree 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:04.889
 I built it by myself so all right 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.049
 great for being so small and 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:14.489
 even so cheap here is to 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:20.039
 example sometimes means just this 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:25.910
 blinking on the only looks like that 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:30.240
 off again completely booster first stage 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:34.710
 second floor third level flashing light 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:38.150
 and off in normal distance 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.550
 comparatively , I was just about 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.840
 three meters away now are about 8 and 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.270
 that looks on the third level 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.410
 the luminosity this little lamp then 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:53.970
 link mode does not have the knowledge anymore 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:56.820
 as far too far from first level second 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.210
 stage and then again the highest ever, the 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.190
 third level the forehead long one can 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.409
 Also always take the way on 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.780
 run for example with the dog at night 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:10.919
 then go for a walk then you have both 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:15.590
 Hands free without you already see that does 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.590
 illuminate the way really nice 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.220
 So ten meters away and do at times 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.819
 just what you have just seen here stood 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.410
 just the tripod and then I'm up 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.300
 I then kill committed to the wooden door 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.919
 the three different lighting modes 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.560
 turned on and then this red 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:34.599
 flashing modes and then I'm just ever 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.650
 gone forward and thus the red 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:43.419
 clinker again back further show 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:47.500
 I just told you then I joined 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:51.669
 the first test about here and I'm 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.349
 Therefore , you can see the route 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:56.919
 I have put myself back from that 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:07:00.960
 without that there are a few already 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.960
 been meters 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:05.050
 Now I have your headlamp but 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.880
 briefly presented 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.910
 I really liked it because 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.520
 She handles the power very well 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.389
 really nice light and is still cheap 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.099
 in the price 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:17.110
 who thinks so what can I do now 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:18.940
 use the link to it there is one 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.159
 text again under the video that was 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.210
 again the test of youtube the swatch 

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:24.099
 is until next time 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.690
 and if you miss me subscribe 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:27.690
