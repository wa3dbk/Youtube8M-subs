00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.579
 first of all i tried to be alive and I 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.099
 I already showed you 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:36.300

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.609
 practice to see if what can be 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.329
 so fast it's starting from the 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:05.580
 old interface start otter look only 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.740
 what speed that beauty that you already 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.890
 had thought we do not know how to show 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.950
 another thing you can organize today 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.440
 taiyou sushi squares arranging 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.570
 playing one of a group and one for the other 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.400
 but few people know what to do 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.670
 group you can see that there is a little group 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.960
 internet office loot and tools by 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.120

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.560
 fun 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.110
 I dragged my square from space 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.820
 between the two groups 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.890
 ready a group I think 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.990
 some things you use here for fun 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.960
 battlefield order site 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.660
 there is something else that life also 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.920
 although this video from the use of 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.140
 group of fun or to have a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.570

 make work in this fashion interface is 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.930
 simple 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.269
 Another interesting thing is 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.220
 talk until the application stays in 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.150
 full screen gives to work so it is not 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.310

 car locked up here plays on 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.180
 The side was split and now it 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.569
 open a problem that I want 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.120
 Look, they 're just divided. 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.700
 You can see that I have internet here. 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.680

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.569
 fashion fashion apps 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.609
 it is they gain form according to 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.879
 the size you are willing 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.250
 then click the inbox 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:27.049
 birthday of the battisti jury 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:30.359
 31/10 is you see that the entire interface 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.319
 stay alive from mail to work is not 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.849
 just e-mail 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.160
 It's not only me, I can close and a half. 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.519
 here is can for example here and I 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.709
 open an account different from the weather 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.199
 weather I can do the same thing 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.239
 the application of the weather catch her playing 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:47.489
 when I had it here while loading it 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.280
 And look how cool it can open hunting in the 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.040
 weather together with old desktop 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.519
 there she gets another way of applying two 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.440
 times here I'll work on the application 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.019
 the weather here with all the information 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.540
 than rio de janeiro and that I'm 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.669
 seeing only two looks unless I have 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.540
 open here in the middle and did old click 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:11.819
 twice come back I'm not practical 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.430
 working with it is a practice that 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.489
 got back got back 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.280
 and for those who still want to take a show 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.880
 It's only normal for you guys to drag it 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.909
 know 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.949
 and for who is perfect is that air that wants 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:30.240
 something like start button such 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.469
 you can squeeze the ideal x 78 x you 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.580
 enter this mode here 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:38.439
 It looks like a button to start a run on x 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.509
 use everything you had on the button 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:41.680
 start windows programs and features 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.169
 xp 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.729
 ok if it squeezed and 2 x it will open one goes 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:52.509
 open the options to go back there to see 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:55.569
 which had our mobile center programs 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:05:00.189
 a lot of direct energy has here 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:02.770
 just needed it then well this is it here 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:04.449
 open from being to tell the 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.090
 install and uninstall programs only with 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.099
 customers saw 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.020
 see the productivity in this interface 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.539
 fashion as I am seeing how it is 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.300
 learning to see so is not a 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:19.389
 perfect interface but it is modern and the 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.599
 polished and is prepared for the 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:25.569
 hydro and hybrid between notebook and tablet 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:28.240
 what's coming around ok we have a lot to 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:31.180
 improve the interface, but it is the 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.680
 most modern and most practical available 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.930
 at the time 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.150
 you will have you compare with lion that 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.360
 I have here one at home and you see 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.330
 that the windows 8 interface is fine and well 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.699
 competitive and I will not talk about 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.979
 competitive advantage is much higher in 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:50.050
 aspects is still not perfect but it is the 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:53.500
 the more contemporary we have is 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.699
 more modern and polished is having on 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.529
 market at the moment 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.349
 Let's see each update that the 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:01.210
 microsoft release will only improve or the 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.370
 important point is to gain productivity 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.870
 and microsoft a clear shot with your 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.370
 personal interface 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.990
 I hope you liked this drop 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.490
 quick just to learn a little 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.080
 more from windows 8 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.080
 Thanks, thank you until next time. 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.660
