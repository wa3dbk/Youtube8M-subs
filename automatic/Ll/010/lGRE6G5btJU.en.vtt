00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.570 
sort of grip onto something and stay
because<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.470> find<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.770> my<00:01:58.920> glasses<00:01:59.340> do<00:01:59.490> you

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
because I find that my glasses do you

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.070 
because I find that my glasses do you
slept<00:01:59.850> throughout<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.299> day<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.930> to

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
slept throughout the day so I like to

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.149 
slept throughout the day so I like to
apply<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.289> little<00:02:01.470> bit<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.680> how<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.890> drive<00:02:02.130> just

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
apply a little bit of how to drive just

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.680 
apply a little bit of how to drive just
down<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.580> bridge<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.759> my<00:02:02.940> nose<00:02:02.970> my<00:02:03.360> crosses

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
down the bridge of my nose my crosses

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.800 
down the bridge of my nose my crosses
have<00:02:03.810> something<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.110> hold<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.440> to<00:02:05.690> so<00:02:06.690> we're

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
have something to hold on to so we're

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.710 
have something to hold on to so we're
gonna<00:02:06.899> be<00:02:07.080> moving<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.560> eye<00:02:07.590> makeup<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.310> um

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
gonna be moving on to eye makeup and um

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.540 
gonna be moving on to eye makeup and um
I'm<00:02:09.720> going<00:02:10.200> for<00:02:10.500> sort<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.890> bright<00:02:11.190> eyed

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
I'm going for sort of a bright eyed

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.540 
I'm going for sort of a bright eyed
effect<00:02:12.060> because<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.450> realize<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.620> when<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.100> I'm

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
effect because I realize that when I I'm

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.570 
effect because I realize that when I I'm
nearsighted<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:16.200> my<00:02:16.709> glasses<00:02:16.980> make<00:02:17.340> my<00:02:17.430> eyes

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
nearsighted so my glasses make my eyes

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.309 
nearsighted so my glasses make my eyes
look<00:02:17.610> smaller<00:02:18.209> which<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.750> not<00:02:18.959> really<00:02:19.200> ideal

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
look smaller which is not really ideal

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.680 
look smaller which is not really ideal
so<00:02:20.040> if<00:02:20.100> you're<00:02:20.280> farsighted<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:21.269> probably

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
so if you're farsighted you probably

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.880 
so if you're farsighted you probably
wouldn't<00:02:21.959> want<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.140> take<00:02:22.260> these<00:02:22.380> tips<00:02:22.590> into

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
wouldn't want to take these tips into

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.110 
wouldn't want to take these tips into
attacks<00:02:23.130> because<00:02:23.400> your<00:02:23.580> glasses<00:02:23.850> make<00:02:24.000> your

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
attacks because your glasses make your

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.009 
attacks because your glasses make your
eyes<00:02:24.239> look<00:02:24.269> bigger

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
eyes look bigger

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.990 
eyes look bigger
um<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:25.739> perhaps<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.250> could<00:02:26.370> line<00:02:26.580> all<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.970> way

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
um so perhaps you could line all the way

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.699 
um so perhaps you could line all the way
around<00:02:27.390> your<00:02:27.510> eyes<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.959> want<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.290> smokey

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
around your eyes and you want a smokey

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.050 
around your eyes and you want a smokey

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:43.340

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
it really makes a big difference in

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.170 
it really makes a big difference in

pretty effective glasses are in terms of
eyeliner<00:04:51.509> I<00:04:51.630> think<00:04:51.870> this<00:04:51.960> is<00:04:52.080> one<00:04:52.199> of<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.410> most

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
eyeliner I think this is one of the most

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.010 
eyeliner I think this is one of the most
important<00:04:53.070> steps<00:04:53.430> because<00:04:53.820> a<00:04:54.060> lot<00:04:54.720> of<00:04:54.810> people

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
important steps because a lot of people

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.180

wear<00:04:56.460> eyeliner<00:04:56.850> um<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.870> think<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:58.919> is<00:04:59.039> a<00:04:59.070> really

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460
