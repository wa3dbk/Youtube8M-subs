00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 with subordinate persons or liability 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 business is beneficial 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.700
 we started fighting only average 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.800
 period of two goals themselves 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.150
 forcing ugly mistakes in 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.859
 defense well and the worst thing in this lawsuit 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.789
 is the last three games it is possible to 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.430
 spilled it play play like 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.800
 what are the points in the trip scored but it 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.800
 little and but the game itself 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:38.309
 what worries the content of our game itself 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:43.370
 villas thank you guys for winning important 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.370
 wins before the trip who that searches 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.990
 thanks, please tell me today 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.270
 probably even more 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.800
 the dynamo was noticeable here is the fourth 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:01.220
 link from young hockey players 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.980
 than your leaders later wilson host name in 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:08.840
 This is particularly the reason for the defeat 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:11.450
 how do you know the first twenty-seven 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.970
 games played healthy probably through 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.160
 month regular season one breath those 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.880
 more on obviously not the favorite street 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.430
 the zone will not run there but run but 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.220
 it probably if it is already left but it 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.660
 she is such a weak excuse in 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.970
 particular if we talk about today 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:33.530
 games then something threesome where it was 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.509
 our take into account and yet on today's game 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.460
 but we had a problem with central 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.759
 hitters will give mother archers 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.380
 disqualified more then Fedor 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.740
 some options were considered but 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.430
 general arkalov it was the only were 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.340
 other options you settled on 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.020
 Thank you most today zapili 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.579
 work out somehow specifically for this 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.799
 here 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.720
 before that, too, that was often not me 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.979
 I will say that he just scored as 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.860
 work through the day ingredient 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.930
 keep up this job can guys know 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.439
 you have your scheme on 1 it turns out 1 does not 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.439
 it turns out
