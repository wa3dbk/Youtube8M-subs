00:00:01.485 --> 00:00:03.375
 Good morning, my name is Paweł. 

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.382
 This is also my namesake - Paweł. 

00:00:05.812 --> 00:00:11.526
 Thanks to the kindness of Darek, who accidentally haunted us today, we have the opportunity to shoot for us 

00:00:11.526 --> 00:00:17.382
 the moment of handing over the motorcycle to a new customer. 

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:21.052
 And the most important thing, or service training. 

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:22.465
 This motorcycle. 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:28.890
 This motorcycle is a new, very popular, deficit Yamaha MT-07. 

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:37.807
 Paweł bought it for his first motorcycle after many years, a very good choice and now I will show him how to look after this motorcycle 

00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:39.994
 because how to drive is unfortunately already known. 

00:00:41.013 --> 00:00:43.174
 - Do you know Paweł? -Yes of course! 

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:46.696
 So, as you know, I will show you how to operate this motorcycle. 

00:00:47.888 --> 00:00:54.335
 The most important elements before we start to run the equipment, that is fluid control. 

00:00:54.962 --> 00:01:06.380
 And now Paweł - here is the oil filler cap and here we are filling up the oil level, the control of the oil condition itself takes place here - 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.739
 I do not know if it will be visible, there is a glass eye here in the engine. 

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:20.782
 And with the eyelet having a vertical motorcycle, the oil in the pond must be visible here. 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.621
 It is visible at the moment, so the status is in accordance with the instructions. 

00:01:26.497 --> 00:01:38.815
 The next liquid you control is the coolant and here you can see it in this slot ... you can see a piece of the tank 

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:45.740
 compensatory and here are dashes and the fluid should be between the upper and lower dash - the fluid state is contained 

00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:47.940
 refrigeration is normal. 

00:01:49.286 --> 00:01:54.800
 The next element is the brake fluid control. 

00:01:55.251 --> 00:02:02.930
 And here in the front just the front of the fluid is to be visible in the pond, at the moment there is a whole hole flooded, because the motorcycle stands on 

00:02:03.277 --> 00:02:04.090
 footer. 

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:13.050
 It is also ok, the liquid is here, as if the matte color of this eyeball, the cloudy color in the middle indicates that the liquid 

00:02:13.052 --> 00:02:14.587
 is. 

00:02:14.587 --> 00:02:26.210
 Now the same brake fluid in the rear brake, here is the rear brake fluid reservoir. 

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:33.360
 It is, you can see low level, high - it's in between, the state is normal. 

00:02:33.742 --> 00:02:38.360
 And as if all the fluids in this motorcycle are checked. 

00:02:39.422 --> 00:02:45.660
 What you will know from the user manual, and I can give you now, the tire pressure is 2.5 atmospheres 

00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:52.800
 rear, 2.25 front regardless of speed, load, there is one value for this motorcycle always. 

00:02:54.206 --> 00:03:00.310
 We have taken control of liquids, there is one most important liquid, I will show you where to pour it and how to pour it, of course, talk about 

00:03:00.545 --> 00:03:05.020
 and here 95 or 98 octane. 

00:03:05.514 --> 00:03:14.360
 The infusion is opened in such a way that it turns the key, deflects it, we pour it under the ceiling if you can afford it. 

00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:17.160
 If not, for 2 zlotys the motorcycle will go as well. 

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:21.080
 We're closing. 

00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:23.640
 Well, probably because you do not want to ride. 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.450
 From such next important elements, it is a panel, it is a display that communicates with us. 

00:03:34.968 --> 00:03:43.530
 And here you are ... we start this way that we put the key in the ignition and turn it into the ON position. 

00:03:45.164 --> 00:03:50.850
 Here you perform the test of instruments on the display and at the moment we have as if the state of the work. 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:54.550
 And here are some important, important elements. 

00:03:54.752 --> 00:04:03.350
 Here is a digital speedometer, here is a tachometer in the form of a scale, it will grow up there to 11-12 thousand. 

00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:11.030
 Here is the fuel level indicator, at the moment it is in reserve, which is confirmed by the flashing last line. 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.680
 If it does not flash, it means that there is the last line, that is not enough fuel, but it is still before the reserve. 

00:04:18.968 --> 00:04:21.330
 Watch working in 12-hour mode. 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.890
 And now the same as it supports the on-board computer, because this motorcycle is equipped with it. 

00:04:28.905 --> 00:04:36.457
 It is switched by this first key and now as if starting - the air temperature is 18 degrees. 

00:04:36.457 --> 00:04:39.440
 The total mileage is 0. 

00:04:41.153 --> 00:04:46.057
 Momentary waveforms, for the first mode, for the second mode. 

00:04:46.057 --> 00:04:53.410
 This is for example for two drivers who move the same, or for example you go on a trip and need to have 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.980
 Indications between refueling one whole when it comes to the entire trip, then you can use these two modes then to this. 

00:04:59.373 --> 00:05:07.400
 This is canceled in such a way that you have to hold the indicator longer. 

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:13.950
 Yes, when he flashes. 

00:05:14.563 --> 00:05:19.080
 You have to come in as if ... it flashes for a few seconds, you have to hold this key. 

00:05:19.584 --> 00:05:25.450
 The next function is instantaneous combustion and here are liter to a hundred, as if at a given moment. 

00:05:26.183 --> 00:05:32.490
 The next computer function is medium burning, then you have AVE written here 

00:05:33.138 --> 00:05:35.230
 it is also in liters for a hundred. 

00:05:36.108 --> 00:05:43.620
 Next is the temperature of the engine, it is currently low and marked Lo, starting from 40 degrees the motorcycle will start counting up. 

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:49.740
 The next is the air temperature. 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.130
 And these are the functions of the on-board computer. 

00:05:52.926 --> 00:06:01.097
 This is the gear indicator, here at the moment there is play, in addition, play or neutral gear is signaled here by the indicator 

00:06:01.097 --> 00:06:02.960
 N lit in this place. 

00:06:03.758 --> 00:06:11.920
 Here is the oil pressure indicator, here is the ABS control lamp, after igniting the motorcycle, passing the first two meters 

00:06:12.328 --> 00:06:13.160
 it will go out. 

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:16.760
 So as if the system will be checked, this indicator will go off.
