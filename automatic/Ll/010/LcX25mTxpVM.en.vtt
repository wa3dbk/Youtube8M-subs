00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
I said but love this glitch is actually

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.700 
I said but love this glitch is actually
really<00:02:00.030> easy<00:02:00.180> I'm<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.469> don't<00:02:01.560> have

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
really easy I'm like if you don't have

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.410 
really easy I'm like if you don't have
to<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.310> perfect<00:02:02.729> tutorial<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.329> how

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
to do it this is perfect tutorial on how

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.690 
to do it this is perfect tutorial on how
to<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.409> really<00:02:04.500> quick<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.250> guess<00:02:05.549> so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
to do it it's really quick I guess so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.130 
to do it it's really quick I guess so
this<00:02:05.729> video<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.329> only<00:02:06.450> seven<00:02:06.750> minutes<00:02:06.840> long

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
this video is only seven minutes long

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.960 
this video is only seven minutes long
and<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.799> really<00:02:07.979> only<00:02:08.069> took<00:02:08.280> me<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.459> about<00:02:08.640> ten

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
and it really only took me in about ten

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.059 
and it really only took me in about ten
so

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
so

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.119 
so
and<00:02:10.299> it's<00:02:11.299> gonna<00:02:11.450> save<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.439> loading<00:02:12.829> screens

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
and it's gonna save the loading screens

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.679 
and it's gonna save the loading screens
probably<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.549> longest<00:02:13.909> thing<00:02:14.060> about<00:02:14.329> it<00:02:14.510> it's

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:14.689 
probably the longest thing about it it's

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.750 
probably the longest thing about it it's
probably<00:02:14.810> crazy<00:02:15.290> part<00:02:15.590> but<00:02:15.769> yeah<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.219> just<00:02:16.489> see

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
probably crazy part but yeah I just see

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.399 
probably crazy part but yeah I just see
here<00:02:16.939> how<00:02:17.030> much<00:02:17.209> of<00:02:17.359> the<00:02:17.420> tryout<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.780> skip<00:02:18.170> that

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
here how much of the tryout to skip that

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.229 
here how much of the tryout to skip that
you're<00:02:18.950> gonna<00:02:19.069> gonna<00:02:19.609> get<00:02:19.730> put<00:02:19.909> into<00:02:20.000> another
