century but some new time period in

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.770 
century but some new time period in
computing<00:02:55.890> power<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.849> i'm<00:02:57.180> very<00:02:57.209> excited

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
computing power so i'm very excited

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.020 
computing power so i'm very excited
using<00:02:58.319> that<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.590> record<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.069> and<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.790> allow

and it is in the bug fixing stage right

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.909 
and it is in the bug fixing stage right
now<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.120> is<00:04:18.239> huge<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:19.199> might<00:04:19.500> have<00:04:19.620> seen<00:04:19.769> the

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
now it is huge you might have seen the

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.800 
now it is huge you might have seen the
onus<00:04:20.220> is<00:04:20.250> going<00:04:20.639> on<00:04:20.729> going<00:04:21.269> in<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:21.570> that<00:04:21.660> is

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
onus is going on going in and that is

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.540 
onus is going on going in and that is
very<00:04:22.109> very<00:04:22.169> true<00:04:22.349> there's<00:04:23.010> lots<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.400> other

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
very very true there's lots of other

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.080 
very very true there's lots of other
stuff<00:04:23.640> going<00:04:23.849> in<00:04:24.210> as<00:04:24.300> well<00:04:24.450> including

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
stuff going in as well including

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.260 
stuff going in as well including
the<00:04:25.630> jetpack<00:04:26.199> so<00:04:26.830> that's<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.760> reason<00:04:27.790> it's

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
the jetpack so that's the reason it's

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.180 
the jetpack so that's the reason it's
taking<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.720> while<00:04:28.750> because<00:04:29.050> these<00:04:29.320> are<00:04:29.500> huge

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
taking a while because these are huge

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.980 
taking a while because these are huge
elements<00:04:30.639> and<00:04:30.760> if<00:04:30.820> you<00:04:30.910> think<00:04:31.240> about<00:04:31.330> it<00:04:31.540> after

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
elements and if you think about it after

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.200 
elements and if you think about it after
the<00:04:32.110> onus<00:04:32.410> on<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.590> jetpack<00:04:32.949> there<00:04:33.460> aren't<00:04:33.729> too

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
the onus on the jetpack there aren't too

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.129 
the onus on the jetpack there aren't too
many<00:04:34.500> large<00:04:35.500> items<00:04:36.070> left<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.669> go<00:04:36.820> in<00:04:37.080> there's<00:04:38.080> a
