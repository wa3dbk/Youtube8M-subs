00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.010
 book 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.189
 there 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:14.669
 the sign in the starting blocks already on 24 March on old photo of 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:15.949
 appear 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.039
 we want you on the basis of the closed Xbox the 60 multiplayer beta ever 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.919
 give a little insight into the multiplayer mode 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.649
 the circle 2 known to play new and now, of course, the 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.489
 Multiplayer beside Vettel in the beta version was but only one card with 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.590
 Skyline many times a good mix of near and long-range combat for many 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.650
 above the rooftops of the houses, you can see the ball around you at a great distance 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.960
 Let your ears fly 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.180
 GDN the individual buildings are now in close combat 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.780
 playfully giving their win way though a bit hectic school of duty series 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.940
 for the next opponent is called the experience points 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.360
 The pet food Aachener wants to ascend 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.860
 then, for example, unlock new classes 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.170
 under it are standards like Sniper it's just GaudÃ­ 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.700
 even the quadfires we are now pulling the strings is always accurate 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.630
 Berg just around the corner but has the unique feature 5 everything 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.840
 the name is and will always be jut the high-tech suit is fitting 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.970
 Variation the teammates battles 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.950
 For example, at the push of a button, his opponents could almost unnoticed 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.570
 sneaking up or separating a protective shield can do more with it 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.880
 Insert hits 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.700
 but names have a lot more on the pan 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.060
 For example, he lets it jump a little higher in the air 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.340
 let a powerful fist launch attacks or he activates one 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.640
 Thermal camera with these also our Fanseiten before 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.230
 April 5 you can design your own class of Masons 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.540
 and, for example, named Juke to equip new engines 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.600
 This reminds me a bit of the erp-system by Kollers 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.729
 World of sounds from the opponents in close combat done no problem 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.460
 simply the module Klopp forgave the viruses 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.650
 and then her case recognizes an adversary too-nourished driving mode 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.880
 is 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.919
 or records to bread and thereby faster after 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.600
 while the culprit was able to use his solid for a deep instant action 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.470
 which is nothing else than Team Deathmatch 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.399
 Interestingly, there is already the muscle steeply a slightly modified variant 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.400
 from Capture the Flag the last teardrop spaceship from time to time a probe 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.689
 fall on the map 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.939
 then it must be fast and be there in front of the opposing team 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.949
 Secure to defend firing point afterwards 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.749
 but be careful after some time of cheap 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:26.749
 graphically because it makes two musicians already a good figure 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.139
 the environment such as the numerous plants packaging 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.379
 detailed design 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.629
 and the light and what effects very nice to look at 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.779
 frequent proportions cloud the overall impression of the time 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:40.549
 Multiplayer, the graphics he anyway rather minor 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.760
 much more important is that he likes our trial rounds no future 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.399
 notable Lex Lugar 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.289
 All in all, the multiplayer mode around a pretty good impression 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:53.359
 Although you can not say much about the different studies of game modes 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:54.359
 to care 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.589
 but just the different function of the name Jun just the game of the 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.589
 Shooter majority off 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:02.299
 to meet
