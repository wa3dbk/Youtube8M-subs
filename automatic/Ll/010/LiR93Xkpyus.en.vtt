I<00:01:32.329> think<00:01:32.869> that<00:01:32.990> gap<00:01:33.170> could<00:01:33.350> be<00:01:33.470> coming<00:01:33.770> down

I think that gap could be coming down

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.630 
I think that gap could be coming down
again<00:01:35.630> because<00:01:36.049> most<00:01:36.619> definitely<00:01:37.220> appears<00:01:37.549> to

be<00:01:37.729> making<00:01:38.299> some<00:01:39.200> inroads<00:01:39.380> on<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.520> uprightly

down to about 12
eleven<00:04:14.439> seconds<00:04:14.920> so<00:04:15.340> there's<00:04:15.549> not<00:04:15.670> too<00:04:15.730> much

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
eleven seconds so there's not too much

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.670 
eleven seconds so there's not too much
