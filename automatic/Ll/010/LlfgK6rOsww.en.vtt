it<00:00:17.310> didn't<00:00:17.490> work<00:00:18.590> mostly<00:00:19.590> because<00:00:19.619> well<00:00:20.340> hey

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
it didn't work mostly because well hey

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.580 
it didn't work mostly because well hey
it<00:00:21.060> turns<00:00:21.300> out<00:00:21.539> immortals<00:00:22.080> work<00:00:22.230> really<00:00:22.470> well

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
it turns out immortals work really well

didn't<00:00:34.110> work<00:00:35.899> probably<00:00:36.899> if<00:00:36.960> Murr<00:00:37.079> inking<00:00:37.410> have

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
didn't work probably if Murr inking have

didn't work probably if Murr inking have
been<00:00:37.590> able<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.860> do<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> good<00:00:38.370> harassment<00:00:38.879> with

been able to do a good harassment with
those<00:00:39.120> hellions<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.840> he<00:00:39.989> would<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.230> gotten

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
those hellions then he would have gotten

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.920 
those hellions then he would have gotten
into<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> reasonable<00:00:42.149> position<00:00:42.300> economically

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
into a reasonable position economically

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.510 
into a reasonable position economically
could<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.290> passed<00:00:43.410> out<00:00:43.770> last<00:00:43.980> his<00:00:44.160> opponent

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
could have passed out last his opponent

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.709 
could have passed out last his opponent
but<00:00:44.670> now<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.059> didn't<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.329> make<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.539> lot<00:00:45.690> of

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
but now it didn't really make a lot of

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.830 
but now it didn't really make a lot of
sense<00:00:46.940> also<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.030> Murr<00:00:48.180> inking<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.600> being<00:00:48.750> able

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
sense also if Murr inking and being able

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.240 
sense also if Murr inking and being able
to<00:00:48.989> get<00:00:49.050> more<00:00:49.200> expansions<00:00:49.890> he'd<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.160> had

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
to get more expansions he'd have had

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.680 
to get more expansions he'd have had
more<00:00:50.399> gas<00:00:50.700> which<00:00:51.000> meant<00:00:51.239> he<00:00:51.270> could<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.539> build

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
more gas which meant he could have build

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.340 
more gas which meant he could have build
ghosts<00:00:52.320> which<00:00:52.860> once<00:00:53.460> again<00:00:53.730> he<00:00:53.820> didn't<00:00:54.059> have

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
ghosts which once again he didn't have

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.510 
ghosts which once again he didn't have
ghosts<00:00:55.350> would<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.649> definitely<00:00:56.010> done<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
ghosts would have definitely done the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.799 
ghosts would have definitely done the
job<00:00:56.699> would<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.000> broken<00:00:57.210> those<00:00:57.420> immortals

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
job would have broken those immortals

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.290 
job would have broken those immortals
hard<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.140> shields<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:59.039> now<00:00:59.340> mass<00:00:59.579> tank<00:00:59.820> not

totally honest the problem with that is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.779 
totally honest the problem with that is
that<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.170> going<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.500> significantly<00:01:46.789> delay

that stalker stalkers yeah they're quite
good<00:04:30.340> against<00:04:30.580> hellions<00:04:30.970> but<00:04:31.120> they<00:04:31.180> don't

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330
