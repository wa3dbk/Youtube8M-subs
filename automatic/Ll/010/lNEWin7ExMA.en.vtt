00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.809
 Galera speaks up beauty of the team and good 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.010
 Today I bring you to tell you that more 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.779
 escargots in the sense of 26 and good happy 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.820
 Christmas is primarily for everybody okay 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:28.650
 there watching and listening to talk is meat 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.869
 cool, okay, so I brought it for you 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.930
 some ways to greatly improve the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.670
 graphic quality of the game're in total 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.829
 they are three modules or using four 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.950
 deaths in this video with charles 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:48.840
 william beaumont training and 24 minutes 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:50.670
 mistake the 23 good and I thought the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.070
 end result was very cool 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.600
 Okay, I've put simoldes there so you can see 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.489
 that water in the original game in the ring 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.309
 No, andrade, no, I do not. 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.760
 pictures of the original game is with yang 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.920
 only with the amb is the first shopping mall 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.350
 los angeles where you can see that the water 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.650
 It's kind of bland if you do not have no wave. 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:19.830
 understood and then adding these molds 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.930
 I put the water and another one with all the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.159
 The way you see the difference, we go 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.320
 evolving so to say with fashion 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.250
 working together for the water is fine 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.170
 cooler is not only ground water and and 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.650
 the lights of the game getting cooler there 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.979
 because I'm using these templates is 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.200
 all in the river or the amb video that also 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.110
 ambition so will not change only water 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.710
 terrain will not change the light will also 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.600
 add more cool is some things in the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.850
 Shining path will stay in the dark 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.130
 I recommend you used and river traveling 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.840
 along with charles schulz dengue because 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.060
 she he 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.719
 He leaves the game a little bit more 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:08.429
 of course if you use only a kick in 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.599
 dark then it 's much cooler that 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.220
 will also fall into the video description 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.310
 all the ways I'm talking teams 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.000
 they are seeing the image 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.170
 it is getting better is the smell that is a 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.050
 template that I will also leave in the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.430
 description and the worst odor that was not 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.400
 They do more or less the same thing. 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.730
 but the odor it modified slightly the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.620
 Let's say let's land 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.370
 it also improves the texture of the earth 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.340
 these things and the water is the iwork wheel 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.900
 music and only from the water did 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.330
 part of the water that I find the part that 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.269
 it gets more impressive and it's more 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.950
 visible the graphic change of a mold 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.370
 to the other joining all in 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.519
 comparing a normal game, I did not find 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.140
 That was really cool, I put it in two 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.090
 different situations but numbers 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.099
 different one focused only on the water 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.230
 another focused on a place where you have 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:05.299
 animal trees have the boot back there 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.910
 So cool, so good , it's good. 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:11.120
 I like this video click there I do not like it 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.060
 you want the link is there in the 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.220
