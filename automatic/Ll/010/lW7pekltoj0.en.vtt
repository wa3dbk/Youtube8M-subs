this<00:05:38.249> is<00:05:38.429> a<00:05:38.459> tactic<00:05:38.879> I<00:05:38.969> use<00:05:39.149> when<00:05:39.300> I<00:05:39.360> first<00:05:39.689> get

00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:39.869 
this is a tactic I use when I first get

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:42.709 
this is a tactic I use when I first get
to<00:05:40.020> El<00:05:40.110> Paso<00:05:40.619> because<00:05:41.399> when<00:05:41.699> if<00:05:42.029> you<00:05:42.089> plan<00:05:42.360> PVE

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:42.719 
to El Paso because when if you plan PVE

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.719 
to El Paso because when if you plan PVE
you<00:05:43.020> rarely<00:05:43.409> get<00:05:43.739> the<00:05:43.800> loot<00:05:44.039> when<00:05:44.279> you<00:05:44.369> kill<00:05:44.580> it

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
you rarely get the loot when you kill it

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.529 
you rarely get the loot when you kill it
so<00:05:45.599> I<00:05:45.629> usually<00:05:46.019> come<00:05:46.229> on<00:05:46.610> PPP's<00:05:47.610> I<00:05:47.849> usually

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
so I usually come on PPP's I usually

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.649 
so I usually come on PPP's I usually
come<00:05:48.719> on<00:05:48.869> a<00:05:48.899> server<00:05:49.229> with<00:05:49.319> less<00:05:49.649> people<00:05:49.889> and<00:05:50.659> so

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
come on a server with less people and so

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:53.989 
come on a server with less people and so
low<00:05:51.839> so<00:05:52.169> I<00:05:52.800> get<00:05:53.009> like<00:05:53.099> a<00:05:53.159> dime<00:05:53.339> children<00:05:53.789> ago
