00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
get both sides and even kind of the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.440 
get both sides and even kind of the
edges<00:01:22.770> as<00:01:22.920> well<00:01:23.070> especially<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.820> double<00:01:24.330> cut

all over and I like to do this a little

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.679 
all over and I like to do this a little
bit<00:01:33.390> ahead<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.810> time<00:01:34.079> maybe<00:01:34.320> 20<00:01:35.070> minutes<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.490> so

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
bit ahead of time maybe 20 minutes or so

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.319 
bit ahead of time maybe 20 minutes or so
15-20<00:01:36.689> minutes<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.829> gives<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.250> chance<00:01:39.119> for

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
15-20 minutes that gives the chance for

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.910 
15-20 minutes that gives the chance for
the<00:01:39.390> salt<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.869> kind<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.079> melt<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.500> there<00:01:40.680> bring

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the salt to kind of melt in there bring

the salt to kind of melt in there bring
some<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.310> proteins<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> top<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
some of the proteins to the top of the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.929 
some of the proteins to the top of the
meat<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.350> gonna<00:01:43.470> help<00:01:43.649> caramelize<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
meat and it's gonna help caramelize the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.590 
meat and it's gonna help caramelize the
outside<00:01:46.040> so<00:01:47.040> once<00:01:47.220> these<00:01:47.310> are<00:01:47.460> good<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.299> have

flipping them a few more times than

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.890 
flipping them a few more times than
normal<00:02:18.189> but<00:02:18.310> if<00:02:18.400> they're<00:02:18.519> kind<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.760> normal<00:02:19.150> say

an inch and a half thick then chances

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.580 
an inch and a half thick then chances
are<00:02:22.329> I'm<00:02:22.420> just<00:02:22.569> gonna<00:02:22.659> cook<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:23.019> one<00:02:23.049> side<00:02:23.230> for

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
are I'm just gonna cook on one side for

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.770 
are I'm just gonna cook on one side for
about<00:02:23.650> 50%<00:02:24.040> of<00:02:24.340> time<00:02:24.489> flip<00:02:25.269> it<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.480> do<00:02:25.659> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
about 50% of time flip it and do the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.470 
about 50% of time flip it and do the
other<00:02:25.810> side<00:02:26.310> what's<00:02:27.310> up<00:02:27.459> put<00:02:27.579> them<00:02:27.670> down<00:02:27.849> it's

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
other side what's up put them down it's

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.699 
other side what's up put them down it's
important<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.930> close<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.379> lid<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.650> grill

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
important to close the lid of the grill

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.920 
important to close the lid of the grill
so<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:30.939> essentially<00:02:31.299> get<00:02:31.540> kind<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.810> an

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
so that you essentially get kind of an

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.349 
so that you essentially get kind of an
of<00:02:32.170> an<00:02:32.500> effect<00:02:32.829> in<00:02:33.010> here<00:02:33.250> right<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.879> pork

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
of an effect in here right and the pork

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.140 
of an effect in here right and the pork
chop<00:02:34.510> cooks<00:02:34.750> from<00:02:34.870> all<00:02:35.019> sides<00:02:35.939> so<00:02:36.939> I'm<00:02:37.060> gonna

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
chop cooks from all sides so I'm gonna

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.640 
chop cooks from all sides so I'm gonna
do<00:02:37.329> that<00:02:37.359> I'm<00:02:37.629> gonna<00:02:37.750> let<00:02:37.900> these<00:02:37.989> go<00:02:38.230> for<00:02:38.439> good

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
do that I'm gonna let these go for good

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.130 
do that I'm gonna let these go for good
five<00:02:39.280> minutes<00:02:39.849> or<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.359> then<00:02:40.870> we'll<00:02:40.959> come

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
five minutes or so and then we'll come

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.869 
five minutes or so and then we'll come
back<00:02:41.170> take<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.530> look<00:02:41.620> okay<00:02:42.159> so<00:02:42.189> my<00:02:42.519> chops<00:02:42.760> have

is nice and hot and hasn't cooled down

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.240 
is nice and hot and hasn't cooled down
at<00:03:04.450> all<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.349> get<00:03:05.590> kind<00:03:05.799> of<00:03:05.829> that<00:03:05.920> crisp

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
at all and you get kind of that crisp

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.280 
at all and you get kind of that crisp
crisscross<00:03:07.109> pattern

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
crisscross pattern

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.220 
crisscross pattern
I<00:03:08.319> however<00:03:09.280> rarely<00:03:09.939> if<00:03:10.269> ever<00:03:10.480> really<00:03:11.019> care

if you if you practice you can kind of

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.540 
if you if you practice you can kind of
use<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.330> field<00:04:31.540> technique<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.340> once<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:33.430> get

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
use the field technique and once you get

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.740 
use the field technique and once you get
good<00:04:33.700> at<00:04:33.730> that<00:04:33.820> you'll<00:04:34.090> be<00:04:34.180> able<00:04:34.330> to<00:04:34.420> tell<00:04:34.570> but

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
good at that you'll be able to tell but

kind<00:04:34.960> of<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.080> easiest<00:04:35.380> most<00:04:35.680> accurate<00:04:36.280> way<00:04:36.400> is

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
kind of the easiest most accurate way is

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.870 
kind of the easiest most accurate way is
with<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.570> meat<00:04:38.110> thermometer<00:04:38.260> which<00:04:39.220> if<00:04:39.490> you're
