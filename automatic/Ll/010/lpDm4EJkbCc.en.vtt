drive slides out vertically like here
I'm<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:42.870> sure<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.230> can<00:00:43.320> see<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.590> from<00:00:43.649> that

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
I'm not sure if you can see it from that

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.330 
I'm not sure if you can see it from that
angle<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:45.590> the<00:00:46.590> best<00:00:46.770> thing<00:00:46.980> about<00:00:47.010> this

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
angle and the best thing about this

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.790 
angle and the best thing about this
thing<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.000> touchscreen<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.260> you

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
thing is that it's touchscreen so you

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.130 
thing is that it's touchscreen so you
can<00:00:51.020> just<00:00:52.020> tap<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> screen<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:53.190> order<00:00:53.820> to
