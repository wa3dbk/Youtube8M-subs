00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.190
 and hello everybody today we 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.080
 found in gta 5 online for a 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.600
 new tutorial on editor mode 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.760
 dedicated to subscribers who had left me 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.770
 so messages on my youtube channel 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.510
 who asked me for small 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.630
 details or small details 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.640
 concerning some tutorials to which there is no 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.769
 was not coming my heart I'm going all of 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.300
 following you also show that the 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.910
 comments and also respond to their 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.189
 questions and show and try to a 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.310
 little better to explain we'll say in 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:37.000
 detail the passages to which they did not 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:41.620
 failed to achieve so prime so 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.240
 first question actually yeah so 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.280
 it's actually kevin who was asking me 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.960
 for the wall breach of 11 July in 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.730
 So what did I go right away and 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.350
 d try to answer your question 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.600
 so in fact it's true that it was a 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.940
 bit short I thought this must be the foot 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.770
 on bach and suddenly we go through 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.050
 so certainly you have to press bach 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.490
 but not that there if we support everything 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.860
 just on berck there you will see 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.629
 that the character is going to bump into actually 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.400
 I forgot to mention it takes 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.470
 foot on bach and puts the left stick 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.750
 so the left joystick to the front 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.190
 so at the same time of course we know 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.350
 already his left stick and press 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.300
 on back to force the wall breach and 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.180
 there look well we arrive inside 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.100
 of the fbi building so here we can 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.440
 do that everywhere on the whole 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.930
 map of gta me i will try to 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.950
 also redo the manipulation a little 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.940
 more to better show how to do 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.390
 So tell them I want to show them 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.710
 again so here it is here I 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.570
 choose another parish of the mayor whose 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.430
 klaus but here we put his joystick to 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.600
 forward and pressing bach and there 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.270
 look closely there is a kind of bugs 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.010
 weird that will happen 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.560
 So here is Norman I hope that you 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.150
 will have to help then there we come to the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.760
 second question in fact loÃ¯c who me 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.740
 asked how to do a looping for 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.360
 the smart ones and also how to ask them 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.870
 floor objects so we start with a 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.310
 big ramp 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.240
 so here I take another small ramp 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.979
 so we put it slightly on the side 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.200
 that's how we have it but without side to 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.810
 using the panels then picks up a 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.119
 small ramp we have it superimposed on the side 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.249
 farah side as a result of the big ramp 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.870
 I say then after we take the ramp 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:17.409
 without the side 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.549
 and we're still putting it right back on the 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.159
 ledge so here I think you have 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.830
 very well understood manipulation have 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:26.230
 did that etc etc up 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.200
 time we want to have the desired height 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.209
 for his looping so there in the video 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.860
 I did this spell a single ramp 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.329
 part to retype all the looping of 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.769
 smart but you are very well understood 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.769
 that you have to do the same thing 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.079
 thing on each side and on the other side 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.090
 parallel time the looping so there 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.810
 I put the last ramp from here 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.609
 in fact we will ask the last in here 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.180
 we then we start each other 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:53.470
 side we take the big ramp we class 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.519
 from there we will start 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.170
 turn for looping 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.849
 so here we are going to give away also the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.440
 joystick method to put the 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.430
 ramps what we can not take the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.530
 machines nor the panels 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.629
 so it's a bit more difficult for those 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.989
 who have trouble but hey it's like that 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.030
 what 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.739
 therefore the large ramp that is removed 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.079
 from below to do exactly like 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.480
 me for the looping smart 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:17.319
 So here we are we will weigh again 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.970
 a small ramp to end and that is me 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.019
 I hope that it will have helped you too 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.549
 to realize the looping of smart 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.109
 then to lay the objects is leaning 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.090
 and a bit no matter how so there I 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.639
 helped me out of the bus debris that is 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.129
 cut in half there will see it there you 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.139
 must be placed in the rounded corner of the 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.060
 bus to be able to put a little bit 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.819
 how can this name also yield from a 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.519
 little ramp that I put not that I 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.959
 superimposed between them so done after 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.030
 from the fifth or the sixth small 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.639
 ramp we get an inclined ramp of 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.430
 this way so we can take 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.500
 also a new container and the 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.109
 put on top of the other containers on 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.900
 sees this same with the little tank 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.160
 ask on the big ramp 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.930
 it can be what the fuck to do 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.790
 shopping 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.780
 so look good, so look at you 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.160
 and although she is half in the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.949
 only so it can be fun too takes 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.629
 races so here look good I 'm 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.910
 put it well in the flare and hop it 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.329
 pose and it gives a shape a bit simple 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.590
 a little nice true for shopping 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.910
 whereas here it's the same it's for 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.030
 to actually make ramps straight 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.440
 with the containers so the gt3 come out 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.260
 so there the first just ask 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.169
 Ramp sale to the place and to 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.750
 upside 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.590
 I admire like me about life early here 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.060
 once you've done that you 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.850
 resume the third render so you 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.510
 put it in the direction in the direction of 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.510
 jump so there look good up 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:45.690
 after just take the container 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.710
 and ask it for help with the help of 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.150
 cement bags 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.230
 so suddenly it makes you a good ramp 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.810
 straight claveau saw that it was not 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.250
 very well ask so there is enough 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.690
 resume the last ramp and the 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.050
 shift a little further forward 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.889
 here is to take back the container and 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.970
 ask them using the cement bags 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.479
 So here we are really getting a 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.910
 ramp with the right well 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.400
 smooth and so will come the like to 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.000
 using the machine one ramp to 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.660
 interior 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.460
 then we stack a container so there 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.370
 it's more to do a half looping or 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.780
 a ramp a little more inclined so there 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.820
 ready for departures and just 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.919
 put a ramp in front of each container 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.639
 to see that the inclinations is not 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:31.680
 like to see too and I come to you 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.570
 show also the three possibilities of 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.669
 do that so I just left 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.930
 like that but me it was just for 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.000
 show you the three so we 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.890
 could realize 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.330
 so I hope it's rather you 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.250
 will have helped 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.840
 do not hesitate to drop me a live or a 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.340
 comment if you have questions 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.930
 on others rather if I have enough of 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.449
 comments i will maybe make myself a 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.660
 tutorial for editor mode for you one 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.700
 arrives at the end of this video and 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.790
 wish you good game and ciao all the 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.790
 world
