00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
alright let's get started for this setup

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.620 
alright let's get started for this setup
we<00:00:09.929> will<00:00:10.050> not<00:00:10.490> not<00:00:11.490> be<00:00:11.849> using<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.269> combat

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
we will not not be using the combat

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.560 
we will not not be using the combat
knife<00:00:13.340> for<00:00:14.340> my<00:00:14.429> experience<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.150> really

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
knife for my experience it is really

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.990 
knife for my experience it is really
slow<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.139> can<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.740> can<00:00:17.130> barely<00:00:17.340> even<00:00:17.490> pick<00:00:17.760> up<00:00:17.789> a

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
slow I can I can barely even pick up a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.519 
slow I can I can barely even pick up a
second<00:00:18.330> kill<00:00:18.480> right<00:00:18.660> after<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.050> first<00:00:19.260> night

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
second kill right after the first night

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.980 
second kill right after the first night
so<00:00:20.310> instead<00:00:20.730> we'll<00:00:21.029> be<00:00:21.180> using<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.510> 44<00:00:21.960> Magnum

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
so instead we'll be using the 44 Magnum

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.870 
so instead we'll be using the 44 Magnum
with<00:00:22.500> attack<00:00:22.769> knife<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:24.570> 44<00:00:25.050> Magnum<00:00:25.170> why

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
with attack knife and the 44 Magnum why

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.120 
with attack knife and the 44 Magnum why
because<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:27.390> like<00:00:27.539> modern<00:00:27.779> warfare<00:00:28.050> 3<00:00:28.230> each

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
because just like modern warfare 3 each

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.510 
because just like modern warfare 3 each
secondary<00:00:29.760> has<00:00:30.119> its<00:00:30.510> own<00:00:30.890> tack<00:00:31.890> knife<00:00:32.160> speed

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
secondary has its own tack knife speed

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.819 
secondary has its own tack knife speed
so<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.390> case<00:00:33.630> we're<00:00:33.930> ghosts<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.350> 44

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
so in this case we're ghosts the 44

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.090 
so in this case we're ghosts the 44
Magnum<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.550> fastest<00:00:35.969> out<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.239> all<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.420> them

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
Magnum is the fastest out of all of them

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.590 
Magnum is the fastest out of all of them
for<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> lethal<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.730> course<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.300> throwing
