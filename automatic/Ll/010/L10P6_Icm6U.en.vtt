little tragic on front post on this

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.240 
little tragic on front post on this
because<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.230> cool<00:03:22.380> thing<00:03:22.560> about<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.860> mojo

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
because the cool thing about this mojo

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.610 
because the cool thing about this mojo
site<00:03:23.459> here<00:03:23.670> guys<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:24.420> its<00:03:24.810> windage<00:03:25.380> and

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
site here guys is its windage and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.060 
site here guys is its windage and
elevation<00:03:26.959> adjustable<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:28.530> don't<00:03:28.800> need

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
elevation adjustable so you don't need

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.310 
elevation adjustable so you don't need
to<00:03:29.310> mess<00:03:29.489> with<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.330> elevation<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.290> I

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
to mess with the the elevation and I

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.080 
to mess with the the elevation and I
believe<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.130> elevation<00:03:32.640> on<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:32.910> is

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
believe the the elevation on this is

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.979 
believe the the elevation on this is
adjustable<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.989> 36<00:03:34.650> inches<00:03:34.890> at<00:03:35.250> 100<00:03:35.610> yards<00:03:35.989> so

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
adjustable to 36 inches at 100 yards so

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.140 
adjustable to 36 inches at 100 yards so
that<00:03:37.170> that's<00:03:37.440> not<00:03:37.530> quite<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.580> bit<00:03:38.910> of

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
that that's not quite a bit of

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.590 
that that's not quite a bit of
adjustment<00:03:39.600> room<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:41.160> I'm<00:03:41.880> probably<00:03:42.180> going<00:03:42.510> to

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
adjustment room so I'm probably going to

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.330 
adjustment room so I'm probably going to
switch<00:03:42.780> out<00:03:42.930> my<00:03:42.959> front<00:03:43.290> poster<00:03:43.680> with<00:03:44.010> a

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
switch out my front poster with a

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.680 
switch out my front poster with a
