00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:05.900
 hello friends here I bring you another video and 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.870
 what we are going to do today 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:13.380
 is to make a frame for photos 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.500
 got to divide old you have me 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.250
 says another tutorial on how to do as a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.620
 type of ceramic starting 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.450
 dividing it 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.580
 Now I'm going to show you how we can do 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.940
 another frame that is dying in the house 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.130
 the first ones we discard to put one 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:35.070
 let's use 6 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.580
 let's put it here let's put as 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.790
 you see now three points and we are going to put 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.790
 three 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.440
 a thing thing 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.860
 for rights 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.300
 two 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.920
 we're going to do now 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.920
 around the machine 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.890
 from pasting 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.360
 a little bit 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.090
 I could charge 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.780
 It puts me on this side because 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.290
 i 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.969
 then we are going to do 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.190
 more or less the same 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.190
 [Music] 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.569
 [Music] 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.680
 and we are going to do this 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.680
 when for half an hour 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.980
 I'm here 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.750
 and now let's put the last 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.320
 here 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.600
 what remains is a kind of pyramid 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.600
 let's specify 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.620
 demonstrated how it is 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.460
 good friends the indexes of glued like 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.910
 come 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.030
 I'll be left with one thing if you want 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.650
 so he 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.050
 can they do it up I am what 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.310
 same put two and one if they are going to 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.410
 agree for what I want to forgive the 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.140
 wall is very good because it will end 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.790
 as if it were a tree has to 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.770
 determine and by how it starts it goes to 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.010
 start with 1 2 and 3 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.430
 and then there are 2 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.470
 2 and 1 and it will stay with you when you look at it 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.290
 below you will be like this and above 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.819
 it will stay the same but this works if 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.099
 you're going to try it if it does not work for you because 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.340
 you start a base it's like that because 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:39.519
 has the basis to put it on a table 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.620
 in any if you're going to hang it 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.980
 I recommend before starting the photos to 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.409
 serious a medium thick nail or something to 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.060
 make a hole in the area but here 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.400
 comes at the tip to put him so that 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.780
 do not have problems then now the second 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.239
 step what you're going to do you're going to grab a 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.620
 glass and you're going to measure how big I think 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.980
 the photos so that they intervene in 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.980
 places 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.160
 there you have the size of the photo and what 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.590
 let's go to take the picture the 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.290
 you're going to mark and you're going to cut it and that's what 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.650
 what we are going to do is very simple not to take 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.940
 the photo that you have cut 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.130
 and we are going to stick it has been an example 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.480
 and to give social photos or football is a 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.480
 magazine paper plate 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.090
 and what you are going to paste 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.090
 for all 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.110
 and then to cut the circle always in 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.110
 circle and you're going to hit all ok 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.010
 good friends as you see 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.510
 what the photos had if you are 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.410
 part of the common magazine because one 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:51.120
 can use photos 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:54.270
 picture on the internet with authority and so a 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.000
 very nice thing they have to do I 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.040
 I recommend tips can you grab the 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.770
 tape that transparent when they put the 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.680
 photos before cutting the ribbon 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.720
 transparent is on top of the photo and the 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.750
 cure in the photo because because this 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.460
 raised as a protection will give me 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.680
 like it's plastic and if they put it right and 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.240
 will be noticed and will leave him with 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.130
 time with two months three months when 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.130
 the photos are exposed 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.909
 they have no base they have no basis 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.440
 for the background what they can do 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.480
 grab a 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:34.010
 an old frame some frame they have 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.680
 thrown in the European house if they can not 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.760
 grab a piece of cardboard and can 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.760
 pretend not to 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.940
 they do not put glue 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.740
 as what you do not want very high very low 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.190
 how far was he putting and 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.190
 contributed 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.460
 do not stick and meanings of what 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.550
 and the good thing about the water bottle that 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.550
 has is that as it is diagonally 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:26.130
 it can go better 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:29.630
 as it has a diagonal partition so what 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.670
 can put more trimmed more stopped 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.620
 so I hope you liked 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.690
 I like it and subscribe to the channel 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.940
 for the other people who asked me 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:43.410
 to those of the cid and 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:45.510
 so here so they know they are two layers 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.430
 there is a flattery and one of others puts him 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.710
 a blade in the middle and they can 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.870
 separate and it's easier to cut because 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.970
 cuts it so it does not break with a 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.440
 big scissors so they can not cut everything 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.920
 in pieces but remember that these 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.360
 they are have two layers, one and the other 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.580
 they can separate in half I can not 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.240
 separate now because I decided the precise 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.340
 to make another video 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.500
 these are two layers they put the knife 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.270
 that in the middle and they are going to separate 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.520
 two layers and it's going to be a lot easier to 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.440
 cut here so they want 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.620
 there is a very nice thing I hope that you 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.620
 I liked it
