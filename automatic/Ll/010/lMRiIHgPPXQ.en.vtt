00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:15.799 
had a look at some of the products that

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.590 
had a look at some of the products that
you<00:00:16.250> guys<00:00:16.430> are<00:00:16.610> showcasing<00:00:16.970> but<00:00:17.270> one<00:00:17.420> that's

you guys are showcasing but one that's
really<00:00:17.810> cool<00:00:17.960> RI<00:00:18.140> is<00:00:18.289> the<00:00:19.039> NUC<00:00:19.939> or<00:00:20.210> nook<00:00:20.420> which

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
really cool RI is the NUC or nook which

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.320 
really cool RI is the NUC or nook which
we've<00:00:21.740> seen<00:00:21.920> of<00:00:22.220> the<00:00:22.400> intel's<00:00:22.700> version<00:00:23.060> so

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
we've seen of the intel's version so

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.050 
we've seen of the intel's version so
what<00:00:24.080> what<00:00:24.230> exactly<00:00:24.619> have<00:00:24.770> we<00:00:24.800> got<00:00:25.070> here<00:00:25.189> okay

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
what what exactly have we got here okay

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.050 
what what exactly have we got here okay
so<00:00:26.439> what<00:00:27.439> we're<00:00:27.590> trying<00:00:27.710> to<00:00:27.890> do<00:00:28.010> here<00:00:28.039> is<00:00:28.519> to

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
so what we're trying to do here is to

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.269 
so what we're trying to do here is to
give<00:00:29.510> people<00:00:29.779> more<00:00:30.019> flexibility<00:00:30.740> on<00:00:30.859> how<00:00:30.890> they

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
give people more flexibility on how they

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.180 
give people more flexibility on how they
want<00:00:31.460> to<00:00:31.519> use<00:00:31.609> their<00:00:32.140> nuc<00:00:33.140> case<00:00:33.350> so<00:00:34.070> you<00:00:34.129> can

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
want to use their nuc case so you can

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.160 
want to use their nuc case so you can
see<00:00:34.460> first<00:00:34.940> of<00:00:35.090> first<00:00:35.360> of<00:00:35.480> all<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:35.720> design<00:00:35.870> on

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
see first of first of all the design on

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.820 
see first of first of all the design on
top<00:00:36.440> this<00:00:37.070> is<00:00:37.280> an<00:00:37.519> aluminium<00:00:38.090> top<00:00:38.870> cover<00:00:39.110> that

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
top this is an aluminium top cover that

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.390 
top this is an aluminium top cover that
has<00:00:40.400> hissing<00:00:40.910> fins<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:42.110> there's<00:00:42.890> an<00:00:43.040> Ashley

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
has hissing fins so there's an Ashley

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.610 
has hissing fins so there's an Ashley
heat<00:00:43.610> pipe<00:00:43.820> built<00:00:44.600> underneath<00:00:45.079> and<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:45.440> see

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
heat pipe built underneath and you see

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.680 
heat pipe built underneath and you see
if<00:00:45.680> I<00:00:45.739> could<00:00:45.890> take<00:00:46.010> this

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.260 

so<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.440> see<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.220> part<00:00:50.520> makes

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
so you can see that this part makes

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.640 
so you can see that this part makes
direct<00:00:51.570> contact<00:00:52.020> with<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.200> CPU<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
direct contact with the CPU and the

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.400 
direct contact with the CPU and the
chips<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.070> right<00:00:53.790> so<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.540> directs<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:55.320> heat

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
chips it right so that directs the heat

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.690 
chips it right so that directs the heat
onto<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.700> very<00:00:57.390> thick<00:00:58.070> aluminum<00:00:59.070> cover<00:00:59.280> yeah

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
onto this very thick aluminum cover yeah

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.760 
onto this very thick aluminum cover yeah
so<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.239> actually<00:01:00.510> run<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.840> famous

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
so you can actually run this famous

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.979 
so you can actually run this famous
so<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.400> could<00:01:02.550> play<00:01:02.700> the<00:01:02.879> passive<00:01:03.239> completely

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
so I could play the passive completely

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.410 
so I could play the passive completely
pass<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.440> but<00:01:05.190> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.400> also<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.240> we

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
pass it but you can also see that we

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.540 
pass it but you can also see that we
have<00:01:06.690> a<00:01:06.720> fan<00:01:07.320> mount<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.190> bottom<00:01:08.520> of

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
have a fan mount here on the bottom of

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.540 
have a fan mount here on the bottom of
the<00:01:08.760> casing<00:01:08.970> yeah<00:01:10.040> that<00:01:11.040> will<00:01:11.190> allow<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
the casing yeah that will allow you to

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.740 
the casing yeah that will allow you to
mount<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.330> fan<00:01:12.630> like<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.830> cool<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:15.570> case

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
mount a fan like this to cool the case

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.320 
mount a fan like this to cool the case
even<00:01:16.050> more<00:01:16.110> yeah<00:01:16.940> you<00:01:17.940> know<00:01:18.030> some<00:01:18.210> people

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
even more yeah you know some people

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.880 
even more yeah you know some people
might<00:01:18.540> be<00:01:18.600> wondering<00:01:18.780> why<00:01:19.110> why<00:01:19.410> do<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.619> need<00:01:19.740> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
might be wondering why why do we need to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.280 
might be wondering why why do we need to
do<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:20.970> that's<00:01:21.149> because<00:01:21.300> you<00:01:22.200> know

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
do this I think that's because you know

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.200 
do this I think that's because you know
during<00:01:22.530> testing<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.070> found<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.399> that<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
during testing we found that that the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.920 
during testing we found that that the
external<00:01:25.020> casing<00:01:25.470> can<00:01:25.800> get<00:01:25.979> up<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.160> past<00:01:26.930> 60

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
external casing can get up to past 60

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.050 
external casing can get up to past 60
degrees<00:01:28.229> Celsius<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:29.460> gonna<00:01:29.580> be<00:01:29.700> hot<00:01:29.910> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
degrees Celsius it's gonna be hot to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.270 
degrees Celsius it's gonna be hot to
touch<00:01:30.270> yeah<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:31.020> CPU<00:01:31.410> that's<00:01:31.649> quite<00:01:32.160> all

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
touch yeah for CPU that's quite all

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.670 
touch yeah for CPU that's quite all
right<00:01:32.509> by<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.840> skins<00:01:34.550> obviously<00:01:35.550> cause<00:01:36.330> very

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
right by for skins obviously cause very

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.410 
right by for skins obviously cause very
great<00:01:37.680> discomfort<00:01:38.039> so<00:01:38.430> I'm<00:01:39.060> with<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> whole

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
great discomfort so I'm with the whole

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.999 
great discomfort so I'm with the whole
unit<00:01:39.750> being<00:01:39.899> made<00:01:40.110> out<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.350> metal<00:01:40.470> no<00:01:40.830> matter

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
unit being made out of metal no matter

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.440 
unit being made out of metal no matter
where<00:01:41.160> you<00:01:41.310> touch<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.729> you're<00:01:41.940> you're<00:01:42.360> gonna

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
where you touch it you're you're gonna

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.210 
where you touch it you're you're gonna
get<00:01:42.660> burned<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.050> if<00:01:43.289> you're<00:01:43.410> storing<00:01:43.740> away<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
get burned so if you're storing away the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.249 
get burned so if you're storing away the
case<00:01:44.479> somewhere<00:01:45.479> where<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.750> can't<00:01:45.960> touch<00:01:46.080> it

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
case somewhere where you can't touch it

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.770 
case somewhere where you can't touch it
and<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.680> fine<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.100> run<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> friendless<00:01:47.850> but

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and it's fine to run it friendless but

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.050 
and it's fine to run it friendless but
if<00:01:49.200> you're<00:01:49.410> you<00:01:49.920> know<00:01:49.950> putting<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> desk

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
if you're you know putting it on a desk

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.990 
if you're you know putting it on a desk
where<00:01:51.289> somebody<00:01:52.289> have<00:01:52.590> access<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.160> it<00:01:53.280> their

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
where somebody have access to it their

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.580 
where somebody have access to it their
children<00:01:54.509> they<00:01:54.630> might<00:01:54.840> come<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.170> grab<00:01:55.289> it<00:01:55.470> in

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
children they might come and grab it in

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.350 
children they might come and grab it in
last<00:01:56.190> thing<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.429> want<00:01:56.550> to<00:01:56.580> do<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.849> go<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.179> the
