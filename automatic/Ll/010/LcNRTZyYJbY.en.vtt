00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
point so well and that's the only

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.280 
point so well and that's the only
concern<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.420> ever<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:42.870> nadia<00:00:43.170> petrova

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
concern you ever have with nadia petrova

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.630 
concern you ever have with nadia petrova
the<00:00:43.710> good<00:00:43.860> part<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.100> better<00:00:44.250> against

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the good part of better against

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.639 
the good part of better against
Kuznetsova<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.989> she<00:00:46.079> was<00:00:46.200> able<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.440> really

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
Kuznetsova is it she was able to really

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.799 
Kuznetsova is it she was able to really
close<00:00:47.039> out<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.370> game<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.000> if<00:00:48.059> Nadia<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.600> stay

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
close out that game so if Nadia can stay

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.720 
close out that game so if Nadia can stay
strong<00:00:49.110> mentally<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.829> should<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.520> great

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
strong mentally it should be a great

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.549 
strong mentally it should be a great
game<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.329> can't<00:00:51.690> go<00:00:51.809> past<00:00:52.020> your<00:00:52.230> students

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
game but I can't go past your students

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.799 
game but I can't go past your students
but<00:00:52.649> an<00:00:52.860> amazing<00:00:53.489> comeback<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.539> reckon

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
but an amazing comeback but I reckon

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.660 
but an amazing comeback but I reckon
that<00:00:54.899> might<00:00:55.050> get<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> three<00:00:55.559> sets<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.280> certainly

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
that might get a three sets it certainly

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.310 
that might get a three sets it certainly
looks<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> great<00:00:57.600> game<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.989> kick<00:00:58.170> off

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
looks to be a great game to kick off

he's matched very efficient the only
concern<00:02:33.120> with<00:02:33.390> Andy<00:02:33.630> Murray<00:02:33.810> when<00:02:33.990> he<00:02:34.080> gets<00:02:34.260> to

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
concern with Andy Murray when he gets to

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.710

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
sometimes you can be a little bit too

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.940 
sometimes you can be a little bit too
passive<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.540> maybe<00:02:39.690> allow<00:02:40.020> he's<00:02:40.620> appointed

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
passive and maybe allow he's appointed

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.800 
passive and maybe allow he's appointed
to<00:02:41.310> make<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.760> unforced<00:02:42.240> errors<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.660> one

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
to make the unforced errors the one

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.270 
to make the unforced errors the one
thing<00:02:42.990> we<00:02:43.080> know<00:02:43.200> about<00:02:43.230> refa<00:02:43.710> on<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.890> doll<00:02:44.100> is

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
thing we know about refa on the doll is

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.360 
thing we know about refa on the doll is
he<00:02:44.850> just<00:02:45.120> keeps<00:02:45.420> returning<00:02:45.720> balls<00:02:46.350> he<00:02:47.040> serves

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
he just keeps returning balls he serves

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.190 
he just keeps returning balls he serves
well<00:02:47.700> he's<00:02:48.030> an<00:02:48.150> extremely<00:02:48.510> efficient<00:02:49.020> player

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
well he's an extremely efficient player

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.000 
well he's an extremely efficient player
I<00:02:49.320> think<00:02:49.440> would<00:02:49.500> be<00:02:49.590> too<00:02:49.710> many<00:02:49.830> unforced

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
I think would be too many unforced

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.310 
I think would be too many unforced
errors<00:02:50.550> long<00:02:50.850> rallies<00:02:51.270> I<00:02:51.450> think<00:02:52.050> in<00:02:52.170> this

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
errors long rallies I think in this

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.740 
errors long rallies I think in this
match<00:02:52.560> I'm<00:02:53.280> leading<00:02:53.700> towards<00:02:53.970> Murray<00:02:54.240> I<00:02:54.540> just

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
match I'm leading towards Murray I just

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.440 
match I'm leading towards Murray I just
think<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.020> way<00:02:55.170> he<00:02:55.380> was<00:02:55.550> how<00:02:56.550> animated<00:02:57.000> he<00:02:57.270> was

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
think the way he was how animated he was

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.870 
think the way he was how animated he was
after<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:57.930> when<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.500> couple<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.160> days<00:02:59.310> ago<00:02:59.550> he

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
after that when a couple of days ago he

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.910 
after that when a couple of days ago he
is<00:02:59.910> sensing<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.540> his<00:03:00.690> time<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:00.990> arriving<00:03:01.620> now

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
is sensing that his time is arriving now

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.010 
is sensing that his time is arriving now
to<00:03:01.980> win<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.190> grand<00:03:02.490> slam<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.210> think<00:03:03.420> he

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
to win a grand slam and I just think he

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.420 
to win a grand slam and I just think he
might<00:03:04.290> be<00:03:04.320> able<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.620> find<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.980> couple<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.280> big

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
might be able to find a couple of big

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.920 
might be able to find a couple of big

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
shots to get past a tree fell on the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.390 
shots to get past a tree fell on the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
dial but that is a really hard one to

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.130

call<00:03:08.580> some<00:03:08.820> Thai<00:03:09.030> breakers<00:03:09.480> may<00:03:09.660> be<00:03:09.720> involved

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
in that one and it might just come down

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.760 
in that one and it might just come down
to<00:03:12.030> one<00:03:12.180> freaky<00:03:12.780> shot<00:03:13.050> that'll<00:03:13.260> split<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.590> two
