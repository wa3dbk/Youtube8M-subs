00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
that's in here that makes this inedible

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.430 
that's in here that makes this inedible
and<00:03:57.630> I<00:03:58.440> know<00:03:58.710> a<00:03:58.770> lot<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.070> my<00:03:59.870> acorns<00:04:00.870> were<00:04:01.020> white

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
and I know a lot of my acorns were white

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.640 
and I know a lot of my acorns were white
oak<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.920> what<00:04:02.520> those<00:04:02.700> we<00:04:03.210> have<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:04.500> don't

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
oak and what those we have you don't

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.260 
oak and what those we have you don't
have<00:04:04.800> to<00:04:04.920> do<00:04:05.040> as<00:04:05.190> much<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.490> this<00:04:05.580> processing

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
have to do as much of this processing

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.450 
have to do as much of this processing
but<00:04:06.630> we're<00:04:07.440> gonna<00:04:07.560> do<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:07.980> anyway<00:04:08.070> because<00:04:08.310> I

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
but we're gonna do it anyway because I

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.830 
but we're gonna do it anyway because I

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
just don't want it to be bitter

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.720 
just don't want it to be bitter

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
that how Brown that water is when it

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.170 
that how Brown that water is when it
comes<00:04:25.860> out<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.100> ask<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.430> tannins<00:04:26.910> that<00:04:27.000> are

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
do this anyway again well I put the oven

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.300 
do this anyway again well I put the oven
on<00:05:45.910> the<00:05:46.180> lowest<00:05:46.419> temperature<00:05:47.110> on<00:05:47.740> this<00:05:48.100> one

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
on the lowest temperature on this one

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:59.820 
on the lowest temperature on this one
will<00:05:48.400> go<00:05:48.520> to<00:05:48.550> 170<00:05:58.290> and<00:05:59.290> then<00:05:59.440> you<00:05:59.530> have<00:05:59.650> just

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
will go to 170 and then you have just

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:08.159 
will go to 170 and then you have just
spread<00:06:00.130> this<00:06:00.310> real<00:06:00.520> thin<00:06:00.850> and<00:06:06.900> we'll<00:06:07.900> get<00:06:08.050> it

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
spread this real thin and we'll get it

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.440 
spread this real thin and we'll get it
to<00:06:08.550> dry<00:06:09.550> it<00:06:09.610> out<00:06:09.700> a<00:06:09.790> little<00:06:09.940> bit<00:06:10.090> and<00:06:10.210> then<00:06:10.330> I'll

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
to dry it out a little bit and then I'll

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.130 
to dry it out a little bit and then I'll
rewrite<00:06:10.780> it

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
rewrite it

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.310 
rewrite it
okay<00:06:12.130> well<00:06:12.550> it's<00:06:13.060> all<00:06:13.210> dried<00:06:13.450> out<00:06:13.630> now<00:06:13.660> all<00:06:14.229> I'm

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
okay well it's all dried out now all I'm
