have so much respect for him given that

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.289 
have so much respect for him given that
he<00:03:53.229> is<00:03:53.319> running<00:03:53.530> an<00:03:53.739> all<00:03:53.889> bronze<00:03:54.220> team<00:03:54.549> and<00:03:54.819> he

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
he is running an all bronze team and he

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.780 
he is running an all bronze team and he
was<00:03:55.509> making<00:03:55.780> me<00:03:56.199> scratch<00:03:56.769> my<00:03:57.040> head<00:03:57.069> out<00:03:57.459> there

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
was making me scratch my head out there

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.599 
was making me scratch my head out there
I<00:03:58.449> had<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:59.049> switch<00:03:59.319> up<00:03:59.349> my<00:03:59.560> rotations<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.459> all

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
I had to switch up my rotations and all

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.729 
I had to switch up my rotations and all
that<00:04:00.849> stuff<00:04:01.030> trying<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:01.959> find<00:04:02.139> something<00:04:02.500> that

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
that stuff trying to find something that

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.009 
that stuff trying to find something that
works<00:04:03.189> and<00:04:03.519> I<00:04:04.030> guess<00:04:04.359> getting<00:04:04.659> the<00:04:04.810> basketball

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
works and I guess getting the basketball

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.589 
works and I guess getting the basketball
through<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.859> backboard<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.819> what<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.329> took<00:04:07.540> to

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
through the backboard is what it took to

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.659 
through the backboard is what it took to
beat<00:04:07.989> my<00:04:08.229> opponent<00:04:08.259> so<00:04:08.949> we're<00:04:09.129> currently<00:04:09.340> up

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
beat my opponent so we're currently up

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.399 
beat my opponent so we're currently up
by<00:04:09.849> 10<00:04:10.090> points<00:04:10.329> at<00:04:10.629> the<00:04:10.659> end<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:11.049> the<00:04:11.199> third

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
by 10 points at the end of the third

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.429 
by 10 points at the end of the third
quarter<00:04:11.739> slowly<00:04:12.579> but<00:04:12.969> surely<00:04:13.229> feeling<00:04:14.229> more

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 
quarter slowly but surely feeling more

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.439 
quarter slowly but surely feeling more
confident<00:04:15.069> but<00:04:15.519> you<00:04:15.729> already<00:04:15.849> know<00:04:16.209> the

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
confident but you already know the

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.180 
confident but you already know the
three-point<00:04:16.989> shot<00:04:17.289> and<00:04:17.530> all<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:17.949> is

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
three-point shot and all that is

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.699 
three-point shot and all that is
unstoppable<00:04:18.900> did<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:20.049> see<00:04:20.259> what<00:04:20.500> Gail

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
unstoppable did you see what Gail

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.920 
unstoppable did you see what Gail
Goodrich<00:04:20.949> tit<00:04:21.430> in<00:04:21.579> this<00:04:21.789> play<00:04:22.060> though<00:04:22.330> that

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
Goodrich tit in this play though that

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.690 
Goodrich tit in this play though that
was<00:04:23.199> ridiculous<00:04:23.469> and<00:04:24.310> that

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
was ridiculous and that

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.580 
was ridiculous and that
the<00:04:24.850> main<00:04:25.090> reason<00:04:25.570> why<00:04:25.810> we<00:04:26.020> were<00:04:26.140> never<00:04:26.440> able

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
the main reason why we were never able

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.760 
the main reason why we were never able
to<00:04:27.130> really<00:04:27.490> build<00:04:28.150> up<00:04:28.420> our<00:04:28.600> lead<00:04:28.960> we<00:04:29.560> were

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
to really build up our lead we were

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.830 
to really build up our lead we were
sleeping<00:04:30.460> on<00:04:30.580> defense<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:31.510> there<00:04:31.690> was

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
sleeping on defense and there was

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.870 
sleeping on defense and there was
nothing<00:04:32.230> I<00:04:32.290> can<00:04:32.530> do<00:04:32.680> my<00:04:32.920> opponent<00:04:33.400> was<00:04:33.490> playing

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
nothing I can do my opponent was playing

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.750 
nothing I can do my opponent was playing
a<00:04:34.180> great<00:04:34.630> passing<00:04:35.200> game<00:04:35.470> attacking<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.520> paint

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
a great passing game attacking the paint

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.490 
a great passing game attacking the paint
doing<00:04:37.180> all<00:04:37.390> of<00:04:37.420> those<00:04:37.660> little<00:04:37.960> things<00:04:38.110> out

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
doing all of those little things out

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.770 
doing all of those little things out
there<00:04:38.830> that<00:04:39.040> I<00:04:39.460> usually<00:04:40.060> do<00:04:40.240> when<00:04:40.450> I'm<00:04:40.600> running

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
there that I usually do when I'm running

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
look like one getting all of these easy

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.210 
look like one getting all of these easy
layups<00:05:04.630> to<00:05:04.810> fall<00:05:05.050> all<00:05:05.350> of<00:05:05.470> those<00:05:05.620> three<00:05:05.950> point

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
layups to fall all of those three point

layups to fall all of those three point
shots<00:05:06.550> there<00:05:07.180> was<00:05:07.300> nothing<00:05:07.690> I<00:05:07.810> can<00:05:07.990> do<00:05:08.110> about

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
shots there was nothing I can do about

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.050 
shots there was nothing I can do about
it<00:05:08.470> but<00:05:08.770> at<00:05:08.890> this<00:05:09.070> point<00:05:09.280> in<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.640> game<00:05:09.670> I

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
it but at this point in the game I

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.510 
it but at this point in the game I
decided<00:05:10.750> I<00:05:10.960> had<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.140> go<00:05:11.350> back<00:05:11.590> to<00:05:11.770> basics<00:05:12.310> and

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
decided I had to go back to basics and

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.240 
decided I had to go back to basics and
try<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.090> secure<00:05:13.660> two<00:05:14.020> points<00:05:14.560> after<00:05:14.680> each

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
try and secure two points after each

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.910 
try and secure two points after each
possession<00:05:15.880> and<00:05:16.330> then<00:05:16.660> focus<00:05:16.960> on<00:05:17.260> defense<00:05:17.740> and

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
possession and then focus on defense and

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.250 
possession and then focus on defense and
