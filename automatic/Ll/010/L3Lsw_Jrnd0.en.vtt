00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.100 
basically cut extremely close to the
hairline<00:06:32.190> without<00:06:32.940> cutting<00:06:33.450> the<00:06:33.840> knots

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
hairline without cutting the knots

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.320 
hairline without cutting the knots
that's<00:06:34.950> the<00:06:35.100> easiest<00:06:35.490> way<00:06:35.610> I<00:06:35.669> can<00:06:35.730> explain<00:06:36.180> it

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
that's the easiest way I can explain it

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.150 
that's the easiest way I can explain it
to<00:06:36.360> you<00:06:36.540> guys<00:06:36.690> you<00:06:36.990> want<00:06:37.230> to<00:06:37.440> get<00:06:37.590> all<00:06:37.800> the<00:06:37.980> lace

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
to you guys you want to get all the lace

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.240 
to you guys you want to get all the lace
off<00:06:38.430> so<00:06:38.850> it<00:06:38.970> doesn't<00:06:39.000> like<00:06:39.680> rub<00:06:40.680> on<00:06:40.890> your<00:06:41.039> head

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
off so it doesn't like rub on your head

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.279 
off so it doesn't like rub on your head
but<00:06:41.460> with<00:06:41.669> soft<00:06:42.390> lace<00:06:42.630> it<00:06:42.810> doesn't<00:06:43.080> do<00:06:43.140> that

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:43.289 
but with soft lace it doesn't do that

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.959 
but with soft lace it doesn't do that
anyway<00:06:43.590> but<00:06:43.910> you<00:06:44.910> just<00:06:45.060> want<00:06:45.210> to<00:06:45.270> get<00:06:45.390> as<00:06:45.570> close

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:45.969 
anyway but you just want to get as close

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:48.029 
anyway but you just want to get as close
the<00:06:46.059> hairline<00:06:46.299> as<00:06:46.419> possible<00:06:46.869> without<00:06:47.319> cutting

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039
