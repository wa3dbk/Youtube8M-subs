thing<00:00:15.480> we're<00:00:15.599> going<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.750> do<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.139> step<00:00:16.500> back

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
thing we're going to do is step back

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.529 
thing we're going to do is step back
inside<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.490> passenger<00:00:17.760> compartment<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.069 

all<00:00:32.189> right<00:00:32.550> we<00:00:32.790> have<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> seat<00:00:33.600> set<00:00:33.899> to

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
all right we have the a seat set to

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.139 
all right we have the a seat set to
maximum<00:00:34.620> cool<00:00:34.890> which<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.489> vehicle<00:00:36.000> is

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
maximum cool which on this vehicle is

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.209 
maximum cool which on this vehicle is
sixty<00:00:36.690> degrees<00:00:36.800> we're<00:00:37.800> going<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.980> go<00:00:38.100> ahead

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
sixty degrees we're going to go ahead

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.959 
sixty degrees we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:38.670> attach<00:00:39.059> our<00:00:39.629> charging<00:00:40.290> kit<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.370> low

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
and attach our charging kit to the low

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.330 
and attach our charging kit to the low
side<00:00:42.300> right<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:42.960> now<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.620> low<00:00:43.860> side<00:00:44.129> is

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
side right here now the low side is

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.580 
side right here now the low side is
going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.969> between<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.719> evaporator

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
going to be in between the evaporator

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.580 
going to be in between the evaporator
and<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.430> compressor<00:00:48.090> take<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.989> unscrew<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
and the compressor take and unscrew the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.060 
and the compressor take and unscrew the
cap<00:00:50.870> just<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.350> now<00:00:52.620> you're<00:00:52.739> not<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
cap just like so now you're not going to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.560 
cap just like so now you're not going to
want<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.219> lose<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.579> tab<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.030> either<00:00:54.120> take<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
want to lose this tab so either take and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.510 
want to lose this tab so either take and
put<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.809> your<00:00:54.870> pocket<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.770> your<00:00:56.160> tray

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
put it in your pocket or in your tray

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.639 
put it in your pocket or in your tray
now<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.420> not<00:00:57.570> metal<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.350> won't<00:00:58.530> be

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
now this is not metal so it won't be

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.360 
now this is not metal so it won't be
bagged<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> time<00:01:00.739> once<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> cap

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
bagged at a time once you have the cap

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.250 
bagged at a time once you have the cap
off<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.030> take<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.449> hook<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.840> your

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
off you can take and hook up your

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.080 
off you can take and hook up your
charging<00:01:04.769> line

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
charging line

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.840

you're<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.170> by<00:01:07.850> retracting

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
you're going to do that by retracting

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.929 
you're going to do that by retracting
this<00:01:09.630> device<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.920> see<00:01:11.130> right<00:01:11.280> there

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.700 

you're<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> retract<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.720> flip<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.560> on

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
you're going to retract it flip it on

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.539 
you're going to retract it flip it on
and<00:01:17.009> push<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.789> down<00:01:17.820> into<00:01:18.180> place<00:01:19.369> give<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.490> a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
and push it down into place give it a

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.999 
and push it down into place give it a
tug<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.789> make<00:01:20.909> sure<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.360> there<00:01:21.539> correctly

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
tug to make sure it's on there correctly

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.859 
tug to make sure it's on there correctly
we<00:01:23.009> are<00:01:23.159> now<00:01:23.310> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> take<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.240> open<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.659> the

we are now going to take and open up the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.560 
we are now going to take and open up the
valve<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.380> you'll<00:01:25.679> see<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.729> gauge<00:01:26.939> begin<00:01:27.450> to

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
valve and you'll see the gauge begin to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.090

is<00:02:21.459> how<00:02:21.610> much<00:02:21.880> refrigerant<00:02:22.480> we're<00:02:22.599> supposed

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
is how much refrigerant we're supposed

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.250 
is how much refrigerant we're supposed
to<00:02:23.080> put<00:02:23.290> in<00:02:23.470> one<00:02:24.100> pound<00:02:24.370> 14<00:02:25.150> ounces<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:25.930> just<00:02:26.170> a

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
to put in one pound 14 ounces so just a

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.410 
to put in one pound 14 ounces so just a
little<00:02:26.590> bit<00:02:26.739> over<00:02:26.920> one<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.790> three-quarter

little bit over one and three-quarter

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.009 
little bit over one and three-quarter
pounds<00:02:29.040> you're<00:02:30.040> going<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.220> use<00:02:30.630> r134a<00:02:31.630> and

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
pounds you're going to use r134a and

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.600 
pounds you're going to use r134a and
it's<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.500> only<00:02:32.650> stuff<00:02:33.069> that's<00:02:33.280> available

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
it's the only stuff that's available

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.729 
it's the only stuff that's available
really<00:02:34.120> any<00:02:34.480> more<00:02:34.810> from<00:02:35.080> your<00:02:35.200> automotive

refrigerants the fittings will not

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.449 
refrigerants the fittings will not
attach<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:40.989> it's<00:02:41.410> pretty<00:02:41.590> much<00:02:41.709> impossible<00:02:42.099> to

right there we have now opened it up to

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.640 
right there we have now opened it up to
the<00:04:07.239> system<00:04:07.659> we<00:04:07.780> can<00:04:07.810> take<00:04:08.080> and<00:04:08.260> connect<00:04:08.530> our
