derailleur set up and your adjustment so
to<00:00:14.639> start<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:15.680> we're<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.859> look<00:00:16.949> at<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
to start with we're going to look at the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.120 
to start with we're going to look at the
hanger<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.779> back<00:00:19.260> which<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.980> rear

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
hanger on the back which the rear

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.429 
hanger on the back which the rear
derailleur<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.580> attached<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.480> idea<00:00:22.020> with

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
derailleur is attached to the idea with

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.109 
derailleur is attached to the idea with
the<00:00:22.590> hanger<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.160> these<00:00:23.580> are<00:00:24.590> meant<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:26.189> very

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the hanger is these are meant to very

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.370 
the hanger is these are meant to very
cool<00:00:27.269> also<00:00:27.420> when<00:00:27.660> they<00:00:27.750> do<00:00:27.869> break<00:00:28.080> they<00:00:28.260> are

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
cool also when they do break they are

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.730 
cool also when they do break they are
replaceable<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.939> drop<00:00:30.179> up<00:00:30.740> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
replaceable so this is the drop up the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.150 
replaceable so this is the drop up the
dropout<00:00:32.130> needs<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:33.380> parallel<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
dropout needs to be parallel to the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.040 
dropout needs to be parallel to the
basically<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.180> wheel<00:00:36.360> or<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.630> rim<00:00:36.840> or

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
basically the wheel or the rim or

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.250 
basically the wheel or the rim or
parallel<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.399> cogs<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> back<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:40.230> have

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
parallel to the cogs on the back we have

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.930 
parallel to the cogs on the back we have
a<00:00:40.410> special<00:00:40.710> tool<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.370> use<00:00:41.399> called<00:00:41.850> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
a special tool that we use called a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.510 
a special tool that we use called a
dropout<00:00:42.270> alignment<00:00:42.809> gauge<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.980> threads<00:00:44.309> in

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
dropout alignment gauge it threads in

00:00:44.520 --> 00:01:06.100 
dropout alignment gauge it threads in
here<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:50.600> threads<00:00:51.600> into<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> dropout

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.719 

between<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> rim<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.740> surface<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
between the rim and the surface at the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.149 
between the rim and the surface at the
top<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.900> compare<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.799> bottom

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
top we can compare that to the bottom

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.490 
top we can compare that to the bottom
and<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.720> make<00:01:12.810> adjustments<00:01:13.380> accordingly

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and we can make adjustments accordingly

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.649 
and we can make adjustments accordingly
by<00:01:14.070> bending<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.610> hanger<00:01:15.030> slightly<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.630> that

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
by bending this hanger slightly so that

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.039 
by bending this hanger slightly so that
it's<00:01:15.810> parallel<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.659> columns<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.810> left

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
it's parallel to the columns on the left

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.719 
it's parallel to the columns on the left
this<00:01:20.040> one<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.340> straight<00:01:20.610> when<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.750> take<00:01:22.500> this

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
this one is straight when we take this

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.240 
this one is straight when we take this
hanger<00:01:23.729> off<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.570> your<00:01:24.750> lines<00:01:24.960> cool<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:26.070> can

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
hanger off and your lines cool you can

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.289 
hanger off and your lines cool you can
then<00:01:27.530> attach<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.590> rear<00:01:29.070> derailleur<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.790> the

then attach the rear derailleur to the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:44.400 
then attach the rear derailleur to the
drop

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.930 

okay<00:01:45.410> now<00:01:46.190> we're<00:01:46.310> going<00:01:46.370> to<00:01:46.460> have<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.640> look<00:01:46.820> at

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
okay now we're going to have a look at

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:57.640 
okay now we're going to have a look at
the<00:01:47.090> front<00:01:47.480> derailleur<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:57.170> at<00:01:57.290> this<00:01:57.410> point

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
the front derailleur so at this point

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.730 
the front derailleur so at this point
the<00:01:58.370> cables<00:01:58.730> are<00:01:58.820> unattached<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.780> we're

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
the cables are unattached and we're

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.900 
the cables are unattached and we're
going<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:00.980> start<00:02:01.160> with<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.340> front<00:02:01.670> derailleur

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
going to start with the front derailleur

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.900 
going to start with the front derailleur
setup<00:02:02.570> there's<00:02:03.410> four<00:02:03.740> stages<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.490> adjusting

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
setup there's four stages to adjusting

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.900 
setup there's four stages to adjusting
the<00:02:04.970> french<00:02:05.180> earlier<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:09.590> four<00:02:10.160> steps<00:02:10.729> to

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
the french earlier the four steps to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.640 
the french earlier the four steps to
adjusting<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.540> front<00:02:11.750> derailleur<00:02:11.959> or<00:02:12.350> height

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
adjusting the front derailleur or height

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.100 
adjusting the front derailleur or height
and<00:02:12.890> angle<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.640> first<00:02:13.880> step<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:14.810> would

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
and angle is the first step so you would

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.990 
and angle is the first step so you would
open<00:02:15.800> up<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.040> clamp<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.790> front

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
open up the clamp on the front

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.990 
open up the clamp on the front
derailleur<00:02:17.240> and<00:02:18.250> at<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.459> point<00:02:19.700> with<00:02:19.910> the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
derailleur and at this point with the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.390 
derailleur and at this point with the
clam<00:02:20.209> open<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:22.100> derailleur<00:02:22.700> can<00:02:23.120> move<00:02:24.130> up<00:02:25.130> and

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
clam open the derailleur can move up and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.870 
clam open the derailleur can move up and
down<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:25.790> also<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:28.010> can<00:02:28.160> change<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.580> angle

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
down and also you can change the angle

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.580 
down and also you can change the angle
of<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.000> derailleur<00:02:29.360> so<00:02:29.990> on<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.230> set<00:02:30.440> up

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
of the derailleur so on the set up

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.290 
of the derailleur so on the set up
basically<00:02:31.400> what<00:02:31.640> you're<00:02:31.730> looking<00:02:32.000> for<00:02:32.209> is

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
basically what you're looking for is

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.600 
basically what you're looking for is
that<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:33.230> teeth<00:02:33.530> on<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.860> large<00:02:34.070> chain<00:02:34.430> ring

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
that the teeth on the large chain ring

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.790 
that the teeth on the large chain ring
and<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.060> outer<00:02:35.270> cage<00:02:35.690> here<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.200> the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
and the outer cage here and the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.140 
and the outer cage here and the
difference<00:02:37.160> between<00:02:37.310> those<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.880> space

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
difference between those the space

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.350 
difference between those the space
between<00:02:38.390> those<00:02:38.810> needs<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.830> be<00:02:40.360> 123

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
between those needs to be 123

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.890 
between those needs to be 123
