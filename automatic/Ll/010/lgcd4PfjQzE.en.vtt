00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
well the one thing I did notice it just

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.759 
well the one thing I did notice it just
has<00:04:15.250> this<00:04:15.489> kind<00:04:15.820> of<00:04:15.940> ornamental<00:04:16.900> hole<00:04:17.350> here

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
has this kind of ornamental hole here

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.969 
has this kind of ornamental hole here
you<00:04:18.250> can<00:04:18.430> almost<00:04:18.700> use<00:04:19.269> it<00:04:19.299> as<00:04:19.660> an<00:04:20.350> opening<00:04:20.739> hole

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
you can almost use it as an opening hole

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.210 
you can almost use it as an opening hole
but<00:04:21.220> not<00:04:21.430> quite<00:04:22.169> so<00:04:23.169> it<00:04:23.620> would<00:04:23.770> actually<00:04:23.919> be

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
but not quite so it would actually be

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.490 
but not quite so it would actually be
cool<00:04:24.430> if<00:04:24.610> they<00:04:24.789> could<00:04:25.030> either<00:04:25.690> extend

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
cool if they could either extend

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.100 
cool if they could either extend
this<00:04:26.590> or<00:04:26.830> move<00:04:27.040> this<00:04:27.280> whole<00:04:27.520> -<00:04:28.210> maybe<00:04:28.420> there<00:04:28.810> I

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
this or move this whole - maybe there I

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.110 
this or move this whole - maybe there I
mean<00:04:29.620> I<00:04:29.710> know<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:29.950> already<00:04:30.130> has<00:04:30.340> a<00:04:30.370> flip<00:04:30.730> or<00:04:30.940> an

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
mean I know it already has a flip or an

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.270 
mean I know it already has a flip or an
thumb<00:04:31.450> studs<00:04:31.750> but<00:04:32.080> if<00:04:32.740> you're<00:04:32.860> gonna<00:04:32.980> put<00:04:33.250> a

thumb studs but if you're gonna put a

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.400 
thumb studs but if you're gonna put a
lightning<00:04:33.790> hole<00:04:34.000> there<00:04:34.300> if<00:04:34.810> they<00:04:35.050> would<00:04:35.230> move

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
lightning hole there if they would move

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.400 
lightning hole there if they would move
that<00:04:35.650> hole<00:04:35.980> up<00:04:36.310> there<00:04:37.060> then<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.110> would<00:04:38.230> have

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
that hole up there then it would have

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.540 
that hole up there then it would have
