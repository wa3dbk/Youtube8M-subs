choice make sure that the fabric is a
very<00:07:29.139> close<00:07:29.590> weave<00:07:30.540> because<00:07:31.540> otherwise<00:07:31.990> when

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:32.590 
very close weave because otherwise when

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.790 
very close weave because otherwise when
the<00:07:33.180> water<00:07:34.180> storm<00:07:34.540> crystals<00:07:35.080> soak<00:07:35.440> up<00:07:35.620> the

water they'll actually come out of the

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.350 
water they'll actually come out of the
fabric<00:07:38.440> if<00:07:38.889> they<00:07:39.160> if<00:07:39.400> you<00:07:39.490> don't<00:07:39.699> have<00:07:40.030> a<00:07:40.060> tight

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 
weave so there you go

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:44.790 
weave so there you go
it's<00:07:42.850> done<00:07:43.270> and<00:07:43.570> you'll<00:07:44.260> just<00:07:44.470> put<00:07:44.650> this
