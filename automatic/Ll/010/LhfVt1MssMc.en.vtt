what I'm doing is I'm measuring one

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:15.529 
what I'm doing is I'm measuring one
continuous<00:00:12.089> piece<00:00:12.740> so<00:00:13.740> from<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.159> the<00:00:15.089> outside

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:15.539 
continuous piece so from the the outside

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.669 
continuous piece so from the the outside
wall<00:00:16.220> the<00:00:17.220> edge<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.699> outside<00:00:18.060> wall<00:00:18.679> which

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:19.679 
wall the edge of the outside wall which

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.249 
wall the edge of the outside wall which
runs<00:00:19.949> perpendicular<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.140> partition<00:00:22.140> wall

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259 
runs perpendicular to the partition wall

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.239 
runs perpendicular to the partition wall
that<00:00:22.439> I'm<00:00:22.529> repairing<00:00:23.150> to<00:00:24.619> the<00:00:25.619> portion<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:26.249 
that I'm repairing to the portion of the

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.150 
that I'm repairing to the portion of the
sill<00:00:26.519> that's<00:00:27.119> remaining<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.749> the<00:00:27.839> bathroom<00:00:28.289> is

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
sill that's remaining in the bathroom is

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.540 
sill that's remaining in the bathroom is
60<00:00:29.579> and<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> half<00:00:29.880> inches<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:31.009> that's<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.220> line

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
60 and a half inches so that's this line

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.770 
60 and a half inches so that's this line
here<00:00:34.790> so<00:00:35.790> after<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.480> mark

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
here so after I get that mark

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.130 
here so after I get that mark
established<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:38.390> went<00:00:39.390> ahead<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.630> started<00:00:39.810> to

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
established I went ahead and started to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.560 
established I went ahead and started to
measure<00:00:40.350> out<00:00:40.650> my<00:00:40.680> circles<00:00:41.310> for<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.360> sewer

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
measure out my circles for the sewer

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.640 
measure out my circles for the sewer
pipes<00:00:42.900> in<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.110> bathroom<00:00:45.020> so<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> measured<00:00:46.440> from

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
pipes in the bathroom so I measured from

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.050 
pipes in the bathroom so I measured from
the<00:00:46.800> edge<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.360> board<00:00:48.360> over<00:00:48.570> there<00:00:49.400> all<00:00:50.400> the

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
the edge of the board over there all the

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.770 
the edge of the board over there all the
way<00:00:51.150> over<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.540> the<00:00:51.660> first<00:00:51.900> pipe<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:53.730> made<00:00:54.630> my

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
way over to the first pipe and made my

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.870 
way over to the first pipe and made my
mark<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.200> first<00:00:55.440> pipe<00:00:55.740> the<00:00:56.340> measurement<00:00:56.790> to

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
mark the first pipe the measurement to

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
mark the first pipe the measurement to
the<00:00:57.000> first<00:00:57.240> pipe<00:00:57.510> was<00:00:57.860> 50<00:00:58.860> and<00:00:58.890> 1/8<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.900> the

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
the first pipe was 50 and 1/8 and the

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.960 
the first pipe was 50 and 1/8 and the
diameter<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.620> pipe<00:01:01.830> the<00:01:02.220> first<00:01:02.490> pipe<00:01:02.730> is

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
diameter the pipe the first pipe is

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.260 
diameter the pipe the first pipe is
three<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.360> half<00:01:03.510> inches<00:01:04.790> instead<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:06.030> using

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
three and a half inches instead of using

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.170 
three and a half inches instead of using
a<00:01:06.540> three<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> half<00:01:07.140> inch<00:01:07.550> hole<00:01:08.550> or<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> cutout

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
a three and a half inch hole or a cutout

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.410 
a three and a half inch hole or a cutout
I<00:01:09.540> decided<00:01:10.440> to<00:01:10.560> go<00:01:10.680> with<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> four<00:01:11.190> inch<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.360> I

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
I decided to go with a four inch so I

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.760 
I decided to go with a four inch so I
can<00:01:12.570> give<00:01:12.690> myself<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.110> little<00:01:13.140> bit<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.560> play

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
can give myself a little bit of play

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.610 
can give myself a little bit of play
when<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.600> when<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.630> start<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.020> patch<00:01:16.230> this<00:01:16.409> whole

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
when I when I start to patch this whole

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.670 
when I when I start to patch this whole
thing<00:01:16.830> back<00:01:17.010> together<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:20.840> measuring<00:01:21.840> from<00:01:22.110> 50

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
thing back together so measuring from 50

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.500 
thing back together so measuring from 50
and<00:01:22.800> two<00:01:23.010> sixteenths<00:01:23.610> over<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.940> quarter<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.420> an

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
and two sixteenths over a quarter of an

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.149 
and two sixteenths over a quarter of an
inch<00:01:25.970> on<00:01:26.970> either<00:01:27.480> side<00:01:27.900> which<00:01:28.590> makes<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
inch on either side which makes up the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.649 
inch on either side which makes up the
half-inch<00:01:29.670> difference<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.300> made<00:01:33.540> that

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
half-inch difference so I made that

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.480 
half-inch difference so I made that
first<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.260> is<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.440> first<00:01:34.560> circle<00:01:35.159> here<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
first this is the first circle here the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.000 
first this is the first circle here the
first<00:01:35.700> edge<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.060> circle<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.920> again

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
first edge of the circle here so again

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.350 
first edge of the circle here so again
like<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.370> said<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.550> have<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> little<00:01:38.970> bit<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.150> play

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
like I said I have a little bit of play

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.690 
like I said I have a little bit of play
on<00:01:39.540> either<00:01:39.720> side<00:01:40.080> of<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.800> pipe<00:01:42.530> then<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.830> took<00:01:44.460> a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
on either side of the pipe then I took a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.620 
on either side of the pipe then I took a
straightedge<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:46.280> measured<00:01:47.280> set<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> straight

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
straightedge and measured set a straight

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.830 
straightedge and measured set a straight
edge<00:01:48.750> across<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.380> walls<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:50.100> studs<00:01:50.840> they

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
edge across the walls the studs they

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.620 
edge across the walls the studs they
measured<00:01:52.260> from<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.740> straight<00:01:53.040> edge<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.630> this

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
measured from that straight edge to this

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.940 
measured from that straight edge to this
front<00:01:54.870> part<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> pipe<00:01:55.530> here<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.690> that<00:01:57.690> was

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
front part of the pipe here and that was

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.370 
front part of the pipe here and that was
3/16<00:01:59.450> actually<00:02:00.450> I'm<00:02:00.510> sorry<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.869> mark<00:02:01.170> here

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
3/16 actually I'm sorry this mark here

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.000 
3/16 actually I'm sorry this mark here
represents<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:04.020> represents<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> front

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
represents the that represents the front

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.960 
represents the that represents the front
part<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> pipe

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
part of the pipe

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.600 
part of the pipe
and<00:02:07.570> then<00:02:07.990> what<00:02:08.350> I<00:02:08.380> did<00:02:08.619> was<00:02:08.770> I<00:02:08.890> drew<00:02:09.100> my<00:02:09.280> four

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
and then what I did was I drew my four

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.820 
and then what I did was I drew my four
inch<00:02:09.820> circle<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.479> little<00:02:10.510> bit<00:02:10.810> outside<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.500> that

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
inch circle a little bit outside of that

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.520 
inch circle a little bit outside of that
mark<00:02:12.130> so<00:02:13.030> again<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.360> have<00:02:13.570> a<00:02:13.600> tiny<00:02:13.990> bit<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.320> play

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
mark so again I have a tiny bit of play

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.750 
mark so again I have a tiny bit of play
but<00:02:14.590> since<00:02:15.070> there's<00:02:15.220> not<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.400> whole<00:02:15.580> lot<00:02:15.610> of

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
but since there's not a whole lot of

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.900 
but since there's not a whole lot of
wood<00:02:16.000> left<00:02:16.210> here<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:17.200> know<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.490> I'm<00:02:18.490> not<00:02:18.760> going

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
wood left here you know I I'm not going

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.910 
wood left here you know I I'm not going
to<00:02:18.970> make<00:02:19.120> my<00:02:19.300> cut<00:02:19.570> too<00:02:19.840> close<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.440> edge<00:02:20.590> but

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
to make my cut too close to the edge but

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.540 
to make my cut too close to the edge but
it's<00:02:21.400> already<00:02:21.730> close<00:02:21.940> enough<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:24.070> that<00:02:24.100> that's

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
it's already close enough so that that's

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.600 
it's already close enough so that that's
the<00:02:24.730> first<00:02:24.910> circle<00:02:25.390> there<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:27.340> did<00:02:27.490> the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
the first circle there and I did the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.280 
the first circle there and I did the
same<00:02:27.850> thing<00:02:28.090> on<00:02:28.210> this<00:02:28.420> one<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.020> two<00:02:29.260> and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
same thing on this one this is a two and

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.780 
same thing on this one this is a two and
a<00:02:29.440> half<00:02:29.620> inch<00:02:29.830> circle<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.770> pipe<00:02:33.010> diameter

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
a half inch circle in the pipe diameter

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.040 
a half inch circle in the pipe diameter
is<00:02:34.060> two<00:02:34.390> inches<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:37.360> edge<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.840> pipe

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
is two inches and the edge of the pipe

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.110 
is two inches and the edge of the pipe
from<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.830> straight<00:02:39.160> edge<00:02:39.340> across<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.750> studs

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
from the straight edge across the studs

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.710 
from the straight edge across the studs
was<00:02:43.230> 7/16<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.430> got<00:02:45.730> my<00:02:46.060> circle<00:02:46.420> running<00:02:46.690> a

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
was 7/16 so I got my circle running a

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.630 
was 7/16 so I got my circle running a
little<00:02:46.960> outside<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.280> have<00:02:48.370> again<00:02:48.610> I

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
little outside that so I have again I

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.890 
little outside that so I have again I
have<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.820> little<00:02:49.000> bit<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.180> play<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:52.330> once<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:52.720> get

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
have a little bit of play so once I get

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.580 
have a little bit of play so once I get
this<00:02:53.050> all<00:02:53.260> cut<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.590> get<00:02:53.830> all<00:02:53.950> my<00:02:54.100> circles<00:02:54.640> made

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
this all cut and get all my circles made

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.750 
this all cut and get all my circles made
and<00:02:56.590> actually<00:02:56.830> I'll<00:02:57.100> show<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.340> what<00:02:57.550> I'll<00:02:57.640> be

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
and actually I'll show you what I'll be

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.140 
and actually I'll show you what I'll be
using<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:58.150> make<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.420> circles<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.120> a

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
using to make the circles so this is a

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.740 
using to make the circles so this is a
two<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.600> half<00:03:01.780> inch<00:03:02.050> hole<00:03:02.350> saw<00:03:03.510> this<00:03:04.510> is

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
two and a half inch hole saw this is

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.510 
two and a half inch hole saw this is
made<00:03:05.680> for<00:03:05.950> cutting<00:03:06.160> through<00:03:07.620> two<00:03:08.620> by<00:03:08.800> sixes<00:03:09.310> or

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
made for cutting through two by sixes or

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.420 
made for cutting through two by sixes or
two-inch<00:03:10.210> would<00:03:10.590> like<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.739> buy<00:03:11.860> for<00:03:12.100> us<00:03:12.190> two<00:03:12.340> by

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
two-inch would like to buy for us two by

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.979 
two-inch would like to buy for us two by
sixes<00:03:12.820> and<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:16.239> that's<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.540> two<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> half

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
sixes and so that's the two and a half

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.410 
sixes and so that's the two and a half
inch<00:03:17.230> one<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:17.590> got<00:03:17.709> these<00:03:17.830> at<00:03:18.010> Home<00:03:18.160> Depot<00:03:18.420> this

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
inch one I got these at Home Depot this

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.590 
inch one I got these at Home Depot this
is<00:03:19.600> called<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.930> bi-metal<00:03:20.350> hole<00:03:20.650> saw<00:03:21.300> cuts<00:03:22.300> wood

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
is called a bi-metal hole saw cuts wood

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:32.400 
is called a bi-metal hole saw cuts wood
and<00:03:22.810> metal<00:03:24.300> this<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.600> four-inch<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:31.410> so

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
and metal this is the four-inch and so

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.490 
and metal this is the four-inch and so
how<00:03:32.560> that<00:03:32.590> works<00:03:32.770> is<00:03:33.900> this<00:03:34.900> is<00:03:34.959> called<00:03:35.380> the

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
how that works is this is called the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.750 
how that works is this is called the
Arbor<00:03:35.920> here<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:38.560> screws<00:03:38.890> in<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.370> back<00:03:39.550> of

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
Arbor here this screws in to the back of

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.360 
Arbor here this screws in to the back of
the<00:03:39.850> hole<00:03:40.030> saw<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.650> then<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.739> attach<00:03:41.860> this

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
the hole saw and then you attach this

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.040 
the hole saw and then you attach this
this<00:03:43.269> end<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.660> bit<00:03:43.900> here<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.430> drill<00:03:46.050> good

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
this end of the bit here to a drill good

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.650 
this end of the bit here to a drill good
cordless<00:03:47.410> drill<00:03:47.680> or<00:03:48.670> corded<00:03:49.150> drill<00:03:49.360> like<00:03:49.510> one

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
cordless drill or corded drill like one

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.759 
cordless drill or corded drill like one
of<00:03:49.750> these<00:03:49.840> over<00:03:50.110> here

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.410 

and<00:03:53.769> so<00:03:54.010> you<00:03:54.069> can<00:03:54.370> set<00:03:54.610> your<00:03:54.819> you<00:03:55.269> can

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
and so you can set your you can

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.429 
and so you can set your you can
basically<00:03:57.390> set<00:03:58.390> this<00:03:58.540> down<00:03:58.750> like<00:03:58.959> that<00:03:59.170> you

00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 
basically set this down like that you

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.830 
basically set this down like that you
can<00:04:00.310> kind<00:04:00.459> of<00:04:00.489> imagine<00:04:00.609> this<00:04:01.000> is<00:04:01.180> screwed<00:04:01.719> into

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
can kind of imagine this is screwed into

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.809 
can kind of imagine this is screwed into
the<00:04:02.049> back<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.950> you<00:04:03.040> can<00:04:03.189> almost<00:04:03.310> use<00:04:03.609> this

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
the back and you can almost use this

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.509 
the back and you can almost use this
little<00:04:04.180> bit<00:04:04.540> edge<00:04:04.840> here<00:04:05.230> or<00:04:06.099> the<00:04:06.189> end<00:04:06.340> of<00:04:06.459> the

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
little bit edge here or the end of the

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.059 
little bit edge here or the end of the
bit<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:06.969> kind<00:04:07.870> of<00:04:07.930> start<00:04:08.200> a<00:04:08.260> paddle<00:04:08.590> so<00:04:08.739> Paolo

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
bit to kind of start a paddle so Paolo

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.110 
bit to kind of start a paddle so Paolo
so<00:04:09.250> what<00:04:09.370> I'll<00:04:09.459> probably<00:04:09.609> be<00:04:09.760> doing<00:04:09.939> is<00:04:10.000> like

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
so what I'll probably be doing is like

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.580 
so what I'll probably be doing is like
pressing<00:04:10.450> down<00:04:10.750> it's<00:04:10.989> in<00:04:11.079> the<00:04:11.109> wood<00:04:11.319> just<00:04:11.470> to

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
pressing down it's in the wood just to

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.720 
pressing down it's in the wood just to
'county<00:04:11.920> get<00:04:12.609> myself<00:04:12.790> centered<00:04:13.299> and<00:04:13.590> then

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
'county get myself centered and then

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.920 
'county get myself centered and then
continue<00:04:15.730> on<00:04:15.790> with<00:04:15.909> making<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.539> cut<00:04:16.720> through

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
continue on with making the cut through

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.009 
continue on with making the cut through
all<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.139> way<00:04:17.259> straight<00:04:17.560> through<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:17.859> wood<00:04:19.019> so

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
all the way straight through the wood so

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.129 
all the way straight through the wood so
after<00:04:20.320> I'm<00:04:20.440> done<00:04:20.590> making<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:21.100> cuts<00:04:22.020> what<00:04:23.020> I'll

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
after I'm done making the cuts what I'll

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.400 
after I'm done making the cuts what I'll
do<00:04:23.350> is<00:04:23.650> I'm<00:04:24.400> gonna<00:04:24.550> slice<00:04:24.940> at<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.960> right<00:04:26.259> at

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
do is I'm gonna slice at the right at

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.260 
do is I'm gonna slice at the right at
the<00:04:26.530> midpoint<00:04:27.310> of<00:04:27.729> each<00:04:27.910> one<00:04:28.120> of<00:04:28.210> these

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
the midpoint of each one of these

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.120 
the midpoint of each one of these
circles<00:04:28.509> in<00:04:28.780> this<00:04:28.900> slice<00:04:29.169> all<00:04:29.470> across<00:04:30.070> here

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
circles in this slice all across here

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.860 
circles in this slice all across here
and<00:04:31.229> across<00:04:32.229> here<00:04:32.830> so<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.240> can<00:04:34.300> sandwich

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
and across here so that I can sandwich

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.089 
and across here so that I can sandwich
the<00:04:35.080> wood<00:04:35.110> around<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.800> pipes<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:37.889> to<00:04:38.889> keep

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
the wood around the pipes and to keep

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.129 
the wood around the pipes and to keep
the<00:04:39.250> wood<00:04:39.460> firmly<00:04:39.849> together<00:04:40.360> after<00:04:40.840> I've<00:04:40.960> done

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
the wood firmly together after I've done

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.290 
the wood firmly together after I've done
made<00:04:41.320> those<00:04:41.500> cuts<00:04:41.830> I'm<00:04:42.580> gonna<00:04:42.729> be<00:04:42.880> using<00:04:43.030> one

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
made those cuts I'm gonna be using one

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.760 
made those cuts I'm gonna be using one
of<00:04:43.330> these<00:04:43.479> brackets<00:04:43.840> here<00:04:44.229> these<00:04:44.590> are

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
of these brackets here these are

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.460 
of these brackets here these are
one-inch<00:04:45.449> brackets<00:04:46.449> that<00:04:46.630> go<00:04:46.660> on<00:04:46.900> either<00:04:47.110> side

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
one-inch brackets that go on either side

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
to one here over here here over here so

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.659 
to one here over here here over here so
that'll<00:04:59.050> take<00:04:59.199> care<00:04:59.260> of<00:04:59.500> the<00:05:00.010> holes<00:05:00.250> and

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
that'll take care of the holes and

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.390 
that'll take care of the holes and
making<00:05:01.289> the<00:05:02.289> connection<00:05:02.440> or<00:05:02.949> making<00:05:03.250> the

replacing the sill on that part of the
wall<00:05:05.789> and<00:05:06.789> then<00:05:06.940> attempt<00:05:07.300> to<00:05:07.330> attach<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:08.110> sill

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
wall and then attempt to attach the sill

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.200 
wall and then attempt to attach the sill
to<00:05:08.650> the<00:05:08.800> existing<00:05:09.340> portion<00:05:09.789> of<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.030> wall

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.290 
to the existing portion of the wall
that's<00:05:10.510> still<00:05:10.780> remaining<00:05:11.849> I'm<00:05:12.849> gonna<00:05:13.030> use<00:05:13.180> the

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
that's still remaining I'm gonna use the

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.080 
that's still remaining I'm gonna use the
same<00:05:13.330> brackets<00:05:13.960> here<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:15.340> here<00:05:17.580> so<00:05:18.580> that

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
same brackets here and here so that

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.149 
same brackets here and here so that
takes<00:05:19.270> care<00:05:19.419> of<00:05:19.599> the<00:05:19.810> sill<00:05:20.050> in<00:05:20.500> preparing<00:05:21.070> the

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:21.159 
takes care of the sill in preparing the

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:23.100 
takes care of the sill in preparing the
sill<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:21.610> then<00:05:22.240> how<00:05:22.449> will<00:05:22.690> probably<00:05:23.020> be

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
sill and then how will probably be

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.409 
sill and then how will probably be
attaching<00:05:23.409> the<00:05:23.620> sill<00:05:23.919> to<00:05:24.190> the<00:05:24.370> to<00:05:25.300> the

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
attaching the sill to the to the

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.680 
attaching the sill to the to the
subfloor<00:05:26.130> is<00:05:27.130> I'll<00:05:27.760> be<00:05:27.849> using<00:05:28.000> probably<00:05:28.479> three

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
subfloor is I'll be using probably three

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.689 
subfloor is I'll be using probably three
and<00:05:28.720> a<00:05:28.870> half<00:05:29.080> inch<00:05:29.320> or<00:05:29.500> three<00:05:29.710> inch<00:05:29.740> screws<00:05:30.250> to

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
and a half inch or three inch screws to

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.779 
and a half inch or three inch screws to
screw<00:05:30.820> it<00:05:31.150> in<00:05:31.240> to<00:05:31.419> the<00:05:31.630> to<00:05:32.229> the<00:05:32.349> subfloor<00:05:32.789> those

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
screw it in to the to the subfloor those

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.430 
screw it in to the to the subfloor those
are<00:05:33.970> probably<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.240> exterior<00:05:34.750> wood<00:05:34.930> screws<00:05:35.260> or

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
are probably the exterior wood screws or

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.029 
are probably the exterior wood screws or
exterior<00:05:35.800> screws<00:05:35.979> of<00:05:36.190> some<00:05:36.310> kind

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
exterior screws of some kind

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.490 
exterior screws of some kind
and<00:05:39.039> then<00:05:39.970> I<00:05:40.210> probably<00:05:41.020> using<00:05:41.409> these

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
and then I probably using these

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.100 
and then I probably using these
countersink<00:05:42.099> bits<00:05:42.370> so<00:05:43.270> they<00:05:43.449> countersink

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
countersink bits so they countersink

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.100 
countersink bits so they countersink
through<00:05:44.460> through<00:05:45.460> the<00:05:45.580> wood<00:05:45.789> and<00:05:46.389> into<00:05:47.020> the

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
through through the wood and into the

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.830 
through through the wood and into the
subfloor<00:05:47.610> it'll<00:05:48.610> also<00:05:48.729> be<00:05:49.060> countersinking

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
subfloor it'll also be countersinking

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.529 
subfloor it'll also be countersinking
the<00:05:50.139> screws<00:05:50.470> that<00:05:50.710> go<00:05:50.820> through<00:05:51.820> the<00:05:52.000> suck<00:05:52.300> the

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
the screws that go through the suck the

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.710 
the screws that go through the suck the
studs<00:05:52.870> into<00:05:53.169> the<00:05:53.530> wall<00:05:54.310> so<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:55.479> replacement

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
studs into the wall so the replacement

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.029 
studs into the wall so the replacement
walls<00:05:56.199> oh<00:05:56.460> so<00:05:57.460> that's<00:05:58.180> it<00:05:58.389> from<00:05:58.570> here<00:05:58.800> and<00:05:59.800> some

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
walls oh so that's it from here and some

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.529 
walls oh so that's it from here and some
