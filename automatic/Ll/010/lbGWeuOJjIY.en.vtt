keys on your HTC One this is something I

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.870 
keys on your HTC One this is something I
was<00:00:11.880> slightly<00:00:12.509> pessimistic<00:00:12.780> about<00:00:13.200> or<00:00:13.880> not

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
was slightly pessimistic about or not

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.070 
was slightly pessimistic about or not
dreading<00:00:15.210> but<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.599> didn't<00:00:15.900> think<00:00:15.929> I

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
dreading but I didn't think I

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.500 
dreading but I didn't think I
particularly<00:00:16.529> enjoy<00:00:16.800> having<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.730> HTC<00:00:18.359> logo

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
particularly enjoy having the HTC logo

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.849 
particularly enjoy having the HTC logo
in<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> middle<00:00:18.840> here<00:00:19.050> which<00:00:19.529> doesn't

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
in the middle here which doesn't

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.080 
in the middle here which doesn't
actually<00:00:19.890> function<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> button<00:00:20.789> which<00:00:20.970> I

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
actually function the button which I

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.170 
actually function the button which I
think<00:00:21.420> i<00:00:21.720> still<00:00:22.410> think<00:00:22.789> could<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.910> implemented

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
think i still think could be implemented

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.900 
think i still think could be implemented
better<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.689> think<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.080> should<00:00:25.170> be<00:00:25.230> mappable

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
better I think it should be mappable

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.130 
better I think it should be mappable
though<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:26.970> be<00:00:27.210> honest<00:00:27.570> i<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:27.779> found<00:00:27.960> this

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
though to be honest i have found this

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.109 
though to be honest i have found this
hardware<00:00:28.590> or<00:00:28.859> software<00:00:28.890> configuration<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:30.029> be

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
hardware or software configuration to be

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.179 
hardware or software configuration to be
really<00:00:30.359> workable<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.439> its<00:00:31.710> power<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> device

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
really workable so its power the device

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.720 
really workable so its power the device

you hit the back button here you

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.600 
you hit the back button here you
obviously<00:00:39.600> go<00:00:39.690> back<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:41.040> doesn't<00:00:41.250> go

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
obviously go back and this doesn't go

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.250 
obviously go back and this doesn't go
back<00:00:41.850> whole<00:00:42.149> applications<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.899> goes<00:00:43.050> back

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
back whole applications it goes back

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.279 
back whole applications it goes back
through<00:00:43.469> pages<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:45.050> Android<00:00:46.050> always

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
through pages just like Android always

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.260 
through pages just like Android always
does<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> bit<00:00:47.160> odd<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.969> some<00:00:48.149> applications

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
does it's a bit odd in some applications

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.970 
does it's a bit odd in some applications
it<00:00:48.809> skips<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> whole<00:00:49.350> thing<00:00:49.620> but<00:00:49.800> that's

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
it skips the whole thing but that's

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.470 
it skips the whole thing but that's
something<00:00:50.129> native<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.820> android<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.300> not

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
something native to android is not

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.810 
something native to android is not

because of sense then here you have a
home<00:00:54.000> button<00:00:54.210> which<00:00:55.370> functions<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.520> standard

that is a good thing in a way um it's

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.280 
that is a good thing in a way um it's
their<00:01:17.909> position<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.630> can't<00:01:18.930> really<00:01:19.020> knock

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
their position so you can't really knock

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.539

because<00:01:23.159> they're<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> bit<00:01:23.490> further<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:23.820> with

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
because they're a bit further up with

because they're a bit further up with
the<00:01:24.360> s3<00:01:24.780> i<00:01:24.810> found<00:01:25.170> often<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:25.830> i<00:01:25.950> hold<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.400> like

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the s3 i found often if i hold it like

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.179 
the s3 i found often if i hold it like
this<00:01:26.549> i<00:01:27.000> would<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.110> nudge<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.350> soft<00:01:29.040> key

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
this i would up just nudge that soft key

this i would up just nudge that soft key

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.069 
nice full screen and preview of them you
only<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.520> nine<00:01:44.549> berm<00:01:45.090> that's<00:01:45.540> enough<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.990> be

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
only get nine berm that's enough to be

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.810 
only get nine berm that's enough to be
honest<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.979> actually<00:01:47.100> quite<00:01:47.430> like<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
honest I do actually quite like the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.249 
honest I do actually quite like the
implementation<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.810> think<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.020> better<00:01:49.140> than

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
implementation I think it's better than

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.289 
implementation I think it's better than
anything<00:01:49.770> they've<00:01:50.520> used<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> past<00:01:51.060> with

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
anything they've used in the past with

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.069 
anything they've used in the past with
sense<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.890> multitasking<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:54.869> cool

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
sense and multitasking the one cool

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.270 
sense and multitasking the one cool
thing<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.680> with<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.829> middle<00:01:56.130> button

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
thing you can do with this middle button

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.100 
thing you can do with this middle button
is<00:01:56.490> because<00:01:56.759> there's<00:01:56.939> no<00:01:57.060> button<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
is because there's no button that and

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.450 
is because there's no button that and
it's<00:01:58.290> obviously<00:01:58.530> completely<00:01:58.680> smooth<00:01:59.189> there's

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
it's obviously completely smooth there's

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.709 
it's obviously completely smooth there's
no<00:01:59.549> hardware<00:01:59.969> there<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.420> there's<00:02:00.600> no

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
no hardware there and there's no

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.969 
no hardware there and there's no
software<00:02:00.960> button<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.560> doesn't<00:02:01.890> get

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
software button that doesn't get

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.039 
software button that doesn't get
confused<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.090> touch<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:03.719> if<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.930> use

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
confused if you touch it so if you use

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.389 
confused if you touch it so if you use
something<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.350> wave<00:02:04.649> launcher<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.219> can

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
something like wave launcher you can

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.789 
something like wave launcher you can
configure<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:07.500> scroll<00:02:07.740> up

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
configure it so if you just scroll up

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.420 
configure it so if you just scroll up

really<00:02:18.189> really<00:02:18.579> well<00:02:18.790> cuz<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.299> s3<00:02:19.450> and

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
really really well cuz on the s3 and

really really well cuz on the s3 and
obviously<00:02:20.319> s4<00:02:20.739> is<00:02:20.860> well<00:02:20.980> you've<00:02:21.069> got<00:02:21.189> the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
obviously s4 is well you've got the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.770 
obviously s4 is well you've got the
hardware<00:02:21.670> butted<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.150> way<00:02:22.269> which<00:02:22.510> sort<00:02:22.750> of

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
hardware butted in the way which sort of

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.020 
hardware butted in the way which sort of
it<00:02:23.650> still<00:02:23.920> works<00:02:24.159> but<00:02:24.370> it's<00:02:24.670> not<00:02:24.819> as<00:02:24.909> elegant

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
it still works but it's not as elegant

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.270 
it still works but it's not as elegant
experience<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.110> think<00:02:26.650> wave<00:02:26.799> which<00:02:27.069> works

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
experience I think wave which works

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.800 
experience I think wave which works
really<00:02:27.340> well<00:02:27.640> with<00:02:27.879> the<00:02:27.970> 1x<00:02:28.299> and<00:02:28.599> it's<00:02:28.720> going

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
really well with the 1x and it's going

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.869 
really well with the 1x and it's going
to<00:02:28.870> be<00:02:29.019> in<00:02:29.110> my<00:02:29.260> top<00:02:29.829> 10<00:02:30.040> apps<00:02:30.189> when<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.549> get
