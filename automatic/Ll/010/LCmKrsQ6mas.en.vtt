00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
he moved a lot during daylight so you

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.760 
he moved a lot during daylight so you
take<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> buck<00:01:21.720> with<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> really<00:01:22.170> small<00:01:22.229> range

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
take a buck with a really small range

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.130 
take a buck with a really small range
that<00:01:23.009> moves<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.310> lot<00:01:23.430> during<00:01:23.909> daylight<00:01:24.360> and

that moves a lot during daylight and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.210 
that moves a lot during daylight and
obviously<00:01:25.439> that's<00:01:25.560> gonna<00:01:25.710> add<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.189> a

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
obviously that's gonna add up to a

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.039 
obviously that's gonna add up to a
pretty<00:01:26.369> easy<00:01:26.580> buck<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.060> hunt<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:27.930> it

during the daylight with the small range

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.910 
during the daylight with the small range
but<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.970> key<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:57.600> like<00:02:58.020> I<00:02:58.140> said<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.770> can

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
but the key to it is like I said you can

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.400 
but the key to it is like I said you can
only<00:02:59.360> you<00:03:00.360> have<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.750> hunt<00:03:00.930> these<00:03:01.110> deer<00:03:01.320> as

only you have to hunt these deer as

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.380 
only you have to hunt these deer as
individuals<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.640> have<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.940> get<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.210> know

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
individuals so you have to get to know

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.510 
individuals so you have to get to know
them<00:03:03.600> as<00:03:03.750> individuals<00:03:04.410> which<00:03:05.040> means<00:03:05.310> that

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
them as individuals which means that

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.800 
them as individuals which means that
you've<00:03:05.640> got<00:03:05.820> us<00:03:06.000> spend<00:03:06.240> as<00:03:06.360> much<00:03:06.480> time<00:03:06.540> as<00:03:06.690> you

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
you've got us spend as much time as you

you've got us spend as much time as you
can<00:03:06.900> with<00:03:07.020> trail<00:03:07.350> cameras<00:03:07.770> so<00:03:08.280> that's<00:03:08.460> my

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
can with trail cameras so that's my

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.460 
can with trail cameras so that's my
biggest<00:03:08.880> tip<00:03:09.180> from<00:03:09.330> this<00:03:09.510> last<00:03:09.720> season<00:03:09.900> just

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
biggest tip from this last season just

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.750 
biggest tip from this last season just
reinforce<00:03:11.010> something<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.550> we've<00:03:11.640> been

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
reinforce something that we've been

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.580 
reinforce something that we've been
learning<00:03:11.940> over<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.300> years<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.930> that's<00:03:13.410> the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
learning over the years and that's the
