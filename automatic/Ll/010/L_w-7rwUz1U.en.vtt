half mounted a gasifier brought out by
kinder<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:17.190> also<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.699> first<00:00:17.940> HG<00:00:18.539> gas<00:00:18.810> fire

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
kinder it's also the first HG gas fire

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.910 
kinder it's also the first HG gas fire
in<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> Aichi<00:00:20.520> range<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:21.320> cheese<00:00:22.320> stands<00:00:22.619> for

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
in the Aichi range a cheese stands for

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.730 
in the Aichi range a cheese stands for
high<00:00:23.070> efficiency<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.019> instance<00:00:25.230> it

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
high efficiency and in this instance it

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.330 
high efficiency and in this instance it
means<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.519> quite<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> quantifier<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:28.340> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
means it's quite a quantifier and the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.900 
means it's quite a quantifier and the
glass-fronted<00:00:29.849> fire<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:31.050> actual<00:00:31.619> fumes<00:00:32.009> can

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
glass-fronted fire the actual fumes can

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.139 
glass-fronted fire the actual fumes can
link<00:00:33.329> around<00:00:33.600> longer<00:00:34.020> which<00:00:34.850> means<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
link around longer which means that the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.139 
link around longer which means that the
heat<00:00:36.559> comes<00:00:37.559> through<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> glass<00:00:38.520> through<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
heat comes through the glass through the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.470 
heat comes through the glass through the
vent<00:00:39.329> here<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.260> therefore<00:00:40.500> restricts<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
vent here and therefore restricts the

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.000 
vent here and therefore restricts the
fumes<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> heat<00:00:43.020> escaping<00:00:43.590> up<00:00:43.829> through

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
fumes and the heat escaping up through

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.639 
fumes and the heat escaping up through
the<00:00:44.160> chimney<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:45.020> actual<00:00:46.020> output<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.410> this

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the chimney the actual output of this

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.090 
the chimney the actual output of this
fire<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.070> 4<00:00:47.460> kilowatts<00:00:48.289> with<00:00:49.289> an<00:00:49.410> input<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.739> 5

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
fire is 4 kilowatts with an input of 5

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.029 
fire is 4 kilowatts with an input of 5
kilowatts<00:00:50.730> now<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.690> equates<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.620> net

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
kilowatts now this equates to a net

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.410 
kilowatts now this equates to a net
efficiency<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:54.800> 89%<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.789> realistically

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
efficiency of 89% so realistically

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.569 
efficiency of 89% so realistically
you're<00:00:57.750> only<00:00:57.930> losing<00:00:58.109> not<00:00:58.680> 12%<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
you're only losing not 12% of the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.260 
you're only losing not 12% of the
chimney<00:01:00.770> now<00:01:01.770> where<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.430> particular<00:01:02.879> model

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
chimney now where this particular model

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.960 
chimney now where this particular model
is<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> remote<00:01:04.140> control<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.460> now<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.790> is

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
is a remote control and now it is

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.210 
is a remote control and now it is
available<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.869> manual<00:01:07.229> control<00:01:07.799> where<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
available as a manual control where the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.530 
available as a manual control where the
controls<00:01:08.640> are<00:01:08.970> underneath<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:10.320> racks<00:01:10.979> or

available as a side control which is a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.870 
available as a side control which is a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
one finger lever on the side now the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.630 
one finger lever on the side now the
remote<00:01:18.180> control<00:01:18.659> option<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.830> voice

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
remote control option is a voice

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.289 
remote control option is a voice
sequential<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:22.049> means<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:23.909> operate

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
sequential this means you can operate

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.480 
sequential this means you can operate
the<00:01:24.509> fire<00:01:24.770> solely<00:01:25.770> through<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.340> remote

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the fire solely through the remote

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.640 
the fire solely through the remote
control<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.540> actually<00:01:27.720> starts<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> fire

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
control so it actually starts the fire

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.240 
control so it actually starts the fire
and<00:01:29.220> turn<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.820> fire<00:01:30.030> off<00:01:30.439> it<00:01:31.439> also<00:01:31.680> has<00:01:31.979> two

and turn the fire off it also has two

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.740 
and turn the fire off it also has two
