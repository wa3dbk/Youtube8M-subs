00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.760 

stereo<00:00:07.770> photography<00:00:08.430> has<00:00:08.610> been<00:00:08.790> around<00:00:09.000> since

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:09.770 
stereo photography has been around since

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.619 
stereo photography has been around since
1840<00:00:10.770> and<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.100> involves<00:00:11.610> replicating<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:12.629 
1840 and it involves replicating the

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.200 
1840 and it involves replicating the
process<00:00:13.110> by<00:00:13.889> which<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.340> actually<00:00:14.550> see<00:00:15.030> which

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
process by which we actually see which

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.240 
process by which we actually see which
is<00:00:15.389> from<00:00:15.660> two<00:00:15.929> slightly<00:00:16.349> different<00:00:16.800> positions

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
is from two slightly different positions

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.010 
is from two slightly different positions
so<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:18.119> can<00:00:19.189> set<00:00:20.189> up<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.369> camera<00:00:20.610> to<00:00:20.759> take<00:00:21.029> or<00:00:21.390> to

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
so you can set up a camera to take or to

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.050 
so you can set up a camera to take or to
keep<00:00:22.200> regular<00:00:22.739> cameras<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.550> case<00:00:23.790> to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
keep regular cameras in this case to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.540 
keep regular cameras in this case to
take<00:00:24.239> pictures<00:00:24.680> simultaneously<00:00:25.680> essentially

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
take pictures simultaneously essentially

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.210 
take pictures simultaneously essentially
you<00:00:26.640> want<00:00:26.790> to<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.810> each<00:00:28.079> camera<00:00:28.380> set<00:00:29.040> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
you want to have each camera set the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.810 
you want to have each camera set the
exact<00:00:29.579> same<00:00:29.820> way<00:00:30.059> and<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.509> want<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.809> have<00:00:30.899> them

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
exact same way and you want to have them

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.490 
exact same way and you want to have them
shoot<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.970> pictures<00:00:33.290> simultaneously<00:00:34.290> which

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
shoot the pictures simultaneously which

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.049 
shoot the pictures simultaneously which
is<00:00:34.680> easy<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.219> with<00:00:35.399> these<00:00:35.520> cameras<00:00:35.880> because

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
is easy to do with these cameras because

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.060 
is easy to do with these cameras because
they<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.360> electronic<00:00:38.750> triggering<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.260> you

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
they have electronic triggering so you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.480 
they have electronic triggering so you
get<00:00:41.220> very<00:00:41.370> good<00:00:41.490> synchronous<00:00:42.620> firing<00:00:43.620> and

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
get very good synchronous firing and

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.840 
get very good synchronous firing and
they<00:00:45.090> also<00:00:45.240> have<00:00:45.800> click<00:00:46.800> stops<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.400> the<00:00:47.550> zooms

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
they also have click stops on the zooms

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.750 
they also have click stops on the zooms
so<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.810> set<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.200> three<00:00:49.500> different<00:00:49.760> zoom

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
so you can set it three different zoom

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.440 
so you can set it three different zoom
positions<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.620> clicks<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.270> that

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
positions and it clicks in so that

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.160 
positions and it clicks in so that
you're<00:00:54.630> at<00:00:54.900> each<00:00:55.380> lens<00:00:55.770> will<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.040> at<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.640> same

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
you're at each lens will be at the same

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.860 
you're at each lens will be at the same
soom<00:00:58.170> stop<00:00:58.560> and<00:00:59.430> this<00:01:00.060> camera<00:01:00.300> also<00:01:00.480> has<00:01:00.720> an

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
soom stop and this camera also has an

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.470 
soom stop and this camera also has an
additional<00:01:01.320> feature<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.710> allows<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
additional feature that allows you to

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
additional feature that allows you to
change<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.630> width<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.259> your<00:01:04.939> eye<00:01:06.320> spacing<00:01:07.320> of

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
change the width of your eye spacing of

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.620 
change the width of your eye spacing of
the<00:01:07.619> pictures<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.070> you're<00:01:08.460> taking<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the pictures that you're taking so for a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.680 
the pictures that you're taking so for a
more<00:01:09.840> distant<00:01:10.260> scene<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.800> a<00:01:10.830> city<00:01:11.190> scape<00:01:11.690> you

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
more distant scene like a city scape you

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.719 
more distant scene like a city scape you
wouldn't<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.979> three<00:01:14.220> dimensionality

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
wouldn't see the three dimensionality

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
wouldn't see the three dimensionality
unless<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.420> are<00:01:15.510> spread<00:01:15.840> out<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.229> then<00:01:16.440> from

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
unless you are spread out and then from

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
unless you are spread out and then from
indoor<00:01:17.520> stuff<00:01:17.880> or<00:01:18.150> anything<00:01:18.360> relatively

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
indoor stuff or anything relatively

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.170 
indoor stuff or anything relatively
close<00:01:19.260> you<00:01:19.409> want<00:01:19.590> them<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.100> roughly<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
close you want them to be roughly the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.170 
close you want them to be roughly the
same<00:01:21.360> separation<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.320> your<00:01:22.500> eyes<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.850> this

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
same separation as your eyes so this

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.830 
same separation as your eyes so this
viewer<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.690> for<00:01:25.470> viewing<00:01:25.680> one<00:01:26.299> stereo<00:01:27.299> pair<00:01:27.630> at

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
viewer is for viewing one stereo pair at

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.020 
viewer is for viewing one stereo pair at
a<00:01:27.870> time<00:01:28.020> manually<00:01:28.950> loaded<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:29.700> are<00:01:29.820> two

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
a time manually loaded so there are two

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.469 
a time manually loaded so there are two
slides<00:01:30.710> taken<00:01:31.710> by<00:01:31.830> your<00:01:32.070> double<00:01:32.580> camera<00:01:33.090> setup

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
slides taken by your double camera setup

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.620 
slides taken by your double camera setup
that<00:01:33.840> are<00:01:34.580> glued<00:01:35.580> down<00:01:35.790> onto<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> piece<00:01:36.479> of

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
that are glued down onto a piece of

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.020 
that are glued down onto a piece of
acrylic<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.350> they<00:01:37.500> need<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.100> properly

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
acrylic and they need to be properly

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.270 
acrylic and they need to be properly
aligned<00:01:39.510> so<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> heights<00:01:40.350> are<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.040> same

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
aligned so that the heights are the same

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.230 
aligned so that the heights are the same
you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.890> then<00:01:43.890> view<00:01:44.280> them<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.760> that<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:45.030> left

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
you can then view them so that your left

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.510 
you can then view them so that your left
eye<00:01:45.450> sees<00:01:45.840> what<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> left<00:01:46.409> camera<00:01:46.979> took<00:01:47.190> and

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
eye sees what the left camera took and

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.130 
eye sees what the left camera took and
your<00:01:47.640> right<00:01:47.909> eye<00:01:47.940> sees<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.990> right

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
your right eye sees what the right

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.170 
your right eye sees what the right
camera<00:01:49.500> took<00:01:49.650> and<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.369> should<00:01:50.549> reproduce

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
camera took and it should reproduce

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.510 
camera took and it should reproduce
exactly<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.320> way<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.500> would<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.250> scene

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
exactly the way you would see the scene

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.170 
exactly the way you would see the scene
and<00:01:54.510> then<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.900> viewer<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.939> similar<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.090> that

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and then this viewer is similar to that

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.210 
and then this viewer is similar to that
one<00:01:57.390> except<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.140> has<00:01:58.350> ten<00:01:59.010> different

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
one except that it has ten different

one except that it has ten different
views<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.240> these<00:02:01.049> are<00:02:01.229> loops<00:02:02.070> they're<00:02:02.369> used

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
views in it these are loops they're used

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.910 
views in it these are loops they're used
