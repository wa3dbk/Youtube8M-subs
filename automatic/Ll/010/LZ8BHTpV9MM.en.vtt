areas while on your skis with the first
skating<00:00:40.590> technique<00:00:40.770> my<00:00:41.460> skis<00:00:41.790> will<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.059> moving

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
skating technique my skis will be moving

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.420 
skating technique my skis will be moving
straight<00:00:42.600> forward<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.230> straight<00:00:43.770> back<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.280> if

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
straight forward and straight back as if

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.760 
straight forward and straight back as if
they<00:00:44.579> were<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.820> parallel<00:00:45.329> tracks<00:00:45.690> I'll<00:00:46.440> use<00:00:46.590> my

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
they were in parallel tracks I'll use my

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:55.550 
they were in parallel tracks I'll use my
poles<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.399> help<00:00:47.430> me<00:00:47.789> gain<00:00:48.329> forward<00:00:48.840> momentum

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.319 

the<00:00:56.560> second<00:00:56.980> skating<00:00:57.340> technique<00:00:57.520> is<00:00:57.910> a<00:00:57.940> little

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
the second skating technique is a little

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.920 
the second skating technique is a little
more<00:00:58.480> advanced<00:00:59.140> it<00:00:59.950> involves<00:01:00.690> sending<00:01:01.690> my

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
more advanced it involves sending my

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.410 
more advanced it involves sending my
skis<00:01:02.260> out<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.920> side<00:01:03.220> one<00:01:03.640> at<00:01:03.760> a<00:01:03.850> time<00:01:04.059> much

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
skis out to the side one at a time much

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.570 
skis out to the side one at a time much
the<00:01:04.600> way<00:01:04.720> an<00:01:04.839> ice<00:01:05.019> skater<00:01:05.379> would<00:01:05.620> move<00:01:05.860> and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
the way an ice skater would move and

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.460 
the way an ice skater would move and
keeping<00:01:07.030> using<00:01:07.390> my<00:01:07.479> poles<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:08.110> gain<00:01:08.260> my

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
keeping using my poles to gain my

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.370 
keeping using my poles to gain my
forward<00:01:08.770> momentum<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:09.900> traverse<00:01:10.900> across<00:01:11.140> a

the hill not down the hill keep your
weight<00:01:21.550> on<00:01:21.580> your<00:01:21.940> uphill<00:01:22.150> leg<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:24.000> then<00:01:25.000> skate

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
weight on your uphill leg and then skate

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.469 
weight on your uphill leg and then skate
across<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.950> slope<00:01:27.250> using<00:01:27.700> your<00:01:28.000> poles<00:01:28.240> to

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
across the slope using your poles to

across the slope using your poles to
help<00:01:28.509> you<00:01:28.780> along

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.920 

there<00:01:36.070> are<00:01:36.160> two<00:01:36.340> methods<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:36.880> ascend<00:01:37.420> a<00:01:37.570> small

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
there are two methods to ascend a small

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.340 
there are two methods to ascend a small
hill<00:01:38.260> in<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.940> first<00:01:40.240> being<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.110> same

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
hill in the first being the same

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.810 
hill in the first being the same
position<00:01:41.830> is<00:01:41.950> when<00:01:42.100> you're<00:01:42.220> traversing<00:01:42.400> a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
position is when you're traversing a

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.670 
position is when you're traversing a
hill<00:01:43.000> with<00:01:43.180> your<00:01:43.330> skis<00:01:43.570> perpendicular<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.410> the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
hill with your skis perpendicular to the

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.250 
hill with your skis perpendicular to the
slope<00:01:44.940> first<00:01:45.940> you<00:01:46.120> will<00:01:46.240> move<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.570> uphill<00:01:46.960> leg

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
slope first you will move the uphill leg

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.020 
slope first you will move the uphill leg
up<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.950> hill<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.370> follow<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.820> with<00:01:48.850> the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
up the hill and follow it with the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.210 
up the hill and follow it with the
downhill<00:01:49.570> leg<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:50.590> will<00:01:50.650> continue<00:01:50.920> doing

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
downhill leg you will continue doing

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.680 
downhill leg you will continue doing
this<00:01:51.430> until<00:01:51.790> you've<00:01:51.940> reached<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.240> top<00:01:52.479> of<00:01:52.630> the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
this until you've reached the top of the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.280 
this until you've reached the top of the
slope<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:53.860> second<00:01:54.250> method<00:01:54.660> involves<00:01:55.660> using<00:01:56.110> a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
slope the second method involves using a

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.120 
slope the second method involves using a
wedge<00:01:56.500> shape<00:01:57.060> you'll<00:01:58.060> be<00:01:58.180> facing<00:01:58.420> uphill<00:01:59.130> with

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
wedge shape you'll be facing uphill with

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.750 
wedge shape you'll be facing uphill with
your<00:02:00.310> tails<00:02:00.580> together<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:02.020> your<00:02:02.950> tips<00:02:03.520> spread

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
your tails together and your tips spread

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.320 
your tails together and your tips spread
apart<00:02:04.170> once<00:02:05.170> facing<00:02:05.650> uphill<00:02:06.210> basically<00:02:07.210> you

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
apart once facing uphill basically you

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.120 
apart once facing uphill basically you
waddle<00:02:07.720> like<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.930> duck<00:02:08.050> until<00:02:08.739> you've<00:02:08.920> reached

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
waddle like a duck until you've reached

the top of the slope these two methods

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.020 
the top of the slope these two methods
can<00:02:11.650> be<00:02:11.680> very<00:02:12.010> useful<00:02:12.520> when<00:02:12.550> you're<00:02:12.820> just

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
can be very useful when you're just

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.699 
can be very useful when you're just
beginning<00:02:13.260> instead<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.350> getting<00:02:14.590> on<00:02:14.650> a

beginning instead of getting on a

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.580 
beginning instead of getting on a
chairlift<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.580> may<00:02:15.790> just<00:02:16.170> ascend<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.290> small

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
chairlift you may just ascend a small

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.650 
chairlift you may just ascend a small
slope<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.400> can<00:02:18.550> come<00:02:18.760> back<00:02:18.910> down<00:02:19.180> at

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
slope so that you can come back down at

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.560 
slope so that you can come back down at
a<00:02:19.690> slower<00:02:19.959> rate<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.290> speed
