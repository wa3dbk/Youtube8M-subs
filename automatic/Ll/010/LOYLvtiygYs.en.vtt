00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 great national laboratory scientists 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.450
 sasso confirmed once again that the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.820
 neutrinos in the universe travel more 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.610
 fast that light invalidating the theory 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.860
 of einstein nothing in the universe travels 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.049
 faster than the light reported in a 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.880
 communication of November 18 the center 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.510
 European nuclear research 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.490
 cern in Swiss geneva the experiment 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.590
 was to send a beam in three 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.890
 pulses of 3 nano seconds long 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.289
 separated by 523 nanoseconds it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.600
 performed 20 times using the detector 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.760
 neutrinos operates to be the results 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.370
 confirmed what the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.840
 team headed by the scientist 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.329
 Italian Antonio R dictates that it be 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.579
 public on September 23 the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.140
 scientist made about 15 thousand 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.910
 measurements before endorsing the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.430
 discovery and recorded that the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.500
 neutrinos of the common type that present 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.620
 anomalous oscillations came with a 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.440
 difference of 20 centimeters by 730 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.600
 kilometers of travel the particles are 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.239
 He noted that the study was carried out 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.250
 precision than previous studies the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.020
 team to be neither reported then that 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.450
 rule out any type of error 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.640
 the discovery published on 23 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.530
 September although the measured time of 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.020
 the neutrinos from serna to the great 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.780
 sasso still needs control and 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.819
 independent measurement the next step 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.549
 is that some other independent team 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:25.170
 corroborate these investigations explained 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.959
 was dictated during the first 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.119
 publication various reactions generates 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:33.209
 this confirmation that nullifies the theory of 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.310
 einstein at least at this point I am 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:37.560
 impressed and eager to know what 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.840
 will happen with all the theories now that 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.209
 we have these tests pointed a 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.610
 comment another person asked that the 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:47.069
 experiment should be done at a distance 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.439
 longer however the amazement is 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.509
 manifested at all levels sometimes 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.159
 discoveries of science are how 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.310
 find a treasure near a 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.920
 shipwreck at other times seem 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.289
 emerge from nowhere as if they had fallen 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.360
 of the sky explains the researcher and 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.520
 physical christine sutton from the group of 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.709
 particle physics department 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.410
 physics from Oxford University and 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.940
 europe particle physics team 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.560
 sutton quotes one of the famous 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.200
 fictional detectives 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.810
 sherlock colmes remembering his words 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.000
 when the impossible has been eliminated 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.970
 that remains unlikely to appear 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.980
 should be the truth experiments with 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.200
 neutrinos are very difficult because the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.720
 Neutrino interactions are so rare 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.940
 but in the coming months and in fact 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.860
 years the teams that work in 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.380
 similar experiments elsewhere 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.019
 will perform the data control to see 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.180
 if you see the same effect add sutton 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.880
 this is the way the 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.069
 science all the time not only when the 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.440
 surprise effect is presented as a 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.420
 unexpected guest at a party 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.840
 the results are reviewed by the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.209
 others finally clarifies the experiment 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.250
 Opera was designed to perform tests 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.530
 direct from the oscillation phenomenon of 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.049
 neutrinos of type very produced in set 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.930
 of Geneva the study comprises a 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.030
 730 kilometers long route 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.250
 between Swiss Geneva and the great Sasso in 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.590
 italy opera also studies the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.690
 appearance of neutrinos is apart from the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.730
 oscillating neutrino mogons during 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.079
 trips of three milliseconds between
