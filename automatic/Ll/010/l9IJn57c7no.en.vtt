 one 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.150
 in one year 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
 I like 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.840
 Conversely 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.500
 - human then in his talk about 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.910
 this year 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.710
 some physical ideas 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.770
 it was like touching them they sent after being of their interest 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.880
 today I'm going to change the subject 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.990
 we wanted 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.200
 the river 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.590
 about what is extra-sportive I am going to refer to a technique very well 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.170
 interesting 3 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.470
 as 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.970
 administratively 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.130
 yes to everyone from the melody down in a technique that are let's pay 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.380
 or that the Americans call 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.240
 because 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.760
 is that we want is suddenly the idea 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.060
 that of the melody accompanied by some state 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.080
 in strict order of the court 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.080
 true 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.390

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.330
 all your products 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.700
 down 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.770
 if they are dollars

 A certain tension available in a small field of wheat has been delayed 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.560
 infamous sedentary 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.910
 a reader in less than two decades 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.530
 the villages 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.530
 as interesting data because it was widely used 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.539
 the time of the journeys by the great bivalves that rested that this 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.969
 kind of acts what was watching a briefcase the money 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:17.139
 then it gives a very compact certain very interesting adam 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:19.860
 9 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.129
 they will also allow you to beat them 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.769
 2011 the bm 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.510
 and they are a variant that was just navigating together add left the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.089
 pop melody was under pamplona 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:36.089
 one of the well rolled 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.609
 one 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.289
 new one 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.079
 a tree 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.449
 these units 2

 samuel eto'o 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:48.909
 i love 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.359
 a new contract 1 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.229
 stanton 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:53.560
 very conscious 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.560
 there is not a very interesting text version of the rapporteur also 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.209
 listen to what they want the mental health network 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.859
 touching your that is a standard 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.659
 but it's very interesting 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.549
 I imagine the fans in San Francisco 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.549
 then here the boy is progressively weakened 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.929
 a band 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:21.709
 surrounding themselves with their products 3 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.969
 wasting time and without being inside one was as a general rule 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:26.549
 let's integrate 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.870
 more or less stable to the rest massive means state 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.119
 we 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.179
 Miguel de Allende and the coup d'Ã©tat 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.009
 true counties of the courts 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:38.399
 this then 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:42.509
 I'm going to play because it came to zero today or because of the bulk of our prosecutors 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:47.719
 attached and after the rebound at noon with a base 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.559
 producer ree -1 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:55.129
 he died between 2009 and 2012 he said a little bit 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:57.849
 one 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.019
 it is not a mediation task nor at all times 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.679
 a second part 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:10.689
 then donoso like which eleven caldas and awake come and the razzies 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:11.669
 as well 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.599
 It is also new 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.599
 the deputy hector barro 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.809
 we are in touch 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:24.169
 I can spend a little bit thousands of native Jews what I have in my 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.669
 right hand and a little bit 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.979
 my others 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.410
 fingers are playing the harmonica with a lower audience than others 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.410
 two goals for one 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.129
 rare navarra 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.129
 It can happen at any moment of conception 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.909
 one 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.040
 one 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:57.009
 under this fraud I have it 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.339
 that grim taste of the diner 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.039
 realizing and sometimes we are going to do it 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.840
 if the whereabouts of Gaddafi 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.840
 as a support a little more owner has given arguments 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.839
 another of the ideas I study using 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:17.729
 it is very interesting is to regret the melody that is exhausted 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.319
 with a light 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.319
 life happens this by 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:27.659
 the governors of the states 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.029
 one 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.029
 none of those two measures 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.249
 paco ortega compact a beloved one 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:52.159
 11 goals 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.069
 the vultures 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:57.069
 it was said then of the score he 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.680
 we want to see all of them are represented so that you 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.130
 can put these new concepts in 2010 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:11.159
 if you want this works very well and lion set of seven 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:13.159
 as the group's 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:17.270
 also raised can be by room 3 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.629
 in the second part 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:20.240
 when 8 percent 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.059
 to the top of the congress their 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:24.259
 we will be back 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.759
 because then I hope that yes grown utility 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.770
 we are seeing each other then in the next month
