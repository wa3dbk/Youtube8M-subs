00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.099
 comment 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.269
 it was said 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.620
 no, not months in need 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.509
 but it was necessary to comment 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:56.939
 I'll comment below here. 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.939
 I ask that I first know what was in the textile 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.139

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.989
 put them on girl we will not print 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.989
 advance and conclude 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.239
 the piece is already on 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.179
 now we go here already count right 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:23.079
 on properties 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.199
 I came here for the speech 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.719
 so that you can keep doing 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.719
 understanding 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.579
 here we give the printer name of the place if you want to change 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.069
 refers without pressure 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.209
 the first was scarce the part is a problem with the printer 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.209
 7 think that if dane city printed vests 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.399
 share if you want to change 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:50.539
 the previous setting 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.769
 d absolute will or will not share 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.639
 everybody gives a series of doors here 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.569
 even sound in the door 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.689
 change it 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.599
 what is the reason 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.599
 can find the best that I can 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.009
 felipe mano keep a standard equipment printer 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.479
 and type you boot schedule for starting iwata finish 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.370
 if someone tries that grimi 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.900
 out of hours 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.900
 she will keep in line this will print 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.900
 I knew the time to print 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.499
 here asked 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:32.870
 c dg 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.059
 the china poll we have 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:39.059
 some were other people here who better split up 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.139
 safety 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.259

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.309
 - the issue with the port 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:53.150
 the test because I 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.080
 as I removed 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.229
 server operators 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:58.699
 removed 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.289
 I gathered mixers 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:01.779
 the operation plan 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:03.599
 creator property 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.599
