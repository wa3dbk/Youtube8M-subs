00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.240
 this tip was a poppet here the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.060
 Her name is Deborah Felipe. 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.369
 I had seen some channels here in the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.370
 youtube talking about this but I never 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.629
 I've done it, I've never tested it, so fine. 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.489
 I do not know if it works or not, okay, it's like 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.489
 You know that on my channel and I speak 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.910
 a lot about nails just there 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.149
 Deborah said you have to do this 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.449
 video teaching staff to grind the pliers 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.500
 with aluminum foil because super works 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.440
 I did it, I'm in love, it's more or less 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.339
 she give up people there you have to 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.200
 I did it, I did it, did not I? 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.360
 So I said come to do it because she 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.020
 guaranteed that it really works 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.330
 excited and then last night I was 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.170
 talking to my friend lauriane 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.750
 silva laureano and said that it works 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.259
 so she already did 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.790
 and finally then why not bring us 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:33.329
 novelty for you so come on 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.619
 You'll get two pieces of paper. 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.920
 aluminum 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.780
 the square soap people get a square 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.090
 have to make a band with paper 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.140
 a firm ball as the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.110
 my 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.610
 besides the debora so I got two 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.899
 pieces 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:55.490
 There you go to knead 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.780
 It's good to knead this foil 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.140
 will make a ball 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.329
 neither would need nor is 2 I think that one 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.030
 It is enough to have another here but not 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.920
 I thought I would stay the colonel was one 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.400
 enough already so you get a 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.720
 sheet or a piece of foil 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.510
 I did not notice my nails that I 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.049
 just 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.610
 It's all blurry, and then you're going to get it. 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.970
 the pliers 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:27.459
 drive with pliers and you're going to 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:32.049
 you were taking the cuticle is okay 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:36.700
 very simple just pity you can also 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:39.459
 make the movement also by shuttle 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.629
 just make the charm on the table is 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:47.140
 good because it will dirty dirty even you 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:51.519
 can make a reciprocating motion or 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:58.720
 as if you were pulling the cuticle 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:03:02.049
 You know people say it's potato 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.470
 I actually works is impressive 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.060
 I really had never done it before. 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.760
 watched some videos here on 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.420
 youtube that teaches you how to do more 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.709
 particularly had never done until the 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.340
 First time I'm doing it now. 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:24.310
 and because it was at the request of my 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.379
 little friend right of débora Felipe and she 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.000
 Oriane confirmed that it really works 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.750
 So you're making this move. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.150
 people look people is the first time 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.629
 You lay down life I do not know here. 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.349
 the channel does not pay né makes a turn and 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.500
 for my channel because it has multiple videos 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.799
 Interesting for you, the channel is good. 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.629
 stuffed 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.079
 who knows who discovered me just 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:53.799
 time I do everything on the channel that the channel is 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:58.569
 a diverse channel has lived 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:01.569

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.970
 homemade homemade video recipes with 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.739
 maridinho videos where I talk about 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.720

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:14.169
 homemade recipes for how to have nails 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:22.160
 great enamel tips people have 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:27.050
 different kinds of life to leave so it's okay 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.070
 you yourself will not have the importance of 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.040
 side is 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.500
 luddy, what side is in trouble is making the 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.120
 ball of foil whatever 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:41.570
 because at the time you pillory penetrate 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.910
 so stay here on earth there yesterday 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.990
 You can try on the nail, okay? 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:53.090
 Can you try on the nail on me? 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.500
 truth our people look do not know if it gives 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.340
 for you to see 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:02.210
 but it's really that it's no good so I 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:05.240
 show people and trust everyone 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.530
 said son at least already two people 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.990
 What I talked about, what I really talked about. 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.520
 it works 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.520
 look how amazing 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.760
 so do it at home 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:24.110
 There you will see that you are not doing well. 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.550
 You're going to test it until you find it. 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.660
 It 's good if you think it's not good. 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.280
 keep on driving this is it people do not think 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.270
 You did not understand much. 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.750
 secret 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:39.350
 There is no secret, I do not believe that 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.330
 many of you already knew this method 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:49.960
 many will also be seeing the first 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:56.800
 time here and that's what can make it 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.800
 aluminum foil for sharpening pliers 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.200
 so folks are a tip it's super fast 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.120
 that I came here to show you 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.990
 So you understand, can not you? 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.060
 make a move like this because here 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:16.790
 It's not good to sanding, it's not to do. 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:19.580
 This is fine, this is not for doing this. 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:25.070
 It's really just the fact that you 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:27.290
 ball of the ball of aluminum the ball 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:31.280
 which was made with foil since this 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:33.270
 fact that will pluck the pliers understood 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.480
 so you do not have to stay ziggy 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.850
 You'll see, it's just the fact that you do it. 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.280
 that here is a cuticle is that you 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.310
 is removing the cuticle 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.010
 so this is a process that will smooth 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.440
 that will pluck the pliers 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.710
 I hope you really do. 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:56.160
