sport<00:02:51.360> similar<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> muscle<00:02:52.959> milk<00:02:53.140> but<00:02:54.930> I'm

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
sport similar to the muscle milk but I'm

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.990 
sport similar to the muscle milk but I'm
on<00:02:56.350> my<00:02:56.380> beading<00:02:56.800> stage<00:02:57.040> right<00:02:57.310> now<00:02:57.490> so<00:02:57.820> that's

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
on my beading stage right now so that's

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.520 
on my beading stage right now so that's
why<00:02:58.300> I'm<00:02:58.480> putting<00:02:58.690> that<00:02:58.959> in<00:02:59.170> there

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
why I'm putting that in there

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.740 
why I'm putting that in there
the<00:03:00.370> last<00:03:00.580> thing<00:03:00.790> is<00:03:00.940> I'm<00:03:01.090> going<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.270> throw<00:03:01.540> a

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
the last thing is I'm going to throw a

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.210 
the last thing is I'm going to throw a
little<00:03:02.320> bit<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.740> understand<00:03:03.070> this<00:03:03.160> is

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
little bit and I understand this is

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.900 
little bit and I understand this is
getting<00:03:03.520> pretty<00:03:03.760> full<00:03:03.880> will<00:03:04.390> be<00:03:04.510> alright<00:03:05.910> you

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
getting pretty full will be alright you

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.070 
getting pretty full will be alright you
throw<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.150> little<00:03:07.240> bit<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.510> banana<00:03:07.600> in<00:03:07.900> there

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
throw a little bit of banana in there

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.010 
throw a little bit of banana in there
that's<00:03:08.200> about<00:03:08.290> half<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.740> banana<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.370> then

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
that's about half a banana and then

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.320 
that's about half a banana and then
lastly<00:03:11.190> we'll<00:03:12.190> do<00:03:12.370> some<00:03:12.550> orange<00:03:12.820> juice<00:03:12.940> and

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
lastly we'll do some orange juice and

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.910 
lastly we'll do some orange juice and
just<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.600> note<00:03:13.810> it's<00:03:14.020> actually<00:03:14.170> easier<00:03:14.709> if<00:03:14.830> you

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
just to note it's actually easier if you

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.470 
just to note it's actually easier if you
put<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.190> orange<00:03:15.459> juice<00:03:15.580> in<00:03:15.790> about<00:03:16.030> halfway

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
put the orange juice in about halfway

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.380 
put the orange juice in about halfway
through<00:03:16.720> your<00:03:16.989> ingredients<00:03:17.980> process<00:03:18.519> but

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
through your ingredients process but

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.300 
through your ingredients process but
skip<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.350> today<00:03:20.650> so<00:03:20.709> we're<00:03:21.040> going<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.190> go

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
skip that today so we're going to go

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.180 
skip that today so we're going to go
ahead<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.640> fill<00:03:21.850> this<00:03:22.000> up<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:23.590> muscle<00:03:23.860> milk

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
ahead and fill this up that muscle milk

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.690 
ahead and fill this up that muscle milk
at<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.370> top<00:03:24.670> will<00:03:24.880> compact<00:03:25.690> in<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:27.370> with<00:03:27.580> your

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
at the top will compact in so with your

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.640 
at the top will compact in so with your
liquids<00:03:28.090> make<00:03:28.540> sure<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.959> only<00:03:29.080> fill<00:03:29.440> to

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
liquids make sure that you only fill to

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.640 
liquids make sure that you only fill to
the<00:03:29.769> line<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:31.810> orders<00:03:32.170> you<00:03:32.290> side<00:03:32.470> just

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
the line this orders you side just

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.320 
the line this orders you side just
pre-made<00:03:33.070> a<00:03:33.100> mix<00:03:33.400> because<00:03:33.550> it's<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:33.970> lot<00:03:34.150> less

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
pre-made a mix because it's a lot less

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.259 
pre-made a mix because it's a lot less
expensive<00:03:34.510> that<00:03:35.019> way<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.230> it's<00:03:35.410> mostly<00:03:35.800> for

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
expensive that way and it's mostly for

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.670 
expensive that way and it's mostly for
liquids<00:03:37.269> as<00:03:37.510> well<00:03:37.900> as<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.050> little<00:03:38.260> extra

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
liquids as well as a little extra

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.949 
liquids as well as a little extra
vitamin<00:03:39.070> C<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.550> some<00:03:40.180> flavor<00:03:40.420> there's<00:03:40.780> lots

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
vitamin C and some flavor there's lots

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.740 
vitamin C and some flavor there's lots
of<00:03:41.049> omega-3<00:03:41.680> fatty<00:03:41.920> acids<00:03:42.459> vitamin<00:03:42.820> DS<00:03:42.970> etc<00:03:43.570> in

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
of omega-3 fatty acids vitamin DS etc in

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.340 
of omega-3 fatty acids vitamin DS etc in
those<00:03:44.230> seeds<00:03:44.650> as<00:03:45.340> well<00:03:45.610> as<00:03:45.760> natural<00:03:46.000> fibers<00:03:46.660> so

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
those seeds as well as natural fibers so

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.410 
those seeds as well as natural fibers so
that's<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:47.830> we<00:03:48.400> should<00:03:48.610> be<00:03:48.640> good<00:03:48.820> to<00:03:48.880> go<00:03:49.000> let's

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
that's it we should be good to go let's

00:03:49.420 --> 00:04:19.980 
that's it we should be good to go let's
see<00:03:49.570> how<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.810> does

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:19.990 

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.330 

so<00:04:20.990> I<00:04:21.050> like<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:21.230> stop<00:04:21.590> there<00:04:21.860> about<00:04:22.070> halfway

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
so I like to stop there about halfway

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.890 
so I like to stop there about halfway
and<00:04:22.760> give<00:04:22.880> it<00:04:22.970> another<00:04:23.060> good<00:04:23.420> couple<00:04:23.840> of

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
and give it another good couple of

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:38.440 
and give it another good couple of
shakes

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.530 

you'll<00:04:39.450> also<00:04:39.630> notice<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.140> I<00:04:40.320> had<00:04:40.620> put<00:04:40.920> the

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
you'll also notice that I had put the

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.240 
you'll also notice that I had put the
non-sticky<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.870> heavy<00:04:43.080> stuff<00:04:43.470> in<00:04:43.680> first<00:04:44.010> so

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
non-sticky the heavy stuff in first so

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.730 
non-sticky the heavy stuff in first so
the<00:04:44.340> carrots<00:04:44.730> beets<00:04:45.060> etc<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.020> then<00:04:46.620> the
