00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello welcome i am v rodrigo is still here 

00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:06.590
 I bring you a news an information 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.300
 about what is being done in e3 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.950
 2013 today 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.690
 of course with the image that I am 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.420
 they are seeing related to the image 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.990
 of 360 equipment related to our 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.600
 xbox 360 console that we're going to have a 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.520
 new model or if you can say no longer 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.520
 we have the slim I have the books with 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.529
 the cons but there they are seeing a 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.270
 more or less similar to the xbox one but 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.790
 it keeps the name of 360 teams and 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.950
 I suppose it will have some 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.200
 characteristics then alternatives a 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.519
 little bit more powerful less noisy and 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.190
 all that according to what is being said 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.079
 the good not only do we have this 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.120
 new this news because no 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.370
 We really expected there to be a 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.190
 new 360 equipment version or a new 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.010
 xbox 360 model but the accounts 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.070
 goal for example now every two months 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.809
 we can choose two games two games 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.210
 monthly accounts practically we're 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.390
 talking about goal scores 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.790
 today I even think that as a way of 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.870
 proof is you can download the 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.500
 facebook 3 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.630
 for free a game that reaches 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.600
 a cost of plus or minus 40 euros 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.700
 buy it from the same equipment is light 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.310
 and now you can download it for free 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:31.040
 almost 5 or 6 gb of space it occupies but 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.910
 good the games that are announcing and 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:41.920
 that I'm listening to are pretty much spent 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:44.619
 up to 52 and 383 imagine what 3 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.610
 play sos let's say that's why they have a 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:51.540
 value almost 40 or 50 up to 60 60 euros 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.330
 in the market here you can download it 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.030
 well it's really very good it was time 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.460
 because playstation had a choice 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.780
 I think I do not know how many games per month 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.850
 what do I know I do not know I have no idea why 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.130
 I did not buy you this did what I did 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.179
 interesting is all the information that we 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.790
 gives for xbox 360 and good I what 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.860
 I want to see your comments, what do you think? 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.380
 the design looks good I hope 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.920
 Well, there are things that I see that 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.720
 they are similar to the slim team but 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.209
 Well, we will not take away a little more 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.799
 power that if I as they tell you that 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.830
 it will last about four or five 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.200
 years more the xbox 360 and that is going to have the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.910
 software similar to the juan team but 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.769
 Well I prefer to stay and I prefer 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.770
 I prefer to change me a new model of 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.590
 team three 60 forgiveness centers 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.880
 Well, if I want to see entertainment, 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.920
 I want to have television if I want the 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.410
 I see it on my TV, not because 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.010
 that's what in the presentation of the 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.600
 wang team that was what they 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.330
 they wanted to show me good for that 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.340
 I have my television and another cable tv 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.160

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.830
