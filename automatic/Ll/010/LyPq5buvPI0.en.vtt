casual game what is it it's like gamer
territory<00:01:55.450> it's<00:01:56.079> getting<00:01:56.590> in<00:01:56.829> that<00:01:57.009> direction

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
territory it's getting in that direction

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.609 
territory it's getting in that direction
for<00:01:57.789> sure<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.060> wizards<00:01:58.329> tower<00:01:58.569> adds<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.439> lot

for sure the wizards tower adds a lot
this<00:01:59.740> is<00:01:59.889> my<00:01:59.950> first<00:02:00.159> time<00:02:00.249> playing<00:02:00.399> the

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
this is my first time playing the

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.879 
this is my first time playing the
wizards<00:02:00.880> tower<00:02:01.029> as<00:02:01.299> well<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:02.289> that<00:02:02.409> that<00:02:02.679> adds

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:02.889 
wizards tower as well and that that adds

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:04.800 
wizards tower as well and that that adds
a<00:02:03.009> lot<00:02:03.099> more<00:02:03.279> strategy<00:02:03.669> as<00:02:03.819> a<00:02:03.909> possible<00:02:04.359> you

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
a lot more strategy as a possible you

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.559 
a lot more strategy as a possible you
know<00:02:04.869> what<00:02:05.349> cards<00:02:05.740> do<00:02:05.829> you<00:02:05.859> want<00:02:06.039> to<00:02:06.099> draw

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
know what cards do you want to draw

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.930 
know what cards do you want to draw
protecting<00:02:07.569> the<00:02:07.719> tower<00:02:07.929> itself<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.640> this

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
protecting the tower itself and this

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.089 
protecting the tower itself and this
this<00:02:10.420> one<00:02:10.599> just<00:02:10.630> does<00:02:11.080> make<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:11.319> harder<00:02:11.650> you

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
this one just does make it harder you

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.559 
this one just does make it harder you
have<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.370> really<00:02:12.580> team<00:02:12.910> up<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.330> there<00:02:13.510> are

have to really team up and there are

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.990 
have to really team up and there are
ways<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.750> team<00:02:14.200> up<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:15.310> version<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:15.940> the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
lot that we can really talk about so

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.580 
lot that we can really talk about so
it's<00:02:33.520> largely<00:02:34.150> under<00:02:34.630> wraps<00:02:34.930> till<00:02:35.260> but<00:02:35.500> the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
it's largely under wraps till but the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.780 
it's largely under wraps till but the
game<00:02:35.740> is<00:02:35.890> called<00:02:36.070> New<00:02:36.970> York<00:02:37.360> 1901<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:39.550> a

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
game in which you are building a the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.870 
game in which you are building a the
layout<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.630> city<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.960> are<00:02:44.200> building

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
layout of the city you are building

structures<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.300> are<00:02:46.450> sometimes<00:02:47.010> demolishing

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
structures you are sometimes demolishing

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.130 
structures you are sometimes demolishing
structures<00:02:48.490> to<00:02:48.670> build<00:02:48.880> over<00:02:49.360> them<00:02:49.660> with<00:02:49.930> new

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
structures to build over them with new

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.950 
structures to build over them with new
or<00:02:50.350> better<00:02:50.760> structure<00:02:51.760> scoring<00:02:52.360> points

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
or better structure scoring points

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.550 
or better structure scoring points
grabbing<00:02:53.770> cards<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.850> it's<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:56.020> fairly<00:02:56.380> simple

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
grabbing cards it it's a fairly simple

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.210 
grabbing cards it it's a fairly simple
game<00:02:57.220> but<00:02:57.460> there<00:02:57.610> is<00:02:57.760> some<00:02:58.060> strategy<00:02:58.690> there<00:02:58.900> in

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
game but there is some strategy there in

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.920 
game but there is some strategy there in
timing<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.400> when<00:03:00.580> you<00:03:00.760> do<00:03:00.940> what<00:03:01.300> and<00:03:01.540> how<00:03:01.690> long

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
timing and when you do what and how long

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.010 
timing and when you do what and how long
do<00:03:02.110> you<00:03:02.200> hold<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:02.920> some<00:03:03.550> some

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
do you hold on to this some some

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.780 
do you hold on to this some some
changing<00:03:05.020> scoring<00:03:05.590> opportunities<00:03:06.280> from<00:03:06.490> game

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
changing scoring opportunities from game

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.780 
changing scoring opportunities from game
to<00:03:06.820> game<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.510> thought<00:03:07.990> it<00:03:08.080> was<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.200> very<00:03:08.950> fun<00:03:09.490> very

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
to game I thought it was a very fun very

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.080 
to game I thought it was a very fun very
neat<00:03:10.690> game<00:03:11.020> that<00:03:11.560> looks<00:03:12.370> like<00:03:12.670> it<00:03:12.850> will<00:03:13.030> be

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
neat game that looks like it will be

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.720 
neat game that looks like it will be
sort<00:03:13.690> of<00:03:13.750> mathematical<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.920> very<00:03:15.160> grid<00:03:15.520> like

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
sort of mathematical and very grid like

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.140 
sort of mathematical and very grid like
but<00:03:16.000> actually<00:03:16.450> it's<00:03:17.020> really<00:03:17.500> cool<00:03:17.800> and<00:03:18.520> gets

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
but actually it's really cool and gets

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.410 
but actually it's really cool and gets
beyond<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.110> know<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:20.970> New<00:03:21.970> York<00:03:22.240> back

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
beyond that you know so New York back

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.790 
beyond that you know so New York back
you<00:03:22.540> know<00:03:22.660> one<00:03:22.840> keep<00:03:23.050> an<00:03:23.200> eye<00:03:23.290> out<00:03:23.320> for<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:23.680> I

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
you know one keep an eye out for that I

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.350 
you know one keep an eye out for that I
think<00:03:24.040> it's<00:03:24.190> going<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.400> be<00:03:24.490> a<00:03:24.520> great<00:03:24.940> one<00:03:25.120> it's

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
think it's going to be a great one it's

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.390 
think it's going to be a great one it's
a<00:03:25.420> solid<00:03:25.630> family<00:03:25.990> game<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.560> good<00:03:26.770> step<00:03:27.220> up

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
a solid family game and a good step up

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.880
