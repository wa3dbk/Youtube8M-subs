00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
menacing maybe you can also notice that

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.180 
menacing maybe you can also notice that
like<00:00:50.379> this<00:00:51.280> part<00:00:51.580> has<00:00:51.790> been<00:00:51.940> broken<00:00:52.269> off<00:00:52.540> and<00:00:53.190> I

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
like this part has been broken off and I

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.880

don't have those two huge things in the

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.030 
don't have those two huge things in the
back<00:00:57.070> it's<00:00:57.879> mainly<00:00:58.510> because<00:00:58.930> when<00:00:59.769> I<00:00:59.799> was

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
back it's mainly because when I was

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.729 
back it's mainly because when I was
priming<00:01:00.580> it<00:01:00.699> it<00:01:01.089> fell<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:01.930> most<00:01:02.409> of<00:01:02.619> the

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
priming it it fell and most of the

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.450 
priming it it fell and most of the
things<00:01:03.189> broke<00:01:03.519> off<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.750> after<00:01:05.229> a<00:01:05.260> long<00:01:05.590> repair

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
things broke off so after a long repair

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.669 
things broke off so after a long repair
I<00:01:06.729> got<00:01:07.060> it<00:01:07.180> all<00:01:07.479> fixed<00:01:07.780> up<00:01:07.930> again<00:01:08.229> but<00:01:08.560> I've

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:48.639 
draw the general idea here make all

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:51.569 
draw the general idea here make all
those<00:01:48.850> shield<00:01:49.569> pieces<00:01:50.049> in<00:01:50.469> the<00:01:50.710> same<00:01:50.950> theme<00:01:51.340> as

and<00:01:52.869> all<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.859> middle<00:01:54.100> parts<00:01:54.429> we'll<00:01:54.639> just<00:01:54.969> a

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
and all the middle parts we'll just a

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.480 
and all the middle parts we'll just a
pure<00:01:55.479> black<00:01:55.749> I<00:01:56.109> think<00:01:56.350> in<00:01:56.740> contrast<00:01:57.249> to<00:01:57.340> the

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
pure black I think in contrast to the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.449 
pure black I think in contrast to the
base<00:01:57.700> it<00:01:58.210> will<00:01:58.539> look<00:01:58.840> nice<00:01:59.109> in<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.829> end<00:01:59.889> I<00:02:00.219> will

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
base it will look nice in the end I will

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.879 
base it will look nice in the end I will
paint<00:02:00.670> on<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.090> face<00:02:01.389> plate<00:02:01.889> something

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:02.889 
paint on the face plate something

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:05.399
