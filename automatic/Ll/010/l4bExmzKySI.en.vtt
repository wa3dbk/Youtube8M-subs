00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.489

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:37.010
 medal of honor and boxing means of 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:38.899
 warfighter in the aesthetic how to 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.270
 can see looks really awesome hammer 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:45.530
 the game is also an extra in a 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.080
 normal packaging as you gave then then 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.490
 it still a beautiful cool dog day 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.280
 as you can see with the 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.710
 lettering medal of honor warfighter 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.580
 really cool is on the plastic or something 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.880
 to communicate that correctly 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.530
 i think thats really nice cool 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.780
 dr 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.430
 and there was an extra dc here 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.520
 I still got impressed here 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.990
 got printed and what exactly 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.890
 I do not know now 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.229
 now one knew enough of one 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.159
 steelbook opel and there but from the dc 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.350
 so far nothing knows that 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.179
 surprise for me 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.109
 and yes I would say we do not want 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:20.179
 long torches 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:21.319
 because I'm also pretty hot on that 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.939
 against and of course the same 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:28.600
 get started and I say pack the whole thing 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.600
 team out 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.860
 he is cool by the time is pure 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.100
 people in full bucket I just see 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.750
 since thankfully as an ebook and 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.700
 still I have to raise another 1000 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.990
 we live there it is already falling apart 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.909
 However, the case has never been bought 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.880
 at gamestop my god what bad 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.950
 advertising for us today well I have myself 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.229
 only against it presented those cool 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.539
 otherwise steelbook is not included 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.910
 gamestop gamestop actually a lot 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.700
 overpriced in my opinion, must 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.230
 just said 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.260
 Here we have the beautiful disc I 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.000
 of course, I hope this is all right 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.200
 the dis is immaculate so there is nothing there 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.690
 That's really a crazy one 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.250
 Cover the CD we leave right outside 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.709

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.769
 Can you walk the garden ? 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:38.489
 we have still to get rid of that 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.489

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.959

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.980
 Redeem and bomb should the team of 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.549

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.299

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.770
