00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
it would definitely be learning to the

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.020 
it would definitely be learning to the
learning<00:04:07.750> zone<00:04:07.780> because<00:04:08.230> obviously<00:04:08.819> they<00:04:09.819> had

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
learning zone because obviously they had

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.550 
learning zone because obviously they had
me<00:04:10.180> for<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.420> reason<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.900> something<00:04:11.500> that

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
me for a reason is something that

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.830 
me for a reason is something that
they're<00:04:11.769> doing<00:04:11.920> that<00:04:12.160> I'm<00:04:12.250> not<00:04:12.400> so<00:04:12.700> I<00:04:13.000> would

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
they're doing that I'm not so I would

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.930 
they're doing that I'm not so I would
take<00:04:13.989> that<00:04:14.019> as<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.260> learning<00:04:14.500> curve<00:04:14.769> and<00:04:15.010> take

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
take that as a learning curve and take

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.400 
take that as a learning curve and take
with<00:04:16.120> click<00:04:16.479> what<00:04:16.630> they're<00:04:16.780> doing<00:04:17.079> put<00:04:17.260> it<00:04:17.350> in

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
with click what they're doing put it in

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.110 
with click what they're doing put it in
my<00:04:17.560> game<00:04:17.799> and<00:04:18.070> come<00:04:18.370> from<00:04:18.579> minutes<00:04:18.850> that's

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
my game and come from minutes that's

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.670 
my game and come from minutes that's
that's<00:04:19.389> what<00:04:19.539> I<00:04:19.630> would<00:04:19.750> do<00:04:19.870> so<00:04:20.229> I<00:04:20.260> wouldn't

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
that's what I would do so I wouldn't

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.670 
that's what I would do so I wouldn't
really<00:04:20.769> take<00:04:20.979> it<00:04:21.130> as<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.250> bad<00:04:21.459> thing<00:04:22.620> thank<00:04:23.620> you
