he<00:00:35.280> had<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:36.570> take<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.840> look<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.320> nkjv<00:00:38.190> we

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
he had if we take a look at the nkjv we

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.400 
he had if we take a look at the nkjv we
can<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.780> english<00:00:40.260> translation

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
can see that this english translation

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.729 
can see that this english translation
includes<00:00:41.340> verse<00:00:41.579> 4<00:00:41.910> while<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> ESV<00:00:43.200> omits<00:00:43.559> it

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
includes verse 4 while the ESV omits it

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.040 
includes verse 4 while the ESV omits it
that's<00:00:44.670> because<00:00:45.059> these<00:00:45.210> translations<00:00:45.780> are

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
that's because these translations are

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.360 
that's because these translations are
based<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.440> different<00:00:46.829> families<00:00:47.219> of

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
based on different families of

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.459 
based on different families of
manuscripts<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.809> definitely<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
manuscripts so this is definitely a

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.170 
manuscripts so this is definitely a
place<00:00:49.649> where<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.129> need<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.430> investigate<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
place where we need to investigate a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.660 
place where we need to investigate a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.790
