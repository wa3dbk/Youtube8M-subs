I'm really looking at each different

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.559 
I'm really looking at each different
piece<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:24.040> hardware<00:02:24.340> over<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.700> years<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.420> see

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
piece of hardware over the years to see

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.960 
piece of hardware over the years to see
how<00:02:25.599> can<00:02:25.870> we<00:02:25.959> take<00:02:26.110> full<00:02:26.349> advantage<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:26.970> what

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
how can we take full advantage of what

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.759 
how can we take full advantage of what
the<00:02:28.090> hardware<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.599> able<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.930> do<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.380> how<00:02:29.709> we're

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
the hardware is able to do and how we're

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.380 
the hardware is able to do and how we're
able<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.099> integrate<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.489> with<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.970> dancing

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
able to integrate that with the dancing

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.780 
able to integrate that with the dancing
with<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.019> music<00:02:32.440> with<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.920> animations<00:02:33.550> of

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
with the music with the animations of

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.360 
with the music with the animations of
the<00:02:33.910> different<00:02:34.420> choreography<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.290> like<00:02:36.190> this

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
the different choreography and like this

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.490 
the different choreography and like this
year<00:02:36.580> with<00:02:36.760> Showtime<00:02:37.599> we're<00:02:38.080> able<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.349> do

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
year with Showtime we're able to do

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.570 
year with Showtime we're able to do
something<00:02:38.769> completely<00:02:38.890> different<00:02:39.220> that

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
something completely different that

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.860 
something completely different that
nobody<00:02:40.000> would<00:02:40.209> have<00:02:40.269> thought<00:02:40.420> we<00:02:40.599> would<00:02:40.630> have

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
nobody would have thought we would have

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.570 
nobody would have thought we would have
tried<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.140> do<00:02:41.349> and<00:02:41.709> take<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.010> little<00:02:42.190> risk<00:02:42.370> as

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
tried to do and take a little risk as

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.009 
tried to do and take a little risk as
well<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:42.970> think<00:02:43.060> that's<00:02:43.360> what<00:02:43.540> makes<00:02:43.720> Just

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
well so I think that's what makes Just

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.780 
well so I think that's what makes Just
Dance<00:02:44.110> special<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.860> which<00:02:45.130> also<00:02:45.340> makes<00:02:45.700> it

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
Dance special and which also makes it

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.710 
Dance special and which also makes it
something<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.090> people<00:02:46.180> want<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.450> come<00:02:46.540> back

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
something that people want to come back

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.509 
something that people want to come back
to<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:46.989> just<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.170> lot<00:02:47.319> of<00:02:47.350> fun<00:02:47.590> yeah<00:02:48.190> with<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
to it's just a lot of fun yeah with the

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.650 
to it's just a lot of fun yeah with the
phone<00:02:48.730> app<00:02:48.880> now<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.120> don't<00:02:49.299> even<00:02:49.450> need<00:02:49.600> the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
additional peripheral to follow with the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.630 
additional peripheral to follow with the
Nugent<00:02:59.110> systems<00:02:59.739> which<00:02:59.860> is<00:02:59.980> great<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.400> all

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
Nugent systems which is great so all

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.520 
Nugent systems which is great so all
those<00:03:01.120> people<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.569> had<00:03:01.780> boughten<00:03:02.140> systems

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
those people that had boughten systems

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.930 
those people that had boughten systems
and<00:03:02.709> maybe<00:03:02.830> hadn't<00:03:03.190> cut<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.400> cameras<00:03:03.760> that

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
and maybe hadn't cut the cameras that

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.670 
and maybe hadn't cut the cameras that
were<00:03:04.090> connected<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.540> them<00:03:04.660> are<00:03:04.930> now<00:03:05.319> able<00:03:05.530> to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
were connected to them are now able to

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.479 
were connected to them are now able to
play<00:03:05.950> via<00:03:06.640> their<00:03:06.880> Android<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:07.810> or<00:03:08.310> what<00:03:09.310> makes

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
play via their Android and or what makes

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.620 
play via their Android and or what makes
just<00:03:09.700> dance<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.000> grades<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.299> you<00:03:10.360> get<00:03:10.540> up

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
just dance the grades that you get up

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.910 
just dance the grades that you get up
and<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.810> can<00:03:10.930> swim<00:03:11.170> you<00:03:11.290> can<00:03:11.410> actually<00:03:11.739> lose

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
and you can swim you can actually lose

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.229 
and you can swim you can actually lose
weight<00:03:12.160> doing<00:03:12.580> this<00:03:12.700> as<00:03:12.880> kind<00:03:13.060> of<00:03:13.090> like<00:03:13.150> a
