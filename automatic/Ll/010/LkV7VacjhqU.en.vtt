00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
number of course it probably wouldn't

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.819 
number of course it probably wouldn't
need<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> password<00:01:30.540> for<00:01:30.810> her<00:01:31.049> driver's<00:01:31.439> license

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
need a password for her driver's license

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.890 
need a password for her driver's license
but<00:01:32.460> if<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.850> did<00:01:33.030> want<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> take<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> picture<00:01:33.689> I

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
but if I did want to take a picture I

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.539 
but if I did want to take a picture I
can<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> picture<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.250> five

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
can have a picture I can have up to five

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.969 
can have a picture I can have up to five
pictures<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:36.240> my<00:01:36.990> driver's<00:01:37.380> license<00:01:37.770> some

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
pictures of my driver's license some

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.120 
pictures of my driver's license some
drivers<00:01:38.909> licenses<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:40.049> barcodes<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
drivers licenses have barcodes on the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.740 
drivers licenses have barcodes on the
back<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.579> i<00:01:41.610> guess<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.180> did<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.509> pulled

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
back so i guess if you did get pulled

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.539 
back so i guess if you did get pulled
over<00:01:42.869> without<00:01:43.140> your<00:01:43.439> license<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> would<00:01:44.070> have

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
over without your license you would have

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.490 
over without your license you would have
a<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:45.240> bit<00:01:45.420> more<00:01:45.570> proof<00:01:45.899> but<00:01:46.170> i<00:01:46.229> don't<00:01:46.470> know

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
a little bit more proof but i don't know
