00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.990
 for 3 what does it mean to have 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.190
 tidy up on the road then one of the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.049
 main characteristics 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.640
 he recalls being to the rangers is before 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.630
 a utility classified as such 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.300
 ford's profile 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:31.050
 it's the presence at the back of 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:34.260
 leaf springs okay it's very 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.079
 good for gliding along a charming 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.969
 apple a little is very good too 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.219
 why come laden with clutter 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.809
 kieffer dead heads on the other hand they are 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.980
 all the roads were a bit more 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:51.300
 folklore of which we are not a 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:53.340
 chore is especially obvious in theory in 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.190
 any case because the national practice 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.250
 is much different then agree it 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.539
 rear train stays a little bit on 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.420
 this map road rehabilitation 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.129
 it's basically the ranger is all to 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.890
 does healthy and he is well helped by this 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.549
 engine that is very voluntary 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.420
 unfortunately it is not put at all 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.950
 in value by this production 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.689
 six-speed automatic is a 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.760
 option to 2000 euros alain operation 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.090
 a little bit erratic hiroshi to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.530
 defend reports a bit too much 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.900
 enthusiastic to ride them 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.760
 it was nice use anyway to 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.020
 favor the manual mode despite 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.020
 the lack of steering wheel paddles 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.190
 so as you all know the snow 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.810
 fell in the Paris region is 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.130
 really the ford datasheet 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.880
 tidy up a little bit scared 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:44.290
 we summarize we have a very heavy diesel 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.080
 overworked and sends 14 100 km of torque to 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.180
 a super light rear end equipped with 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.780
 leaf springs that then deceived 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.320
 the aunt support displeased in 230 in loincloth 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.780
 the gold tree adds that all this clip 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.030
 tons of gravity 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.979
 skyscrapers and that they have there a box 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.540
 automatic speeds as long as 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.600
 I try to report to purchases and another 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.300
 case a recipe that is far from being 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.670
 ideal for me that we want to do 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.100
 beltran easy and funny a young 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.320
 mother happily the fraudster did not 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.010
 that fed a helmet but we also have the 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.930
 transmission 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.580
 a small wheel stroke and we get 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.420
 found in full transmission when 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.980
 even having to stop 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.290
 unfortunately the adhesion problems and have 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.580
 more than a distant memory and adjusted 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.860
 vintage promoters do not count too much 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.890
 annoyed the bm but rare wonder in these 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.890
 terms
