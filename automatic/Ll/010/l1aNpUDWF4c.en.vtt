they're<00:01:39.630> made<00:01:39.810> very<00:01:40.170> very<00:01:40.290> poorly<00:01:40.860> um<00:01:42.229> it's

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
they're made very very poorly um it's

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.710 
they're made very very poorly um it's
just<00:01:43.729> instead<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.850> making<00:01:45.270> each<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.630> these

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
just instead of making each of these

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.859 
just instead of making each of these
separate<00:01:47.360> individual<00:01:48.360> pieces<00:01:48.540> which

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
separate individual pieces which

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.420 
separate individual pieces which
honestly<00:01:49.049> they<00:01:49.409> should<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.799> they<00:01:49.979> made<00:01:50.130> all

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430

the pieces all four of these claws broke

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.540 
the pieces all four of these claws broke
right<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.110> center<00:02:07.380> here<00:02:07.409> right<00:02:08.250> at<00:02:08.399> that

right in the center here right at that
point<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.810> claw<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.440> three<00:02:10.679> other

clause<00:02:11.099> i<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.489> there<00:02:11.610> all<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.849> them<00:02:12.120> broke

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
clause i have in there all of them broke

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.649 
clause i have in there all of them broke
and<00:02:14.760> once<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.879> actually<00:02:16.030> get<00:02:16.269> working<00:02:16.569> with

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
and once you actually get working with

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.699 
and once you actually get working with
them<00:02:16.749> to<00:02:16.840> put<00:02:16.989> these<00:02:17.139> bottom<00:02:17.620> parts<00:02:18.099> into<00:02:18.519> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
them to put these bottom parts into the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.989 
them to put these bottom parts into the
upper<00:02:20.709> part<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.010> call<00:02:21.219> itself<00:02:21.519> these<00:02:21.849> are

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:21.999 
upper part of the call itself these are

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.330 
upper part of the call itself these are
actually<00:02:22.299> pretty<00:02:22.480> weak<00:02:22.749> too<00:02:23.019> so<00:02:23.889> that's

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
actually pretty weak too so that's

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.099 
actually pretty weak too so that's
something<00:02:24.549> to<00:02:24.639> watch<00:02:24.790> out<00:02:24.969> about<00:02:25.629> but

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
something to watch out about but

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.220 
something to watch out about but
honestly<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.739> can't<00:02:26.980> even<00:02:27.129> tell<00:02:28.230> you're

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
honestly you can't even tell you're

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.349 
honestly you can't even tell you're
never<00:02:29.439> you'll<00:02:29.859> never<00:02:30.010> know<00:02:30.159> one<00:02:30.549> kit<00:02:30.939> that<00:02:31.150> it

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
never you'll never know one kit that it

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.410 
never you'll never know one kit that it
broke<00:02:31.599> but<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.439> is<00:02:32.760> very<00:02:33.760> very<00:02:33.849> easily

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
broke but it is very very easily

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.940 
broke but it is very very easily
breakable<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.469> is<00:02:35.590> something<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.859> watch

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
breakable so it is something to watch

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.330 
breakable so it is something to watch
out<00:02:36.159> for<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.870> otherwise<00:02:38.079> I<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:39.040> wanted<00:02:39.280> to

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
out for but otherwise I just wanted to

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.860 
out for but otherwise I just wanted to
show<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:39.519> that<00:02:39.639> I<00:02:39.790> do<00:02:39.909> have<00:02:40.269> all<00:02:40.450> these<00:02:40.599> white

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
parts done and I will be assembling them

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.390 
parts done and I will be assembling them
or<00:02:46.780> assembling<00:02:47.500> what<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.709> can<00:02:47.919> you<00:02:47.950> can<00:02:48.280> see

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
vent cover or the vent itself did this

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.030 
vent cover or the vent itself did this
one<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:33.549> I<00:03:34.269> know<00:03:35.109> I<00:03:35.259> looked<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.739> looked<00:03:35.859> and

some other places here in my room and
workspace<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.379> maybe<00:03:41.379> I'll<00:03:41.560> come<00:03:41.709> across<00:03:41.979> it

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 
workspace and maybe I'll come across it

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.300 
workspace and maybe I'll come across it
somewhere<00:03:42.629> I'm<00:03:43.629> sure<00:03:43.720> I<00:03:43.900> will<00:03:44.019> but<00:03:44.650> there<00:03:45.129> was

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
somewhere I'm sure I will but there was

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.369 
somewhere I'm sure I will but there was
a<00:03:45.340> lot<00:03:45.489> of<00:03:45.699> peace<00:03:46.000> lot<00:03:46.479> of<00:03:46.659> internal<00:03:47.139> frame

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
a lot of peace lot of internal frame

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.409 
a lot of peace lot of internal frame
parts<00:03:47.590> on<00:03:47.799> this<00:03:47.919> and<00:03:48.189> I<00:03:48.459> had<00:03:48.909> a<00:03:48.970> feeling<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.329> was

parts on this and I had a feeling I was

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.499 
parts on this and I had a feeling I was
going<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.599> lose<00:03:49.720> one<00:03:50.079> along<00:03:50.319> the<00:03:50.530> way<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.790> at

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:52.509 
going to lose one along the way so at

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
white parts of the world actually made a

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.729 
white parts of the world actually made a
significant<00:04:06.639> amount<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.879> progress<00:04:07.650> next<00:04:08.650> we

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
significant amount of progress next we

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.189 
significant amount of progress next we
have<00:04:08.799> the<00:04:08.859> back<00:04:09.189> half<00:04:09.519> of<00:04:09.699> it<00:04:09.879> the<00:04:10.840> cover<00:04:11.049> the

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:13.479 
tail and then the tail itself so i got

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:14.789 
tail and then the tail itself so i got
these<00:04:13.629> white<00:04:13.900> parts<00:04:14.169> down<00:04:14.319> here<00:04:14.349> i<00:04:14.530> was<00:04:14.680> able

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
these white parts down here i was able

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.339 
these white parts down here i was able
to<00:04:14.949> assemble<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.489> tail<00:04:15.729> you<00:04:16.180> can<00:04:16.329> see<00:04:16.509> then<00:04:17.229> it

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
to assemble the tail you can see then it

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.879 
to assemble the tail you can see then it
has<00:04:17.469> the<00:04:17.680> gun<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.579> bottom<00:04:19.090> I<00:04:19.560> quite<00:04:20.560> like<00:04:20.739> the

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
has the gun the bottom I quite like the

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.860 
has the gun the bottom I quite like the
look<00:04:20.919> at<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.250> gun<00:04:21.430> that<00:04:21.549> sculpted<00:04:22.419> very

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
look at the gun that sculpted very

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.250 
look at the gun that sculpted very
nicely

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
nicely

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.740 
nicely
nice<00:04:24.770> gun<00:04:25.070> I'm<00:04:25.700> not<00:04:25.880> as<00:04:26.030> much<00:04:26.180> a<00:04:26.240> fan<00:04:26.480> of<00:04:26.510> the

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
nice gun I'm not as much a fan of the

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.440 
nice gun I'm not as much a fan of the
tail<00:04:27.020> itself<00:04:27.500> something<00:04:27.950> about<00:04:28.070> it<00:04:28.220> just

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
tail itself something about it just

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.610 
tail itself something about it just
doesn't<00:04:29.450> work<00:04:29.570> for<00:04:29.630> me<00:04:29.870> something<00:04:30.260> seems<00:04:30.440> like

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
doesn't work for me something seems like

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.710 
doesn't work for me something seems like
they<00:04:30.800> could<00:04:30.980> have<00:04:31.160> done<00:04:31.910> a<00:04:31.940> little<00:04:32.180> better<00:04:32.420> out

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
they could have done a little better out

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.710 
they could have done a little better out
alone<00:04:33.430> I'll<00:04:34.430> get<00:04:34.610> used<00:04:34.760> to<00:04:34.910> it<00:04:35.000> but<00:04:35.270> something

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
alone I'll get used to it but something

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.980 
alone I'll get used to it but something
about<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:36.050> just<00:04:36.080> doesn't<00:04:37.040> work<00:04:37.780> I'll<00:04:38.780> get<00:04:38.930> a
