00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.540 
yahoo.com and I'll email you a document
with<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.300> bunch<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.570> information<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.550> okay

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
with a bunch of information on that okay

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.880 
with a bunch of information on that okay
so<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.000> pretty<00:00:39.180> much<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.690> grid<00:00:39.989> I'll

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
so this is pretty much just a grid I'll

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.950 
so this is pretty much just a grid I'll
fold<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.489> half<00:00:42.559> and<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:44.190> I'm<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.960> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
fold it in half and so I'm going to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.940 
fold it in half and so I'm going to
first<00:00:46.440> tie<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.329> second<00:00:49.230> level<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
first tie this to the second level and

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.830 
first tie this to the second level and
you<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.460> tight<00:00:50.760> too<00:00:50.940> because<00:00:51.270> these

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
you can do this tight too because these

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.049 
you can do this tight too because these
ties<00:00:52.230> Bend<00:00:53.059> as<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.329> see<00:00:55.160> so<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.489> always

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
ties Bend as you can see so you always

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.649 
ties Bend as you can see so you always
be<00:00:57.270> able<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:58.399> do<00:00:59.399> that

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.260 

and<00:01:06.010> now<00:01:07.010> we're<00:01:07.159> going<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:07.400> attach<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.060> the

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
and now we're going to attach it to the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.770 
and now we're going to attach it to the
wall<00:01:08.300> right<00:01:08.870> here<00:01:09.490> by<00:01:10.490> putting<00:01:11.330> it<00:01:11.450> on<00:01:11.630> the

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
wall right here by putting it on the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.710 
wall right here by putting it on the
grid<00:01:12.050> and<00:01:12.440> if<00:01:13.159> you<00:01:13.310> have<00:01:13.580> a<00:01:13.610> ramp<00:01:14.090> this<00:01:14.270> is<00:01:14.390> a<00:01:14.420> 2

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
grid and if you have a ramp this is a 2

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.940 
grid and if you have a ramp this is a 2
by<00:01:14.930> 3<00:01:15.520> CNC<00:01:16.520> cage<00:01:16.760> so<00:01:17.330> if<00:01:17.900> you<00:01:18.080> did<00:01:18.290> a<00:01:18.320> full<00:01:18.619> room

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
by 3 CNC cage so if you did a full room

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.940 
by 3 CNC cage so if you did a full room
which<00:01:19.369> is<00:01:19.520> what<00:01:19.670> I<00:01:19.700> have<00:01:20.000> which<00:01:20.690> is<00:01:20.869> like<00:01:21.050> two

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
which is what I have which is like two

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.040 
which is what I have which is like two
grand<00:01:22.250> pieces<00:01:22.759> like<00:01:23.000> this<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.840> would<00:01:24.020> just

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
grand pieces like this it would just

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.780 
grand pieces like this it would just
reach<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.380> wall<00:01:24.740> on<00:01:24.890> your<00:01:25.040> guinea<00:01:25.190> pig<00:01:25.340> foot

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
reach the wall on your guinea pig foot

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.150 
reach the wall on your guinea pig foot
what<00:01:26.720> happens<00:01:27.050> because<00:01:27.530> there's<00:01:27.890> no<00:01:28.009> way

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
what happens because there's no way

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.520 
what happens because there's no way
they'd<00:01:28.340> be<00:01:28.369> able<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:28.700> get<00:01:28.850> to<00:01:29.000> it<00:01:29.229> but<00:01:30.229> if<00:01:30.380> you

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
they'd be able to get to it but if you

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.590 
they'd be able to get to it but if you
do<00:01:30.800> that<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:31.790> want<00:01:31.940> to<00:01:32.030> make<00:01:32.119> sure<00:01:32.150> that

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
do that you want to make sure that

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.930 
do that you want to make sure that
there's<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.900> space<00:01:33.200> or<00:01:33.470> a<00:01:33.500> can<00:01:33.740> go<00:01:33.890> through<00:01:34.130> like

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
there's a space or a can go through like

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.270 
there's a space or a can go through like
where<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.240> coroplast<00:01:35.630> can<00:01:35.900> go<00:01:36.020> through<00:01:36.280> okay

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
where the coroplast can go through okay

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.070 
where the coroplast can go through okay
now<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.610> second<00:01:38.000> piece<00:01:38.119> I'm<00:01:38.450> using<00:01:38.630> for<00:01:39.020> the

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
now the second piece I'm using for the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.170 
now the second piece I'm using for the
ramp<00:01:39.289> is<00:01:40.030> this<00:01:41.030> it's<00:01:41.899> um<00:01:42.610> grid<00:01:43.610> except<00:01:44.030> it's

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
ramp is this it's um grid except it's

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.730 
ramp is this it's um grid except it's
not<00:01:44.360> bent<00:01:44.840> bent<00:01:45.380> as<00:01:45.619> much<00:01:46.060> so<00:01:47.060> um<00:01:49.270> we'll<00:01:50.270> put

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
not bent bent as much so um we'll put

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.070 
not bent bent as much so um we'll put
this<00:01:51.740> part<00:01:52.100> up<00:01:52.430> right<00:01:52.729> here

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.240 

obviously<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.259> edge<00:01:57.470> all<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.770> way<00:01:57.920> but

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
obviously the edge all the way but

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.029 
obviously the edge all the way but
that's<00:01:58.399> it<00:01:58.869> like<00:01:59.869> all<00:02:00.050> the<00:02:00.170> way<00:02:00.289> to<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.649> end<00:02:00.920> of

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
that's it like all the way to the end of

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.830 
that's it like all the way to the end of
the<00:02:01.190> cage

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.710 

and<00:02:06.729> what<00:02:07.729> tool<00:02:09.009> and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.380 

and<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.650> school<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:16.300> then<00:02:16.630> tie<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:19.000> around

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
and this school and then tie to around

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.810 
and this school and then tie to around
fresh<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:20.080> like<00:02:20.260> unfold<00:02:20.800> this<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.040> little<00:02:21.280> more

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.760 

this<00:02:24.820> part

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.160 

so<00:02:30.430> then<00:02:30.940> they<00:02:31.210> can<00:02:32.190> have<00:02:33.190> like<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.610> place<00:02:34.170> so
