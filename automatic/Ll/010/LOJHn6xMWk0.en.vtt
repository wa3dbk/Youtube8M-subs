00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.860

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.439
 barcelona that who has this will be a 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.560
 third generation rate a big suv 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.360
 whose template and 4 m 78 nearly 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.840
 10 cm longer than the model he 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.590
 replaces 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:30.820
 this suv that wants to be premium is supposed 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.800
 compete with audi q5 and bmw x3 is 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.379
 also volvo xc60 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.660
 according to kia it can also compete with 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.600
 very big suv that are the fake wagen 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.370
 Tuareg or audi q7 very classic of 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.379
 line this new kia sorento do 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.120
 not revolutionize the segment so much 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.760
 must lack a little character 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.879
 if it is not the front that is supposed 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.530
 draw a wolf's head with 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.899
 regards the quality of finishing the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.430
 presentation the materials of this new 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.890
 kia sorento 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.120
 the atmosphere is extremely neat the 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.730
 assemblies are also 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.050
 the ergonomics are irreproachable with 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.729
 beautiful materials as a new 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.410
 leather upholstery of very good quality we 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.420
 still do not quite find 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.750
 the refined atmosphere of the competitors 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.070
 confess that are the audi q5 and bmw x3 and 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.229
 volvo xc60 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.930
 we have a panoramic roof as standard 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.390
 glass opening extremely friendly 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.920
 which really illuminates the cabin we 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.060
 have plenty of storage space which 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.939
 is not always the case 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.340
 the modularity is simple but very 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.079
 completed with second and second seats 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.000
 third ranks that retract into the 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.829
 floor by releasing a floor 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.930
 totally flat especially since there is 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.970
 more bondage tunnel 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.350
 third place places are 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.850
 near acceptable even for a big 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.590
 gauge I'm not saying that I will do to 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.090
 paris marseille does not prevent me from 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.610
 am not too bad compared to 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.190
 some competitors 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.350
 strong of a power of 200 horses this 4 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.840
 Turbodiesel cylinders proves to be largely 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.140
 quite powerful and very nice to 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.030
 lead 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.800
 all the more so when he is associated as 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.680
 today and a transmission 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.880
 six-speed automatic which 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 transmission is not of a 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.240
 crazy intelligence but proves very 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.280
 soft and sufficient for driving 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.770
 family very good surprise side 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.200
 comfort this new sorento is revealed 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.540
 extremely comfortable in damping 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.700
 despite the 19-inch rims 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.880
 optional features that our 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.160
 test pattern is also a 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.140
 soundproofing extremely neat to 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.450
 stabilized speed of course on 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.950
 intermediaries we mean the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.620
 mechanical four-cylinder diesel 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.540
 only small criticism in this area the 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.340
 lack of seat maintenance before a 4 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.080
 Which of course will 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.489
 leave the room to address in 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.489
 very good conditions the paths
