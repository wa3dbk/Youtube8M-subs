months to two years that's the normal
time<00:04:33.590> period<00:04:34.039> so<00:04:34.300> because<00:04:35.300> we're<00:04:35.449> so<00:04:35.599> strong

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
time period so because we're so strong

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:37.689 
time period so because we're so strong
in<00:04:36.439> that<00:04:36.469> market<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:37.069> our<00:04:37.099> products<00:04:37.490> are<00:04:37.580> so

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
in that market and our products are so

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.179 
in that market and our products are so
differentiated<00:04:38.449> I<00:04:38.629> think<00:04:39.319> its<00:04:39.590> effect<00:04:39.770> will

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:40.189 
differentiated I think its effect will

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:43.080 
differentiated I think its effect will
be<00:04:40.219> marginal<00:04:40.939> longer<00:04:41.150> medical<00:04:41.509> business<00:04:41.860> is

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
be marginal longer medical business is

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.119 
be marginal longer medical business is
there<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.120> chance<00:04:44.180> if<00:04:44.780> you<00:04:45.050> went<00:04:45.349> back<00:04:45.590> you

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
there a chance if you went back you

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:47.770 
there a chance if you went back you
would<00:04:46.280> want<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.550> see<00:04:46.759> the<00:04:47.000> this<00:04:47.270> this<00:04:47.539> the
