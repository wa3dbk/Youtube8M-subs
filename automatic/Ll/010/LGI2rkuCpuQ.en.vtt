 I say good glasses, I 'm offering you 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.200

 I'm just talking, my dad asks you to 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.770
 we ask about the lenses and they are 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.040
 they had given yes because I was 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.390
 distracted recording 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.700
 now we are going to enter the room 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.700
 correct to watch the movie 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:38.859
 green 2 teas warm lenses 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.859
 ay says rain of hamburgers 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.360
 so we've already entered 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.950
 and we enter the room of the century we are 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.950
 waiting for the movie to start 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.870
 same when we start we will record the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.500
 two parts more 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:04.660
 well let's record it but very little 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.240
 we went walking everywhere 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.149
 because there is but what a shame because 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.100
 we are in front of everyone in front of 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.490
 everyone like that we went walking all 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.490
 parts 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.610
 this part is not illuminated let's go to the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.590
 another good but what a shame even though 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.700
 things in which clara dares to do 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.600
 the things that you clear and should be 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.440
 all right 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.610
 it's almost lit up and well what 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.220
 shame because people are 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.200
 listening and talking and everything and they are 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.629
 looking seriously 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.739
 the movie is about to start, this is the 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.739
 advance of another movie 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.069
 all my life I wanted 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.380
 and I have dedicated all my life and truth 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:49.050
 every dream 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.050
 I still remember my first invention 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.920
 when it was finished I would have talked 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.520
 directly using the language of the 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.150
 science 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.470
 - now 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.810
 the new xcl claw with crystallized 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.110
 after so many years still congratulated 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.110
 to people 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.120
 but do not forget there is no science 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.530
 little 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.530
 these little ones 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.780
 talking about small scientists 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.099
 my dream 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.939
 so much 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.650
 those parts happened in the movie 12 that 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:44.090
 happens in the movie 1 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.090
 finally the inverse 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.680
 good only because as we said 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.680
 we show few parts in a movie 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.190
 and then it happened like an hour and it ends 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:07.460
 the movie so we 're already going 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:11.980
 and before we leave here there is a coca lover 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.980
 and pepsi and 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.000
 well that
