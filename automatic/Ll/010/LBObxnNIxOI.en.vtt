what<00:00:26.570> we're<00:00:26.690> gonna<00:00:26.780> want<00:00:26.960> to<00:00:26.990> type<00:00:27.200> in<00:00:27.380> here<00:00:27.620> is

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
what we're gonna want to type in here is

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.160 
what we're gonna want to type in here is
the<00:00:28.940> same<00:00:29.120> thing<00:00:29.300> we<00:00:29.420> kind<00:00:29.660> of<00:00:29.810> before<00:00:30.140> that

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
the same thing we kind of before that

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.360 
the same thing we kind of before that
was<00:00:30.380> given<00:00:30.620> us<00:00:30.710> a<00:00:30.860> 0<00:00:31.190> we<00:00:31.850> sent<00:00:32.239> these<00:00:32.990> cgn<00:00:33.650> C<00:00:34.220> and

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
was given us a 0 we sent these cgn C and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.750 
was given us a 0 we sent these cgn C and
E<00:00:34.580> get<00:00:34.910> on<00:00:35.150> our<00:00:35.300> spore<00:00:35.600> config<00:00:36.560> arm<00:00:36.980> ours<00:00:37.400> or

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
E get on our spore config arm ours or

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.870 
E get on our spore config arm ours or
correctly<00:00:38.480> C<00:00:38.810> and<00:00:39.170> now<00:00:39.860> as<00:00:40.010> you<00:00:40.100> can<00:00:40.220> see<00:00:40.430> it<00:00:40.700> is

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
correctly C and now as you can see it is

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.750 
correctly C and now as you can see it is
definitely<00:00:41.390> reading<00:00:41.630> at<00:00:41.810> 800<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:42.980> we<00:00:43.250> did<00:00:43.460> save

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
definitely reading at 800 so we did save

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.830 
definitely reading at 800 so we did save
that<00:00:44.170> correctly<00:00:45.170> and<00:00:46.090> you<00:00:47.090> might<00:00:47.300> notice<00:00:47.480> a

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
that correctly and you might notice a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.930 
that correctly and you might notice a
slight<00:00:48.350> increase<00:00:48.800> of<00:00:48.829> your<00:00:49.130> performance<00:00:49.730> now

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
slight increase of your performance now

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.370 
slight increase of your performance now
there's<00:00:50.120> also<00:00:50.360> other<00:00:50.750> things<00:00:50.840> that<00:00:51.140> you<00:00:51.260> can

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
there's also other things that you can

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.210 
there's also other things that you can
do<00:00:51.640> like<00:00:52.930> overclocking<00:00:53.930> your<00:00:54.079> RAM<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.070> how

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
do like overclocking your RAM so how

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.680 
do like overclocking your RAM so how
would<00:00:55.280> we<00:00:55.550> do<00:00:55.730> that<00:00:55.760> if<00:00:56.270> we<00:00:56.390> wanted<00:00:56.630> to

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
would we do that if we wanted to

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.870 
would we do that if we wanted to
overclock<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.320> RAM<00:00:57.739> well<00:00:58.040> say<00:00:58.610> anything

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
overclock the RAM well say anything

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.340 
overclock the RAM well say anything
we're<00:00:59.000> gonna<00:00:59.120> pop<00:00:59.540> into<00:00:59.750> that<00:00:59.960> in<00:01:00.079> from<00:01:00.290> the

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
we're gonna pop into that in from the

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.750 
we're gonna pop into that in from the
mouse<00:01:00.590> sudo<00:01:01.399> nano<00:01:01.510> /<00:01:02.510> boot<00:01:02.899> /<00:01:03.320> take<00:01:03.829> that<00:01:04.040> text

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
mouse sudo nano / boot / take that text

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.790 
mouse sudo nano / boot / take that text
and<00:01:05.210> I<00:01:05.300> should<00:01:05.510> bring<00:01:05.750> up<00:01:05.930> our<00:01:06.110> file<00:01:06.470> then

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
and I should bring up our file then

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.290 
and I should bring up our file then
again<00:01:07.100> we'll<00:01:07.310> just<00:01:07.340> put<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:07.729> kind<00:01:07.909> of<00:01:07.940> with<00:01:08.120> our

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
again we'll just put it kind of with our

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.440 
again we'll just put it kind of with our
other<00:01:08.450> overclock<00:01:09.050> setting<00:01:09.590> here<00:01:12.700> down<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:13.940> so

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
other overclock setting here down and so

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.990 
other overclock setting here down and so
now<00:01:14.630> what<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:14.870> can<00:01:14.900> do<00:01:15.140> is<00:01:15.260> SDRAM<00:01:16.220> underscore

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
now what you can do is SDRAM underscore

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.600 
now what you can do is SDRAM underscore
frequency<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:17.960> you<00:01:18.440> can<00:01:18.590> set<00:01:18.830> this<00:01:19.010> let's<00:01:19.400> say

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
frequency and you can set this let's say

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.270 
frequency and you can set this let's say
I<00:01:19.640> think<00:01:20.120> the<00:01:20.240> default<00:01:20.479> is<00:01:20.840> at<00:01:21.020> 200<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.010> we<00:01:22.159> can

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
I think the default is at 200 so we can

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.480 
I think the default is at 200 so we can
set<00:01:22.460> this<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.670> 300<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:24.350> now<00:01:24.470> we<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:24.799> I'm<00:01:25.190> sorry<00:01:25.340> I

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
set this to 300 so now we so I'm sorry I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.410 
set this to 300 so now we so I'm sorry I
hit<00:01:25.610> ctrl<00:01:26.000> s<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:27.680> used<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:28.250> operating<00:01:29.150> on<00:01:29.270> like

exit we're gonna save and save it to the
same<00:01:38.479> file<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:40.360> let's<00:01:41.360> run<00:01:41.570> this<00:01:41.750> again

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.219 

and<00:01:47.950> we<00:01:48.729> want<00:01:48.939> to<00:01:49.000> get<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:50.580> SDRAM<00:01:52.229> frequency

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
and we want to get the SDRAM frequency

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.050 
and we want to get the SDRAM frequency
so<00:01:53.799> as<00:01:53.890> you<00:01:53.979> can<00:01:54.070> see<00:01:54.130> it's<00:01:54.369> reading<00:01:54.580> zero

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
so as you can see it's reading zero

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.399 
so as you can see it's reading zero
because<00:01:55.390> we<00:01:55.479> haven't<00:01:55.600> synced<00:01:56.080> so<00:01:56.110> let's<00:01:56.259> try

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
because we haven't synced so let's try

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.580 
because we haven't synced so let's try
see<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.600> zero<00:01:59.100> will<00:02:00.100> do<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:02.380> it's<00:02:02.530> really

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
see so zero will do but it's really

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.620 
see so zero will do but it's really
hoping<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.399> avoid<00:02:03.640> another<00:02:03.850> shutdown<00:02:04.210> but

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
hoping to avoid another shutdown but

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.690 
hoping to avoid another shutdown but
let's<00:02:04.869> just<00:02:05.080> one<00:02:06.070> more<00:02:06.190> time

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
let's just one more time

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.520 
let's just one more time
No<00:02:07.360> okay<00:02:07.899> so<00:02:07.960> we're<00:02:08.170> gonna<00:02:08.229> have<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.440> go

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
No okay so we're gonna have to go

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.640 
No okay so we're gonna have to go
through<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.880> entire<00:02:09.880> process<00:02:10.119> again<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.590> I'm

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
through the entire process again so I'm

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.630 
through the entire process again so I'm
gonna<00:02:11.739> go<00:02:11.890> ahead<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.040> do<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.280> I'm<00:02:12.400> just<00:02:12.430> going

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
gonna go ahead and do it I'm just going

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.870 
gonna go ahead and do it I'm just going
to<00:02:12.670> type<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.000> out<00:02:13.090> really<00:02:13.450> quick<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:14.880> and

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
to type it out really quick so and

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.190 
to type it out really quick so and
actually<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.180> think<00:02:16.209> all<00:02:16.569> we<00:02:16.750> really<00:02:16.900> have<00:02:17.110> to

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
actually I think all we really have to

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.440 
actually I think all we really have to
do<00:02:17.319> is<00:02:17.440> shut<00:02:17.980> down<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.340> restart<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:18.970> be<00:02:19.090> honest

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
do is shut down and restart to be honest

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.030 
do is shut down and restart to be honest
that<00:02:19.690> ought<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.290> do<00:02:20.680> it

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
that ought to do it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.070 
that ought to do it
but<00:02:21.400> anyway<00:02:21.670> just<00:02:21.850> just<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.300> case<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.690> you

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
but anyway just just in case you you

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
but anyway just just in case you you
need<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.380> go<00:02:23.500> through<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.800> sync<00:02:24.040> process

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
need to go through the sync process

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.800 
need to go through the sync process
we'll<00:02:24.730> just<00:02:24.880> do<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.060> really<00:02:25.209> quick<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:25.630> see

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
we'll just do it really quick so see

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:40.020 
we'll just do it really quick so see

those saying sudo SH - Rob underscore
cache<00:02:40.560> should<00:02:42.840> be<00:02:43.840> good

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
cache should be good

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
restarted open up the LX terminal one

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.699 
restarted open up the LX terminal one
last<00:03:36.260> time<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:38.140> what<00:03:39.140> we<00:03:39.230> want<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.500> do<00:03:39.590> is

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
last time and what we want to do is

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.820 
last time and what we want to do is
check<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:41.150> RAM<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.200> then<00:03:42.440> while<00:03:42.590> we're<00:03:42.739> at<00:03:42.800> it

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
check the RAM and then while we're at it

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.880 
check the RAM and then while we're at it
we'll<00:03:43.010> just<00:03:43.069> check<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.459> CPU<00:03:43.819> one<00:03:44.000> last<00:03:44.209> time

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
we'll just check the CPU one last time

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.289 
we'll just check the CPU one last time
well<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:45.980> should<00:03:46.190> probably<00:03:46.489> notice<00:03:47.090> that

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
well you should probably notice that

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.300 
well you should probably notice that
your<00:03:47.840> terminal<00:03:48.290> ran<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:48.530> little<00:03:48.860> bit<00:03:49.069> quicker

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
your terminal ran a little bit quicker

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.339 
your terminal ran a little bit quicker
upload<00:03:50.000> or<00:03:50.180> came<00:03:50.510> up<00:03:50.660> a<00:03:50.780> little<00:03:51.019> bit<00:03:51.140> quicker

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
upload or came up a little bit quicker

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.710 
upload or came up a little bit quicker

for you but anyway vc g en CMD get our
score<00:03:57.200> config<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:58.129> then<00:03:58.849> you<00:03:59.030> want<00:04:00.400> your

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
score config and then you want your

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.789 
score config and then you want your
SDRAM<00:04:03.160> underscore<00:04:04.160> pregnancy<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:06.440> as<00:04:06.650> you

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
SDRAM underscore pregnancy and as you

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.160 
SDRAM underscore pregnancy and as you
can<00:04:06.890> see<00:04:06.950> now<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.340> is<00:04:07.459> reading<00:04:07.730> 300<00:04:08.660> same<00:04:08.930> thing

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
can see now it is reading 300 same thing

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:16.900 
can see now it is reading 300 same thing
we<00:04:09.260> can<00:04:09.290> do<00:04:09.700> with<00:04:10.700> our<00:04:13.480> arm<00:04:14.829> an<00:04:15.829> arm<00:04:16.430> is<00:04:16.639> just<00:04:16.669> a

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
we can do with our arm an arm is just a

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.430 
we can do with our arm an arm is just a
reference<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.450> your<00:04:17.540> processor<00:04:18.169> what<00:04:18.320> you're

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
running an ARM processor anyway so now

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.200 
running an ARM processor anyway so now
that's<00:04:21.169> 800<00:04:21.590> we<00:04:21.979> are<00:04:22.100> now<00:04:22.250> successfully

overclocked<00:04:24.169> and<00:04:24.260> we<00:04:24.380> did<00:04:24.560> it<00:04:24.650> all<00:04:24.830> by

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
overclocked and we did it all by

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.610 
overclocked and we did it all by
ourselves<00:04:26.740> now<00:04:27.740> if<00:04:28.570> if<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:29.810> want<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.199> know<00:04:30.350> how

have it then this would be the command
you<00:05:00.080> would<00:05:00.200> do<00:05:00.470> sudo<00:05:00.830> app<00:05:01.039> and<00:05:01.430> you<00:05:01.550> want<00:05:01.729> to

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
you would do sudo app and you want to

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.330 
you would do sudo app and you want to
get<00:05:02.320> update<00:05:03.320> and<00:05:03.530> then<00:05:04.120> and<00:05:05.120> and<00:05:05.690> sudo<00:05:06.650> apt<00:05:06.919> -

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
thing that we want to do is pull up that

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.190 
thing that we want to do is pull up that
configuration<00:05:38.360> utility<00:05:38.750> and<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:38.960> way<00:05:39.050> that

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
configuration utility and the way that

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.120 
configuration utility and the way that
we're<00:05:39.289> going<00:05:39.380> to<00:05:39.440> do<00:05:39.530> that<00:05:39.680> sudo<00:05:40.039> brass<00:05:40.789> PI<00:05:41.060> -

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
we're going to do that sudo brass PI -

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.760 
we're going to do that sudo brass PI -
and<00:05:44.030> that<00:05:44.150> pulls<00:05:44.390> up<00:05:44.570> that<00:05:44.600> car<00:05:44.960> it's<00:05:45.200> it's<00:05:45.560> not

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
and that pulls up that car it's it's not

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.530 
and that pulls up that car it's it's not
a<00:05:45.830> BIOS<00:05:46.280> but<00:05:46.520> it<00:05:46.670> just<00:05:46.820> kind<00:05:47.000> of<00:05:47.030> reminds<00:05:47.360> me<00:05:47.480> of

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
a BIOS but it just kind of reminds me of

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.780 
a BIOS but it just kind of reminds me of
a<00:05:47.600> BIOS<00:05:47.870> so<00:05:48.440> this<00:05:49.130> is<00:05:49.310> kind<00:05:49.490> of<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:49.610> thing<00:05:49.760> that

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
a BIOS so this is kind of the thing that

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.430 
a BIOS so this is kind of the thing that
you<00:05:50.000> saw<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.270> first<00:05:50.690> time<00:05:50.930> you<00:05:51.050> installed

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
you saw the first time you installed

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.250 
you saw the first time you installed
your<00:05:52.120> operating<00:05:53.120> system<00:05:53.510> so<00:05:53.750> here<00:05:53.960> you<00:05:54.110> can

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
your operating system so here you can

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.560 
your operating system so here you can
edit<00:05:54.440> your<00:05:54.590> user<00:05:54.980> password<00:05:55.670> you<00:05:55.910> can<00:05:56.060> enable

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
edit your user password you can enable

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.180 
edit your user password you can enable
boot<00:05:56.930> to<00:05:57.050> desktop<00:05:57.380> which<00:05:57.620> I<00:05:57.740> don't<00:05:57.800> recommend

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
boot to desktop which I don't recommend

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.360 
boot to desktop which I don't recommend
you<00:05:59.090> could<00:05:59.270> do<00:05:59.360> the<00:05:59.680> camera<00:06:00.680> but<00:06:00.920> then<00:06:01.040> anyway

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
you could do the camera but then anyway

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.400 
you could do the camera but then anyway
we<00:06:01.550> get<00:06:01.670> down<00:06:01.880> to<00:06:02.000> overclock<00:06:02.450> and<00:06:02.870> you<00:06:03.080> come

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
we get down to overclock and you come

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.890 
we get down to overclock and you come
into<00:06:03.590> overclock<00:06:04.160> and<00:06:04.370> it<00:06:05.270> just<00:06:05.450> warns<00:06:05.780> you

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
into overclock and it just warns you

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.330 
into overclock and it just warns you
that<00:06:05.930> you<00:06:06.170> could<00:06:06.320> reduce<00:06:06.470> the<00:06:06.710> lifetime<00:06:06.920> of

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
that you could reduce the lifetime of

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.830 
that you could reduce the lifetime of
your<00:06:07.430> raspberry<00:06:07.850> pi<00:06:10.240> now<00:06:11.240> the<00:06:11.300> only<00:06:11.600> thing<00:06:11.750> I

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
your raspberry pi now the only thing I

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.010 
your raspberry pi now the only thing I
will<00:06:11.960> just<00:06:12.110> say<00:06:12.320> on<00:06:12.590> top<00:06:12.920> of<00:06:13.130> this<00:06:13.310> is<00:06:14.020> what

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
will just say on top of this is what

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.330 
will just say on top of this is what
kills<00:06:15.470> a<00:06:15.680> processor<00:06:16.430> over<00:06:17.210> time<00:06:17.750> is<00:06:18.140> heat<00:06:18.860> and

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
kills a processor over time is heat and

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.490 
kills a processor over time is heat and
heat<00:06:19.520> only<00:06:19.730> pretty<00:06:20.180> much<00:06:20.390> I<00:06:20.660> guess<00:06:21.230> water

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
heat only pretty much I guess water

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:28.930 
heat only pretty much I guess water
could<00:06:21.800> do<00:06:21.920> it<00:06:22.040> too<00:06:23.050> but<00:06:26.110> this<00:06:27.110> is<00:06:27.230> badass<00:06:27.940> when

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
could do it too but this is badass when

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.920 
could do it too but this is badass when
do<00:06:29.090> you<00:06:29.150> like<00:06:29.240> 900<00:06:29.870> and<00:06:29.990> 250<00:06:30.560> anyway<00:06:31.600> so<00:06:32.600> heat

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930 
do you like 900 and 250 anyway so heat

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.170 
do you like 900 and 250 anyway so heat
is<00:06:33.080> what<00:06:33.260> does<00:06:33.440> it<00:06:33.620> so<00:06:33.770> right<00:06:34.250> now<00:06:34.520> if<00:06:34.970> you've

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
is what does it so right now if you've

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.820 
is what does it so right now if you've
got<00:06:35.360> no<00:06:35.630> case<00:06:35.930> right<00:06:36.290> you're<00:06:36.470> just<00:06:36.500> kind<00:06:36.800> of

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
got no case right you're just kind of

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
got no case right you're just kind of
free<00:06:37.130> airing<00:06:37.580> it<00:06:38.290> the<00:06:39.290> Raspberry<00:06:39.740> Pi<00:06:39.850> it

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
free airing it the Raspberry Pi it

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.260 
free airing it the Raspberry Pi it
should<00:06:41.180> stay<00:06:41.480> you<00:06:41.750> know<00:06:41.840> relatively<00:06:42.650> cool<00:06:43.310> but

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
should stay you know relatively cool but

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.820 
should stay you know relatively cool but
the<00:06:44.600> best<00:06:44.780> way<00:06:44.930> to<00:06:44.960> keep<00:06:45.170> your<00:06:45.320> Raspberry<00:06:45.770> Pi

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
the best way to keep your Raspberry Pi

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.600 
the best way to keep your Raspberry Pi
cool<00:06:46.280> is<00:06:46.580> to<00:06:47.030> have<00:06:47.300> it<00:06:47.450> by<00:06:47.570> a<00:06:47.600> fan<00:06:48.140> or<00:06:48.890> something

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
cool is to have it by a fan or something

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.640 
cool is to have it by a fan or something
that<00:06:49.850> is<00:06:49.940> going<00:06:50.120> to<00:06:50.180> continue<00:06:50.990> moving<00:06:51.530> away

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
that is going to continue moving away

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.280 
that is going to continue moving away
the<00:06:52.100> hot<00:06:52.430> Erik<00:06:52.820> so<00:06:52.910> you<00:06:53.030> can<00:06:53.180> put<00:06:53.360> your<00:06:53.510> finger

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 
the hot Erik so you can put your finger

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.140 
the hot Erik so you can put your finger
don't<00:06:55.040> touch<00:06:55.310> it<00:06:55.520> but<00:06:55.700> you<00:06:55.790> can<00:06:55.970> put<00:06:56.060> your

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
don't touch it but you can put your

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.610 
don't touch it but you can put your
finger<00:06:56.390> over<00:06:56.540> your<00:06:56.720> processor<00:06:57.320> and<00:06:57.440> you<00:06:57.500> can

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
finger over your processor and you can

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.170 
finger over your processor and you can
feel<00:06:57.860> that<00:06:57.890> it's<00:06:58.160> giving<00:06:58.460> off<00:06:58.550> heat<00:06:58.820> so<00:06:59.090> the

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
feel that it's giving off heat so the

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.210 
feel that it's giving off heat so the
best<00:06:59.300> thing<00:06:59.510> for<00:06:59.540> you<00:06:59.720> to<00:06:59.780> do<00:06:59.990> is<00:07:00.260> to<00:07:00.770> move<00:07:00.950> that

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220 
best thing for you to do is to move that

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.890 
best thing for you to do is to move that
heat<00:07:01.460> immediately<00:07:02.150> once<00:07:02.360> it<00:07:02.480> comes<00:07:02.720> off<00:07:02.870> of

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
heat immediately once it comes off of

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.180 
heat immediately once it comes off of
the<00:07:03.170> processor<00:07:04.690> so<00:07:05.690> anyway<00:07:06.020> that's<00:07:06.950> that

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190 
the processor so anyway that's that

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.860 
the processor so anyway that's that
that's<00:07:07.730> pretty<00:07:08.000> much<00:07:08.120> everything<00:07:08.720> you<00:07:08.750> need

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
that's pretty much everything you need

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.070 
that's pretty much everything you need
to<00:07:09.110> know<00:07:09.170> when<00:07:09.560> it<00:07:09.650> comes<00:07:09.920> to<00:07:11.080> overclocking

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 
to know when it comes to overclocking

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.340 
to know when it comes to overclocking
and<00:07:13.060> you<00:07:14.060> know<00:07:14.150> how<00:07:14.390> to<00:07:14.450> do<00:07:14.600> it<00:07:14.690> yourself<00:07:15.050> or<00:07:15.200> to

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:15.350 
and you know how to do it yourself or to

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.020 
and you know how to do it yourself or to
just<00:07:15.530> use<00:07:15.680> the<00:07:15.830> settings<00:07:16.250> that<00:07:16.340> they<00:07:16.520> give<00:07:16.790> you

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.030 
just use the settings that they give you

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.400 
just use the settings that they give you
I<00:07:17.210> want<00:07:17.450> this<00:07:17.630> ok<00:07:18.140> give<00:07:18.470> me<00:07:18.500> this<00:07:18.680> overclock

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410 
I want this ok give me this overclock

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.960 
I want this ok give me this overclock
thank<00:07:21.410> you<00:07:22.900> I'm<00:07:23.900> done<00:07:24.290> so<00:07:25.070> anyway<00:07:25.310> just<00:07:25.580> keep

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:25.970 
thank you I'm done so anyway just keep

thank you I'm done so anyway just keep
that<00:07:26.090> in<00:07:26.150> mind<00:07:26.240> when<00:07:26.480> you<00:07:26.570> do<00:07:26.660> overclock<00:07:27.310> that

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:28.750 
that in mind when you do overclock that

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.660 
that in mind when you do overclock that
it's<00:07:29.750> highly<00:07:30.200> likely<00:07:30.230> that<00:07:31.010> your<00:07:31.160> well<00:07:31.550> you're

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:31.670 
it's highly likely that your well you're

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.190 
it's highly likely that your well you're
probably<00:07:31.760> its<00:07:32.120> own<00:07:32.300> it's<00:07:32.510> certain<00:07:32.870> that<00:07:33.080> your

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:33.200 
probably its own it's certain that your

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.980 
probably its own it's certain that your
processor<00:07:33.710> will<00:07:33.920> run<00:07:34.100> hotter<00:07:34.490> so<00:07:35.210> just<00:07:35.840> keep

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:35.990 
processor will run hotter so just keep

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.180 
processor will run hotter so just keep
that<00:07:36.110> in<00:07:36.170> mind<00:07:36.290> as<00:07:36.680> you<00:07:37.510> as<00:07:38.510> you<00:07:39.470> you<00:07:39.920> know<00:07:40.010> kind
