three off the flower opens again these
are<00:00:58.980> ram<00:01:00.050> similar<00:01:01.050> fault<00:01:02.180> yeah<00:01:03.180> all<00:01:03.989> three<00:01:04.500> of

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
are ram similar fault yeah all three of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.820 
are ram similar fault yeah all three of
them<00:01:04.710> one<00:01:04.920> mortar<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.460> down<00:01:06.350> have<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.470> look<00:01:07.710> at

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
them one mortar is down have a look at

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.160 
them one mortar is down have a look at
one<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.700> simple<00:01:09.600> fetchers<00:01:09.930> right<00:01:10.080> as

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
one and it's simple fetchers right as

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.719 
one and it's simple fetchers right as
we're<00:01:10.320> attaching<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.710> wire<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.310> nobody<00:01:11.580> other

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
we're attaching a wire so nobody other

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.700 
we're attaching a wire so nobody other
tool<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:13.290> metal<00:01:13.560> balance<00:01:13.950> bars<00:01:15.020> wait<00:01:16.020> these

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
tool the metal balance bars wait these

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.039 
tool the metal balance bars wait these
things<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:17.159> missing<00:01:17.430> off<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.960> them

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
things are missing off of a one of them

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.039 
things are missing off of a one of them
so<00:01:19.830> if<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:19.979> come<00:01:20.159> up<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.490> remote<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
so if we come up with that remote in the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.520 
so if we come up with that remote in the
transformer<00:01:23.390> two<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.509> these<00:01:24.630> bags<00:01:24.869> full<00:01:25.290> of
