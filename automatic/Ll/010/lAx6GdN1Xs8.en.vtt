00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 what time 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.059
 When I was seven years old I was a girl 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.950
 I only got to me a very tall tree 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.200
 I would watch the sunsets that 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.800
 they did in front of my house and I put 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.170
 paint 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.420
 whenever I was wondering what do you think of 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.250
 life I'm going to be great suddenly not 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.810
 of stature but if I'm going to make a big 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.810
 artist I show my art in the streets 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.910
 I put it a space to put me 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.190
 paint I call people the individual I go 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.930
 painting and then I say the price of the 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.330
 pictures and who will buy it 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.880
 I need the knowledge of how to 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.350
 you can call my works of art and all 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.949
 those things 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.880
 I dream of being a great artist 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.690

 [Applause] 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.900
 I think the same thing happened to everyone 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.590
 that to us not as I was going 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.480

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.299
 what were you doing, everyone went 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.530
 imagining a picture in his head and I think 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:52.139
 that none of us imagine 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.599

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:58.139

 You can convert a large 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.430
 transparency in an illusion in a 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.459
