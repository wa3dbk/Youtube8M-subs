 link in the description hello to all today we 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.470
 analyze the final boss of the raid 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.840
 high hammer 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.539
 Emperor Margak battle with him 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.730
 relatively long and complicated consists 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.650
 she is of four main phases and 2 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.110
 transient despite the large 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.510
 number of phases of ability which marga 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.360
 will use almost the same ones 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.510
 same first phase will last until 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.300
 until the boss has 85 percent 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.340
 health up to this point marvel will 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.530
 use basic versions of their 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.470
 abilities let's quickly over them 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.320
 let's go through the tanks will have to watch out for 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.270
 buff accelerated assault the longer markov 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.910
 will kill one goal the more will be 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.700
 the speed of his attack is why a tank needs 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.800
 will change beyond that periodically 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.619
 one of the tanks boss marks the label 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.659
 chaos which explodes after 8 seconds 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.359
 causing great damage in radius 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.969
 thirty five meters tank with debuff 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:15.100
 must immediately run away from the raid otherwise 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:17.229
 You are waiting for the wipe if the mark of chaos 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.649
 hanged on the active tank second 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.209
 the tank must pick up the boss 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.609
 magic anger hangs on random 

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:26.829
 player debuff after 4 seconds 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.639
 deals damage to him and jumps to 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.729
 nearest 

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:31.209
 player within 200 meters with each 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.729
 leap 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:36.399
 damage increases by 25 percent a 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.439
 jump distance decreases by 50 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.179
 Of course, it is not desirable that 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.060
 ability jumped at random 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.340
 on the raid man who hanged himself 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.979
 devs and several other players 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.619
 should run away from the main part of the raid 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.869
 to absorb leap debuff up 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.950
 as long as he can no longer 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.159
 who spread 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.570
 and the devastating resonance will be gone 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.550
 creates minutes on earth if in her 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.430
 then come all the army get 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.530
 perceptible damage by a player who blew mine 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.899
 also takes a lot of damage and 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.390
 addition increasing damage from 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.360
 secret magic and causing stunning when 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.700
 each taking similar damage to the ring 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.360
 forces causing diverging from boss 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.910
 ring 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.830
 touch damage also 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.650
 periodically the boss will call 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.870
 magic hell operations which need 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.390
 will quickly kill as they 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.330
 For the second time, they cause aoe damage throughout the raid. 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.100
 the second phase begins when health 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.340
 Margaka reaches eighty five 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.410
 percent and it activates the rune bias 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.959
 now he will use the same ones 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.270
 abilities against the raid but they will 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.010
 modified arcane oil 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.380
 will give to the person with the debuff 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.590
 move further than 10 meters from the point 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.900
 where he got the debuff it certainly can 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.459
 make it difficult to throw a debuff but when 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.340
 good raid coordination 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.709
 should not cause any special problems traps 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.120
 from destructive resonance after 30 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.910
 seconds will appear 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.549
 double double be careful not 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.950
 stand with them a ring of the same power 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.500
 will now repel when touched 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.780
 Chaos Label now teleports tanks 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.610
 random point when laying tank 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.340
 will have to quickly navigate 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.980
 so as not to blow up the whole raid magical 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.350
 operations also change at the moment 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.560
 death they will throw back all the players 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.690
 second phase lasts up to 55 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.810
 percent of health after what you 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.090
 begins the first transitional phase of the morgan 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.549
 Kru runs not fortifications and starts 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.980
 activate it within 1 minute 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.269
 the boss rises into the air and at that time 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.920
 becomes invulnerable and causes hells 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.530
 noble war mages is fixed on 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.690
 15 seconds on random players and 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.760
 shelling them these players must 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.829
 keep a distance of 5 meters from 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.260
 the rest of the raid so as not to hurt 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.900
 any damage you need from the raid 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.730
 will dispel slowdowns also to magicians 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.129
 you canâ€™t let others down 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.049
 hells otherwise they will buff the auras 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.760
 domination 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.000
 unstable anomalies appear next to 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.860
 boss and tanks will need to be promptly 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.530
 intercept them here it is important to remember that in 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.229
 moment of death anomalies explode inflicting 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.530
 damage to the entire raid after receiving the rune 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.850
 fortification begins the third phase 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.639
 boss's abilities are changing again 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.699
 now after every arcane jump 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.800
 anger distance decreases by only 25 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.050
 percent so you have to either 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.760
 run away or do more 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.580
 throwing a debuff 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.280
 traps of destructive resonance now 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.710
 last twice as long ring of force now 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.199
 releases two additional rings 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.639
 the mark of chaos now immobilizes the tank 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.460
 therefore he must 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.590
 run off the whole raid of the magic operation 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.260
 now has 75 percent more 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.960
 health and now they do not act 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.080
 no effects control phase lasts up to 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.120
 25 percent health after which mark og 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.020
 starts to activate the last rune 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.120
 the rune of replication begins the second 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.729
 transition phase this phase is different from 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.580
 previous superfluous phenomenon of hell 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.680
 Glinsky destroyer a free tank 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.190
 should pick it up and turn it away from 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.440
 raid 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.650
 since andean acne is a destroyer 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.150
 frontal ouya from hangs up debuff 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.240
 crushing of armor as well as periodically 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.700
 kicks the current tank kicking it off 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.010
 and reset the threat level after 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.830
 activation fleece replication begins 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.080
 final fourth phase ability 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.750
 boss change final time 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.000
 now magic spell after the first 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.580
 jump causes another debuff on 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.120
 random player that is, you have to 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.470
 deal with two d buffs at once 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.690
 destructive resonance in the explosion 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.360
 or ending action now causes 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.820
 2 more traps ring of power now 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.330
 calls around every hurt player 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.370
 ou e radius of 5 meters mark of chaos at 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.610
 triggered now shoots at everything 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.470
 the sides of the spheres of the very large 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.199
 touch damage will have to go 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:12.140
 shy away from them magic operations 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:15.620
 after death will now cause 7 more 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.409
 small hells this phase is the most difficult here 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.900
 need to squeeze all available cool down and and 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:23.630
 squeeze the maximum DPS and to finish 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.210
 margaka as soon as possible especially long 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.729
 stay alive you here will not succeed 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.669
 the whole fourth phase is inherently 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.950
 is a detailed dps race
