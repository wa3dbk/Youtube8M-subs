 that a sisti master threw a bad shot 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.479

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.700
 I couldn't not put the burrata on you 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.470
 turnip tops and then nothing 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.869
 added a bit of pine nuts the broccoli 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.880
 chilli and sausage but missing 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:32.090
 the fundamental ingredient that inside a 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.090
 this box here then we open wide 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.840
 and it is not that a type of pasta anymore 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.940
 pugliese of that there is no time to 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.179
 orecchiette cooking you and it is 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.179

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.759
 silvana 12 minutes to prepare a 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.890

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.509

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.850
 what you have to do it the first now i put a 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.670
 bit of cooking water in this 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.700
 small pot where I will cook for 5 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.550
 broccoli minutes 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.940
 now I make a simple oil bottom 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.819
 and I put her to heat some shallots 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.170

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.440
 sylvan broccoli I want to put you a little 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.730
 anxiety though as we pay and skip 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.380
