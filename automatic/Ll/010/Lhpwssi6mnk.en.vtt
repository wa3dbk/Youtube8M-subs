hello<00:00:02.970> everyone<00:00:03.300> today<00:00:03.570> I'll<00:00:03.629> be<00:00:03.689> showing<00:00:03.780> you

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
hello everyone today I'll be showing you

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.089 
hello everyone today I'll be showing you
my<00:00:04.770> my<00:00:05.609> drawbridge<00:00:06.109> I've<00:00:07.109> got<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.410> moat<00:00:07.649> four

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
my my drawbridge I've got a moat four

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.100 
my my drawbridge I've got a moat four
blocks<00:00:08.309> wide<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.880> block<00:00:09.090> steep<00:00:09.360> single<00:00:09.960> block

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
blocks wide to block steep single block

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.480 
blocks wide to block steep single block
order<00:00:10.380> at<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.530> bottom<00:00:10.769> so<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.250> can't

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
order at the bottom so that you can't

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.820 
order at the bottom so that you can't
jump<00:00:11.910> back<00:00:12.120> out<00:00:12.300> if<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.570> fall<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.139> you'll

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
jump back out if you fall in and you'll

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.279 
jump back out if you fall in and you'll
see<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:15.089> block<00:00:15.330> hollow<00:00:15.599> they're<00:00:15.870> filled<00:00:16.199> with

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
see to block hollow they're filled with

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.900 
see to block hollow they're filled with
water<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.279> when<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.520> drawbridge

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
water so that when the drawbridge

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.179 
water so that when the drawbridge
phrases<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.840> then<00:00:19.289> lowers<00:00:19.590> again<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.010> water

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
phrases and then lowers again the water

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.380 
phrases and then lowers again the water
fills<00:00:20.460> back<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.789> naturally<00:00:21.920> this<00:00:22.920> switch

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
fills back in naturally this switch

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.300 
fills back in naturally this switch
raises<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:25.500> switch<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:27.740> as<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:29.039> my

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
raises it this switch and as with my

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.030 
raises it this switch and as with my
other<00:00:29.400> videos<00:00:29.840> each<00:00:30.840> switch<00:00:31.230> does<00:00:31.500> each<00:00:31.710> job

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.880 

right<00:00:35.040> now<00:00:35.899> I'll<00:00:36.899> go<00:00:37.079> show<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.320> how<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.710> works

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
right now I'll go show you how it works

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.430 
right now I'll go show you how it works
why<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.700> was<00:00:39.469> xor<00:00:40.469> gate<00:00:41.000> on<00:00:42.000> my<00:00:42.149> door<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:43.260> we

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
why it was xor gate on my door so we

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.080 
why it was xor gate on my door so we
open<00:00:43.680> from<00:00:43.800> both<00:00:43.950> sides<00:00:44.190> same<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:44.730> everything

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
open from both sides same as everything

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.779 
open from both sides same as everything
else<00:00:46.160> outer<00:00:47.160> door<00:00:47.370> yeah<00:00:48.360> door<00:00:49.789> downstairs

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
else outer door yeah door downstairs

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.270 
else outer door yeah door downstairs
I've<00:00:51.780> got<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> maintenance<00:00:52.530> room<00:00:52.739> before<00:00:53.160> all

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I've got a maintenance room before all

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.900 
I've got a maintenance room before all
my<00:00:53.309> circuitry<00:00:54.530> this<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.710> all<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> inner

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
my circuitry this is all for the inner

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.860 
my circuitry this is all for the inner
and<00:00:57.000> outer<00:00:57.270> doors<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.609> then<00:00:59.609> down<00:01:00.149> here<00:01:00.180> we

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and outer doors and then down here we

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.640 
and outer doors and then down here we
have<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> drawbridge<00:01:02.539> so<00:01:03.539> I've<00:01:03.750> got<00:01:03.930> sticky

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
have the drawbridge so I've got sticky

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.620 
have the drawbridge so I've got sticky
pistons<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> bottom<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:08.420> normal<00:01:09.420> pistons

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
pistons on the bottom and normal pistons

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.179 
pistons on the bottom and normal pistons
on<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> top<00:01:10.260> I'm<00:01:10.470> not<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.830> destroy<00:01:11.159> it

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
on the top I'm not going to destroy it

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.820 
on the top I'm not going to destroy it
because<00:01:11.700> if<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.960> water<00:01:13.140> flows<00:01:13.380> down<00:01:13.409> it'll

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
because if the water flows down it'll

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.679 
because if the water flows down it'll
destroy<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> circuitry<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.540> you're

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
destroy all the circuitry so you're

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.300 
destroy all the circuitry so you're
gonna<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.020> take<00:01:16.140> my<00:01:16.290> word<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.680> sticky

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
gonna have to take my word for it sticky

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.270 
gonna have to take my word for it sticky
normal<00:01:18.380> as<00:01:20.119> with<00:01:21.409> my<00:01:22.409> previous<00:01:22.680> videos<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
normal as with my previous videos the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.539 
normal as with my previous videos the
basic<00:01:23.580> idea<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:25.200> charge<00:01:25.890> from<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
basic idea is this the charge from the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.170 
basic idea is this the charge from the
outer<00:01:26.880> switch<00:01:27.150> comes<00:01:27.780> down<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:29.030> comes<00:01:30.030> down

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
outer switch comes down here comes down

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.560 
outer switch comes down here comes down
the<00:01:30.240> corner<00:01:30.420> enters<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.590> XOR<00:01:32.070> gate<00:01:32.250> same<00:01:33.180> with

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
the corner enters the XOR gate same with

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.920 
the corner enters the XOR gate same with
the<00:01:34.009> inner<00:01:35.009> switch<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:35.850> comes<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.750> down

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the inner switch there comes on down

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.170 
the inner switch there comes on down
repeaters<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.920> keep<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> charge<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.729> same

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
repeaters to keep the charge going same

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.749 
repeaters to keep the charge going same
on<00:01:39.270> both<00:01:39.299> sides<00:01:39.630> they<00:01:40.590> reach<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.840> output<00:01:42.840> here

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
on both sides they reach it output here

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:50.270 
on both sides they reach it output here
repeater<00:01:44.759> again<00:01:45.290> here<00:01:46.290> are<00:01:47.810> slowed<00:01:48.810> down<00:01:49.280> for

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
repeater again here are slowed down for

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.100 
repeater again here are slowed down for
the<00:01:50.340> bottom<00:01:50.460> box<00:01:50.729> because<00:01:51.119> these<00:01:51.540> Pistons

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
the bottom box because these Pistons

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.630 
the bottom box because these Pistons
have<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.409> be<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> last<00:01:52.799> activate<00:01:53.340> all<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
have to be the last activate all the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.280 
have to be the last activate all the
time<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:55.070> faster<00:01:56.070> up<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.549> top<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.540> single

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
time and faster up the top so single

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.120 
time and faster up the top so single
delay<00:01:58.530> tripled<00:01:59.369> away<00:01:59.899> again<00:02:00.899> if<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.890> missed

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
delay tripled away again if you missed

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.260 
delay tripled away again if you missed
the<00:02:02.700> concept<00:02:03.210> earlier<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.689> ideas<00:02:04.140> that

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
the concept earlier the ideas that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.819 
the concept earlier the ideas that
extended<00:02:06.270> Pistons<00:02:06.659> can't<00:02:06.990> be<00:02:07.110> retracted<00:02:07.740> and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
extended Pistons can't be retracted and

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.420 
extended Pistons can't be retracted and
there<00:02:08.759> are<00:02:08.910> not<00:02:09.319> affected<00:02:10.319> by<00:02:10.349> gravity<00:02:10.470> so

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
there are not affected by gravity so

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.400 
there are not affected by gravity so
these<00:02:12.330> Pistons<00:02:12.870> push

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
these Pistons push

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.260 
these Pistons push
the<00:02:13.530> two<00:02:13.980> blocks<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.580> gravel<00:02:14.970> up<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:17.270> the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
the two blocks of gravel up and the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.580 
the two blocks of gravel up and the
gravel<00:02:18.570> will<00:02:18.690> fall<00:02:18.930> back<00:02:19.110> down<00:02:19.140> naturally

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
gravel will fall back down naturally

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.150 
gravel will fall back down naturally
when<00:02:20.010> they're<00:02:20.190> attracted<00:02:20.810> but<00:02:22.160> extended

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
when they're attracted but extended

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.310 
when they're attracted but extended
business<00:02:23.250> can't<00:02:23.640> be<00:02:23.730> moved<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:25.080> power

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
business can't be moved so the power

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.040 
business can't be moved so the power
reaches<00:02:25.740> these<00:02:25.950> blocks<00:02:26.250> first<00:02:26.580> then<00:02:27.360> these

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
reaches these blocks first then these

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.700 
reaches these blocks first then these
pushes<00:02:28.920> these<00:02:29.850> Pistons<00:02:30.360> up<00:02:30.510> then<00:02:31.350> they<00:02:31.530> get

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
pushes these Pistons up then they get
