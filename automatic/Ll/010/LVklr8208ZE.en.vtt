the<00:04:31.700> hypothesis<00:04:32.210> of<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.330> situation<00:04:33.100> c-bro

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
the hypothesis of the situation c-bro

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.160 
the hypothesis of the situation c-bro
there<00:04:34.610> is<00:04:34.730> general<00:04:35.390> there<00:04:35.540> are<00:04:35.570> two<00:04:35.660> subjects

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
there is general there are two subjects

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.350 
there is general there are two subjects
the<00:04:36.320> situation<00:04:36.740> is<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:37.040> we<00:04:37.520> all<00:04:37.730> are<00:04:38.000> in<00:04:38.270> this

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
the situation is that we all are in this

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.420 
the situation is that we all are in this
world<00:04:38.540> together<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.440> we<00:04:39.710> all<00:04:39.860> have<00:04:40.160> a<00:04:40.190> cause

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
world together and we all have a cause

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.120 
world together and we all have a cause
but<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:41.330> cause<00:04:41.630> always<00:04:42.230> defines<00:04:42.590> why<00:04:42.890> we<00:04:43.040> go

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
but that cause always defines why we go

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.680 
but that cause always defines why we go
to<00:04:43.190> school<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:43.700> call<00:04:43.940> it<00:04:44.120> Jake<00:04:44.360> cetera<00:04:44.630> et

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
either the left or the right if you go

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.060 
either the left or the right if you go
left<00:04:53.510> what<00:04:53.960> happens<00:04:54.200> to<00:04:54.290> the<00:04:54.380> right<00:04:54.470> and<00:04:54.980> if

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
left what happens to the right and if

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.530 
left what happens to the right and if
you<00:04:55.160> go<00:04:55.280> right<00:04:55.430> what<00:04:55.820> happens<00:04:56.060> to<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.240> center

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
you go right what happens to the center

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.450 
you go right what happens to the center
if<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.110> center<00:04:57.440> is<00:04:57.590> elliptical<00:04:58.130> to<00:04:58.340> the

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
if the center is elliptical to the

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.580 
if the center is elliptical to the
circumference<00:04:58.970> then<00:04:59.510> why<00:04:59.780> is<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.350> world

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
circumference then why is the world

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:08.590 
circumference then why is the world
doing<00:05:00.830> this<00:05:00.980> to<00:05:01.100> us<00:05:06.910> but<00:05:07.910> why<00:05:08.150> will<00:05:08.330> I<00:05:08.360> have<00:05:08.510> to
