00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.330
 I tell you how it is done 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.379
 in this tutorial he decided how it is done or 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.330
 we will teach how to make a cover for 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:22.210
 your waterproof and floating phone 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.210
 for this we are going to use a mobile 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.300
 a couple of balloons 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.030
 and a sheet to check that it does not get wet 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.230
 inside we take the paper and roll it up 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.239
 on the mobile 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.180
 in this way we will know if something of 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.280
 Water 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.760
 then we take the balloon what 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.760
 we inflate 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.930
 and pressing against each other we get 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.660
 put the phone inside 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.520
 as we see is the loose mouthpiece in 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.890
 which we can start later for 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.250
 make it float 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.989
 the other side is quite tight 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.810
 making sure that the water does not enter we're going 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.070
 with our balloon we inflate it 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.070
 and we repeat the same operation 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.520
 but this time for the opposite side 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.800
 good and once we have put both 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.320
 balloons we will have the mobile phone sealed 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.110
 now we give way to inflating one of the 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.020
 parts in this case the interior to well 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.000
 make it float with the air inside and with 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.400
 Be careful not to leave, we take the 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.570
 two ends and we tie a knot 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.790
 something like that 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.570
 we will have prepared the mobile for 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.570
 throw it into the water 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.470
 well, we only have to prove that everything 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.730
 work properly we take the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.370
 container with water and submerged 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.540
 as we see fleet perfectly we push 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.540
 a little bit so that it submerges 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.900
 and after a few minutes we took them out 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.640
 with the wet covers we are going to remove the 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.040
 knot and we will check that everything is 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.230
 Dry inside 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.040
 If everything goes correctly, it should still 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.040
 have some air 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.250
 and to remove the covers we see that it has fallen 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.750
 a little bit of water but that is 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.750
 completely dry inside 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.940
 I hope you enjoy it 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.710
 and that's how it's done if you liked it
