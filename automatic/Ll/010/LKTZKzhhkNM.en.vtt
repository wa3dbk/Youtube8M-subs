00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.529
 hello very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:07.509
 new video today I bring you a shine 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.610
 trophies of assassin's creed revelations 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.640
 the trophy is the following arsonist 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.349
 fulfill all bomb missions not 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.299
 I'm going to show you how the missions are 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.239
 but I will tell you where you have to 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.829
 do them because the problem is that to me 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.599
 it cost me a lot of affection because 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.489
 I really did not know where to go 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.310
 to do the missions and the only thing 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:30.429
 must do is go to the bazaar is worth the 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.720
 bazaar is the commercial center of the 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:36.600
 city and this area is worth 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.790
 this area here we go to the piri icon 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.640
 reis that is the one that teaches us to do 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.480
 bombs and what it cost me to notice is that 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.480
 if you enter your house 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.309
 have this has areas to make bombs 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.460
 but what I did not realize is that there 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.940
 also a few fours on the wall to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.149
 do the missions 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.350
 I for example already have them but in case 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.079
 that you have not done these missions 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.780
 nor the trophy because the four paintings that 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.720
 there will shine you and every one is a 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.540
 mission of a different type of bomb 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.270
 so you do the four and the trophy 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.130
 will jump right I know that of course I wanted 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.320
 this trophy was just making bombs and 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.880
 make bombs and that's it but you had to 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.240
 do these four missions that we the 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.240
 give him 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.790
 so do not do the four missions and 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.470
 they give you the trophy 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.180
 so no 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.160
 first what I'm going to do one thing 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.170
 also that I'm sorry I could not go up 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.960
 videos this week because it's a bit 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.160
 bundled in addition and also as not 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.900
 I have new games from new games 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.980
 like sky or that but of course they are 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.620
 already a year ago and of those there are many 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.540
 videos and that and I do not want to go up but 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.280
 I do not want to upload videos of 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.070
 games that two or three years ago because 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.100
 They are already very old and they are not going to be 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.810
 attractive for those who see it then 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.450
 next month they take out those registered 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.979
 and I'll buy it then upload I think 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.980
 that from game uploaded enough videos 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.500
 because I play that I 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.020
 that what I 've seen I really like that 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.120
 that I hope this tutorial would be 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.690
 trophies and see you in the next video 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.690
 goodbye
