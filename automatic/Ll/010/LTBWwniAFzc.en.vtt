00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.859
 a beer and a red onion there I go 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.779

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.600
 is already quite hot we can get started 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.939
 already some sheets of aluminum foil 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.619
 prepared here we can do the opperdoes 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.119

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.439
 I even leave the skin on that 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.570

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.489
 flavor to the earth 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.350
 Once you've packed them all yourself 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.149
 you put them right on the barbecue and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.550

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.340

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.460

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.740
 stick out but can do more 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.439
 you are in the middle of aluminum foil 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.189
 do you still a little coarse sea salt and 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.460

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.530

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.990
 slightly different shape so you Coming up 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.180
 can easily recognize on the barbecue 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.880
 turn its why can i equal one 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.100
 little space to make the onions from the 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.460
 can access it 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.470
 so just put this in between 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.060
 and wait I have everything half a 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.950
 left alone so it would be now 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.580
 about to be ready I'm going to look 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.619

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.890
 prick in potato to see if he 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.170
 is done 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.539
 these opperdoes they are going around half 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.100
 finished for an hour if some are larger than 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.179
 it may very well be that fifteen minutes 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.049
 or maybe even half an hour 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:05.610
 no effe lasts longer with beetroot 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:08.670
 must be peeled just the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.180
 sauterne make delicious salad from 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.010
 a beetroot cuts nice segments 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.870
 potatoes cut a wave in the same 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.959
 segments as the bitches 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.519
 how big you unpack looks super 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.160
 good from those inside edges that are 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.720
 nicely cooked it is sharp and you from yourself 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.760
 a bit sweetish 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.650
 and can really last until the last leaf 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.870
 you all use out 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.109

 I like the arugula spicy salad 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.709
 I forget the potatoes they lay on 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.500
 just not too difficult to do tasty 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.810
 advantageously the onions needs a bit off 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.630
 get together I finish it with one 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.160
