in<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:00.930> lesson<00:00:01.170> I'll<00:00:01.439> be<00:00:01.589> covering<00:00:02.010> three

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
in this lesson I'll be covering three

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.090 
in this lesson I'll be covering three
common<00:00:02.790> travelers<00:00:03.149> speaking<00:00:03.480> parents<00:00:04.100> the

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
common travelers speaking parents the

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.839 
common travelers speaking parents the
first<00:00:05.339> pattern<00:00:05.700> uses<00:00:06.540> four<00:00:06.750> strings<00:00:07.170> and

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849 
first pattern uses four strings and

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.900 
first pattern uses four strings and
we'll<00:00:08.849> be<00:00:09.000> using<00:00:09.710> D<00:00:10.710> major<00:00:10.980> chord<00:00:11.160> as<00:00:11.670> an

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
we'll be using D major chord as an

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.480 
we'll be using D major chord as an
example<00:00:14.389> as<00:00:15.389> for<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.809> picking<00:00:16.139> pattern<00:00:16.490> you

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
example as for the picking pattern you

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.820 
example as for the picking pattern you
put<00:00:17.699> your<00:00:17.880> thumb<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.930> fourth<00:00:19.199> string<00:00:19.320> from

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
put your thumb on the fourth string from

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.880 
put your thumb on the fourth string from
the<00:00:19.920> bottom<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> middle<00:00:21.300> finger<00:00:21.890> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
the bottom and the middle finger the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.790 
the bottom and the middle finger the
first<00:00:23.070> string<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:24.210> pluck<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.630> at<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.619> same

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
first string you pluck it at the same

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.229 
first string you pluck it at the same
time<00:00:27.260> then<00:00:28.260> pluck<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:30.679> 3rd<00:00:31.679> string<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
time then pluck the 3rd string and the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.790 
time then pluck the 3rd string and the
2nd<00:00:33.750> string<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.640> then<00:00:35.640> back<00:00:35.940> up<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.510> 4th<00:00:36.989> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
2nd string and then back up to 4th and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.729 
2nd string and then back up to 4th and
down<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.579> 1st<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.410> off<00:00:40.410> back<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:41.809> 3rd<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.230> then

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
down to 1st and off back to 3rd and then

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.710 
down to 1st and off back to 3rd and then
a<00:00:43.980> second

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.170 

and<00:00:47.720> it<00:00:47.960> would<00:00:48.080> sound<00:00:48.320> something<00:00:48.950> like<00:00:49.160> this

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.270 

and<00:00:54.180> if<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:55.109> repeat<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.590> twice

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and if you repeat that twice

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.790 
and if you repeat that twice
it<00:00:56.640> was<00:00:56.850> sounds<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.449> this

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.670 

like<00:01:02.800> that<00:01:03.840> there's<00:01:04.840> another<00:01:05.140> way<00:01:05.380> you<00:01:05.410> can

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
like that there's another way you can

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.650 
like that there's another way you can
pick<00:01:05.890> instead<00:01:06.610> of<00:01:06.700> picking<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.120> fourth<00:01:07.390> and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
pick instead of picking the fourth and

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.470 
pick instead of picking the fourth and
the<00:01:08.230> first<00:01:08.470> same<00:01:08.830> time<00:01:09.100> you<00:01:09.910> can<00:01:10.090> pick<00:01:10.270> the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
the first same time you can pick the

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.550 
the first same time you can pick the
fourth

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
fourth

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.359 
fourth
then<00:01:13.159> 1st<00:01:13.600> 3rd<00:01:14.600> 2nd<00:01:15.590> 4th<00:01:16.600> 1st<00:01:17.600> 3rd<00:01:18.460> 2nd

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
then 1st 3rd 2nd 4th 1st 3rd 2nd

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.670 
then 1st 3rd 2nd 4th 1st 3rd 2nd
and<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.329> would<00:01:21.450> sound<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.750> this

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.330 

and<00:01:26.180> if<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.330> repeat<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.750> twice

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.630 

it<00:01:34.340> sounds<00:01:34.640> like<00:01:34.760> that<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:36.290> second<00:01:36.830> pattern

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
it sounds like that the second pattern

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.530 
it sounds like that the second pattern
uses<00:01:38.570> five<00:01:38.960> strings<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.850> for<00:01:40.850> our<00:01:40.940> example

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
uses five strings and for our example

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.590 
uses five strings and for our example
we'll<00:01:41.690> be<00:01:41.840> using<00:01:42.130> C<00:01:43.130> major<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:47.210> picking

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
we'll be using C major the picking

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.170 
we'll be using C major the picking
pattern<00:01:47.960> for<00:01:48.140> this<00:01:48.290> goes<00:01:48.830> like<00:01:49.070> this<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.610> put

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
pattern for this goes like this you put

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.170 
pattern for this goes like this you put
the<00:01:50.300> fifth<00:01:50.660> and<00:01:51.230> the<00:01:52.040> first<00:01:52.310> string<00:01:52.610> at<00:01:53.030> the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
the fifth and the first string at the

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.749 
the fifth and the first string at the
same<00:01:53.390> time<00:01:54.550> and<00:01:55.550> then<00:01:55.730> the<00:01:55.850> fourth<00:01:57.820> third

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
same time and then the fourth third

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.610 
same time and then the fourth third
and<00:02:01.180> then<00:02:01.299> a<00:02:01.420> fifth

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
and then a fifth

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.100 
and then a fifth
second<00:02:05.270> for

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.110 

and<00:02:09.740> then<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.940> fifth<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:13.190> second<00:02:13.730> same<00:02:13.940> time

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
and then the fifth and second same time

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:29.040 
and then the fifth and second same time
and<00:02:16.330> then<00:02:17.160> for<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:21.599> 51st<00:02:23.069> fourth<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.900> it

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
and then for the 51st fourth and it

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.780 
and then for the 51st fourth and it
sounds<00:02:29.410> like<00:02:29.590> this

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:45.520 

and<00:02:35.790> if<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.060> repeat<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.750> twice

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.289 

there's<00:02:46.530> also<00:02:46.769> an<00:02:47.099> alternative<00:02:47.730> way<00:02:47.909> to<00:02:47.939> pick

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
there's also an alternative way to pick

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.550 
there's also an alternative way to pick
this<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:50.370> instead<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.959> first

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
this you instead of the first

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.160 
this you instead of the first
and<00:02:53.159> the<00:02:53.280> fifth<00:02:53.519> twice<00:02:54.349> you<00:02:55.349> pluck<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:56.060> fifth

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
and the fifth twice you pluck the fifth

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.550 
and the fifth twice you pluck the fifth
first<00:02:58.579> then<00:02:59.579> two<00:02:59.849> for<00:03:00.799> third<00:03:01.939> fifth<00:03:03.560> second

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
first then two for third fifth second

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.379 
first then two for third fifth second
fourth<00:03:05.420> third<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:07.459> then<00:03:08.459> go<00:03:08.700> back<00:03:08.879> instead<00:03:09.329> of

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
fourth third and then go back instead of

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.000 
fourth third and then go back instead of
plucking<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.959> fifth<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.439> second<00:03:10.829> twice

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
plucking the fifth and the second twice

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.789 
plucking the fifth and the second twice
you<00:03:11.340> pluck<00:03:11.579> the<00:03:11.730> fifth<00:03:12.530> second<00:03:13.530> fourth<00:03:14.629> third

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
you pluck the fifth second fourth third

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.900 
you pluck the fifth second fourth third
fifth<00:03:17.030> first<00:03:18.049> fourth

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:32.410 

and<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.830> sounds<00:03:24.340> like<00:03:24.400> this

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.000 

if<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.570> play<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:33.960> twice<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.710> would<00:03:34.860> sound

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
if you play that twice it would sound

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:44.000 
if you play that twice it would sound
like<00:03:35.160> this

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.070 

the<00:03:45.010> last<00:03:45.250> child<00:03:45.549> speaking<00:03:45.970> pattern<00:03:46.450> that<00:03:47.049> I

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
the last child speaking pattern that I

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.270 
the last child speaking pattern that I
will<00:03:47.290> cover<00:03:47.819> uses<00:03:48.819> six<00:03:49.299> strings<00:03:49.599> and<00:03:50.159> as<00:03:51.159> an

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
will cover uses six strings and as an

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.890 
will cover uses six strings and as an
example<00:03:51.580> we'll<00:03:51.940> be<00:03:51.970> using<00:03:52.090> G<00:03:52.720> at<00:03:52.900> nine<00:03:54.900> the

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
example we'll be using G at nine the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.080 
example we'll be using G at nine the
picking<00:03:56.260> pattern<00:03:56.440> for<00:03:56.890> this<00:03:57.040> one<00:03:57.280> goes<00:03:57.760> as

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
picking pattern for this one goes as

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.089 
picking pattern for this one goes as
such<00:03:58.330> you<00:03:58.959> pluck<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.409> fifth

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
such you pluck the fifth

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.030 
such you pluck the fifth
I<00:04:00.190> mean<00:04:00.340> sixth<00:04:00.849> and<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:02.019> first<00:04:02.260> at<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.860> same

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
time forward then second

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.810 
time forward then second
fourth<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:13.600> then<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.020> plot<00:04:14.320> the<00:04:14.530> fifth<00:04:15.280> and

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
fourth and then you plot the fifth and

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.819 
fourth and then you plot the fifth and
the<00:04:15.940> second<00:04:16.359> same<00:04:16.540> time<00:04:17.250> then<00:04:18.250> move<00:04:18.519> to<00:04:18.820> fourth

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
the second same time then move to fourth

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.250 
the second same time then move to fourth
third<00:04:21.750> sixth<00:04:23.100> first

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
third sixth first

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.050 
third sixth first
for

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.230 

and<00:04:29.300> that<00:04:30.140> sounds<00:04:30.620> like<00:04:30.680> this

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:43.880 

if<00:04:36.020> you<00:04:36.139> played<00:04:36.350> that<00:04:36.380> twice

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.280 

it<00:04:44.890> sounds<00:04:45.280> like<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.640> there's<00:04:46.540> also<00:04:46.810> an

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
it sounds like that there's also an

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.950 
it sounds like that there's also an
alternative<00:04:47.860> way<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.370> pick<00:04:48.790> this<00:04:49.000> instead<00:04:49.870> of

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
alternative way to pick this instead of

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.500 
alternative way to pick this instead of
picking<00:04:50.140> the<00:04:50.410> first<00:04:50.650> six<00:04:51.430> and<00:04:51.640> the<00:04:52.030> first<00:04:52.300> at

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
picking the first six and the first at

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.340 
picking the first six and the first at
the<00:04:52.600> same<00:04:52.810> time<00:04:53.020> you<00:04:53.710> can<00:04:53.890> pick<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.460> six<00:04:55.350> then

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
the same time you can pick the six then

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:07.170 
the same time you can pick the six then
first<00:04:57.450> fourth<00:05:01.890> second<00:05:03.450> fourth<00:05:04.890> and<00:05:05.970> then<00:05:06.970> go

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
first fourth second fourth and then go

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.510 
first fourth second fourth and then go
back<00:05:07.420> and<00:05:07.810> instead<00:05:08.380> of<00:05:08.440> picking<00:05:08.710> the<00:05:09.100> fifth

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
back and instead of picking the fifth

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.390 
back and instead of picking the fifth
and<00:05:09.790> a<00:05:09.850> second<00:05:10.270> together<00:05:10.960> you<00:05:11.800> can<00:05:11.950> pick<00:05:12.160> the

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
and a second together you can pick the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:26.159 
and a second together you can pick the
fifth<00:05:13.230> second<00:05:14.370> fourth<00:05:19.260> sixth<00:05:20.460> second

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:33.340 

and<00:05:27.129> that<00:05:27.580> would<00:05:27.699> sound<00:05:27.909> like<00:05:28.030> this

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.200 

if<00:05:34.350> you<00:05:34.560> repeat<00:05:34.830> that<00:05:35.040> twice<00:05:35.250> it<00:05:35.820> would<00:05:36.060> sound

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
if you repeat that twice it would sound

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.360 
if you repeat that twice it would sound
