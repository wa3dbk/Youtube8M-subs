00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.539 
animation and the actual story of this
anime<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.380> absolutely<00:01:13.380> insane<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:14.250> almost

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
anime is absolutely insane it's almost

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.179 
anime is absolutely insane it's almost
impossible<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.299> truly<00:01:15.810> convey<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.380> I'm<00:01:17.040> going

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
impossible to truly convey so I'm going

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.620 
impossible to truly convey so I'm going
to<00:01:17.250> try<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.430> break<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.939> down<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
to try to break it down for you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
to try to break it down for you
essentially<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> ultimate<00:01:19.920> spin

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
