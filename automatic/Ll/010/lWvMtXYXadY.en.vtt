want to be plain invisible stalker
there's<00:01:49.740> all<00:01:50.369> these<00:01:50.820> different<00:01:51.060> versions<00:01:52.049> of

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
there's all these different versions of

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.440 
there's all these different versions of
the<00:01:52.290> stack<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.590> they're<00:01:52.799> all<00:01:52.950> winning<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:54.090> I

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
the stack and they're all winning and I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.270 
the stack and they're all winning and I
think<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> biggest<00:01:54.899> thing<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.320> delver<00:01:56.070> ties

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
think the biggest thing is delver ties

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.190 
think the biggest thing is delver ties
them<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:56.549> together<00:01:56.670> yeah<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.630> course<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:58.079> I

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
them all together yeah of course like I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.240 
them all together yeah of course like I
think<00:01:58.439> all<00:01:58.590> these<00:01:58.770> decks<00:01:59.009> would<00:01:59.130> be

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
think all these decks would be

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.370 
think all these decks would be
reasonable<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.360> their<00:02:00.540> own<00:02:00.659> right<00:02:00.930> without

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
reasonable in their own right without

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.899 
reasonable in their own right without
delver<00:02:01.829> secrets<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> fact<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.790> you

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
delver secrets but the fact that you

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.340 
delver secrets but the fact that you
have<00:02:03.119> delver<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:03.899> get<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.049> play<00:02:04.200> tone

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
have delver you just get to play tone

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.780 
have delver you just get to play tone
turn<00:02:04.530> one<00:02:04.740> if<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.070> flip<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:05.729> you

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
turn one if you flip it you know you

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.449 
turn one if you flip it you know you
have<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.060> 20<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.960> 28<00:02:07.380> things<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.160> flip<00:02:08.340> it

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
have like 20 to 28 things that flip it

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.469 
have like 20 to 28 things that flip it
depending<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:08.970> version<00:02:09.090> you're<00:02:09.300> playing

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
depending on the version you're playing

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.059 
depending on the version you're playing
and<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.720> just<00:02:09.899> leads<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.649> bunch<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.890> free

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
and that just leads to a bunch of free

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.680 
and that just leads to a bunch of free
wins<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.700> makes<00:02:11.879> your<00:02:12.120> tournaments<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> lot

easier
and<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:14.100> don't<00:02:14.550> know<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.670> think<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.970> could<00:02:15.090> just

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
and I don't know I think you could just

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.940 
and I don't know I think you could just
like<00:02:15.420> get<00:02:15.660> rid<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:15.960> make<00:02:16.470> everyone<00:02:16.800> have

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
like get rid of that make everyone have

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.550 
like get rid of that make everyone have
to<00:02:16.980> play<00:02:17.220> fair<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.960> like<00:02:18.960> these<00:02:19.170> decks<00:02:19.380> would

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
to play fair and like these decks would

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.130 
to play fair and like these decks would
still<00:02:19.740> exist<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.370> what<00:02:21.240> what<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.050> about

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
still exist so what what is it about

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.860 
still exist so what what is it about
delver<00:02:22.500> like<00:02:22.680> why<00:02:22.920> why<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.460> think<00:02:23.640> that

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
delver like why why do you think that

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.690 
delver like why why do you think that
it's<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.470> know<00:02:25.500> making<00:02:25.860> all<00:02:26.130> these<00:02:26.280> decks<00:02:26.520> so

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
biggest thing is that blue shouldn't

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.930 
biggest thing is that blue shouldn't
