most major big-box stores all right
we're<00:02:08.869> gonna<00:02:08.959> start<00:02:09.290> by<00:02:09.470> bending<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:10.040> top<00:02:10.250> of

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
we're gonna start by bending the top of

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.790 
we're gonna start by bending the top of
the<00:02:12.200> tube<00:02:12.670> sliding<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.820> cord<00:02:14.120> end<00:02:14.330> like<00:02:14.540> that

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
and then use your needle nose pliers to

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.290 
and then use your needle nose pliers to
crimp<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.840> loop<00:02:20.840> closed<00:02:22.180> securing<00:02:23.180> the
