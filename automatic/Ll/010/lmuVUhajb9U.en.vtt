under local anesthetic and the recovery

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.220 
under local anesthetic and the recovery
is<00:02:21.480> usually<00:02:22.019> only<00:02:22.170> five<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.769> seven<00:02:23.130> days

different ways the first one is and many
of<00:02:32.269> you<00:02:32.360> will<00:02:32.480> roll<00:02:32.599> your<00:02:32.810> eyes<00:02:32.840> back<00:02:33.260> when<00:02:33.560> I

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
of you will roll your eyes back when I

of you will roll your eyes back when I
say<00:02:34.069> this<00:02:34.250> is<00:02:34.519> that<00:02:34.670> will<00:02:34.790> last<00:02:34.970> forever<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:35.599> I

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
say this is that will last forever and I

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.380 
say this is that will last forever and I
love<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.860> use<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.129> identical<00:02:37.640> twin<00:02:37.849> analogy

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
love to use the identical twin analogy

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.110 
love to use the identical twin analogy
let's<00:02:38.870> say<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.680> had<00:02:40.250> identical<00:02:40.760> twin

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
let's say that you had identical twin

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.570 
let's say that you had identical twin
and<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.989> one<00:02:42.110> of<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.319> had<00:02:42.530> let's<00:02:43.040> say<00:02:43.159> you

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
and that one of you had let's say you

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.750 
and that one of you had let's say you
for<00:02:43.940> example<00:02:44.299> had<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.769> facelift<00:02:45.769> a<00:02:46.129> light<00:02:46.489> lift

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
for example had a facelift a light lift

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.720 
for example had a facelift a light lift
and<00:02:47.030> your<00:02:47.870> twin<00:02:48.170> did<00:02:48.319> not<00:02:48.500> well<00:02:49.370> from<00:02:49.549> that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
and your twin did not well from that

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.150 
and your twin did not well from that
time<00:02:50.060> forward<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:50.900> will<00:02:51.049> always<00:02:51.560> look

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
time forward you will always look

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.339 
time forward you will always look
younger<00:02:52.430> than<00:02:52.580> your<00:02:52.819> identical<00:02:53.269> twin<00:02:53.349> five

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
younger than your identical twin five

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.619

years<00:02:56.810> from<00:02:56.989> now<00:02:57.110> you'll<00:02:57.920> always<00:02:58.250> look<00:02:58.430> so

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
years from now you'll always look so

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.150 
years from now you'll always look so
many<00:02:58.909> years<00:02:59.090> younger<00:02:59.569> but<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.680> doesn't<00:03:00.829> mean

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
many years younger but that doesn't mean

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.309 
many years younger but that doesn't mean
that<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.549> stop<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.150> clock<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.720> time<00:03:02.750> and

that you stop the clock of time and

that you stop the clock of time and

ten years younger older rather than you

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:13.990 
ten years younger older rather than you

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
did right after you recovered from it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.789

but<00:03:14.569> you'll<00:03:14.720> always<00:03:15.019> have<00:03:15.349> those<00:03:15.530> long

their concern that the facelift will

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.900 
their concern that the facelift will

correct the neck and the face that most

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.160 
correct the neck and the face that most
patients<00:03:44.020> want<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.380> have<00:03:44.550> changed

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.620 

question<00:03:50.650> that's<00:03:50.860> asked<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.340> how<00:03:51.670> long<00:03:52.420> is

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
question that's asked is how long is

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.170 
question that's asked is how long is
recovery<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.410> this<00:03:54.040> actually<00:03:54.520> varies<00:03:54.970> from

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
recovery and this actually varies from

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.420 
recovery and this actually varies from
person<00:03:55.420> to<00:03:55.660> person<00:03:55.690> some<00:03:56.620> people<00:03:56.980> tend<00:03:57.310> to

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
person to person some people tend to

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.990 
person to person some people tend to
bruise<00:03:57.730> more<00:03:58.420> than<00:03:58.569> others<00:03:59.370> others<00:04:00.370> tend<00:04:00.849> to

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
bruise more than others others tend to

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.740 
bruise more than others others tend to
swell<00:04:01.300> more<00:04:01.750> than<00:04:01.900> others<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:03.099> it<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.390> so

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
swell more than others and it and so

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.380 
swell more than others and it and so
there's<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.959> wide<00:04:05.080> range<00:04:05.890> of<00:04:06.340> what<00:04:06.670> it<00:04:06.790> takes

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
there's a wide range of what it takes

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.350 
there's a wide range of what it takes
however<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.890> recovery<00:04:09.400> is<00:04:09.430> accelerated

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
however the recovery is accelerated

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.970 
however the recovery is accelerated
tremendously<00:04:10.930> from<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.290> traditional<00:04:11.770> face

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
tremendously from a traditional face

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.330 
tremendously from a traditional face
left<00:04:12.280> about<00:04:12.550> half<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:13.000> time<00:04:13.209> so<00:04:14.130> typically<00:04:15.130> we

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
left about half the time so typically we

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.280 
left about half the time so typically we
too<00:04:15.520> i<00:04:15.550> tell<00:04:15.880> my<00:04:16.060> patients<00:04:16.600> one<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.109> two<00:04:17.260> weeks

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
too i tell my patients one to two weeks

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.020 
too i tell my patients one to two weeks
they<00:04:17.829> should<00:04:17.980> be<00:04:18.100> ready<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.400> be<00:04:18.519> able<00:04:18.639> to<00:04:18.940> go

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
they should be ready to be able to go

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.710 
they should be ready to be able to go
out<00:04:19.150> in<00:04:19.269> public<00:04:19.450> if<00:04:20.410> you<00:04:20.560> have<00:04:21.450> more<00:04:22.450> than<00:04:22.510> one

out in public if you have more than one

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.719 
out in public if you have more than one
procedure<00:04:23.260> like<00:04:23.680> for<00:04:23.919> example<00:04:23.950> say<00:04:24.520> you<00:04:24.550> got<00:04:24.700> a

procedure like for example say you got a

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.390 
procedure like for example say you got a
light<00:04:24.970> lift<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.540> you<00:04:26.229> had<00:04:26.440> your<00:04:26.680> eyes<00:04:27.010> down

light lift and you had your eyes down

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.640 
light lift and you had your eyes down
the<00:04:27.550> block<00:04:27.729> or<00:04:27.910> plasti<00:04:28.389> and<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.050> also<00:04:29.290> had<00:04:29.620> a

the block or plasti and you also had a

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.520 
the block or plasti and you also had a
