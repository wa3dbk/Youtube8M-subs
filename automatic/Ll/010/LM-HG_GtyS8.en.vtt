hello formylation productions today I'm
going<00:00:07.670> to<00:00:07.760> show<00:00:07.970> you<00:00:08.029> a<00:00:08.180> project<00:00:09.170> I've<00:00:09.500> been

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
going to show you a project I've been

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.919 
going to show you a project I've been
working<00:00:10.040> on<00:00:10.099> which<00:00:10.849> is<00:00:11.059> a<00:00:11.090> DC<00:00:11.719> motor

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
working on which is a DC motor

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.650 
working on which is a DC motor
conversion<00:00:12.650> for<00:00:12.860> my<00:00:13.009> tag<00:00:13.339> milling<00:00:14.330> machine

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
conversion for my tag milling machine

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.650 
conversion for my tag milling machine
and<00:00:15.589> as<00:00:16.280> you<00:00:16.460> can<00:00:16.610> see<00:00:16.850> all<00:00:17.210> I've<00:00:17.420> basically

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
and as you can see all I've basically

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.620 
and as you can see all I've basically
done<00:00:18.020> here<00:00:18.500> is<00:00:18.650> I've<00:00:18.860> taken<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:19.520> DC<00:00:20.030> motor<00:00:20.330> and

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
done here is I've taken the DC motor and

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.550 
done here is I've taken the DC motor and
speed<00:00:21.620> control<00:00:21.850> from<00:00:22.850> a<00:00:22.880> sherline<00:00:23.570> mill<00:00:23.840> and

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
speed control from a sherline mill and

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.970 
speed control from a sherline mill and
adapted<00:00:25.100> it<00:00:25.190> for<00:00:25.460> use<00:00:25.700> on<00:00:26.000> my<00:00:26.150> take<00:00:26.950> not<00:00:27.950> a

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
adapted it for use on my take not a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.430 
adapted it for use on my take not a
whole<00:00:28.280> lot<00:00:28.520> going<00:00:28.550> into<00:00:29.060> here<00:00:29.510> a<00:00:29.660> little<00:00:30.230> bit

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
whole lot going into here a little bit

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.360 
whole lot going into here a little bit
time-consuming<00:00:31.059> but<00:00:32.059> basically<00:00:32.960> we've<00:00:33.860> just

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
time-consuming but basically we've just

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.209 
time-consuming but basically we've just
got<00:00:34.640> a<00:00:34.879> redone<00:00:35.570> motor<00:00:35.899> mount<00:00:36.199> to<00:00:36.499> fit<00:00:36.980> the

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
got a redone motor mount to fit the

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.150 
got a redone motor mount to fit the
smaller<00:00:37.609> motor<00:00:37.940> on<00:00:38.179> there<00:00:38.559> and<00:00:39.559> I<00:00:39.769> cut<00:00:40.039> about

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
smaller motor on there and I cut about

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.509 
smaller motor on there and I cut about
half<00:00:40.640> of<00:00:40.789> an<00:00:40.969> inch<00:00:41.089> off<00:00:41.420> that<00:00:41.749> main<00:00:42.519> platform

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
half of an inch off that main platform

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.389 
half of an inch off that main platform
here<00:00:43.850> where<00:00:44.749> the<00:00:45.379> original<00:00:45.589> motor<00:00:46.100> was

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
here where the original motor was

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.610 
here where the original motor was
mounted<00:00:48.100> which<00:00:49.100> made<00:00:49.879> it<00:00:50.030> fit<00:00:50.600> on<00:00:50.839> the<00:00:51.469> now

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
mounted which made it fit on the now

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.479 
mounted which made it fit on the now
lower<00:00:51.980> pulleys<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.859> the<00:00:54.859> larger<00:00:55.249> pulley

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
lower pulleys and the larger pulley

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.939 
lower pulleys and the larger pulley
which<00:00:55.940> attaches<00:00:56.359> to<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.809> spindle<00:00:57.019> has<00:00:57.649> been

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
which attaches to the spindle has been

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.309 
which attaches to the spindle has been
bored<00:00:58.219> out<00:00:59.019> to<00:01:00.019> fit<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:00.679> new<00:01:01.960> headstock<00:01:02.960> here

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
bored out to fit the new headstock here

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:07.569 
bored out to fit the new headstock here
and<00:01:05.110> that's<00:01:06.110> basically<00:01:06.680> it<00:01:06.920> for<00:01:07.190> the<00:01:07.370> motor

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
and that's basically it for the motor

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.109 
and that's basically it for the motor
setup<00:01:08.619> now<00:01:09.619> for<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.130> speed<00:01:10.369> control<00:01:10.790> I<00:01:10.820> want

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
setup now for the speed control I want

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.459 
setup now for the speed control I want
something<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.540> little<00:01:11.810> bit<00:01:11.990> different<00:01:12.409> I

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
something a little bit different I

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.160 
something a little bit different I
wanted<00:01:12.829> to<00:01:12.950> pull<00:01:13.159> it<00:01:13.280> off<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.630> motor<00:01:14.869> which

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
wanted to pull it off of the motor which

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.319 
wanted to pull it off of the motor which
normally<00:01:15.740> is<00:01:15.799> where<00:01:16.040> attaches<00:01:16.670> in<00:01:16.790> our<00:01:16.909> line

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
normally is where attaches in our line

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:20.200 
normally is where attaches in our line
mill<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:17.869> move<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:18.920> to<00:01:19.100> side<00:01:19.399> column<00:01:19.880> on<00:01:20.000> the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
mill and move it to side column on the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.109 
mill and move it to side column on the
mill<00:01:20.420> itself<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:21.229> little<00:01:21.829> bit<00:01:21.950> more<00:01:22.729> out<00:01:22.909> of<00:01:22.939> the

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
mill itself a little bit more out of the

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.670 
mill itself a little bit more out of the
way<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:23.329> I<00:01:23.600> have<00:01:23.719> less<00:01:23.979> stuff<00:01:24.979> attached<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:26.030> the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
way so I have less stuff attached to the

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.779 
way so I have less stuff attached to the
z-axis<00:01:27.680> there<00:01:29.320> but<00:01:30.320> as<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:30.920> can<00:01:31.070> see<00:01:31.130> I've<00:01:31.490> got

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
z-axis there but as you can see I've got

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.399 
z-axis there but as you can see I've got
the<00:01:32.859> Box<00:01:33.859> basically<00:01:34.640> wired<00:01:34.880> up<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:35.479> this

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
the Box basically wired up to this

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.649 
the Box basically wired up to this
platform<00:01:37.280> I've<00:01:37.880> bolted<00:01:38.329> on<00:01:38.680> using<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.799> same

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
platform I've bolted on using the same

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.039 
platform I've bolted on using the same
screw<00:01:41.659> positions<00:01:42.259> which<00:01:43.219> the<00:01:43.520> original

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
screw positions which the original

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.429 
screw positions which the original
on/off<00:01:45.049> switch<00:01:45.469> was<00:01:45.680> mounted<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:47.659> in

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
on/off switch was mounted to and in

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.709 
on/off switch was mounted to and in
addition<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.039> I<00:01:49.340> have<00:01:49.579> got<00:01:49.789> a<00:01:50.090> little<00:01:50.539> bit

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
addition to that I have got a little bit

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.260 
addition to that I have got a little bit
extra<00:01:50.750> of<00:01:51.289> a<00:01:51.409> control<00:01:51.799> panel<00:01:52.219> here<00:01:52.460> which

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
2 amp DC meter which should give me a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.029 
2 amp DC meter which should give me a
good<00:02:06.829> range<00:02:07.759> for<00:02:07.909> this<00:02:08.240> motor

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
good range for this motor

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.190 
good range for this motor
it's<00:02:10.039> very<00:02:10.460> maximum<00:02:11.270> peak<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.750> should<00:02:12.019> only

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
it's very maximum peak it should only

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.380 
it's very maximum peak it should only
peak<00:02:12.650> out<00:02:12.890> at<00:02:13.099> about<00:02:14.319> about<00:02:15.849> 1.7<00:02:16.849> 3

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
peak out at about about 1.7 3

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.030 
peak out at about about 1.7 3
five<00:02:17.510> amps<00:02:18.080> or<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:21.530> should<00:02:21.740> be<00:02:21.800> right

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
five amps or so so that should be right

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.980 
five amps or so so that should be right
within<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.520> range<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.970> any<00:02:23.120> operating<00:02:23.720> will

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
within the range of any operating will

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.530 
within the range of any operating will
do<00:02:24.140> with<00:02:24.319> it<00:02:24.670> as<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.970> can<00:02:26.150> see<00:02:26.360> you've<00:02:26.510> got

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
do with it as you can see you've got

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.270 
do with it as you can see you've got
some<00:02:26.930> modification<00:02:27.770> here<00:02:27.980> on<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.190> original

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
some modification here on the original

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.550

barely<00:03:14.690> see<00:03:15.080> that<00:03:15.350> at<00:03:15.500> all<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:16.430> our<00:03:16.610> meter<00:03:17.030> the

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
barely see that at all the our meter the

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.759 
barely see that at all the our meter the

little decimal point is currently

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.280 
little decimal point is currently
blinking<00:03:19.340> meaning<00:03:19.670> it's<00:03:19.760> working<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:21.080> I've

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
blinking meaning it's working and I've

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.530 
blinking meaning it's working and I've
got<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.620> pilot<00:03:21.980> like<00:03:22.250> put<00:03:22.489> in<00:03:22.610> there<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.209> also

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
got a pilot like put in there to to also

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.460 
got a pilot like put in there to to also
indicate<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:24.820> you<00:03:25.820> got<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.060> nice<00:03:26.470> variable

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
indicate that you got a nice variable

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.360 
indicate that you got a nice variable
speed<00:03:27.799> control<00:03:28.340> with<00:03:29.180> this<00:03:29.450> motor<00:03:29.720> now

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.089 

and<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:35.120> can<00:03:35.330> turn<00:03:35.569> it<00:03:35.720> down<00:03:35.750> pretty<00:03:36.260> darn<00:03:36.620> slow

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
and I can turn it down pretty darn slow

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:43.880 
and I can turn it down pretty darn slow
here

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.370 

and<00:03:44.460> it'll<00:03:44.730> ramp<00:03:45.120> all<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.570> way<00:03:45.690> up<00:03:45.960> to<00:03:46.200> what

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
and it'll ramp all the way up to what

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.420 
and it'll ramp all the way up to what
I've<00:03:46.500> measured<00:03:46.740> to<00:03:47.040> be<00:03:47.190> about<00:03:48.800> 26<00:03:49.800> or<00:03:50.070> 27

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
I've measured to be about 26 or 27

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.870 
I've measured to be about 26 or 27
hundred<00:03:51.150> rpm<00:03:51.860> which<00:03:52.860> is<00:03:52.890> still<00:03:53.340> slower<00:03:53.700> than

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
hundred rpm which is still slower than

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.120 
hundred rpm which is still slower than
the<00:03:54.090> original<00:03:54.570> tag<00:03:54.840> motor<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.500> came<00:03:55.680> on<00:03:55.980> it

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
the original tag motor that came on it

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.580 
the original tag motor that came on it
but<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:57.030> should<00:03:57.240> be<00:03:57.270> fast<00:03:57.660> enough<00:03:57.870> for<00:03:58.230> most<00:03:58.410> of

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
but it should be fast enough for most of

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:09.170 
but it should be fast enough for most of
my<00:03:58.710> purposes<00:04:07.070> the<00:04:08.070> slower<00:04:08.400> speed<00:04:08.730> they're

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
my purposes the slower speed they're

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.100 
my purposes the slower speed they're
using<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.610> larger<00:04:11.610> pulley<00:04:11.880> on<00:04:12.270> spindle<00:04:13.020> and

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
using the larger pulley on spindle and

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.740 
using the larger pulley on spindle and
the<00:04:13.230> smaller<00:04:13.560> pulley<00:04:13.950> on<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.220> motor<00:04:14.490> gives<00:04:15.480> me

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
the smaller pulley on the motor gives me

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.819 
the smaller pulley on the motor gives me
a<00:04:15.780> range<00:04:16.079> of<00:04:16.680> about<00:04:17.010> zero<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:18.590> fifteen<00:04:19.590> or

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
a range of about zero to fifteen or

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.300 
a range of about zero to fifteen or
sixteen<00:04:20.010> hundred<00:04:20.640> rpm<00:04:21.260> but<00:04:22.260> with<00:04:22.620> increased

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
sixteen hundred rpm but with increased

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.370 
sixteen hundred rpm but with increased
torque<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:23.880> course<00:04:26.360> and<00:04:27.360> that's<00:04:27.840> basically

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
torque of course and that's basically

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.280 
torque of course and that's basically
all<00:04:28.650> there<00:04:28.890> is<00:04:29.040> to<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:29.490> this<00:04:30.330> has<00:04:30.690> been<00:04:30.960> phase

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
all there is to it this has been phase

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.670 
all there is to it this has been phase
