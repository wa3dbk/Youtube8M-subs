00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.340 
closer in 60 K I think he's gonna run me
off<00:00:42.150> the<00:00:42.360> nitrous<00:00:42.720> so<00:00:42.839> it<00:00:42.900> means<00:00:42.989> I'll<00:00:43.199> have<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
off the nitrous so it means I'll have a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.049 
off the nitrous so it means I'll have a

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
chance oh yeah and he's about the same

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.310 
chance oh yeah and he's about the same
power<00:00:45.300> as<00:00:45.449> you<00:00:45.480> without<00:00:45.750> nitrous<00:00:46.110> right

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320

gen<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.270> GM<00:01:12.930> iron<00:01:13.200> block<00:01:13.530> with<00:01:13.890> stock<00:01:14.369> crank

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
gen for GM iron block with stock crank

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.350 
gen for GM iron block with stock crank
Eagle<00:01:15.570> rods<00:01:15.750> Blasco<00:01:16.200> Pistons<00:01:16.619> LSA<00:01:17.340> heads<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
Eagle rods Blasco Pistons LSA heads and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.719 
Eagle rods Blasco Pistons LSA heads and
it's<00:01:18.600> got<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> f1<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> neighbor<00:01:19.770> belt<00:01:20.189> okay

and so it's what horsepower about nine

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.880 
and so it's what horsepower about nine
probably<00:01:24.030> nine<00:01:24.150> fifteen<00:01:24.479> plus<00:01:24.689> okay<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.590> real

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
probably nine fifteen plus okay so real

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:36.890 
probably nine fifteen plus okay so real
