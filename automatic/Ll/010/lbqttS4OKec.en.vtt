 social and miniskirt 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.550
 the risks 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.550
 Everything seems to go completely off 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.580

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.290
 the conception margin to everything 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.640
 adjusted for the venues 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 otherwise, a color space appreciates 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.940
 Percent DAX 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.460

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.320
 on rejection 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.670
 we do not need it 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.840

 but they are really cool 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.269
 so not only did some things want to try 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.269

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.589

 they are not very big 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.789
 because there is no chance 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:29.969
