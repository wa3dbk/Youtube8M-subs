00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 the pt 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.290
 good then I made a post of hôtel de ville 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.880
 left comments asking to say 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.170
 What are the products I use in my 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.710
 course is one of them have changed and others 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:28.099
 still it is and separate my five 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.259
 Preferred is the first is cedi people 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.460
 What a clinic and what I have with 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.770
 three giant photos're almost done is he 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.870
 it's kind of heavy but can we when 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.790
 You start taking ink on your skin. 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.100
 I did not use it again after I started 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.200
 the new tactical technique very sensitive 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.530
 but once the treatment is over there is 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.090
 Little sure that everything never knows I 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.010
 I use makeup of the day 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.990
 so it's important not to not until all 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.150
 the days and he serves for it he 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.940
 It works for me a lot for that. 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.220
 and when I cleanse the skin which then 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.610
 Dude when I have to imitate guy 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.090
 the signal that you are cleaning is 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.680
 Good , I use sunscreen, I started. 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.749
 to use by indication of the logo 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.219
 I'll write the paper later, but I'll definitely go. 

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:21.350
 keep using I do not know how to speak 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.499
 In this brand, people are wrong. 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.609
 but anyway it's in the pharmacy sells some 

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:28.850
 pharmacies 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.049
 He is a 50-year-old sun protection actor and he 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.909
 has body 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.020
 Look, I'm just going to spend a little bit here. 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.729
 for you to see 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:42.850
 Look, it works almost like a 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:45.799
 base as well but it is very much is 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.289
 thin skirt and looks just fine 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.569
 spread it does not have several shades 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.700
 precisely because for those who have skin 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.679
 Clearly it works well when you 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.399
 he's not enough, I will not try to talk to him 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.829
 body 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.959
 so sometimes I swear I will not 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.840
 base to be alone with him I think he 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:05.329
 It does not cover the imperfections but gives 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.240
 unified in his thing and he has 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.940
 sunscreen 54 to 50 then go talk 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.620
 which is very important and you can take 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.300
 is as important as any 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.250
 another thing you use when your 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.870
 perfume knows 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.660
 you get older you'll see what 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.270
 It happens with pmn so it's too sunny 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.520
 she looks good she both appear she does not 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.360
 be treated then I am like this 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.760
 Here 's my moisturizer too. 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.320
 I started to pass after the coup year is 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.690
 this rock is is a former athlete here who 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.500
 it is made specifically 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.630
 specifically for people who are 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.880
 so completely standing 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.340
 then this dry one that affects nothing 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.980
 My part has always been Mass watching me. 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.260
 I do not even know it's very dry cause the route 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.480
 He was awaiting a rattlesnake in 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.070
 places and this fabric even helped me. 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.900
 a lot and it 's very good 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.450
 and I do not know if it is the most suitable for 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.060
 all girls who choose a good 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.489
 indication but does not use it is to several 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.380
 others of this brand that are very good 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.370
 the most expensive brand and the politician was also 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.320
 real and I was here crying but thanks 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.170
 very worth it is very Indian I use a lot 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:20.330
 Little do I know it's going to last a lot there. 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.600
 to wash the face of having given the order of 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:27.830
 your favorites rather you use this 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.880
 here it is from here trier is the morning is 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.850
 nerd 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.870
 it has micro and serious easy as soon as 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.420
 give energy years they say look at you 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.640
 vital has said positive stories 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.840
 that help sustain the energy of 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.540
 hotels like not buying a product from this 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.030
 that's good. 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.739
 the energy of my skin but I do not feel 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.380
 Very well when I spend the morning and the 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:58.760
 Bath, even wash the dishes, I feel. 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.480
 refreshed but the middle of the night is finally is 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.510
 dow jones 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.540
 but it is asking for a very bad taste 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.090
 ah and it's not exfoliating to type though 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.519
 have these balls and lewis went to him 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.890
 give only one bulb even the balls and 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.960
 nor does it feel when you pass so it's a 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.040
 good 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.600
 he is a cleaner who likes football 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.520
 and finally to leave a product that 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.440
 nor is it such treatment despite 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.290
 wall promising miracles but I wanted to 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.790
 talk a lot about him because I do not know 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.730
 nothing more 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.040
 is this blues bb king da l'oréal is who 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.050
 indicated me it was manu gavassi she took out 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.700
 a photo holding this product account 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.760
 and there was no way then I instrument 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.460
 I loved it and saved because I used other days. 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.370
 a base she cries I told her on the blog 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.970
 It's better face but that 's what left 675 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.580
 look like piloted makeup and 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.430
 now I realized that my body that he 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.890
 covers well he does not take all his 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.110
 ships already benefits some problematic it 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.450
 it will not be as potent as that but the day 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.720
 She knows the school day to work in a 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.940
 good because it unifies skin color and 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.810
 gives you a cover and it leaves the skin 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.610
 breathing 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.690
 he promises 5 promises to treat is to correct 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.610
 sky 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.560
 I do not know if that 's how things work or 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.120
 no but I can say that he is a good 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.540
 base for your day to day 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.060
 so this is it there are 33 some sheets 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.070
 that the clear is darker something like this 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.320
 again with the same sunscreen 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.240
 even if you have perry and when you 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.580
 it passes in your hand if it were the people 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.260
 not the exact color, no problem 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.680
 because it's very clear when you 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.440
 he spreads it gets imperceptible 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.890
 good now, yes , you are mine 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.840
 facial skin is hope you 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.460
 help you if you have any 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.000
 indication of legal production leave us 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.370
 comments 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.250
 I really want to know the length of the video 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.480
 I will only have one jewel so the channel that 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.710
