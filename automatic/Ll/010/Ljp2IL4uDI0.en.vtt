00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.310
 project mene come on and today we are with you 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.560
 we will download triceps 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.980
 analyze basic triceps exercises 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.160
 this we have a bench press lying narrow grip 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.029
 to work out the triceps from which 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.420
 consists last without this triceps 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.630
 shoulder 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.760
 that is, show the shoulder biceps 2 chapters and 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:43.050
 triceps we have 3 chapters that is she from 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.700
 three galaxies, that is what to do as 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.820
 train think of 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.590
 base exercises there are a lot of them 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.199
 push-ups on the bars this bench press narrow 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.510
 grip french barbell bench press 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.170
 french dumbbell press this 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.090
 dumbbells from the head pushups simple 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.550
 Russian paw but we will analyze the very base 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.189
 exercise yet others Let us examine 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.600
 later so narrow grip bench press cry 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.920
 we need to do this 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:16.650
 bench press bench itself and start 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.729
 sit on the bench stop list they 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.340
 go completely remember clear 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.280
 eye positions always 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.380
 goes under the bodice directly reach 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.500
 we will have our shoulder line somewhere 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.740
 may be a little bit already 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.109
 two kinds of cute 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.750
 open and sometimes concealed ie finger 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:40.549
 close all other fingers it 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.950
 done for safe advise 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.780
 closed grip it includes barracuda 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.149
 forearm 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.289
 open hold due from work on and off 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.869
 transfer you can completely 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.140
 concentrate on muscle work 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:58.780
 so take a closed fret to the bar 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.780
 I fell on the chest or on the person shooting 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:05.709
 coverage at our level 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.420
 shoulder-width can you already lower and 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:12.579
 squeeze out 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:19.360
 on the inhale lower and exhale squeeze 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:19.360
 we lower squeeze and so we do 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:36.139
 we put what we do we mean 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.769
 let out on the inhale and the bar somewhere on 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:42.049
 Breast middle immobilized purely our 33 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.690
 head shoulder muscles and squeezed everything 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.849
 simple enough that is the technique you 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.940
 understood and there is no need to make a deflection 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.220
 lower back and this exercise is not basic 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.500
 let's say as a barbell bench press is not here 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.500
 you need to do deflection in powerlifting 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.049
 if you need to do the bridge in the lower back then 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.750
 there is a goal no need to raise the maximum 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.160
 super weight goal to feel the trumpeter 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.390
 breaking through again to secure 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.200
 repeat sit down 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.830
 in order to eliminate the possibility 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.550
 make a bridge chip you can legs 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.730
 throw straight on the bench and then you don't 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:24.190
 will help your legs and other muscles 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:27.190
 clean it will be 32 now I will take the grip 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.190
 the hall 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.950
 see guys secret chip 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.099
 if you want to work more 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.020
 the inner 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:48.110
 the head of the triceps tobacco which is difficult 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:55.849
 here in like this so they have to 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:57.349
 go along the body along the edges if you want 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.540
 work out and lower head 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.540
 30 but elbows out 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.459
 understand the main grip of any kitchen 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.040
 closed and open closed grip 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.870
 includes three forerunners but does 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.330
 exercise more safely barbell not 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.330
 will fall on you if you make a bathrobe 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.340
 open does not hold the so-called current 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.830
 principle of transfer from work off 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.100
 but there is a rika bar that will fall on you 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.570
 be careful the second thing if you want 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.180
 work inside 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:44.680
 the triceps head should always be bigger 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.590
 be inside they have to go 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.630
 go leg must go along the body then 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.330
 will work inner heads to 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.610
 worked outwardly more elbows should be 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.240
 In Russia, the more people the more 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.670
 work the external head is clear here and 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.470
 all this is the base study exercises 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.730
 30 press the bar lying narrow grip do 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.070
 Good luck to all of you 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.190
 if someone liked it like 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.360
 write komenty ask questions I will 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.170
 very happy feedback
