block<00:00:56.670> launcher<00:00:57.000> pro<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.629> use<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.079> mod

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
block launcher pro so I can use this mod

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.849 
block launcher pro so I can use this mod
I'm<00:00:58.859> gonna<00:00:59.430> try<00:00:59.670> now<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.570> mod<00:01:00.930> looks

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
I'm gonna try now because this mod looks

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.100 
I'm gonna try now because this mod looks
like<00:01:02.070> it'll<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.460> worth<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.300> basically<00:01:03.750> it

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
like it'll be worth it so basically it

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.469 
like it'll be worth it so basically it
will<00:01:04.500> show<00:01:04.680> your<00:01:04.799> x<00:01:05.010> y&amp;z<00:01:05.610> coordinates<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.270> you

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
will show your x y&amp;z coordinates and you

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.020 
will show your x y&amp;z coordinates and you
can<00:01:06.630> zoom<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.020> out<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.380> d<00:01:07.860> mod<00:01:08.220> or<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
can zoom in and out of d mod or the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.120 
can zoom in and out of d mod or the
mini-map<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> mini-map<00:01:10.320> at<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.950> very

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
mini-map so the mini-map at the very

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.649 
mini-map so the mini-map at the very
left<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.909> bottom<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.360> mini-map

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
left and the bottom of the mini-map

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.750 
left and the bottom of the mini-map
there's<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.350> subtraction<00:01:14.189> version<00:01:14.520> there's

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
there's the subtraction version there's

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.090 
there's the subtraction version there's
20<00:01:15.360> my<00:01:15.570> god<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.290> never<00:01:16.409> talk<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> record

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
20 my god I can never talk on a record

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.940 
20 my god I can never talk on a record
so<00:01:17.460> trap<00:01:17.840> subtraction<00:01:18.840> button<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
so trap subtraction button and the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.980 
so trap subtraction button and the
addition<00:01:20.369> button<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.090> addition<00:01:21.299> obviously

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
addition button the addition obviously

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.770 
addition button the addition obviously
zooms<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.740> zooms<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.330> subtraction

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
zooms it zooms in and a subtraction

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.810 
zooms it zooms in and a subtraction
obviously<00:01:25.650> zooms<00:01:26.460> out<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:28.130> many<00:01:29.130> zoom<00:01:29.520> reach

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
obviously zooms out so many zoom reach

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.899 
obviously zooms out so many zoom reach
so<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.119> can't<00:01:30.479> go<00:01:30.689> any<00:01:31.049> farther<00:01:31.920> than<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.670> guess

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
so you can't go any farther than I guess

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.850 
so you can't go any farther than I guess
I'm<00:01:33.600> gonna<00:01:33.720> calculate<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.350> from<00:01:34.560> all<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
I'm gonna calculate that from all the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.319 
I'm gonna calculate that from all the
way<00:01:34.950> down<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.659> they're<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.110> 1<00:01:37.439> 2<00:01:37.470> 3<00:01:37.799> 4<00:01:38.430> 5<00:01:39.090> 6

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
way down so they're so it's 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.690 
way down so they're so it's 1 2 3 4 5 6
8<00:01:40.079> 9<00:01:40.320> 10<00:01:40.950> 11<00:01:41.430> 12<00:01:41.869> teen<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:44.070> do<00:01:44.220> 13

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
8 9 10 11 12 teen so you can do 13

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.719 
8 9 10 11 12 teen so you can do 13
clicks<00:01:45.060> from<00:01:45.420> DV<00:01:45.869> from<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> lowest<00:01:46.680> zoo<00:01:47.490> I

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
clicks from DV from the lowest zoo I

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.090 
clicks from DV from the lowest zoo I
mean<00:01:47.939> yeah<00:01:48.119> from<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.479> lowest<00:01:49.079> zoom<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.680> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
mean yeah from the lowest zoom in you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.620 
mean yeah from the lowest zoom in you
can<00:01:50.130> go<00:01:50.369> 13<00:01:50.790> clicks<00:01:51.060> out<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.049> 12<00:01:53.630> so

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
can go 13 clicks out so it's 12 so

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.780 
can go 13 clicks out so it's 12 so
obviously<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.470> gonna<00:01:55.619> be<00:01:55.740> 13<00:01:56.100> clicks<00:01:56.310> down<00:01:56.549> so

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
obviously is gonna be 13 clicks down so

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.959 
obviously is gonna be 13 clicks down so
yes<00:01:57.060> since<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:58.049> 13<00:01:59.040> zoom<00:01:59.310> pixels<00:01:59.759> I

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
yes since just like 13 zoom pixels I

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.990 
yes since just like 13 zoom pixels I
