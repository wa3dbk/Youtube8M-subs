00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
well the power plant is also a very

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.910 
well the power plant is also a very
stylish<00:01:48.090> product<00:01:48.720> as<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.140> see<00:01:49.380> one

disadvantage<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.939> maybe<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.420> fact<00:01:51.659> that

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
disadvantage to that maybe the fact that

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.719 
disadvantage to that maybe the fact that
it<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.229> get<00:01:52.530> scratches<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.310> fingerprints

it can get scratches and fingerprints
very<00:01:54.030> very<00:01:54.329> easily<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.680> that

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
very very easily but you can see that

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.350 
very very easily but you can see that
the<00:01:55.950> overall<00:01:56.219> functionality<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.090> device

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the overall functionality of the device

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.929 
the overall functionality of the device
is<00:01:57.570> great<00:01:57.869> one<00:01:58.649> thing<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.040> also<00:01:59.219> wish<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.790> in

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
is great one thing I do also wish is in

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.310 
is great one thing I do also wish is in
fact<00:02:00.119> at<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> end<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> cable<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
fact at the end of the cable the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.660 
fact at the end of the cable the
lightning<00:02:01.649> dock<00:02:01.799> connector<00:02:02.189> cable<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.640> is

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
lightning dock connector cable that is

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.700 
lightning dock connector cable that is
built<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.180> maybe<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:04.020> bit<00:02:04.200> thinner<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.680> I

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
built in maybe a little bit thinner so I

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.020 
built in maybe a little bit thinner so I
can<00:02:04.950> actually<00:02:05.100> charge<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.670> when<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:06.000> a

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
can actually charge it when I have a

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.570 
can actually charge it when I have a
case<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.509> however<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.259> no<00:02:07.409> big<00:02:07.619> deal<00:02:07.649> so

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
case on however that is no big deal so

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.830 
case on however that is no big deal so
overall<00:02:08.970> there<00:02:09.149> isn't<00:02:09.360> really<00:02:09.420> much<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.720> say

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
overall there isn't really much to say

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.690 
overall there isn't really much to say
