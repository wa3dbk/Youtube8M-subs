 Hi, I'm Eugenie. 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.050
 People usually have egg rolls with a retangular pan. 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.050
 Today I am going to show you how to make egg rolls with a round pan. 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.250
 For this recipe, you will need to: 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.090
 3 eggs 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.450
 Milk 1 tablespoon 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.700
 1 tablespoon of carrots, cut 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.000
 1 tablespoon chopped onion 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.500
 1 tbsp. Spring onion, chopped 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.920
 Salt and freshly ground pepper. 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 First, break the eggs in a mixing bowl 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.540
 Add in milk and salt. 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.170
 I am adding about ملعقة teaspoon salt. 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.170
 Whisk until combined. 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.410
 Then pass through a soft sieve to remove the plaques. 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.620
 Clases are known to contain cholesterol 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.620
 And they often remove the tissue finer than the dish. 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.500
 Add in carrots, onions, green onions, and all can be chopped. 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.250
 And add in pepper. 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.250
 And even stirred together. 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.160
 Lightly grease pan with vegetable oil, 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.160
 Today I'm using a spray oil and a 10-inch pan. It rolls a small egg. 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.400
 Heating pan. 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.400
 Then pour in 1/2 egg mixture and cook on low temperature 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 So halfway. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Roll half of the omelets into the center. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 If there is not enough oil, lightly lubricate the pan each time you roll up. 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.410
 Add the من of the egg mixture to the side of the omelet. 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.040
 And cook up half do. 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.040
 Roll the middle of the road again and move the egg roll to the center of the pan. 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.620
 Add in the remaining egg mixture and cook until half done. 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.620
 Finally roll all the way up. 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.870
 Transfer to the cutting board. 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.870
 When the egg rolls hot, it's easily broken. So let's cool before cutting. 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.200
 Slice now to bite bite size. 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.900
 And service. 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.300
 It's quick and easy. 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.410
 Everyone can make it, everyone likes it. she is beautiful. 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.410
 Bon appetite. 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.910
 It was today that he lost eggs and tomorrow she was Omurice. 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.910
