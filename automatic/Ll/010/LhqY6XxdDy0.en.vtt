at just 1.2 gigahertz however it is the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.869 
at just 1.2 gigahertz however it is the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
straight out of the box you see the nice

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.160 
straight out of the box you see the nice

little chrome trim ring one of the
things<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.829> actually<00:01:29.189> it's

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
things we like is actually it's

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.740 
things we like is actually it's
sandwiched<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.000> between<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.509> there's

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
sandwiched in between here so there's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.600 
sandwiched in between here so there's
only<00:01:30.869> chrome<00:01:31.170> at<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> top<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.250> at<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> bottom

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.010 
only chrome at the top and at the bottom
of<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.270> there's<00:01:33.390> actually<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> dark

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
of this and there's actually a dark

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.859 
of this and there's actually a dark
narrow<00:01:34.229> strip<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.860> between<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.630> subtle

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
narrow strip in between just a subtle

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.270 
narrow strip in between just a subtle
little<00:01:37.110> difference<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.740> something<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.070> we

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
little difference but something that we

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.640 
little difference but something that we
like<00:01:38.490> kind<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.909> differentiates<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:40.439> course

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
like kind of differentiates it of course

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.170 
like kind of differentiates it of course
we<00:01:40.770> got<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.920> volume<00:01:41.310> rocker<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.759> microUSB

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
we got the volume rocker in the microUSB

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.319

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
that is where the mock shows it

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.179 
that is where the mock shows it

that this is a qwerty phone so let's

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.009 
that this is a qwerty phone so let's
take<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.829> look<00:02:46.980> at<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.189> keyboard<00:02:47.370> here

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
take a look at the keyboard here

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.149 
take a look at the keyboard here
keyboard<00:02:49.019> is<00:02:49.109> not<00:02:49.290> quite<00:02:49.680> going<00:02:49.889> to<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.040> as

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
keyboard is not quite going to be as

keyboard is not quite going to be as
good<00:02:50.340> as<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.609> motorola<00:02:51.060> Photon<00:02:51.090> but<00:02:51.689> that's

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
good as the motorola Photon but that's

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.289 
good as the motorola Photon but that's
not<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.139> say<00:02:52.319> it's<00:02:52.469> not<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.680> good<00:02:52.829> keyboard<00:02:53.299> it

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
not to say it's not a good keyboard it

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.409 
not to say it's not a good keyboard it
is<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> five<00:02:54.840> row<00:02:55.109> here<00:02:55.769> we<00:02:56.730> have<00:02:56.909> the<00:02:57.060> standard

quickly<00:03:02.129> accurately<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:03.299> keys<00:03:03.510> are<00:03:03.689> a<00:03:03.719> little

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
quickly accurately the keys are a little

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.470 
quickly accurately the keys are a little
bit<00:03:04.049> too<00:03:04.230> short<00:03:04.260> for<00:03:04.799> us<00:03:05.090> this<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.239> only<00:03:06.329> a

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
bit too short for us this is only a

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.839 
bit too short for us this is only a
4-inch<00:03:06.930> screen<00:03:07.109> as<00:03:07.500> compared<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.459> photons

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
4-inch screen as compared to the photons

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.030 
4-inch screen as compared to the photons
4.3<00:03:09.629> inch<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:09.959> it's<00:03:10.169> a<00:03:10.260> little<00:03:10.469> bit<00:03:10.650> less<00:03:10.769> room

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
4.3 inch so it's a little bit less room

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.550 
4.3 inch so it's a little bit less room
that<00:03:11.219> we<00:03:11.280> have<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.519> work<00:03:11.699> with<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.169> keys

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
that we have to work with and the keys

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.500 
that we have to work with and the keys
don't<00:03:13.829> quite<00:03:14.099> have<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.340> same<00:03:14.489> awesome<00:03:15.299> feel

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
don't quite have the same awesome feel

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.929 
don't quite have the same awesome feel
that<00:03:15.719> the<00:03:15.840> photon<00:03:16.199> did<00:03:16.530> but<00:03:16.799> all<00:03:17.340> in<00:03:17.519> all<00:03:17.609> it's

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:17.939 
that the photon did but all in all it's

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.030 
that the photon did but all in all it's
a<00:03:18.030> perfectly<00:03:18.449> serviceable<00:03:18.689> keyboard<00:03:19.439> we<00:03:19.769> used

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
a perfectly serviceable keyboard we used

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.189 
a perfectly serviceable keyboard we used
it<00:03:20.280> right<00:03:20.579> out<00:03:20.699> of<00:03:20.729> the<00:03:20.879> box<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.509> we<00:03:21.930> were<00:03:22.019> very

it right out of the box and we were very

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.099 
it right out of the box and we were very
accurate<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:23.099> just<00:03:23.699> doesn't<00:03:24.060> have<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.269> super

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
accurate it just doesn't have that super

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.949 
accurate it just doesn't have that super
comforting<00:03:25.590> feel<00:03:25.889> but<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.030> layouts<00:03:27.329> good<00:03:27.659> we
