00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
as though we were part of the the Arthur

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.920 
as though we were part of the the Arthur
Murray<00:03:49.730> family<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.560> speak<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.400> we<00:03:53.330> really

felt very comfortable and I think that's

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.610 
felt very comfortable and I think that's
probably<00:03:56.660> one<00:03:56.900> of<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.050> hardest<00:03:57.320> things

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
probably one of the hardest things

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.250 
probably one of the hardest things
myself<00:03:58.100> not<00:03:58.730> really<00:03:59.240> knowing<00:03:59.480> how<00:03:59.900> to<00:03:59.960> dance

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
myself not really knowing how to dance

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.290 
myself not really knowing how to dance
is<00:04:00.560> its<00:04:00.860> feeling<00:04:01.280> comfortable<00:04:01.670> enough<00:04:02.030> to

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
is its feeling comfortable enough to

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.020 
is its feeling comfortable enough to
actually<00:04:02.750> get<00:04:03.200> out<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.380> dance<00:04:03.830> in<00:04:04.220> in<00:04:04.490> front

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
actually get out and dance in in front

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.290 
actually get out and dance in in front
of<00:04:05.120> people<00:04:05.420> who<00:04:05.570> you<00:04:05.810> don't<00:04:05.840> really<00:04:06.410> know<00:04:06.740> and
