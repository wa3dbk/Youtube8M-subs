Welcome back to "Drive the Desert Bus"! And, no, the episode number is not a typo. I simply decided not to bother uploading parts 2 through 39. It's pretty much the same boring stuff.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I will, however, show this highlight from part 25... (This is about 4 and a half hours in.)

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.500
What was that? A tiny muncher making a buzzing sound? If you missed it, feel free to go back and watch it again.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.500
Alright, it's been a little over seven hours since I began my journey.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.500
How much further before we get to Vegas?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.500
Oh, by the way, more of those "muncher" bugs did appear periodically after that one I just showed.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.500
They were usually several minutes apart, though I've also seen cases where a couple were only separated by a few seconds.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Are we there yet?

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.500
No.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Are we there yet?

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.500
No.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Are we there yet?

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.500
Yes.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Well, look at that! I've made it to Las Vegas!

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Oh, by the way, if you look around the map, you'll notice that it's shaped like the USA.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
Now, that makes sense, but there's something that bothers me...

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Where's Canada?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Mexico seems to be missing too...

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.500
Oh, well. I'm not gonna think about it too much. Let's start heading back to Tuscon!

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.500
Woo-hoo! I scored a point!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Wait, what's that?

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.500
A rumble strip perhaps? But it sounds like one of those "muncher" bugs...

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.500
Well, that was weird...

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.500
Oh, well. Let's continue our trip back to Tuscon!

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.500
This will probably take another seven hours or so, unless I hit a wormhole or something.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Good thing Vegas had restrooms! I was holding it since shortly after I left Tuscon.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You know what would be funny: If it turned out that black spot on the road back there actually was a wormhole, and the trip back to Tuscon took less than a minute!

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Well, guess what...

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.500
Seriously? It took over seven hours to get there and only 50 seconds to get back?!

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.500
Maybe I found a warp zone. This is a Mario hack after all!

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.500
What if I reenter a level...

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500
Alright! I set a new high score!

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But if you think I've driving all the way back to Las Vegas again, forget it! One round trip is enough! I'm done with this hack!
