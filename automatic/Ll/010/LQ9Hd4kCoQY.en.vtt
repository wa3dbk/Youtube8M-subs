00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 olano de cillas and welcome back to 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.370
 word cloud today as you see by the 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:12.389
 extra title was the review of a 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:13.769
 trilogy that I love and if you like 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.509
 Disappeared I'm going to talk about 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.190
 trilogy of doctor wars said 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.189
 trilogy is composed of these three 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.990
 books mental factor empire and last 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.570
 I think I'm talking a lot about the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.060
 three books in numerous videos too 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.800
 on the blog that posted some reviews and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.140
 good are books that never stopped 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.880
 recommend is that the trilogy has a 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.340
 lots of elements that make them 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.440
 really books one the story is 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.360
 develops in a kind of japan 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.070
 feudal is already like a kind of age 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.660
 mean but it really is a story 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.579
 retro futuristic since good to have 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.530
 elements steam bread in history 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.930
 begins when yukiko who is the daughter of 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.670
 an old hunter embarks with his 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.070
 father in an adventure that the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.290
 emperor 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.180
 from Japan feudal as it has a 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.010
 kind of divine revelation in which 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.900
 well basically you see that you are going to ride 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.330
 a ruler is a mythological creature 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.699
 half aguilar and half earth then 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.080
 well a little moved by the madness this 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.300
 emperor calls his best hunters 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.550
 and asks them to make a the cetto the 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.979
 mission that seems totally crazy 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.150
 and a suicide since the first thing in the 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.729
 structure is a mythological creature 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.220
 that it had not been seen for years 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.229
 land and in addition this feudal japan is 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.080
 find totally devastated there is no 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.850
 vegetation there are no no animals the 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.640
 adventure begins and evidently 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.050
 they manage to find the equal writer 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.490
 by a series of circumstances 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.490
 Yuki with the protagonist is at 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.170
 alone with the parasite now and still has 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.940
 at the end end up establishing a 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.160
 very important link the story has been 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.680
 gradually developed in the three 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.970
 books generates a civil war and a 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.500
 lots of open fronts because the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.420
 people start to wake up and start 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.850
 revolutions to rise 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.350
 against this authoritarian empire to points 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.270
 strengths or points that I liked the most 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.710
 these books in the first place is the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.790
 environmental content poses in first 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.910
 place a mushroom 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.800
 a little extreme not that there is not 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.780
 animals or vegetation otherwise 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.540
 important with the environmental sense is 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.860
 the relationship between animals and logical 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.410
 because good what contains a gift 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.150
 special I wanted to go is discovering another 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.890
 of the strengths are the adventure and 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.290
 the amount of action that these 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.870
 books is a non-stop from the beginning 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.060
 and see books maybe looser or not in 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.610
 some sense but still not for 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.230
 nothing boring or anything in fact has the 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.700
 same chicha that others like 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.340
 much of the first book especially the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.290
 evolution of the relationship between the aras and 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.090
 tora is guru and doubled 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.360
 protagonist and the author does not skimp on the 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.970
 time to describe situations or scenes 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.100
 more bloody and more violent also 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.240
 has a content of a romantic love 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.640
 that is always relegated to a second 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.590
 flat but it's not the main thing in the book 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.450
 It's worth to some characters if it's 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.180
 true for there is a specific character 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.459
 I love that man love 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.620
 it really is what moves him in all 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.020
 the books and he's a real character 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.160
 complex also can not and this 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.960
 it's another good thing 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.690
 the books characters have a 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.340
 remarkable constant evolution are very 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.110
 well elaborated they all have a lot of background 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.510
 even the secondary ones more than one we 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.550
 will surprise many of them are not what 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.740
 that there seem to be incredible twists in the 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.540
 plot also in the evolution let's say of 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.770
 performance of these old characters 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.230
 that will leave you with your mouth open 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.880
 the narration is also very good is 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.220
 true that you have a lot to describe 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.230
 things but that makes us heavy but 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.700
 that enriches is that you see that they are 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.500
 well written is not that it is limited to 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.120
 tell the facts but tells more 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.010
 things so that I for all this 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.360
 I recommend reading this trilogy is 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.010
 true a trilogy finished in many 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.260
 things is discovered characters that are 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.020
 they will stay with me forever is a 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.250
 Very child of heaven but it is really they are 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.320
 characters that have earned a mi 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.540
 heart completely I suffered a lot 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.160
 with all of them seeing how they suffered but 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.020
 good at the end in things are finished 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.310
 solving in some way so in 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.050
 definitive are the books that you 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.880
 I recommend a lot and that I think that 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.230
 they're going to like it for all this and that 's it 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.640
 this is all I wanted to tell you 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.330
 how the war will be silly talking about 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.700
 them on the maps 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.320
 so if all sides that I could that's why 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.630
 I wanted to make an exclusive video for 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.820
 this saga I hope you are encouraged to 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.830
 read it you like it a lot and to favor 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.990
 less comments are you reading or if 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.220
 you think to do that that is starting and 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.840
 everything is therefore left the box of 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.670
