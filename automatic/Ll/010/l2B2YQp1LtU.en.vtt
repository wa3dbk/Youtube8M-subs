00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 Pressure can now be exercised if they 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.189
 assume that a value during 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.460
 a riding lesson yes a bucket full 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.290
 saliva forms where does it stay with them 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.680
 They do not fly around in the train 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.720
 but that will vilja swallow 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.050
 Since we have ever had a problem 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.939
 we pulled the nose too tight and pulled 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.519
 that will not be the possibility of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.689
 swallow movement has its wish to take their 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.239
 his head will be unwilling to come then 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.309
 So the next thing we say something like 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.719
 you do not want to take a rest i 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.090
 do not go from the mother 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.010
 but unite something older horse so 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.250
 the thing still pulled if nothing 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.170
 more helps in looping us 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.790
 Bring it done that the horse in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.240
 a stretched posture goes 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.740
 in a so-called humble attitude that 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.840
 But that's not what you want 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.310
 that's how we create what we do 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.580
 previously heard in the lecture namely 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.490
 stressful situations 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.650
 the horse will clean up internally 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.830
 it will defend itself and thereby give 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.540
 of course this famous acidification 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.690
 confess that in humans even if they 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.979
 then they also have stress 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.810
 They aroused stomach acidity 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.520
 there is everything through the area 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.110
 but the horse can smell that too 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.259
 what we saw before from the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.600
 Maul pretty lazy but I others 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.369
 Symptoms are still important when had 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.290
 the horse puts itself there 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.920
 behind the back covers the forehand 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.530
 Forward 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.600
 that makes the back pending then 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.479
 is it a sure sign that 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.770
 Now what needs to be investigated 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.960
 let what is going on in the belly of the horse 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.550
 then it does not bring so much anymore 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.490
 put this on the pasture this 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.430
 stress loose work middle drives then must 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.610
 the first time be eliminated 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.320
 but if we are on horseback there 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.090
 we do a lot by doing so 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.630
 really the right remedy that 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.670
 choose the correct bit 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.170
 I just have to pick it up like this 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.090
 before we continue here map 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.040
 the right bit, he is important to you 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.530
 have the loads of a horse you know 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.260
 all those are looking narrower 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.230
 but also look sharp and dull 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.050
 dull then I choose my bit 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.660
 not necessarily as it used to be 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.830
 thick bite at the young horse kv the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.110
 next one 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.430
 you have to be exactly the mouth of the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.360
 view horses 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.610
 a horse has a swollen 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.730
 lower lip and this time maybe 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.410
 can be very pronounced so that 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.170
 horse at all the bit nothing 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.380
 but makes the other tolerates 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.180
 bit on the shop where agree the 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.500
 tongue as buffer should rank 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.690
 Always remember the tongue is 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.519
 very sensitive and we put that 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:08.180
 horse simply lined an iron and 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.910
 move this iron also still writing 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.530
 it in the mouth 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:17.320
 so that the horse a certain attitude 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.910
 the people accept the 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.510
 have had centuries of experience 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.930
 that have been written down again and again 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.410
 pointed out that a horse in 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.860
 a forward downward movement into one 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.380
 so-called dns attitude not 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.710
 humane attitude should go in the boys 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.570
 attitude long neck laid open 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.030
 so that the horse any possibility 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.420
 you can perceive the saliva they are 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.730
 produce to swallow but by the 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.820
 neck band you see here at this value 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.070
 clearly says that necktie serves itself 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.170
 the horse is open in the neck and the 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.390
 back is brought to bear 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.670
 The horse has to wear himself 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:06.740
 but then also the rider saddle anyway 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.770
 and a young horse just is not 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.630
 Strong does not come with the balance like that 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.720
 clear and not with that 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:18.710
 Balance must therefore be the experienced 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.140
 instructor on a young horse and the 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:24.770
 young rider is riding on a trained 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:29.930
 so that the young rider feels something 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:32.140
 horse needs the training scale the 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.520
 German equestrian union now 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.650
 has enshrined 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.620
 has one more for my ideas 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.039
 decisive factor beforehand namely the 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.050
 point of trust the horse must 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.720
 absolutely trust in his equipment 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:52.129
 So have to his equipment too 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.740
 his environment to the rider of the rider 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:58.400
 starting to trust the hand to 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.129
 thighs trust the seat that is one 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.440
 Absolute must have come before where 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:06.289
 one should never be allowed the second before 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.169
 Do not believe in the first step like 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:11.360
 many actually believe a young 34 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.159
 Year old scared look at this 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.000
 Horse on it is a gelding and rifle 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:16.000
 a stallion
