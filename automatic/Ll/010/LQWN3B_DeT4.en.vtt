00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.010 
a plus I'm going to mess around i'm also
going<00:02:10.850> to<00:02:10.910> check<00:02:10.970> reddit<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.570> see<00:02:11.720> if<00:02:11.810> i<00:02:11.870> can

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
going to check reddit and see if i can

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.350 
going to check reddit and see if i can
find<00:02:12.050> anything<00:02:12.920> else<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.670> new<00:02:14.030> besides

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
find anything else that is new besides

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.160 
find anything else that is new besides
what<00:02:14.810> i've<00:02:14.900> shown<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.440> far<00:02:16.690> alright<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:17.870> a

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
what i've shown you so far alright so a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.310 
what i've shown you so far alright so a
few<00:02:18.620> new<00:02:19.100> small<00:02:19.760> things<00:02:20.150> when<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.200> have

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
few new small things when you have

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.050 
few new small things when you have
redstone<00:02:21.830> that's<00:02:22.040> not<00:02:22.190> connected<00:02:22.460> anything

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
redstone that's not connected anything

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.010 
redstone that's not connected anything
it<00:02:23.180> looks<00:02:23.210> a<00:02:23.420> little<00:02:23.510> bit<00:02:23.660> different<00:02:24.080> now<00:02:25.000> so

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
it looks a little bit different now so

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.360 
it looks a little bit different now so
it<00:02:27.020> doesn't<00:02:27.260> appear<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.440> affect<00:02:27.590> any<00:02:27.920> circuits

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
it doesn't appear to affect any circuits

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.640 
it doesn't appear to affect any circuits
though<00:02:28.550> this<00:02:29.300> works<00:02:29.600> just<00:02:29.900> as<00:02:30.050> it's<00:02:30.230> supposed

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
though this works just as it's supposed

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.420 
though this works just as it's supposed
to<00:02:31.010> work<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:32.360> yeah<00:02:32.920> somebody<00:02:33.920> said<00:02:34.130> double

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
to work so yeah somebody said double

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.420 
to work so yeah somebody said double
doors<00:02:34.670> are<00:02:34.910> messed<00:02:35.120> up<00:02:35.300> but<00:02:35.750> uh<00:02:36.070> unread<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:37.190> but

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
doors are messed up but uh unread it but

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.170 
doors are messed up but uh unread it but
they're<00:02:37.640> not<00:02:37.900> they<00:02:38.900> work<00:02:39.080> just<00:02:39.350> fine<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.460> all

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
they're not they work just fine so all

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.630 
they're not they work just fine so all
circuits<00:02:41.720> appear<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.260> be<00:02:42.440> exactly<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.550> way

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
circuits appear to be exactly the way

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.510 
circuits appear to be exactly the way
they<00:02:43.820> were<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.480> no<00:02:44.600> problems<00:02:45.020> there<00:02:45.520> another

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
they were so no problems there another

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.430 
they were so no problems there another
new<00:02:46.820> thing<00:02:46.850> into<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.540> new<00:02:47.660> sound<00:02:48.020> does<00:02:48.410> the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
new thing into the new sound does the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.110 
new thing into the new sound does the
explosion<00:02:49.130> sound<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.490> haven't<00:02:49.730> actually<00:02:49.820> tried

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
explosion sound I haven't actually tried

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.270 
explosion sound I haven't actually tried
this<00:02:50.390> we'll<00:02:50.600> see<00:02:50.780> what<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:50.930> sounds<00:02:51.260> like

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.470 

that's<00:02:58.280> kind<00:02:58.490> of<00:02:58.550> cool<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:58.880> can<00:02:59.030> kind<00:02:59.330> of<00:02:59.360> hear

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
that's kind of cool you can kind of hear

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.030 
that's kind of cool you can kind of hear
the<00:02:59.630> rocks<00:02:59.870> breaking<00:03:00.200> in<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.620> background

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
the rocks breaking in the background

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.780 
the rocks breaking in the background
that's<00:03:01.270> that's<00:03:02.270> all<00:03:02.420> right<00:03:02.510> okay<00:03:02.870> cool

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
that's that's all right okay cool

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.590 
that's that's all right okay cool
something<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:04.910> was<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.150> i<00:03:05.300> think<00:03:05.510> the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
something that was it i think the

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.510 
something that was it i think the
previous<00:03:06.050> pre-release<00:03:06.560> but<00:03:06.830> i<00:03:06.950> don't<00:03:07.310> think<00:03:07.370> i

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
previous pre-release but i don't think i

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.030 
previous pre-release but i don't think i
mentioned<00:03:07.760> it<00:03:08.260> redstone<00:03:09.260> ore<00:03:09.290> takes<00:03:09.800> less

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
mentioned it redstone ore takes less

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.340 
mentioned it redstone ore takes less
time<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.760> break<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.420> that's<00:03:11.540> good<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:12.170> always

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
time to break so that's good it always

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.940 
time to break so that's good it always
takes<00:03:12.830> forever<00:03:14.290> let's<00:03:15.290> see<00:03:17.800> come<00:03:18.800> on

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
takes forever let's see come on

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.110 
takes forever let's see come on
from<00:03:19.459> your<00:03:19.550> chicken<00:03:22.120> there<00:03:23.120> we<00:03:23.209> go<00:03:23.300> ok<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:25.120> you

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
from your chicken there we go ok so you

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.820 
from your chicken there we go ok so you
get<00:03:26.300> baby<00:03:26.690> chicken<00:03:27.140> now<00:03:27.290> any<00:03:27.530> throw<00:03:27.680> eggs

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
get baby chicken now any throw eggs

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.490 
get baby chicken now any throw eggs
instead<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.370> big<00:03:29.030> chickens<00:03:29.360> another<00:03:30.170> change

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
instead of big chickens another change

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.220 
instead of big chickens another change
and<00:03:30.880> one<00:03:31.880> other<00:03:31.970> change<00:03:32.269> with<00:03:32.600> animal

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
and one other change with animal

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.759 
and one other change with animal
breeding<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:35.000> baby<00:03:35.570> sheep<00:03:35.959> inherited<00:03:36.680> their

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
breeding the baby sheep inherited their

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.620 
breeding the baby sheep inherited their
parents<00:03:37.130> color<00:03:37.370> so<00:03:37.820> if<00:03:38.000> you<00:03:38.120> have<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.390> brown

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
parents color so if you have to brown

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.620 
parents color so if you have to brown
sheep<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.769> baby<00:03:40.459> will<00:03:40.640> be<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.790> brown<00:03:41.030> shape<00:03:41.300> so

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
sheep the baby will be a brown shape so

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.199 
sheep the baby will be a brown shape so
that's<00:03:42.350> kind<00:03:42.620> of<00:03:42.680> cool<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:43.730> i<00:03:43.820> think<00:03:44.030> that's

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
that's kind of cool and i think that's

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.400 
that's kind of cool and i think that's
more<00:03:44.510> or<00:03:44.570> less<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:45.080> can<00:03:45.200> see<00:03:45.290> the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
more or less it and you can see the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.440 
more or less it and you can see the
shading<00:03:45.739> i<00:03:45.830> was<00:03:45.950> talking<00:03:46.220> about<00:03:46.310> with<00:03:47.269> this

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
shading i was talking about with this

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.650 
shading i was talking about with this
you<00:03:47.959> can<00:03:48.019> see<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:48.260> much<00:03:48.410> more<00:03:48.590> pronounced<00:03:49.660> but

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
you can see you much more pronounced but

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.900 
you can see you much more pronounced but
there<00:03:50.810> appear<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:50.989> be<00:03:51.080> no<00:03:51.170> new<00:03:51.530> blocks<00:03:51.920> these

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
there appear to be no new blocks these

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.540 
there appear to be no new blocks these
leaves<00:03:53.120> are<00:03:53.360> in<00:03:53.480> last<00:03:53.810> one<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.890> fern<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.400> but

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
leaves are in last one the fern to but

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.830 
leaves are in last one the fern to but
not<00:03:55.700> run<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.060> last<00:03:56.239> one

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
not run the last one

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
not run the last one
so<00:03:59.180> that's<00:04:00.180> more<00:04:00.540> or<00:04:00.569> less<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:00.959> it's<00:04:01.379> mostly<00:04:01.769> a

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
so that's more or less it it's mostly a

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.240 
so that's more or less it it's mostly a
cosmetic<00:04:02.810> release<00:04:03.810> in<00:04:04.080> terms<00:04:04.319> of<00:04:04.470> bug<00:04:04.709> fixing

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
cosmetic release in terms of bug fixing

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.330 
cosmetic release in terms of bug fixing
and<00:04:05.660> adding<00:04:06.660> new<00:04:06.840> sounds<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.590> slightly<00:04:08.099> new

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
and adding new sounds and slightly new

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.059 
and adding new sounds and slightly new
textures<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.239> just<00:04:10.019> fixing<00:04:10.410> up<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.650> couple<00:04:10.860> of

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
textures and just fixing up a couple of

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.860 
textures and just fixing up a couple of
things<00:04:11.099> that<00:04:11.400> need<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.640> be<00:04:11.730> fixed<00:04:12.060> like<00:04:12.480> the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
things that need to be fixed like the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.289 
things that need to be fixed like the
baby<00:04:13.080> chickens<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:13.980> Sheep<00:04:14.790> inheriting

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
baby chickens and the Sheep inheriting

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.129 
baby chickens and the Sheep inheriting
bold<00:04:15.510> colors<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.229> I<00:04:16.440> think<00:04:17.310> that's<00:04:17.609> about<00:04:17.699> it

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
bold colors so I think that's about it

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.870 
bold colors so I think that's about it
if<00:04:19.139> there's<00:04:19.290> anything<00:04:19.500> else<00:04:19.650> i<00:04:19.859> will<00:04:19.919> add<00:04:20.820> it

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
if there's anything else i will add it

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.780 
if there's anything else i will add it
to<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.329> end<00:04:21.479> of<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.660> video<00:04:22.160> but<00:04:23.160> i<00:04:23.340> think

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
to the end of the video but i think

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.310 
to the end of the video but i think
that's<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.270> for<00:04:24.300> this<00:04:24.540> pre-release<00:04:24.930> it's

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
that's it for this pre-release it's

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.740 
that's it for this pre-release it's
nothing<00:04:25.740> exciting<00:04:26.190> but<00:04:26.639> we're<00:04:27.300> one<00:04:27.510> step

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
nothing exciting but we're one step

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.129 
nothing exciting but we're one step
closer<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:29.100> full<00:04:29.430> release<00:04:29.760> so<00:04:30.150> i<00:04:30.389> don't

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
closer to the full release so i don't

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.629 
closer to the full release so i don't
think<00:04:31.290> they'll<00:04:31.380> be<00:04:31.470> any<00:04:31.500> new<00:04:31.740> features<00:04:31.979> in<00:04:32.550> the

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
think they'll be any new features in the

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.570 
think they'll be any new features in the
release<00:04:33.050> but<00:04:34.050> we'll<00:04:34.500> get<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:34.919> enjoy<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:35.550> and
