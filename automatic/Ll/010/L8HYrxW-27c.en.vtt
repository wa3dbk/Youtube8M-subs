00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.780
 It is Zaku II breaks B. It is a performance like a small dom weight. 

00:00:06.603 --> 00:00:10.603
 This time, I use the quick loader 2 type, but if I fight with the current limit, HP 15,000 will be destroyed immediately if I can not secure it, so the problem is that the risk is high. 

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:21.445
 It is a pattern to attack B after securing C. You can not have a quick attack, but it is easier to pick up since the subsequent respawn is closer than E. 

00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:30.967
 Watch out for enemy reactions in the warehouse. 

00:00:35.977 --> 00:00:39.977
 It seems that WR climbs the building and shoots. I'll pull. 

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:46.682
 Go around the back of the enemy fighting with your allies. 

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:54.234
 The basic is Sturm from Bazooka's hit confirmation. When it seems useless, I will return immediately. 

00:01:07.904 --> 00:01:11.904
 Move at the same time as the launch to lower the impact. 

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:29.736
 I can fight a little defensively because I can make careless enemies. 

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:52.974
 Repairs have been made since the ongoing battle has become severe. 

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:26.517
 I will go to support of allies. 

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:32.033
 As well as Dom, Bazooka&gt; Sturm&gt; Bazooka is again a combo in addition to emergency avoidance and tackle. It is a required technology. 

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:36.087
 I'm stuck because WR has always ignored me. 

00:03:58.284 --> 00:04:02.284
 The number of allies has decreased, so I draw. 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.849
 Sturm Launch motion can not be attacked by BR rapid fire and can not attack (; w 

00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:58.191
 Enemy who tried to kill C and take advantage came. I will intercept. 

00:05:03.393 --> 00:05:07.393
 The second hand (Sturm) shoots here from Bazooka conquest. 

00:05:08.554 --> 00:05:12.554
 The chasing bazooka is too close to blow my blast. Slash immediately dash for follow. 

00:05:13.424 --> 00:05:17.424
 It was urgently avoided, but calmly and repeated fighting. It is confirmed. 

00:05:20.025 --> 00:05:24.025
 While waiting for the re-inactive time, I will move to the back and I will match the timing. It is a definite endorsement. 

00:05:25.822 --> 00:05:29.822
 The key is whether or not the tieman can take out the second hand or the third hand when the attack is taken off or when the two become involved. Stop thinking and wait for a cool time to lose. 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:40.529
 Join with allies. It seems that point B could be overwhelmed. 

00:05:48.836 --> 00:05:52.836
 Fight in the warehouse. Close the range of BR and take topographical advantage. 

00:06:13.366 --> 00:06:17.366
 As I surrounded Jim Cum, I killed it. 

00:06:22.126 --> 00:06:26.126
 The enemy reaction behind is fleeing and fleeing ahead. 

00:06:27.496 --> 00:06:31.496
 I was rubbing emergency evasion, but it was no good (; w 

00:06:36.085 --> 00:06:40.085
 I'm looking at the enemy's gaze while invincible and looking for a direction to escape. 

00:06:41.604 --> 00:06:45.604
 I failed to return to the warehouse after crossing. It would have been nice to run to B honestly. 

00:06:54.266 --> 00:06:58.266
 With the strengthening of the first-class follow-up chapter, the respawn has been made even faster in the unrestricted room. It is good to be hard to become one-sided. 

00:07:08.568 --> 00:07:12.568
 It is just the last minute. I intended to survive B's friend somehow. 

00:07:33.484 --> 00:07:37.484
 Stop the chase enemy. 

00:07:49.616 --> 00:07:53.616
 I'm aiming for a stop at Bazooka while taking an avoidance exercise. 

00:07:56.347 --> 00:08:00.347
 Stop Ez8 for dash-cutting. 

00:08:02.119 --> 00:08:06.119
 Zaku II Kai (B) is busy switching arms and has to shoot and fight, so the amount of operation is the thing. I think that it is for the expert.
