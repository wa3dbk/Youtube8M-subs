00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.070
 duel by teams walks that I do not 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.110

 standing and let's see what we can do 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.050
 if this is a little green because 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.130
 principle as I do not know if there are francs or not 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.180
 Well, give me a little bit of 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.790
 respect to the capo we are going to go through an area 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.830
 in which they can not reach us 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.400
 sniper's worth this steal me to 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.070
 hand 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.400
 is worth double crockery so 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.400
 free 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.059
 in return the scraping 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.690

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.740
 Free double low with the car

 Orbital is even worse because that's how I do not 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.009
 I would have taken because I have made 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.259
 gusts of accurate help that is that I know 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.570

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:39.640
 more to see if we get to 50 I think that 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.640
 no but well we can try 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.460

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.070
 three casualties and we go 37 casualties that goes nothing 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.689
 time we do 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.819

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.089
 nuclear or I know that I have to put 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.589
 storms of assault to reach 50 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:12.539
 low but good I want it to last a 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:14.189
 little bit this today so there is a nuclear 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.929
 in some episode, anyway, I think that 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.279
 you would like no but I do not think what 

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:19.049
 try again with help gusts 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:21.389

00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:23.159
 nothing nothing, thank you very much for having seen 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.199

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:27.979
 next game today I 'll leave you with 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.979
