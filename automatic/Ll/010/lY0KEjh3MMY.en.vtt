which is very very small would cause an

would<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.640> be

would have to be

would have to be
you<00:02:03.560> know<00:02:03.969> rejected<00:02:04.969> basically<00:02:05.450> very

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
you know rejected basically very

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.949 
you know rejected basically very
expensive<00:02:06.649> so<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:08.270> was<00:02:08.450> developed<00:02:08.599> by<00:02:08.929> a

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
expensive so this was developed by a

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.009 
expensive so this was developed by a
chemist<00:02:09.470> who<00:02:09.940> came<00:02:10.940> up<00:02:11.060> with<00:02:11.180> this<00:02:11.270> formula<00:02:11.780> to

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
chemist who came up with this formula to

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.930 
chemist who came up with this formula to
again<00:02:12.470> sort<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.010> lift<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.430> dirt<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:13.670> debris

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
again sort of lift the dirt and debris

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.990 
again sort of lift the dirt and debris
off<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.300> surface<00:02:14.830> rather<00:02:15.830> than<00:02:16.069> just<00:02:16.310> sort<00:02:16.940> of

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
off the surface rather than just sort of

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.670 
off the surface rather than just sort of
scooting<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.480> around<00:02:17.720> like<00:02:17.989> a<00:02:18.050> solvent<00:02:18.560> based

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
scooting it around like a solvent based

scooting it around like a solvent based
cleaner<00:02:18.950> would<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:20.019> you<00:02:21.019> know<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.260> we

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
cleaner would and you know so we

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.410 
cleaner would and you know so we
partnered<00:02:21.620> with<00:02:21.769> him<00:02:22.069> about<00:02:22.760> six<00:02:23.000> years<00:02:23.209> ago

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
partnered with him about six years ago

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.229 
partnered with him about six years ago
and<00:02:23.810> brought<00:02:24.769> this<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.250> consumer<00:02:25.880> market

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
and brought this to the consumer market

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.670 
and brought this to the consumer market
so<00:02:26.569> there<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.750> go<00:02:26.780> guys<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:27.080> little<00:02:27.349> look<00:02:27.530> at

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
so there you go guys a little look at

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.440 
so there you go guys a little look at
the<00:02:27.860> shorts<00:02:28.220> extender<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:28.849> also<00:02:29.209> some<00:02:29.360> more

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
the shorts extender and also some more

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.820 
the shorts extender and also some more
information<00:02:29.900> about<00:02:29.959> that<00:02:30.080> Omni<00:02:30.560> cleanse

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
information about that Omni cleanse

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.380 
information about that Omni cleanse
cleaner<00:02:31.190> this<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.730> my<00:02:31.849> crew<00:02:32.000> insanely<00:02:32.269> great

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
cleaner this is my crew insanely great

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.349 
cleaner this is my crew insanely great
Mac<00:02:32.630> thanks<00:02:33.200> for<00:02:33.319> watching
