00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:17.270
 twenty five hello everyone today I bring you 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.380
 two books on plants vs zombies the truth 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.570
 that quite weird as you are seeing 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.760
 we are using the drone is worth in this 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.050
 moment was a zombie and when it breaks 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.930
 the drone has to transport me 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.119
 let's tell my player and continue with my 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.250
 player but as you are watching I do not know 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.290
 what happened that I got like under the 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.900
 map and there really is no game 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.090
 no player puts me like life 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.610
 I have it to zero, but as you can see 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.200
 I can shoot and everything is really me 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.149
 I was with porsche in this game and 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.250
 I could see myself moving, I saw myself shoot 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.050
 and do things but this is what I 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.360
 I saw that I was not seeing anything 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.070
 as you are seeing you see the water that 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.239
 it's on top of me, it's worth it 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.760
 let's say I'm below the map 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.350
 under water so to speak, not like 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.329
 You see, I was there shooting, shooting 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.680
 and when I get the drone it's worth it when 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.510
 has recharged again that I can take out 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.249
 again the drone as you see I return another 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.590
 time to see normal and see again what 

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:07.329
 it's the normal game 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.859
 this was another case that happened to me 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:10.539
 is also worth what in this case instead 

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:12.280
 of being a zombie was a plant but I 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:14.530
 it happened exactly the same and the only 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.619
 way to tell you to take off 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.359
 this book is worth being able to return to the map and 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.880
 to be able to continue playing 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:23.740
 is when the drone is recharged now what 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.439
 you are going to see what you get and then you can 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.569
 to see again, but this has only 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.240
 happened when I'm using the drone 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:32.560
 as I say and it breaks then instead 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.659
 to go back to being the player goes from this 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.100
 it's happened to me two or three times and 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.329
 well I had thought about recording it since it is 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.950
 a failure that I suppose will be 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.229
 just in the first days I hope 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.610
 that they repair it since it is one more putada 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.649
 than nothing 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.270
 if it touches you with the cactus or with the 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.310
 engineer nothing happens because you wait 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.280
 the drone is recharged and it's ok but 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.719
 if it happens to you with one another zombie or with 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.219
 another plant because it is more complicated 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.989
 because you're going to have to screw up and 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.209
 wait for the game to end or not 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:59.349
 is wrong so nothing simply this 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:01.119
 I hope you liked it if it has 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:02.590
 liked to vote i like favorites and we 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.860
 we see in the next video greetings to 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.860
 everyone
