00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:07.850 

I<00:00:01.639> just<00:00:02.639> taught<00:00:02.880> custom<00:00:03.510> kicks<00:00:03.750> again<00:00:06.830> after<00:00:07.830> I

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:07.860 
I just taught custom kicks again after I

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.129 
I just taught custom kicks again after I
rebuilt<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.250> motor<00:00:08.339> had<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.900> little<00:00:09.900> bit<00:00:10.049> of

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
rebuilt the motor had a little bit of

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.879 
rebuilt the motor had a little bit of
issues<00:00:10.499> with<00:00:10.709> the<00:00:11.059> little<00:00:12.059> bit<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.299> blowback

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
issues with the little bit of blowback

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.039 
issues with the little bit of blowback
so<00:00:14.239> went<00:00:15.239> ahead<00:00:15.329> and<00:00:15.539> got<00:00:15.629> me<00:00:15.779> a<00:00:15.839> cat-scan

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
so went ahead and got me a cat-scan

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.210 
so went ahead and got me a cat-scan
installed<00:00:17.180> just<00:00:18.180> got<00:00:18.420> done<00:00:18.600> putting<00:00:18.870> it<00:00:18.990> in

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
installed just got done putting it in

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.880 
installed just got done putting it in
why<00:00:20.220> my<00:00:20.370> hands<00:00:20.520> are<00:00:20.640> dirty<00:00:21.350> and<00:00:22.350> what<00:00:22.620> you<00:00:22.740> do

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
why my hands are dirty and what you do

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.430 
why my hands are dirty and what you do
is<00:00:23.040> you<00:00:23.130> tied<00:00:23.370> it<00:00:23.520> in<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:25.610> PCV<00:00:26.610> and<00:00:27.110> any<00:00:28.110> of<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.440 
is you tied it in to PCV and any of the

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.859 
is you tied it in to PCV and any of the
oil<00:00:28.650> or<00:00:29.010> any<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.370> gas<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:30.180> gets<00:00:30.570> past

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
oil or any of that gas that gets past

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.369 
oil or any of that gas that gets past
that<00:00:30.990> PCV<00:00:31.650> valve<00:00:31.950> and<00:00:32.789> comes<00:00:32.999> back<00:00:33.329> into<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
that PCV valve and comes back into the

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.110 
that PCV valve and comes back into the
intake<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.010> burns<00:00:35.749> can<00:00:36.749> foul<00:00:36.960> plugs<00:00:37.320> can

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
intake and burns can foul plugs can

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.279 
intake and burns can foul plugs can
greatly<00:00:39.120> kill<00:00:39.420> your<00:00:39.569> horsepower<00:00:39.929> of<00:00:40.079> course

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
greatly kill your horsepower of course

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.819 
greatly kill your horsepower of course
and<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.789> what<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.030> do<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.539> you<00:00:42.659> take<00:00:42.839> this

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
and so what you do is you take this

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.930 
and so what you do is you take this
loose<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.809> I<00:00:45.809> will<00:00:46.649> connect<00:00:47.300> this<00:00:48.300> line<00:00:49.940> to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
loose and I will connect this line to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.599 
loose and I will connect this line to
that<00:00:51.089> tube<00:00:51.420> which<00:00:52.350> will<00:00:52.530> allow<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.889> line<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
that tube which will allow that line to

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.079 
that tube which will allow that line to
go<00:00:53.760> straight<00:00:54.749> into<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.199> kids<00:00:55.409> camp<00:00:55.909> and<00:00:56.909> what

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
go straight into the kids camp and what

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:03.280 
go straight into the kids camp and what
it<00:00:57.210> does<00:00:57.440> is<00:00:59.059> then<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.749> pulls<00:01:01.139> from<00:01:02.069> this<00:01:02.339> one

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
it does is then it pulls from this one

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.470 
it does is then it pulls from this one
and<00:01:04.370> goes<00:01:05.370> back<00:01:05.700> into<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:07.080> intake<00:01:08.300> this<00:01:09.300> high

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
and goes back into the intake this high

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.240 
and goes back into the intake this high
crankcase<00:01:10.050> birth<00:01:10.790> pressures<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:12.600> bled<00:01:12.840> off

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
crankcase birth pressures get bled off

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.550 
crankcase birth pressures get bled off
through<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:14.370> filter<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:14.940> and<00:01:15.470> when<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
through your filter here and when it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.740 
through your filter here and when it
goes<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.740> vacuum<00:01:17.340> there's<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.210> reversible

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
goes to vacuum there's a reversible

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.230 
goes to vacuum there's a reversible
valve<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.260> that<00:01:19.410> closes<00:01:20.030> when<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.120> goes

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
valve in here that closes when it goes

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.470 
valve in here that closes when it goes
to<00:01:21.270> vacuum<00:01:21.870> it<00:01:21.990> closes<00:01:22.440> and<00:01:23.150> when<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.270> goes<00:01:24.450> to

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
to vacuum it closes and when it goes to

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.380 
to vacuum it closes and when it goes to
pull<00:01:25.190> from<00:01:26.190> that<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.760> gonna<00:01:26.940> pull<00:01:27.210> nice

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
pull from that it's gonna pull nice

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.250 
pull from that it's gonna pull nice
clean<00:01:27.720> fresh<00:01:27.990> air<00:01:28.610> instead<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:30.260> dirty-ass

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
clean fresh air instead of dirty-ass

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.000 
clean fresh air instead of dirty-ass
crankcase<00:01:32.160> air<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.840> way<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.050> kind<00:01:34.230> of<00:01:34.350> keep

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
crankcase air so one way to kind of keep

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.790 
crankcase air so one way to kind of keep
at<00:01:35.280> high<00:01:35.550> RPM's<00:01:36.120> from<00:01:36.480> smoking<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.320> little<00:01:37.650> bit

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
at high RPM's from smoking a little bit

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.650 
at high RPM's from smoking a little bit
and<00:01:38.220> there's<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.520> lot<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.700> Mustangs<00:01:39.210> do<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.630> a

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
and there's a lot of Mustangs do it a

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.020 
and there's a lot of Mustangs do it a
lot<00:01:39.870> of<00:01:40.050> the<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.100> know<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.250> higher<00:01:41.520> rpm

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
lot of the you know the higher rpm

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.390 
lot of the you know the higher rpm
engines<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.990> one<00:01:43.260> being<00:01:43.410> a<00:01:43.560> built<00:01:43.800> Northstar

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
engines this one being a built Northstar

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.080 
engines this one being a built Northstar
motor<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:45.590> 477<00:01:46.590> at<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> flywheel<00:01:47.010> when<00:01:47.970> it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
motor it's 477 at the flywheel when it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.120 
motor it's 477 at the flywheel when it
hits<00:01:48.270> seven<00:01:48.450> grand<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.230> smoked<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.770> little<00:01:49.860> bit

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
hits seven grand it smoked a little bit

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.280 
hits seven grand it smoked a little bit
so<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.150> gonna<00:01:51.270> alleviate<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.870> problem

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
so this is gonna alleviate that problem

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.420 
so this is gonna alleviate that problem
and<00:01:53.510> kind<00:01:54.510> of<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:55.410> know<00:01:55.530> let<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.950> motor<00:01:56.160> run<00:01:56.400> a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
and kind of you know let the motor run a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.490 
and kind of you know let the motor run a
lot<00:01:56.670> cleaner<00:01:56.970> may<00:01:57.540> possibly<00:01:57.990> last<00:01:58.260> a<00:01:58.380> lot

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
lot cleaner may possibly last a lot

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.690 
lot cleaner may possibly last a lot
longer<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:59.510> now<00:02:00.510> that<00:02:00.690> I<00:02:00.780> got<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.080> new<00:02:01.700> new

longer and now that I got the new new
select<00:02:03.060> Pro<00:02:03.300> supercoils<00:02:04.080> on<00:02:04.200> oh<00:02:04.610> yeah<00:02:05.610> it's

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
select Pro supercoils on oh yeah it's

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.530 
select Pro supercoils on oh yeah it's
gonna<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.540> ready<00:02:06.750> thanks
