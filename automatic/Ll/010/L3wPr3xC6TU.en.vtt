if<00:02:26.710> this<00:02:27.040> works<00:02:27.250> out<00:02:27.520> you<00:02:27.760> can<00:02:28.180> already<00:02:28.600> start

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
if this works out you can already start

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.320 
if this works out you can already start
to<00:02:29.290> practice<00:02:29.530> your<00:02:29.980> first<00:02:30.340> parallel<00:02:30.940> swing

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
to practice your first parallel swing

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.900 
to practice your first parallel swing
turn<00:02:31.630> let's<00:02:32.560> take<00:02:32.800> a<00:02:32.830> look<00:02:33.100> at<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.490> complete

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
turn let's take a look at the complete

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.930 
turn let's take a look at the complete
turn<00:02:34.300> move<00:02:35.230> your<00:02:35.530> upper<00:02:35.680> body<00:02:36.130> forward<00:02:36.370> and

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
the mountain now let's take a look at

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.270 
the mountain now let's take a look at
the<00:03:02.830> entire<00:03:03.220> term<00:03:03.610> one<00:03:04.060> more<00:03:04.330> time<00:03:04.980> move<00:03:05.980> your
