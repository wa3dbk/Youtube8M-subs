manufacturers<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.649> well<00:00:46.680> let's<00:00:47.430> take<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.610> look

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
manufacturers as well let's take a look

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
manufacturers as well let's take a look
at<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> front<00:00:48.120> panel<00:00:48.239> features<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.920> left

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
at the front panel features on the left

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.790 
at the front panel features on the left
we're<00:00:50.460> going<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.640> start<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.800> phantom

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
we're going to start with the phantom

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.209 
we're going to start with the phantom
power<00:00:52.980> switch<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:54.510> followed<00:00:55.170> by<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.829> phase

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
power switch and followed by the phase

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.330 
power switch and followed by the phase
reversal<00:00:56.640> switch<00:00:57.770> next<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.309> going

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
reversal switch next to that it's going

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.630 
reversal switch next to that it's going
to<00:00:59.550> be<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.199> input<00:01:01.199> gain<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> preamplifier

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
to be the input gain of the preamplifier

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.600 
to be the input gain of the preamplifier
it's<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.210> stepped<00:01:03.710> input<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.010> then<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.430> also

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it's a stepped input and then you also

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.340 
it's a stepped input and then you also
have<00:01:05.970> an<00:01:06.180> output<00:01:07.280> gain<00:01:08.280> trim<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.659> next

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
have an output gain trim for that next

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.270 
have an output gain trim for that next
we're<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.710> into<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> tonal

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
we're going to get into the tonal

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.480 
we're going to get into the tonal
shaping<00:01:11.670> capabilities<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> preamplifier

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
shaping capabilities of the preamplifier

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.249 
shaping capabilities of the preamplifier
in<00:01:14.490> which<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.210> something<00:01:15.600> that's<00:01:15.810> pretty

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
in which we have something that's pretty

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.990 
in which we have something that's pretty
unique<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> lot<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.340> preamplifiers

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
unique to a lot of preamplifiers

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.340 
unique to a lot of preamplifiers
and<00:01:18.180> you're<00:01:18.540> gonna<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.900> variable

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and you're gonna have a variable

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.980 
and you're gonna have a variable
high-pass<00:01:19.920> filter<00:01:20.430> basically<00:01:21.360> starting<00:01:21.900> at

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
high-pass filter basically starting at

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.760 
high-pass filter basically starting at
18<00:01:22.409> Hertz<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.820> 360<00:01:24.659> Hertz<00:01:24.869> this

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
18 Hertz and going up to 360 Hertz this

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.740 
18 Hertz and going up to 360 Hertz this
gives<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> very<00:01:27.390> wide<00:01:27.900> range<00:01:28.520> of

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
gives you a very wide range of

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.170 
gives you a very wide range of
frequencies<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.079> basically<00:01:31.590> cut<00:01:31.920> out<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
frequencies to basically cut out so you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.690 
frequencies to basically cut out so you
can<00:01:33.329> fine<00:01:33.570> tune<00:01:33.829> any<00:01:34.829> little<00:01:35.159> rumbles<00:01:35.490> from

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
can fine tune any little rumbles from

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.600 
can fine tune any little rumbles from

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.039 
to get into a basically the the high EQ
as<00:01:56.219> far<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:56.820> most<00:01:57.210> digital<00:01:57.600> systems<00:01:57.930> are

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
as far as most digital systems are

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.719 
as far as most digital systems are
concerned<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.500> probably<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.009> appear<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
concerned is probably going to appear to

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.980 
concerned is probably going to appear to
be<00:01:59.759> a<00:02:01.070> shelving<00:02:02.070> EQ<00:02:02.270> though<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.659> unit

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
be a shelving EQ though this unit

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.929 
be a shelving EQ though this unit
actually<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.530> have<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> frequency<00:02:05.820> response

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
actually can have a frequency response

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.320 
actually can have a frequency response
of<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:06.689> Hertz<00:02:07.020> up<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.979> beyond<00:02:08.340> 200<00:02:09.000> kilohertz

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
of one Hertz up to beyond 200 kilohertz

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.080 
of one Hertz up to beyond 200 kilohertz
so<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:10.950> gonna<00:02:11.760> generate<00:02:11.940> in

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
so it's it's gonna generate in

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.420 
so it's it's gonna generate in
more<00:02:13.209> sound<00:02:13.510> than<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:13.900> actually<00:02:14.110> can<00:02:15.069> really

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
more sound than we actually can really

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.000 
more sound than we actually can really
hear<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:15.970> or<00:02:16.180> our<00:02:16.360> systems<00:02:16.720> will<00:02:16.840> record<00:02:17.260> it's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010

basically<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.430> bell<00:02:18.670> curve<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:19.629> starts<00:02:19.750> to

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
basically a bell curve that starts to

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.710 
basically a bell curve that starts to
taper<00:02:20.140> out<00:02:20.319> up<00:02:20.650> around<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.269> 200k<00:02:22.269> area

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
taper out up around the 200k area

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.199 
taper out up around the 200k area
actually<00:02:23.019> on<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.470> graphs<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.879> have

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
actually on the graphs so you have

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.720 
actually on the graphs so you have
basically<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:26.879> frequency<00:02:27.879> starting<00:02:28.450> at<00:02:28.599> 2.1<00:02:29.260> K

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
basically a frequency starting at 2.1 K

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.850 
basically a frequency starting at 2.1 K
going<00:02:30.730> all<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.150> way<00:02:31.239> up<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.480> 26<00:02:32.110> K<00:02:32.319> in<00:02:32.500> terms<00:02:32.709> of

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
going all the way up to 26 K in terms of

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.920 
going all the way up to 26 K in terms of
your<00:02:33.010> adjustments<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.790> have<00:02:34.480> your<00:02:34.720> gain

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
your adjustments and you have your gain

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.520 
your adjustments and you have your gain
and<00:02:35.200> cut<00:02:35.670> here<00:02:36.670> on<00:02:36.879> this<00:02:37.540> switch<00:02:37.750> that's

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
and cut here on this switch that's

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.850 
and cut here on this switch that's
basically<00:02:38.920> all<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:40.000> same<00:02:40.840> settings<00:02:41.709> are

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
basically all the the same settings are

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.530 
basically all the the same settings are
duplicated<00:02:42.370> over<00:02:42.580> on<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.819> other<00:02:43.000> channel<00:02:43.360> and

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
duplicated over on the other channel and

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.830 
duplicated over on the other channel and
then<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.319> final<00:02:44.590> power<00:02:44.860> switch<00:02:45.250> down<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.610> end

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
then a final power switch down the end

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.759 
then a final power switch down the end
on<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.989> rear<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.290> unit<00:02:47.319> we're<00:02:47.620> going<00:02:47.709> to

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
on the rear of the unit we're going to

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.229 
on the rear of the unit we're going to
notice<00:02:48.040> something<00:02:48.610> that's<00:02:48.760> really<00:02:49.000> pretty

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
notice something that's really pretty

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.600 
notice something that's really pretty
unique<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.599> this<00:02:49.810> preamplifier<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.519> you

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
unique to this preamplifier and that you

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.550 
unique to this preamplifier and that you
have<00:02:51.880> both<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:53.099> phantom<00:02:54.099> power<00:02:54.989> input<00:02:55.989> and<00:02:56.200> then

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
have both a phantom power input and then

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.400 
have both a phantom power input and then
also<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.920> non<00:02:57.190> phantom<00:02:57.579> power<00:02:57.700> input<00:02:58.410> for

also a non phantom power input for
ribbon<00:02:59.680> microphones<00:03:00.129> you're<00:03:00.310> almost

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
ribbon microphones you're almost

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.430 
ribbon microphones you're almost
exclusively<00:03:01.000> going<00:03:01.269> to<00:03:01.390> use<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.840> non<00:03:02.019> phantom

exclusively going to use the non phantom
power<00:03:02.590> input<00:03:03.010> as<00:03:03.250> well<00:03:03.730> as<00:03:03.790> whenever<00:03:04.660> you

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
power input as well as whenever you

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
decide that you would like to use it

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.300 
decide that you would like to use it
with<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.640> dynamic<00:03:07.209> microphone<00:03:07.709> or<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.769> tube

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
with a dynamic microphone or a tube

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.479 
with a dynamic microphone or a tube
microphone<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:11.170> also<00:03:11.379> can<00:03:11.709> use<00:03:11.739> an<00:03:12.129> active

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
microphone you also can use an active

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.160 
microphone you also can use an active
ribbon<00:03:13.030> microphone<00:03:13.450> on<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.780> phantom<00:03:14.049> power

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
input but this basically makes it where

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.500

might be intermittent and if that goes

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.990 
might be intermittent and if that goes
then<00:03:52.269> basically<00:03:52.599> the<00:03:53.340> opposing<00:03:54.340> voltage<00:03:54.760> on

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
then basically the opposing voltage on

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.349 
then basically the opposing voltage on
the<00:03:55.239> line<00:03:55.389> then<00:03:55.900> is<00:03:56.169> now<00:03:56.470> not<00:03:57.400> cancelling<00:03:58.180> out

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
the line then is now not cancelling out

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.500 
the line then is now not cancelling out
the<00:03:58.769> other<00:03:59.769> voltage<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.459> then<00:04:00.940> that's<00:04:01.299> one<00:04:01.450> of

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
the other voltage and then that's one of

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.599 
the other voltage and then that's one of
you<00:04:01.630> actually<00:04:01.780> get<00:04:02.049> a<00:04:02.079> voltage<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.889> ribbon

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
you actually get a voltage to the ribbon

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.199 
you actually get a voltage to the ribbon
which<00:04:03.760> can<00:04:03.940> pop<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.329> so<00:04:04.950> that's<00:04:05.950> why<00:04:06.220> we<00:04:06.790> try<00:04:07.120> to

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
which can pop it so that's why we try to

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.360 
which can pop it so that's why we try to
isolate<00:04:07.419> ribbon<00:04:07.989> microphones<00:04:08.410> from<00:04:08.739> phantom

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
isolate ribbon microphones from phantom

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.159 
isolate ribbon microphones from phantom
power<00:04:09.549> though<00:04:10.180> normally<00:04:10.540> it's<00:04:10.840> not<00:04:10.930> going<00:04:11.109> to

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
power though normally it's not going to

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.050 
power though normally it's not going to
hurt<00:04:11.290> it<00:04:11.410> and<00:04:11.799> just<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.310> round<00:04:12.430> out<00:04:12.609> the<00:04:12.639> the

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
hurt it and just to round out the the

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.560 
hurt it and just to round out the the
