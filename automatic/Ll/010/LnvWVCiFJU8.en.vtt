00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 9 more welcome to the lounge channel 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.600
 alfons in this room saw I will teach you a 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.280
 second method much faster for 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.510
 block a person in case they do not 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.230
 We want this person to send us 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.870
 text messages and call us or you 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.220
 communicate with us with facetime 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.109
 procedure is very simple if 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.699
 we block a person to that person 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.160
 every time he calls us immediately he 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.619
 will enter that person's phone 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.800
 mail euros and we will appear 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.240
 a message I called as loss that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.489
 will miss we made a missed call 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.530
 or who called it supposes that we already 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.510
 we know that we had already blocked him 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.790
 so we will not be interested in calling days 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.200
 from that person very easy procedure 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.800
 but before we take care that 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.480
 effectively at the beginning of this 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.879
 person this is going to be the essay with the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.020
 ds3 that I have here next to me I'm going to 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.530
 call my iphone 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.190
 I'm calling you look like as 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.190
 I went to call 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:06.600
 we are going to reject here and end here 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.280
 I will give as you see the iphone the s3 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.930
 this mind is not blocked let's 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.880
 block it to block that person the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.800
 faster procedure instead of going to 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.040
 through phone lock settings 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.860
 just search here on the phone 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.300
 power we look for the contact in this case 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.610
 the samsung of science transit 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.560
 anybody calls me and here we go down and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.619
 side block that contact block 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.649
 contact and so it's simple since to this 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.940
 user or that person already blocks let's 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.570
 do the test again 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.170
 let's call here again with the s3 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.170
 the latest is already 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.540
 as you will see immediately I enter 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.520
 post 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.410
 so it's simple we can block a 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.450
 person each time in this case does not 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.240
 dare try to call the iphone the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.300
 call did not enter a ls teresa 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.860
 use and if we go here by phone and we go 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.020
 to get recent calls 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.720
 let's see is in red you want 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.940
 tell you that he calls her but because 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.710
 call is being inside that is to say the 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.110
 part the missed calls list why 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.940
 because we had blocked it 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.350
 and especially for this video many 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.210
