00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
really simply does exactly that you

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.870 
really simply does exactly that you
could<00:00:16.560> take<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.740> hair<00:00:16.949> texture<00:00:17.340> like<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.520> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
could take a hair texture like this and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.580 
could take a hair texture like this and
create<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.240> very<00:00:18.539> unique<00:00:18.840> matte<00:00:19.140> texture

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
create this very unique matte texture

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.590 
create this very unique matte texture
but<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.189> never<00:00:20.490> very<00:00:20.550> heavy<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:21.420> never

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
but it's never very heavy and it's never

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.660 
but it's never very heavy and it's never
greasy<00:00:21.869> strength<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.800> probably<00:00:23.160> around<00:00:23.460> a

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
greasy strength of probably around a

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.609 
greasy strength of probably around a
three<00:00:23.939> which<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.240> exactly<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.560> you

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
three which is exactly what it is so you

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.160 
three which is exactly what it is so you
know<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.949> really<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.340> very<00:00:26.369> pliable

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
know that really it's a very pliable

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.169 
know that really it's a very pliable
texture<00:00:28.170> kind<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.680> paste<00:00:29.070> work<00:00:29.910> your<00:00:30.060> through

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
texture kind of paste work your through

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.150 
texture kind of paste work your through
your<00:00:30.240> hands<00:00:30.599> again<00:00:30.869> as<00:00:31.080> always<00:00:31.230> break<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
your hands again as always break the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.500 
your hands again as always break the
product<00:00:32.460> down<00:00:32.550> at<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> heat<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.180> hands

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
product down at the heat of the hands

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.180 
product down at the heat of the hands
and<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.899> can<00:00:34.050> see<00:00:34.260> here<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.680> even<00:00:34.770> feel

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and you can see here you can even feel

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.979 
and you can see here you can even feel
this<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> light<00:00:36.120> bit<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.480> texture<00:00:36.960> there

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
this is a light bit of texture there

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.139 
this is a light bit of texture there
that's<00:00:37.559> really<00:00:37.829> gonna<00:00:38.010> saturate<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:39.000> through

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
that's really gonna saturate in through

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.940 
that's really gonna saturate in through
the<00:00:39.270> hair<00:00:39.420> make<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.719> very<00:00:39.899> very<00:00:39.960> workable<00:00:40.469> so

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the hair make it very very workable so

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.139 
the hair make it very very workable so
I'm<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.160> work<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> through<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> hair<00:00:41.760> my

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
I'm going to work it through the hair my

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.060 
I'm going to work it through the hair my
hands<00:00:42.390> are<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.510> best<00:00:42.750> tool<00:00:43.020> ever<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.890> I'd<00:00:43.980> be

hands are the best tool ever and I'd be

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.619 
hands are the best tool ever and I'd be
frightened<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.550> rubbing<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> product<00:00:45.450> in

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
frightened of rubbing the product in

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.959 
frightened of rubbing the product in
even<00:00:46.320> where<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> hair<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.280> very<00:00:47.309> very<00:00:47.730> short

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
is great you can lay up with the same

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.560 
is great you can lay up with the same
product<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.280> little<00:01:08.700> bit<00:01:08.820> more<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.210> little<00:01:09.540> bit

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
product a little bit more a little bit

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.840 
product a little bit more a little bit
more<00:01:09.659> gives<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.229> control<00:01:10.590> over<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.369> texture

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
more gives you control over the texture

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.429 
more gives you control over the texture
that<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.060> want<00:01:12.240> here<00:01:12.630> there's<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.049> little<00:01:13.320> bit

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
that you want here there's a little bit

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.990 
that you want here there's a little bit
thick<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.830> dense<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.280> has<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> ability<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
thick and dense so it has the ability to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.300 
thick and dense so it has the ability to
absorb<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.170> like<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.530> work<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.830> product<00:01:17.189> in

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
absorb so I like to work the product in

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.980 
absorb so I like to work the product in
through<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.729> hair<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.600> really<00:01:18.720> see

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
through the hair and you can really see

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.719 
through the hair and you can really see
through<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:19.470> how<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.250> does<00:01:20.520> have

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
through here how it really does have

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.910 
through here how it really does have
this<00:01:20.850> incredible<00:01:21.420> modern<00:01:21.869> texture<00:01:22.470> which<00:01:22.890> is

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
this incredible modern texture which is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.770 
this incredible modern texture which is
very<00:01:23.280> very<00:01:23.400> hot<00:01:23.700> at<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> moment<00:01:23.909> whether<00:01:24.659> your

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
very very hot at the moment whether your
