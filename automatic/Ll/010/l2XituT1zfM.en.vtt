that's<00:02:07.420> all<00:02:07.630> fine<00:02:07.960> bake<00:02:08.740> transformations

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
that's all fine bake transformations

relative paths triangulate those are all

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
things that you want see here lights

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.180 
things that you want see here lights
won't<00:02:20.680> export<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:22.630> work<00:02:23.260> with<00:02:23.500> paper<00:02:23.739> vision

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
won't export and work with paper vision

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.610 
won't export and work with paper vision
so<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.489> don't<00:02:24.670> have<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.120> do<00:02:25.209> that<00:02:25.239> I<00:02:25.870> don't

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
so you don't have to do that I don't

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.560 
so you don't have to do that I don't
think<00:02:26.650> cameras<00:02:27.280> export<00:02:28.060> either<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:31.330> might<00:02:31.480> as

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
think cameras export either you might as

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.820 
think cameras export either you might as
well<00:02:31.720> just<00:02:31.900> leave<00:02:32.050> joints<00:02:32.440> in<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.560> skin<00:02:32.800> on

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
well just leave joints in the skin on

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.380 
well just leave joints in the skin on
because<00:02:35.280> later<00:02:36.280> when<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:37.000> actually<00:02:37.269> use<00:02:37.720> like

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
because later when you actually use like

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.680 
because later when you actually use like
joints<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:41.040> skin<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.370> your<00:02:42.730> model<00:02:42.880> like<00:02:43.540> if

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
joints and skin on your model like if

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.990 
joints and skin on your model like if
you're<00:02:43.810> doing<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.110> character<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:44.800> want<00:02:45.700> this

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
you're doing a character you want this

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.229 
you're doing a character you want this
checked<00:02:46.300> so<00:02:46.660> just<00:02:47.170> leave<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.440> on<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:49.090> really

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
checked so just leave it on it's really

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.820 
checked so just leave it on it's really
not<00:02:49.390> going<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.630> add<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.959> much<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.440> your<00:02:50.650> file

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
not going to add that much to your file

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.479 
not going to add that much to your file
size<00:02:51.180> yes<00:02:52.180> we<00:02:52.390> want<00:02:52.510> animations<00:02:55.980> I'm<00:02:56.980> not<00:02:57.130> sure

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
size yes we want animations I'm not sure

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.210 
size yes we want animations I'm not sure
I<00:02:57.940> don't<00:02:58.390> think<00:02:58.630> paper<00:02:59.230> version<00:02:59.590> does<00:02:59.739> physics

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
I don't think paper version does physics

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.320 
I don't think paper version does physics
so<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.489> don't<00:03:00.730> think<00:03:00.850> we<00:03:00.940> need<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:04.060> don't

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
so I don't think we need that you don't

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:12.940 
so I don't think we need that you don't
need<00:03:04.540> invisible<00:03:05.050> nodes<00:03:07.320> what

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.830 

we<00:03:13.950> want<00:03:14.190> normals<00:03:14.700> we<00:03:15.150> want<00:03:15.300> texture

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
we want normals we want texture

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.580 
we want normals we want texture
coordinates<00:03:19.910> probably<00:03:20.910> don't<00:03:21.330> need<00:03:21.690> per

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
coordinates probably don't need per

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.540 
coordinates probably don't need per
vertex<00:03:23.070> colors<00:03:26.000> those<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.300> stay<00:03:27.600> off<00:03:28.550> that's

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
vertex colors those can stay off that's

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.830 
vertex colors those can stay off that's
fine<00:03:29.940> that's<00:03:30.840> fine<00:03:32.120> leave<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.330> on<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:35.840> these

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
fine that's fine leave that on so these

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.040 
fine that's fine leave that on so these
settings<00:03:37.230> are<00:03:37.410> good<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.060> just<00:03:39.270> do<00:03:39.480> export

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
settings are good and you just do export

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.960 
settings are good and you just do export
and<00:03:41.330> just<00:03:42.330> go<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:43.020> your<00:03:43.500> folder<00:03:43.740> and<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.220> want

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
and just go to your folder and you want

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.180 
and just go to your folder and you want
to<00:03:45.090> save<00:03:45.330> it<00:03:45.360> in<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.930> same<00:03:46.170> folder<00:03:46.620> as<00:03:46.650> you

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
to save it in the same folder as you

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.000 
to save it in the same folder as you
have<00:03:48.120> your<00:03:48.150> mana<00:03:48.540> file<00:03:48.960> and<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.590> want<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:49.890> make

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
have your mana file and you want to make

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.580 
have your mana file and you want to make
sure<00:03:50.070> that<00:03:50.490> you<00:03:50.760> have<00:03:51.480> your<00:03:51.510> textures<00:03:52.260> in<00:03:52.530> the

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
sure that you have your textures in the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.620 
sure that you have your textures in the
same<00:03:52.950> folder<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:53.550> if<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.790> just<00:03:53.820> open<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.300> photo

same folder so if I just open that photo

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.790 
same folder so if I just open that photo
real<00:03:54.840> quick<00:03:56.120> here's<00:03:57.120> my<00:03:57.450> file<00:03:57.780> here's<00:03:58.620> my

real quick here's my file here's my

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.560 
real quick here's my file here's my
texture<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.660> I'm<00:04:00.660> going<00:04:01.050> to<00:04:01.110> export<00:04:02.570> my

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
texture and I'm going to export my

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.950 
texture and I'm going to export my
animation<00:04:04.170> to<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:04.740> folder<00:04:04.980> as<00:04:05.250> well<00:04:05.870> so<00:04:06.870> I'm

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
animation to that folder as well so I'm

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.420 
animation to that folder as well so I'm
just<00:04:07.110> going<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.350> call<00:04:07.500> this<00:04:07.710> Maya<00:04:08.130> cube<00:04:09.080> Adam

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
just going to call this Maya cube Adam

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.340 
just going to call this Maya cube Adam
and<00:04:11.430> export<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:13.400> it<00:04:14.400> will<00:04:14.580> export<00:04:15.000> your<00:04:15.600> your

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
and export and it will export your your

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.110 
and export and it will export your your
timeline<00:04:17.359> so<00:04:18.359> let's<00:04:18.870> see<00:04:19.049> here<00:04:19.290> i<00:04:20.090> might<00:04:21.090> have

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
timeline so let's see here i might have

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.700 
timeline so let's see here i might have
exported<00:04:22.040> too<00:04:23.040> much

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.370 

yeah<00:04:28.400> I'm<00:04:28.699> going<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.300> just<00:04:29.600> pull<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:29.900> back<00:04:30.080> one

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
yeah I'm going to just pull it back one

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.610 
yeah I'm going to just pull it back one
frame<00:04:30.819> so<00:04:31.819> that<00:04:31.850> it<00:04:32.060> looks<00:04:32.240> because<00:04:33.050> my<00:04:33.470> last

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
frame so that it looks because my last

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.550 
frame so that it looks because my last
frame<00:04:34.009> before<00:04:34.360> was<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.569> same<00:04:35.780> frame<00:04:36.139> as<00:04:36.169> my

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
frame before was the same frame as my

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.510 
frame before was the same frame as my
first<00:04:36.740> frame<00:04:37.870> so<00:04:38.870> if<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:39.139> you<00:04:39.740> know<00:04:39.770> just<00:04:39.860> knock

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
first frame so if I you know just knock

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.460 
first frame so if I you know just knock
off<00:04:40.759> one<00:04:41.060> frame<00:04:41.330> off<00:04:41.509> the<00:04:41.690> end<00:04:41.840> it'll<00:04:42.169> loop

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
off one frame off the end it'll loop

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.469 
off one frame off the end it'll loop
seamlessly<00:04:43.160> so<00:04:43.759> I'm<00:04:43.819> just<00:04:43.970> going<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.150> export

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
seamlessly so I'm just going to export

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.510 
seamlessly so I'm just going to export
that<00:04:44.690> again<00:04:44.900> so<00:04:45.680> X<00:04:45.860> portal<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:48.130> it<00:04:49.130> remembers

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
that again so X portal and it remembers

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.379 
that again so X portal and it remembers
you<00:04:50.389> know<00:04:50.509> your<00:04:50.690> same<00:04:50.930> settings<00:04:51.410> as<00:04:51.590> before<00:04:52.389> so

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
you know your same settings as before so

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:05.680 
you know your same settings as before so
X<00:04:53.750> portal<00:04:54.139> and<00:04:55.150> an<00:04:56.150> m2<00:04:57.370> dot<00:04:58.370> da<00:05:03.789> ok<00:05:04.789> and<00:05:05.000> should

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
X portal and an m2 dot da ok and should

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.320 
X portal and an m2 dot da ok and should
have<00:05:05.780> exported<00:05:07.750> memorize<00:05:08.750> that<00:05:08.960> and<00:05:10.030> if<00:05:11.030> you

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
have exported memorize that and if you

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.140 
have exported memorize that and if you
don't<00:05:11.509> have<00:05:11.660> this<00:05:11.840> it's<00:05:12.199> the<00:05:12.440> paper<00:05:12.979> vision<00:05:13.400> 3d

load in you know Maya cube annum tube so
we<00:05:38.360> just<00:05:38.539> made<00:05:38.780> and<00:05:39.580> it's<00:05:40.580> really<00:05:41.150> annoying

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
we just made and it's really annoying

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.249 
we just made and it's really annoying
because<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:42.400> Maya<00:05:43.400> exporter<00:05:44.259> Claude

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
because the Maya exporter Claude

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.430 
because the Maya exporter Claude
exporter<00:05:45.909> exports<00:05:46.909> things<00:05:47.120> really<00:05:47.389> small<00:05:47.750> but

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
exporter exports things really small but

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.159 
exporter exports things really small but
in<00:05:48.740> paper<00:05:49.159> vision<00:05:49.610> like<00:05:49.880> in<00:05:50.270> flower<00:05:50.630> manager

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
in paper vision like in flower manager

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:52.629 
in paper vision like in flower manager
if<00:05:51.440> you're<00:05:51.620> doing<00:05:51.889> this<00:05:52.009> for<00:05:52.070> augmented

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
if you're doing this for augmented

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.670 
if you're doing this for augmented
reality<00:05:53.090> you<00:05:53.570> can<00:05:53.750> scale<00:05:54.080> it<00:05:54.110> up<00:05:54.320> really

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
reality you can scale it up really

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.899 
reality you can scale it up really
easily<00:05:55.099> so<00:05:56.229> that's<00:05:57.229> probably<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:58.340> easiest

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909 
easily so that's probably the easiest

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:01.570 
easily so that's probably the easiest
way<00:05:59.180> to<00:05:59.240> work<00:05:59.479> it's<00:06:00.020> just<00:06:00.289> you<00:06:01.039> know<00:06:01.130> work<00:06:01.340> that

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
way to work it's just you know work that

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.719 
way to work it's just you know work that
on<00:06:01.759> it<00:06:02.060> on<00:06:02.210> a<00:06:02.270> normal<00:06:02.659> size<00:06:03.020> and<00:06:03.050> Maya<00:06:03.729> export

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
on it on a normal size and Maya export

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.339 
on it on a normal size and Maya export
it<00:06:04.880> and<00:06:05.000> just<00:06:05.479> know<00:06:05.690> that<00:06:05.900> you're<00:06:06.110> going<00:06:06.259> to

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.349 
it and just know that you're going to

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.550 
it and just know that you're going to
have<00:06:06.560> to<00:06:07.000> adjust<00:06:08.000> the<00:06:08.180> scale<00:06:08.630> of<00:06:08.900> the<00:06:09.139> model

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
have to adjust the scale of the model

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.120 
have to adjust the scale of the model
inside<00:06:10.310> of<00:06:10.580> your<00:06:10.969> action<00:06:11.389> script<00:06:11.919> so<00:06:12.919> if<00:06:13.039> I

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
inside of your action script so if I

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.920 
inside of your action script so if I
just<00:06:13.310> click<00:06:13.520> it<00:06:13.550> we<00:06:14.060> can<00:06:14.210> see<00:06:14.469> our<00:06:15.469> little<00:06:15.620> cube

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
just click it we can see our little cube

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.839 
just click it we can see our little cube
jumping<00:06:17.930> back<00:06:18.169> and<00:06:18.199> forth

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:26.469 

cool<00:06:22.339> so<00:06:23.339> that's<00:06:23.580> how<00:06:23.819> you<00:06:24.529> export<00:06:25.529> and

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
cool so that's how you export and

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.409 
cool so that's how you export and
animate<00:06:27.479> a<00:06:27.659> 3d<00:06:28.409> model<00:06:28.589> for<00:06:29.339> paper<00:06:29.729> version<00:06:30.119> 3d

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
animate a 3d model for paper version 3d

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.519 
animate a 3d model for paper version 3d
just<00:06:31.379> using<00:06:31.709> your<00:06:31.830> transformations<00:06:32.669> I<00:06:33.529> hope
