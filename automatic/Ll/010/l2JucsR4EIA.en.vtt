to g7 and she said that one more time

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.340 
to g7 and she said that one more time
into<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.390> face<00:02:53.570> not<00:02:53.750> what<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:53.960> could<00:02:54.170> do

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
into the face not what you could do

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.020 
into the face not what you could do
instead<00:02:54.620> of<00:02:54.860> altering<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.340> chord<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:55.940> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
instead of altering the chord in the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.390 
instead of altering the chord in the
left<00:02:56.060> hand<00:02:56.420> we<00:02:56.870> could<00:02:57.020> just<00:02:57.230> keep<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.590> G<00:02:57.860> note<00:02:58.100> I

East and we're going to try that one we

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.960 
East and we're going to try that one we
actually<00:04:06.860> change<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.220> court<00:04:07.519> we've<00:04:07.700> got<00:04:07.819> two

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
actually change the court we've got two

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.090 
actually change the court we've got two
chords<00:04:08.360> in<00:04:08.510> here

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.800 

see<00:04:15.019> to<00:04:16.019> g7<00:04:17.269> now<00:04:18.269> we're<00:04:18.420> going<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.660> kick

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
see to g7 now we're going to kick

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.840 
see to g7 now we're going to kick
everything<00:04:19.110> up<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.440> semitone<00:04:19.769> so<00:04:20.250> c-sharp

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
everything up a semitone so c-sharp

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.740 
everything up a semitone so c-sharp
becomes<00:04:21.690> G<00:04:22.019> sharp<00:04:22.470> 7<00:04:23.100> which<00:04:23.700> is<00:04:23.730> a<00:04:23.970> flat<00:04:24.240> 7<00:04:24.600> it's

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
becomes G sharp 7 which is a flat 7 it's

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.350 
becomes G sharp 7 which is a flat 7 it's
easy<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:25.170> think<00:04:25.350> so<00:04:26.100> we're<00:04:26.280> going<00:04:26.430> from<00:04:26.730> C

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
easy to think so we're going from C

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.350 
easy to think so we're going from C
sharp<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:28.410> flat<00:04:28.650> 7<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:29.700> let's<00:04:29.730> go<00:04:30.090> from<00:04:30.240> the

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
sharp to a flat 7 so let's go from the

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:42.959 
sharp to a flat 7 so let's go from the
beginning<00:04:33.260> now<00:04:34.260> we<00:04:34.320> go

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:42.969 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:45.839 

and<00:04:43.059> then<00:04:43.959> finally<00:04:44.499> we<00:04:45.009> complete<00:04:45.459> the<00:04:45.579> tune

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
and then finally we complete the tune

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:56.520 
and then finally we complete the tune
with<00:04:46.269> the<00:04:46.449> D<00:04:46.869> major<00:04:47.110> section

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.649 

which<00:04:57.530> goes<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:57.800> see<00:05:01.120> so<00:05:02.120> let's<00:05:02.300> have<00:05:02.449> that

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659 
which goes to see so let's have that

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.990 
which goes to see so let's have that
introduction<00:05:03.650> all<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:04.129> way<00:05:04.220> through<00:05:04.550> without

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
introduction all the way through without

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:26.490 
introduction all the way through without
my<00:05:05.780> talking

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:37.390
