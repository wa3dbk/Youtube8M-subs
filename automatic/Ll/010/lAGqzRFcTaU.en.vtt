00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 in the program today the creation 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.490
 a big pot of grasses is this 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.480
 that if we make a hotpot of grasses I 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.099
 can say that it is almost a 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.690
 sustainable gardener that is beautiful any 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.889
 the year you can keep it until 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.059
 next spring since spring 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.250
 next we will have news 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.809
 repels it is a pot that will go into 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.330
 the garden we need the father is for 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.880
 evacuation of the water here I go back 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.820
 then the program is to install 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.500
 the clay balls we've drilled 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.750
 holes the water will therefore drain and the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:38.219
 clay balls will further facilitate the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:40.129
 drainage then the garden felt the 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.020
 felt and gardens that will allow to 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.680
 avoid or potting mix in 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.680
 clay balls 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.960
 ok here and there we have installed the 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.059
 potting soil is what grasses have 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.890
 specific needs at ground level the 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.969
 well-drained soil we said it but this 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.890
 are plants that can adapt 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:13.930
 practically at all soils a good 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:16.210
 garden soil will then suit us 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.490
 still have the motta buried us 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.920
 let's go buried here pretty much at this 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.229
 level there ie about 10 cm in 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.630
 below the height of the pot so before 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.700
 every planting we have to soak 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.130
 the plant in the water so well 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.270
 moisten the pack 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.450
 so you're busy donating them 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.390
 sas plants I love it's a mini-van 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.280
 you this is wiplier dawn trick is 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.200
 a bamboo that will stay small kir has very 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.420
 well in the background beyond your 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.990
 planting with miscanthus 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.670
 so I have a personal advice 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.590
 give is that you realize a 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.830
 big garden big spots and especially 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.509
 for those ci that is going to be sustainable for 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.039
 to be certain that you will appreciate 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.440
 the result 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.849
 do not hesitate to position the pots and 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.920
 see a little bit about the arrangement that you 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:04.840
 which suits you best and above all 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.520
 then to turn the pot here it is a little 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.379
 bulky so it's not obvious but 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.899
 in which case you do all the trick 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.319
 to 360 to see if it's beautiful under all 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.760
 Angles 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.190
 so at the maintenance level we 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.020
 let's get this hottie to grow 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.250
 she will still push of course and then 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.709
 as I told you in the fall 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.790
 some leaves will dry a little 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.530
 little but we leave them for the winter 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.840
 because it will be very pretty to imagine the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.760
 the frost and the snow to know then you 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.629
 I'm talking about undoing the bun but that 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.940
 it's really useful 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.730
 yes it has nothing to do with hair 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.800
 this is the bun of the roots that have 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.450
 tend to curl up a little bit in 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.040
 the pot is the same thing in 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.590
 it would be feasible 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.209
 yes by taking a little more space say 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.890
 we will be able to respect the distances 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.080
 we will be able to plant all these 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.569
 grasses in the sun in any good 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.220
 garden soil but about 40 cm 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.750
 up to a meter apart 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.400
 others at startup must be watered 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.530
 at the plantation but then in the east 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.670
 in the first two months water 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.590
 regularly so that 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.690
 roots take their place then in 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.150
 full earth 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.490
 she will endure a watering obviously 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.160
 planting fertilization yes or no 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.810
 we can in the spring we can add a 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.580
 little bit of a little bit of fertilizer 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.050
 airbus did not need them 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.760
 grasses thrive well alone 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.320
 roland is what you and nothing a 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.900
 last tip for managing the pot 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.580
 as a whole yes given the size of the 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.440
 pot it's going to be hard to move it 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.390
 so there are small boards 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.220
 with rollers called rolls 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.810
 skin that could be installed under it 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.990
 never have morning skin on the lawn 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.490
 or even on its terrace not because 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.860
 little holes you know what we did 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.260
 swiss or pot could plug 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.760
 and so it does not facilitate drainage 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.190
 of the plant and all the plants have 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.450
 need a good drainage and roland me 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.970
 I 'll let you finish 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.350
 were you cleaning fee I you the 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.350
 door in front of the house too yeah
