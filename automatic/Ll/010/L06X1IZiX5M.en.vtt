00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.630
 hello guys and girls from youtube gonzalo 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.990
 to the speech commenting today I will have a 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:10.510
 new video of mairena in this video what 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.720
 I will devote to different types of 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.810
 monsters that you know in maicao 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.770
 first 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.770
 two blocks 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.880
 on top not one here 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.689
 now 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.150
 and really one is called cabbage in this 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.690
 This mode will protect you from the different 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.300
 monsters that there may be an example 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.559
 we have more or less than two hits 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.559
 We could all zombie 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.690
 then I would do with the armor 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.020
 I am going 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:04.290
 and it's pretty cool the next one is going to 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.290
 be this is a snowman 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.310
 this in different ways would attack 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.760
 if you look at many blows to send 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.760
 of our strokes of 12 plus or minus 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.130
 already this 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.130
 with zombies 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.650
 It is not so good previous 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:59.980
 now last this this one that would attack 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:03.180
 and survival is quite good 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.430
 it's hard enough to kill him 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.050
 we need this a skull written from 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.860
 weapons and abyssal stone like the colon 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:18.880
 but with life and what do you think 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:22.860
 this is called like now it will explode 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:27.720
 know that the bar will explode and 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.720
 he will surely kill if he kills him 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:36.299
 some heads and destroying all this 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.420
 above 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.420
 and life 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.900
 it's going up and 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:04.840
 a lighthouse servers and this has been 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.880
 everything we'll see in the next 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.880
 good video so far
