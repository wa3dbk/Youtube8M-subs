00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
that to also use a stapler to unbind

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.260 
that to also use a stapler to unbind
them<00:01:45.570> together<00:01:45.930> or<00:01:46.590> what<00:01:47.369> i<00:01:47.399> did<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.670> mine<00:01:48.000> i

use<00:02:06.390> run<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.110> through<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> line<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:09.149> when<00:02:09.330> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
use run it through the line so when you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.580 
use run it through the line so when you
put<00:02:10.319> your

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
put your

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.160 
put your
glue<00:02:10.830> on<00:02:11.099> particularly<00:02:12.090> here<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.629> here<00:02:12.989> this

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
glue on particularly here and here this

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.729 
glue on particularly here and here this
on<00:02:13.410> here<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.300> then<00:02:15.300> put<00:02:15.480> another<00:02:15.510> blue<00:02:16.349> hair

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
on here and then put another blue hair

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.440 
on here and then put another blue hair
and<00:02:16.980> what<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.459> basically<00:02:17.730> does<00:02:18.239> is<00:02:20.450> don't

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
and what that basically does is don't

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.150 
and what that basically does is don't
fold<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.870> yet<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:22.200> want<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.410> go<00:02:22.560> ahead<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.040> let

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
fold it yet you want to go ahead and let

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.740 
fold it yet you want to go ahead and let
cool<00:02:23.459> down<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:24.830> that<00:02:25.830> way<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.819> would<00:02:27.090> share

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
cool down and that way it would share

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.280 
cool down and that way it would share
that<00:02:27.780> your<00:02:28.319> paper<00:02:29.040> bag<00:02:29.280> won't<00:02:29.900> fall<00:02:30.900> apart<00:02:31.099> and

that your paper bag won't fall apart and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.800 
that your paper bag won't fall apart and
then<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.590> can<00:02:34.739> go<00:02:34.860> ahead<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.220> start<00:02:35.810> covering

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
then you can go ahead and start covering

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.520 
then you can go ahead and start covering
your<00:02:38.180> paper<00:02:39.180> your<00:02:39.480> paper<00:02:39.870> bag<00:02:40.140> with<00:02:40.379> your

it<00:02:43.019> like<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.769> then<00:02:43.950> just<00:02:44.160> turn<00:02:44.700> around

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849

and<00:02:45.209> snip<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.019> out<00:02:46.760> do<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.910> same<00:02:48.180> way<00:02:48.329> on<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
and snip this out do it same way on the

other side as well and so I don't don't

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.009 
other side as well and so I don't don't
have<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.030> use<00:02:51.180> all<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.450> measurements<00:02:51.750> like

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
that's how i would do that and then you

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.240 
that's how i would do that and then you
noticing<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.739> third<00:02:57.230> paper<00:02:58.230> bag<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.860> what

a oil sandwich like follow it and try to

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.520 
a oil sandwich like follow it and try to
see<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.030> distance<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:18.720> that's<00:03:18.900> how<00:03:19.079> much<00:03:19.290> this

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
somewhat of the same distance and then

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
somewhat of the same distance and then
you<00:03:27.750> want<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:27.959> go<00:03:28.079> ahead<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.470> fold<00:03:28.889> that<00:03:30.470> again
