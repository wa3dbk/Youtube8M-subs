00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Hello everyone today I want to reveal everything 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.270
 hair growth speed secrets 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.250
 Recently watched a couple of videos of different 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.260
 girls who promised that the hair 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.300
 can grow by 10 centimeters a month 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.400
 decided to find out if this is true 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.520
 Do not deceive us turned out that up 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.690
 cheating such speed just 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.400
 impossible maximum achievable 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.680
 speed for us registrations squirrel is 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.810
 one and a half centimeters a month if you 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.300
 Asian girl you are damn lucky 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.490
 your hair can grow as much as possible on 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.679
 two centimeters a month but if you 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.989
 the Kan continent themselves then unfortunately 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.210
 here you will find a big disappointment 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.920
 girls black skin very slow 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.540
 Hair growth rate is even less than one 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.070
 centimeters per month by the way 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.680
 pretty long hair 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.270
 they are already below the belt it's very cool 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.160
 by the way did you notice the roots of my hair 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.840
 slightly different in color I 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.910
 the hair is colored and can be noticed 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.460
 how far have they grown it now somewhere 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.600
 one and a half centimeters but for now Iâ€™m a little strong 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.829
 more than a month ago 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.510
 This means that I have practically 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.370
 optimal hair growth rate 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.579
 almost half a centimeter but 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.719
 of course i want to do more i 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.210
 intends to fight for every millimeter 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.369
 I even plan to drink all sorts of vitamins 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.500
 need very different vitamins for growth 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.180
 hair but they say that very well 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.210
 helps 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.310
 b12 biotin more protein iron and zinc 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.650
 I think to remove as there will be no special 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.619
 test your videos to show how much 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.110
 it helps and now perhaps I will tell 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.210
 to you about those secrets of these ways and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.200
 receptions that using to 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.180
 hair grew 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.119
 long there are wonderful say that 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.009
 if carefully and permanently 25 times a 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.229
 day hair combing they will be very 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.880
 grow fast no it's not true 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.680
 In fact, they just all come out there that 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.570
 hair actually so dead 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.220
 imagine your joke will be constantly 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.320
 combing of course she's just for 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.540
 ruffling will become ugly the same 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.549
 will be with hair but what really help 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.079
 this is a good head massage blood 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.060
 flows to the base of the hair and they 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.790
 really start credibility yet 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.100
 say that if it is very often worth while camping 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.829
 then shave your hair well 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.719
 grow very very fast and sometimes 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.260
 try to even pick up a barber 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.510
 whose easy mca is nothing like 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.700
 in fact all to grow by their 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.380
 maher cuts off and you get no 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.880
 no additional benefits 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.410
 length no growth rate 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.260
 I checked it on myself cut 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.030
 differently sheared hot scissors 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.130
 cold scissors cut 1 month 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.110
 Taigla times in the mountains every other year and 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.330
 I must tell you what I cut 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.520
 hair threads build up and one more 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.470
 very common myth that 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.720
 washing your hair will leave half a lot from 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.760
 depends on how you wash your hair if 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.650
 you use a good shampoo well not 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.690
 what kind of sulphate well and if you 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.120
 Be sure to use the air conditioner 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.260
 hair will grow perfectly normal 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.360
 that is, they just won't break 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.070
 since you will take good care and 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.220
 their condition but there is another small 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.870
 the secret is coconut oil apply it 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.790
 before washing hair 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.040
 and then flush and the result will not force 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.470
 yourself waiting for you will be silky and 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.380
 will break much less keeping 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.180
 your real length after washing your hair 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.620
 take us very carefully desirable 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.700
 naturally neatly 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.260
 I wash towels 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.780
 using no fen can dry out 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.459
 hair and they will become brittle and split 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.560
 tips again support them 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.989
 shear off to tell you more 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.530
 secret secret in general where my our 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.209
 hat 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.640
 the thing is that the hair does not like 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.950
 cold weather is a water worm he 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.140
 freezes and may break therefore 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.700
 very often the tips of girls 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.100
 boys probably too 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.750
 and generally cool hat in winter is great 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.970
 there are a lot of all sorts of factors that 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.890
 affect the hair is your health and 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.050
 your mood maybe you noticed 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.209
 when the flu is in your hair 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.160
 grow significant days but noticed and 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.810
 somehow very sick on the whole 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.370
 two weeks I have been very high 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.260
 temperature for a long time to lie 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.600
 the beds and my hair began to grow 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.880
 significantly slower as you think how 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.590
 I learned about it the master was very simple 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.900
 my hair was just dyed and 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.000
 it was noticeable that it would understand very much 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.560
 slowly but when I recovered speed 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.420
 hair growth came in 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.730
 it was not very happy and remember 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.489
 when you experience some kind of alarm 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.560
 anxiety trying to worry hair 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.870
 start to grow much less sometimes 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.550
 practically do not grow this is due to 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.500
 all sorts of complex chemical processes 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.630
 that occur in the body I even 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.880
 honestly afraid to go down in the details 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.220
 because well, somehow it's all very 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.200
 difficult but absolutely certain that 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.709
 good mood helps girls

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.070
 hair and the most important secret to me 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.580
 trust the hairdresser with huge 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.100
 to scissors they just shear off everything 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.110
 that you carefully built up it was a part 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.940
 for girls to answer for boys 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.950

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.300
 long hair they look so cool 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.360

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.600
