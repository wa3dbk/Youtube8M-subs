00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.570
 minecraft girls italy i am 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.940
 piece and today I am here to show you one 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.389
 new fashion the ways or freezes cheating without 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.940
 on the mod 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.190
 then this fashion I classify it is 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.160
 more like a chip or comunaque but not 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.270
 just like a fashion though as I quote 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.380
 it also doesn't have all the features 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.390
 needed 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.670
 let's see how this works 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.710
 fashion by clicking the g key on the keyboard 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.080
 this little one will open up less 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.170
 on the left he called globe that would be 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.719
 let's say the menu by clicking on the ball 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.120
 right several functions will come out 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.980
 active fund schenn function we will do 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.540
 see all the activities or i 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.730
 active processes of the mod 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.739
 we close it just by clicking 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.700
 clicking on player will open it 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.469
 then all the functions on the right 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.050
 which we say allow us to interact 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.270
 with for so creative fly that there 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.430
 allows you to fly without suffering damage 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.359
 row instead we will have damage from 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.850
 fall 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.580
 no full instead what we will need for not 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.409
 suffer damage once dropped so if 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.740
 we combine no food and fly 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.900
 we are practically like the creative fly 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.760
 they call it so even if the creative fly 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.830
 is not active on the servers 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.280
 if you try for example, authorize the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.590
 flai is the uncertain anofol serves 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.390
 probably not real fencing ie if 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.180
 do you for example try to use them 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.299
 could work I recommend you 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.549
 do not do it anyway because you flai 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.490
 peck in a few seconds banana 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.619
 therefore not usable in the servers 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.110
 sprint serves for itself nor do we press for 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.640
 example v continues to sprint from 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.220
 only then we must not press two 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.530
 times v to make them do the sprint hampus 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.869
 able you present now pursue yourself 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.670
 this we need in the servers however vi 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.049
 I remember not even using them 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.060
 if I know you will eventually use it 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.100
 in ambiguous servers it serves for non 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.159
 make them push out of season 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.840
 so stay still even if I do n't know 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.540
 in later versions of minecraft 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.390
 if it is still active, however, the use is 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.110
 this but i'm afraid what does it take for 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.110
 example the zombie 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.989
 I don't click anything around and hit it 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.140
 same the zombie this here we say that 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.450
 does not work with players only works 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.340
 with fashion it's called moba now I don't know 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.159
 if it works with the players I think not 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.920
 because for example I remember that in 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.470
 some uncertain even this not 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.970
 worked however moba now works 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.950
 for mobs for players it's not safe 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.829
 no full high jump player that makes us 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.049
 skip three blocks instead of one, however 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.269
 give and believed we take it dynamic 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.400
 fly which is a fly but much faster 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.430
 of the normal you see we suffer the same 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.930
 fall damage so be careful 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.510
 invisible player ie this is here 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.609
 epic don't see us we don't have either 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.290
 the particles therefore practically 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.170
 we are invincible 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.329
 even here we do not see then though 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.810
 for example, let's take a look at the armor 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:04.030
 the nature you see you see here is only and is 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.400
 equal to the invisibility only that there is not 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.440
 show the particles we deactivate it 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.230
 the slow down allows us to go 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.970
 fast also on the souls end and step alla 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.010
 I don't know what it was because it wasn't 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.220
 there is not used is not often 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.690
 used and on the site there was no world 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.280
 instead they are those commands that they make us 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.769
 interact with the world that is with the first 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.419
 place as per name quickly places us 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.540
 the blocks set of va well you know 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:31.299
 infinite day waterworks is not that 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.489
 we walk on water allows us to 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.410
 staying afloat is not like the lotus you are 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.410
 walk on water with water gore walk 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.480
 you don't go to the bottom you always float 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.949
 spoon author and allows you not to click 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.379
 the respon button exposes was 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:46.829
 automatically fulbright increases the 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.480
 brightness at 200 percent and passes 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.419
 fastbreak allows you to break faster 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.180
 in what are called blocks and brett 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.739
 camp crumb is a pretty thing 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.780
 particularly because it has 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.220
 practically locates us all 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.810
 positions where we went see 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.940
 these stripes that for just 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.370
 they disappear here for example we do 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.889
 maybe we die in this position 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.810
 we answer and see all of them 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.639
 distances we have traveled then 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.099
 let's see where we went practically 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:17.469
 shows us our position which 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.450
 turn we did what we did 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:20.900
 it's also a bit difficult to locate 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.240
 in the end because all the lines 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.419
 see they go together is a kind of trust 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.710
 a mega thread that is behind us and there 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.449
 it follows and shows us what we have 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.520
 done we deactivate it because it gives me a 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.100
 annoyance if we re activating it 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.889
 remains active see us see that again 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.139
 which is there and disappears by itself and before 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:43.400
 that alone info instead makes us see the 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:45.440
 things like fps coordinates and then the name 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.050
 of the nearby player radar i 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.639
 player nearby so if that 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.410
 multiplayer vi is used 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.810
 I advise you not to use them multiplayer 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.780
 makes us see all the people in the 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.060
 neighborhood render is more we say one thing 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.900
 which serves as a city ​​and just an extreme 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.910
 that is, spectator entities look at us 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.320
 an entity of its own away from 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.949
 we can therefore visualize 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.080
 whatever there is guest finder does 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.940
 see all the processes that there are blocks 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.770
 all the particular blocks nearby 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.780
 player all players nearby 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.020
 mob all the furniture nearby 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.910
 finally traceurs we need to 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.919
 display is like a line going from 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.539
 us at player 15 displays the player 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.020
 closer the player position more 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:32.690
 near uses instead serve more like 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.669
 let's say a single player world because 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.860
 he runs by reloading hands 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.050
 finally I told you activex for example 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.940
 clicking reload chan it will reload us 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.770
 everyone is also there as you see that they are there 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.240
 this is very useful in the single player e 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.949
 especially for a few years maybe gods 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.260
 problems with junk 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.960
 so guys, I remind you to wear me 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.610
 like the video if the mode or hv is served 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.229
 however I advise you not to use 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.270
 in the servers and I don't take the 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.130
 responsibility for everything you can 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.020
 do with this fashion 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.610
 I remind you to put I like to register 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.199
 the minecraft italia and di channel 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.060
 pass in my channel that you find in the 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.039
 description if you are interested in mini mode 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.080
 game or anything related to 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.120
 world the world of minecraft and beyond 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.289
 so see you in a next video 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.770
 on minecraft italy 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.770
 hello everyone guys
