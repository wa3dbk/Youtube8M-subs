just very FIF a worker versus and this

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.340 
just very FIF a worker versus and this

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
is for every time timer so there's it's

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.970 
is for every time timer so there's it's
a<00:00:37.500> great<00:00:38.430> looking<00:00:39.059> washes<00:00:39.660> way<00:00:39.870> with<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.379> golden

rim with a light blue pen in the middle

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.150 
rim with a light blue pen in the middle
so<00:00:45.719> unlike<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.559> regular<00:00:47.309> watches<00:00:48.090> lay<00:00:48.570> hours

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
so unlike the regular watches lay hours

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.369 
so unlike the regular watches lay hours
they<00:00:50.160> they<00:00:50.640> are<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> difference<00:00:51.329> from<00:00:52.050> from

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
they they are the difference from from

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.790 
they they are the difference from from
from<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.329> regular<00:00:54.329> 5600<00:00:55.050> lay<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.559> this

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
from the regular 5600 lay out like this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.599 
from the regular 5600 lay out like this
and<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.520> got<00:00:56.670> daytime<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.750> much<00:00:58.170> bigger<00:00:58.620> than

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
and they got daytime as much bigger than

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.479 
and they got daytime as much bigger than
then<00:01:00.239> those<00:01:01.129> we<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.270> other<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
then those we have on the other one and

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.690 
then those we have on the other one and
it<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.640> precise<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.600> further<00:01:06.930> before<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.710> for

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
it is precise for further before it for

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.429 
it is precise for further before it for
watch<00:01:08.970> itself<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.020> bezel<00:01:10.530> itself<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
watch itself like the bezel itself is a

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.060 
watch itself like the bezel itself is a
slightly<00:01:13.439> thicker<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.420> bigger<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:16.350> compared

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
slightly thicker and bigger so compared

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.999 
slightly thicker and bigger so compared
to<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.549> regular<00:01:18.090> 56<00:01:18.630> hundreds<00:01:18.990> they<00:01:19.170> because

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
to like regular 56 hundreds they because

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.999 
to like regular 56 hundreds they because
smaller<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.549> thinner<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:21.750> even<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> size<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
smaller and thinner so even the size the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.359 
smaller and thinner so even the size the
windows<00:01:23.490> everything's<00:01:24.920> difference<00:01:25.920> but

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
windows everything's difference but

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.210 
windows everything's difference but
compared<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> my<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.170> tough<00:01:28.350> soda<00:01:28.740> waste

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
compared to my this is tough soda waste

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.719 
compared to my this is tough soda waste
after<00:01:29.460> watch<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:31.170> looks<00:01:31.380> alike<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.979> think

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
after watch and it looks alike I think

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.969 
after watch and it looks alike I think
they're<00:01:33.270> interchangeable<00:01:33.689> person<00:01:34.530> they<00:01:34.799> can

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
they're interchangeable person they can

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.499 
they're interchangeable person they can
interchangeable<00:01:35.820> which<00:01:35.909> either<00:01:36.000> looks<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
interchangeable which either looks the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.999 
interchangeable which either looks the
same<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:38.030> comforted<00:01:39.030> 5600<00:01:39.750> state<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
same and comforted 5600 state this is a

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.069 
same and comforted 5600 state this is a
record<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.750> v600e<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.780> tell<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
record for v600e and you can tell the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.340 
record for v600e and you can tell the
difference<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.290> it's<00:01:49.290> pretty

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
difference on this one and it's pretty

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.609 
difference on this one and it's pretty
nice<00:01:49.649> essence<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.490> want<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:52.259> is

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
nice essence I just want you and this is

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.969 
nice essence I just want you and this is
a<00:01:52.829> collectible<00:01:53.490> items<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.930> still<00:01:55.799> have

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
a collectible items and and still have

a collectible items and and still have
some<00:01:56.250> around<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:56.909> my<00:01:57.299> washes<00:01:57.780> are<00:01:57.930> slightly

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
some around but my washes are slightly

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.980 
some around but my washes are slightly
different<00:01:58.619> from<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.219> other<00:01:59.399> one<00:01:59.640> because<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
different from the other one because the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.959 
different from the other one because the
one<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.200> saw<00:02:01.590> out<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:01.979> most<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.430> them<00:02:02.610> has<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
one I saw out that most of them has a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.350 
one I saw out that most of them has a
rubber<00:02:03.360> rubber<00:02:04.140> pen<00:02:04.939> just<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.240> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
rubber rubber pen just like this a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.749 
rubber rubber pen just like this a
rubber<00:02:06.990> band<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.129> one<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.550> clock<00:02:08.970> band

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
rubber band but this one is a clock band

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.050 
rubber band but this one is a clock band
and<00:02:09.909> this<00:02:10.300> one's<00:02:10.479> got<00:02:10.629> FIF<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:14.170> soccer

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.190 
associations depend the holder right
here<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.319> gots<00:02:20.799> a<00:02:20.920> different<00:02:22.049> versions<00:02:23.049> on

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
here so it gots a different versions on

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.990 
here so it gots a different versions on
this<00:02:23.409> one<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.830> this<00:02:24.280> one's<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.580> can<00:02:24.730> see<00:02:24.849> this

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
this one and this one's I can see this

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.940 
this one and this one's I can see this
rare<00:02:25.330> items<00:02:25.900> because<00:02:26.379> most<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.769> them<00:02:26.920> have

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
rare items because most of them have

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.619 
rare items because most of them have

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629
