00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
already a close team this year

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.070

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:59.580 

I<00:00:57.420> think<00:00:58.420> it's<00:00:58.510> important<00:00:58.900> to<00:00:59.170> go<00:00:59.290> to<00:00:59.350> camp

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
I think it's important to go to camp

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.170 
I think it's important to go to camp
because<00:01:00.120> every<00:01:01.120> team<00:01:01.420> needs<00:01:01.830> that<00:01:03.180> bonding

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
because every team needs that bonding

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.900 
because every team needs that bonding
experience<00:01:04.900> that<00:01:05.680> allows<00:01:06.250> them<00:01:06.580> to<00:01:06.790> come

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
experience that allows them to come

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.380 
experience that allows them to come
together<00:01:07.090> as<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.420> team<00:01:08.100> camp<00:01:09.100> really<00:01:09.490> does<00:01:09.729> help

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
together as a team camp really does help
