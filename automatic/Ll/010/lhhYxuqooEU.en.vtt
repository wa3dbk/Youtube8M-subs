this<00:02:09.300> consumed<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.899> lot<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.229> lund<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.739> takes<00:02:11.250> of

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
this consumed a lot of lund and takes of

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
that's behind the dumb so even some

so to conclude it's obviously just an

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
opinion whether it is a success to some

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.670 
opinion whether it is a success to some
people<00:05:51.940> are<00:05:52.030> not<00:05:52.240> some<00:05:52.840> food<00:05:53.050> people<00:05:53.440> find

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
people are not some food people find

people are not some food people find
that<00:05:53.770> it's<00:05:53.950> just<00:05:54.160> cause<00:05:54.340> worse<00:05:54.610> problems<00:05:55.120> has

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
that it's just cause worse problems has
