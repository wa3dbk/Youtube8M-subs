fans and the back for nothing could be
the<00:00:40.950> same<00:00:41.129> as<00:00:41.280> well<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.430> think<00:00:41.550> monkey

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the same as well I think monkey

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.569 
the same as well I think monkey
all-stars<00:00:42.480> at<00:00:42.660> right-back<00:00:42.980> Toure<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.309> scale

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
all-stars at right-back Toure and scale

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.310 
all-stars at right-back Toure and scale
obviously<00:00:45.090> partnered<00:00:45.510> centre-backs<00:00:45.960> again

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
obviously partnered centre-backs again

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.900 
obviously partnered centre-backs again
and<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.590> think<00:00:46.620> Johnson's<00:00:47.309> going<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> keep<00:00:47.730> his

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
and I think Johnson's going to keep his

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.360 
and I think Johnson's going to keep his
place<00:00:48.120> at<00:00:48.329> left-back<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:49.710> shall<00:00:49.950> shake

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
place at left-back but we shall shake

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.979

moving<00:00:50.700> into<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> midfield<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.390> think<00:00:51.570> Alan's

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
moving into the midfield I think Alan's

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.170 
moving into the midfield I think Alan's
going<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.350> come<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.730> partnered

going to come in and be partnered

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.880 
going to come in and be partnered

alongside Lucas Lucas obviously the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.260

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
deeper of the two and then I've got

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.360 
deeper of the two and then I've got
Henderson<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> right<00:00:58.379> hand<00:00:58.620> side<00:00:58.710> I've

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
Steven Gerrard obviously a huge decision

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.929
