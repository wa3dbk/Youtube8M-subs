00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.870
 the temperate forest is very variable in 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.430
 some places predominate the trees 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.590
 decided while in others the 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.780
 conifers are more common there are also 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.970
 mixed forests with coniferous trees 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.640
 broadleaf and evergreen waste 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.250
 wide-leaf flattened forests 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.630
 of pine tree I called generally 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.140
 found in the upper part of 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.140
 mountains 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.300
 Mexico is a center of diversity of both 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.300
 pine trees as neighbors with more than 50% of 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.790
 all pine species and more than 150 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.620
 species of signs of the planet in these 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.809
 forests inhabit a lot of 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.890
 species among which the bear stand out 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.329
 black the monarch butterfly among others 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.950
 these forests are complex 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.390
 structurally some of them 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.940
 they support a great diversity of species 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.559
 vegetables which in turn provides so many 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.030
 food resources as well as space 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.030
 for a great diversity of animals 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.150
 human populations are very high in 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.129
 this area because the soil is 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.080
 excellent for agriculture besides 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.450
 we must mention that the species of 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.760
 existing trees there are very valuable 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.260
 for the type of wood so these 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.630
 they were affected long before the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.460
 extensive agriculture many plants 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.080
 these areas were domesticated for 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.650
 food both in Europe and in the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.650
 near east 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.070
 the vegetation is predominantly 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.530
 arboreal although there are also shrubs and 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.690
 herbaceous plants these forests are 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.630
 composed mainly of Aragonese 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.280
 figs that discard their leaves each fall 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.280
 and developing a new complement 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.350
 every spring therefore they are very 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.410
 marked the seasonal changes in the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.750
 aspect of these forests as they become 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.230
 goes to the south appear more and more 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.060
 species of evergreen trees 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.090
 hojancha coniferous particularly 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.020
 Pines appear in many situations 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.210
 geographical specials for example where 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.820
 good are frequent in soils are 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.530
 poor the flat ones are more common than in 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.530
 other forests in the as example 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.020
 another important feature of 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.340
 temperate forest is the diversity of 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.980
 animal species 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.170
 the herbivores consumes herb fruits and 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.930
 berries and these serve as food to the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.480
 predators the fauna of all forests 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.010
 temperate of the world is very similar it 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.200
 more difference for being in a 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.940
 continent or others that by variety 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.370
 vegetable present in the forests 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.650
 temperate much of the fauna of 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.050
 these forests resort to hibernation and 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.480
 to migration the fauna of the forests 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.049
 tempered is abundant and varied a 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.600
 example of them are reptiles and rodents 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.640
 insects and worms that move the humus 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.120
 carnivorous herbivorous excavators and all 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:53.500
 class of birds so we find squirrels 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:57.580
 mole mice deer boars badgers 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.550
 lynx wolves weasel otters and you're 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.380
 the brown bear etcetera unlike the 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.190
 vegetation there is no kind of 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.900
 dominant 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.700
 the temperate forests are in 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.560
 an area of ​​warm summers and winters 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.900
 cold with precipitation frequently 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.150
 distributed throughout the year but in 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.470
 some areas snow is more seasonal 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.180
 It is common in the northern part of the area 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.819
 but then they do not come in mind in the 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.890
 extra 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.930
 the temperate forests are typical of 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.790
 the entire European continent the region 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.310
 eastern asia especially china and 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.989
 Japan and North America but also 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.400
 only temperate areas and 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.530
 temperate cold and south america 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.450
 within the temperate forests one of 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.480
 its divisions is the temperate forest 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.060
 deciduous is located in areas with climates 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.709
 softer than the coniferous forest and 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.840
 the tree species that make up the 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.209
 forest are very numerous 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.049
 there are oak trees next to chestnut trees 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.750
 hazelnuts arts elms etcetera these are 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.590
 the most frequent fauna is rich and 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.959
 varied 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.459
 there are many insects and animals that 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.409
 they feed on a large number of birds 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.840
 amphibians are also found 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.540
 reptiles and mammals are very 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.519
 abundant 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.989
 then this side of conifers more or 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.239
 minus contains the most amount of 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.099
 biomass the predominant species of 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.060
 trees are fir trees and cypresses 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.590
 larches and birches 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.480
 the type of fauna the forests of 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.650
 conifer is variable since it depends on 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.019
 the types of vegetation 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.610
 develops in the forest the birds that 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.650
 they inhabit the coniferous humid forests 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.840
 many animals of these types are very varied 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.480
 forests and true the forests only 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.280
 deciduous is very rich in them the 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.070
 temperate coniferous forests are 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.330
 find in asia europe north america 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.730
 southeastern area of ​​south america 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.200
 tasmania and new zealand there's only 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.919
 temperate coniferous forests in seven 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.919
 regions of the world
