that'll<00:03:20.440> pick<00:03:20.590> up<00:03:20.740> on<00:03:20.890> my<00:03:21.040> lighting<00:03:21.610> there

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
that'll pick up on my lighting there

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.420 
that'll pick up on my lighting there
it's<00:03:22.030> just<00:03:22.209> really<00:03:22.390> white<00:03:22.780> skin<00:03:23.400> which<00:03:24.400> is

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
it's just really white skin which is

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.449 
it's just really white skin which is
fitting<00:03:24.970> for<00:03:25.000> Punisher<00:03:25.660> but<00:03:26.160> it's<00:03:27.160> more<00:03:27.370> of

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
fitting for Punisher but it's more of

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.710 
fitting for Punisher but it's more of
just<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.730> plastic<00:03:27.970> look<00:03:28.769> didn't<00:03:29.769> I've<00:03:29.890> you<00:03:30.670> know

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
just a plastic look didn't I've you know

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.170 
just a plastic look didn't I've you know
actually<00:03:31.720> bigger<00:03:31.900> skin<00:03:32.260> telling<00:03:32.620> or<00:03:32.709> anything

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
actually bigger skin telling or anything

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.290 
actually bigger skin telling or anything
so<00:03:34.180> that<00:03:34.209> could<00:03:34.450> definitely<00:03:34.570> be<00:03:34.930> better<00:03:36.300> but

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
so that could definitely be better but

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.120 
so that could definitely be better but
it's<00:03:37.570> still<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.840> cool<00:03:38.050> figure<00:03:38.290> definitely

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
it's still a cool figure definitely

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.979 
it's still a cool figure definitely
