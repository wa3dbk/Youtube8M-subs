 or the clouds the indicators here 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.719
 sitting minecraft videos we're already 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.269

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.090

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:22.429
 that now you will see it right here and give it to 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.170
 favorites like to the video please that 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.570
 They are much brightens my day share 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.980
 with our friends addicted to the main after 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.109
 which raise will love them 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.789
 also learn to do that little bit of 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.980
 aica I will explain and of course I have 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.739
 seen by subscribing and good guys 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.750
 as in this episode no tutors of 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.570
 minecraft not of bell with his hand then he 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.760
 It teaches you how to make a bridge, no bar 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.190
 trap I do not elevate as you see there and 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.590
 well now let's see how they work and 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.149
 I explain it to you and then I show you the 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.219
 measures and how to levitate those things 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.469
 nice but good as you will see here 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.899
 a pressure does not play and what I say is 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.250
 imagine where I get an enemy and then 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.620
 this simply has to do is and is not 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.269
 it gives you time to cross it but 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.070
 When I come to your friend, I know that 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.360
 will fall not and it will burn then you have the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.850
 enough time to cross 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.500
 while lava is falling 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.280
 but the person who follows you or what you 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.020
 follow will not be able to survive like you and then 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.670
 you go out here and if you want to do it 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.500
 another way not so what we will have to 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.720
 to do is give you a button here and not 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.790
 we will have the same amount of time 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.990
 as you see here if you run and you will arrive 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.240
 here but the interesting thing is to do it 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.680
 from this side that is the coolest and 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.170
 good if you want to make the bridge 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.530
 permanent is not simply to put a 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.660
 lever and it's how it stays like this or it 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.730
 it's down but the cool thing about this is 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.170
 do it like that because if someone follows you 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.220
 making wait 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.220
 if someone follows you 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.090
 these eight guys or languages either 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.640
 the measures up then good guys already 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.159
 we have done here the square of nine 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.490
 blocks for ten blocks and good now 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.950
 we start doing cool things as 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.429
 well what I would do would be the first 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.509
 well first we put the gun that 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.909
 you can put whatever you want 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.190
 feel there is space not for all 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.360
 let's put like that you can also put 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.250
 the amount I want now I'm going to 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.250
 put more because I feel like 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.980
 so I think it's fine 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.739
 I will remove here in this row 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.659
 If we have this perfect three 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.340
 three the body we no longer remove it from 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.170
 as well above what we have to 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.989
 do when we are here is not that 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.030
 we will not need to see what I catch here 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.099
 other material forgive now I have 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.010
 here the perfect land then good 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.900
 we will need to make a hole below 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.620
 not to also reach the shoulder 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.629
 the pistons and it 's further in there 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.409
 let's say the middle row and we put 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.840
 and repeaters according and then 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.870
 what we will do 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.870
 but we have here guiding the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.730
 rest in these guiding remains worth 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.480
 and now what we have to do is to 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.480
 that the top ones arrive 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.480
 because it 's that if I'm not going to mess up a 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.670
 little with this girlfriend josie if you can 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.769
 use wool and I do not care 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.430
 is going to come from fucking good mother 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.319
 we put this like this 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.319
 and we put here more repeated 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.879
 I put the thing down there 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.769
 by taking a look now according 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.239
 we on track and taking good 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.370
 this here now what we have to do 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.170
 is to gather all this 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.290
 do this that we see here and repeat the 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.750
 same process, not because it's not down here, 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.890
 in theory it should already be going to 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.900
 suppose repeated also by the 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.830
 wiring that is individual since yes 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.180
 will not lose the current 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:55.400
 well let's see if it works 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.400
 is worth something happens with state here 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.810
 what is upside down in this 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.970
 Okay, so the kids are here 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.710
 you have your lift bridge 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:14.260
 not all are done at the same time but 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:16.090
 what the tutorial says as if the 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.700
 Quote is already your thing and good 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.630
 now you put the sand not here or not 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.470
 you put the stone forgiveness 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.850
 the stone the material that we say that 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.840
 you want that it sticks here you can then 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.100
 anything exclusive of that of the 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.630
 habano put wood because it goes to 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.670
 burn and it's going to be a disaster then 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.870
 you do your thing here I'm not in a 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.580
 no height but I imagine that the oil 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.470
 under the ground or somewhere 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.600
 strategic where we say that I can 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.670
 benefit in some way and nothing like 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.450
 you see here you already have this then you give him 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.310
 no and the stone goes up and the sand goes up and 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.440
 when it goes down like sand it has to 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.930
 to fall was to fall with the stone and now 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.460
 guys here you have put tudelan 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.130
 to put the base simply to do 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.860
 a style here of like this later when 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.870
 is so agreed jolin complicated that 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.210
 it's pussy now when it's up 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.880
 sand the lava does not come out but when I was 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.710
 down fall good guys like I said 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.180
 I hope this tutorial I love that 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.290
 I gave stable suggestions some 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.940
 subscribers and I thank you very much 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.890
 because sometimes I run out of 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.810
 ideas and you do not know what I've gone to 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.730
 you tell me that suggestions and 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.170
 things that you want that teach you because 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.550
 I had a fucking mother doing 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.650
 banner or things that I think someday 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.810
 could do in my own world and 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.660
 survival and nothing guys 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.090
 welcome everything a lot to see we take 4000 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.300
 soon to the audio next and until the 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.300
 view
