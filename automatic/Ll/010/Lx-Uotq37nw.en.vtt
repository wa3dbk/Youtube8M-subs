there<00:02:31.970> blarin<00:02:32.510> kind<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.350> work<00:02:33.799> around<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.370> to

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
there blarin kind of work around it to

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.710 
there blarin kind of work around it to
heat<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.790> up<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.180> then<00:02:36.010> using<00:02:37.010> some<00:02:37.040> pliers<00:02:37.720> we

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
heat it up and then using some pliers we

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.560 
heat it up and then using some pliers we
use<00:02:38.870> t<00:02:39.080> shrink<00:02:39.470> around<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:41.000> can<00:02:41.150> use<00:02:41.269> black

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
use t shrink around you can use black

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.590 
use t shrink around you can use black
tape<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.620> just<00:02:42.769> want<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.040> coat<00:02:43.250> them<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:43.760> then

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
tape you just want to coat them and then

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.449 
tape you just want to coat them and then
you<00:02:44.959> want<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.170> make<00:02:45.560> sure<00:02:45.590> you're<00:02:45.950> up<00:02:46.160> high

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
you want to make sure you're up high

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.280 
you want to make sure you're up high
enough<00:02:46.730> on<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.090> lens<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:47.660> your<00:02:47.870> players

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
enough on the lens so your players

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.440 
enough on the lens so your players
aren't<00:02:48.590> close<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.160> circuit<00:02:49.580> board<00:02:49.610> if

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
aren't close to the circuit board if

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.120 
aren't close to the circuit board if
you're<00:02:50.900> too<00:02:51.019> close<00:02:51.049> to<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.500> circuit<00:02:51.890> board

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
you're too close to the circuit board

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.050 
you're too close to the circuit board
you<00:02:52.400> can<00:02:53.209> notch<00:02:53.780> out<00:02:54.019> some<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.590> little

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
you can notch out some of the little

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.039 
you can notch out some of the little
circuitry<00:02:56.060> parts<00:02:56.959> on<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.720> you<00:02:59.780> want<00:02:59.989> to

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
circuitry parts on it so you want to

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.900 
circuitry parts on it so you want to
over-tighten<00:03:00.670> just<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.790> little<00:03:02.090> bit<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:03.910> then

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
over-tighten just a little bit and then

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.479 
over-tighten just a little bit and then
after<00:03:05.180> you've<00:03:05.269> over<00:03:05.570> tightened<00:03:05.989> it<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:07.310> want

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
after you've over tightened it you want

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.610 
after you've over tightened it you want
to<00:03:07.580> start<00:03:07.850> going<00:03:08.060> back<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:09.110> opposite<00:03:09.739> way<00:03:10.299> and

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
to start going back the opposite way and

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.020 
to start going back the opposite way and
it'll<00:03:12.620> take<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:12.950> little<00:03:13.190> bit<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.459> force<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.880> get

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
it'll take a little bit of force to get

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.300 
it'll take a little bit of force to get
it<00:03:14.209> out<00:03:14.360> because<00:03:15.140> of<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.470> glue<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:16.250> the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
it out because of the glue and the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.780 
it out because of the glue and the
threads<00:03:16.640> on<00:03:16.880> there<00:03:17.950> but<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:18.980> unthread<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.519> out

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
threads on there but you unthread it out

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.509 
threads on there but you unthread it out
and<00:03:20.060> notice<00:03:20.510> on<00:03:20.780> this<00:03:21.019> new<00:03:21.230> hero<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:22.160> shaft

and notice on this new hero to the shaft

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.840 
and notice on this new hero to the shaft
has<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.570> lip<00:03:24.019> on<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:25.160> threads<00:03:25.549> don't

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
has a lip on it and the threads don't

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.970 
has a lip on it and the threads don't
start<00:03:26.209> till<00:03:26.480> about<00:03:26.600> four<00:03:27.049> millimeters<00:03:27.350> down

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
start till about four millimeters down

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.340 
start till about four millimeters down
you<00:03:28.400> can<00:03:28.579> cut<00:03:28.760> this<00:03:28.940> lip<00:03:29.660> off<00:03:29.870> if<00:03:30.079> you<00:03:30.230> would

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
you can cut this lip off if you would

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.759 
you can cut this lip off if you would
like<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:31.060> this<00:03:32.060> will<00:03:32.239> actually<00:03:32.480> give<00:03:32.870> you<00:03:33.049> the

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
like and this will actually give you the

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.310 
like and this will actually give you the
ability<00:03:34.549> to<00:03:35.120> use<00:03:35.329> our<00:03:35.480> two<00:03:35.720> point<00:03:35.989> eight<00:03:36.140> to

so<00:03:41.840> now<00:03:42.049> to<00:03:42.980> install<00:03:43.430> your<00:03:43.579> new<00:03:43.820> lens<00:03:44.350> we<00:03:45.350> give

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
so now to install your new lens we give

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.409 
so now to install your new lens we give
you<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.680> rubber<00:03:45.980> band<00:03:46.250> gasket<00:03:46.880> depending<00:03:47.299> on

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
you a rubber band gasket depending on

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.170 
you a rubber band gasket depending on
what<00:03:47.600> lens<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:47.989> have<00:03:48.019> and<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:49.609> rubber<00:03:49.820> band

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
what lens you have and the rubber band

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.409 
what lens you have and the rubber band
what<00:03:50.930> it<00:03:51.049> does<00:03:51.230> is<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.650> creates<00:03:51.829> a<00:03:52.370> force<00:03:52.850> so

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
what it does is it creates a force so

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.539 
what it does is it creates a force so
when<00:03:53.600> you<00:03:53.690> thread<00:03:53.989> in<00:03:54.139> the<00:03:54.260> lens<00:03:54.530> then<00:03:55.400> it

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
when you thread in the lens then it

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.849 
when you thread in the lens then it
holds<00:03:55.669> it<00:03:55.940> nice<00:03:56.150> in<00:03:56.480> place<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:57.680> won't

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
holds it nice in place and it won't

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.830 
holds it nice in place and it won't
vibrate<00:03:58.130> out<00:03:58.639> of<00:03:58.790> focus<00:03:59.000> you<00:03:59.389> don't<00:03:59.600> have<00:03:59.720> to

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
vibrate out of focus you don't have to

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.240 
vibrate out of focus you don't have to
glue<00:04:00.049> it<00:04:00.169> back<00:04:00.199> in<00:04:00.970> so<00:04:02.709> now<00:04:03.709> when<00:04:03.859> we<00:04:03.889> put<00:04:04.130> the

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
glue it back in so now when we put the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.420 
glue it back in so now when we put the
lens<00:04:04.489> back<00:04:04.790> into<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.239> shaft<00:04:06.220> you're<00:04:07.220> going<00:04:07.340> to

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
lens back into the shaft you're going to

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.729 
lens back into the shaft you're going to
want<00:04:07.639> to<00:04:07.760> reverse<00:04:08.150> thread<00:04:08.630> it<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:09.049> little<00:04:09.470> bit

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
want to reverse thread it a little bit

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.349 
want to reverse thread it a little bit
to<00:04:09.949> make<00:04:10.100> sure<00:04:10.280> it<00:04:10.400> locks<00:04:10.549> down<00:04:10.880> into<00:04:11.239> those

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
to make sure it locks down into those

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.840 
to make sure it locks down into those
threads<00:04:11.980> don't<00:04:12.980> give<00:04:13.160> it<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.310> lot<00:04:13.459> of<00:04:13.579> force

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
threads don't give it a lot of force

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.060 
threads don't give it a lot of force
when<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.209> start<00:04:14.570> to<00:04:14.720> rethread<00:04:15.049> it<00:04:15.230> in<00:04:15.530> go<00:04:15.919> and

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.670 
when you start to rethread it in go and
clockwise<00:04:16.609> you<00:04:17.570> just<00:04:17.750> want<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.019> just<00:04:18.320> you<00:04:18.530> want

clockwise you just want to just you want

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.560 
clockwise you just want to just you want
to<00:04:18.709> make<00:04:18.859> sure<00:04:18.889> it's<00:04:19.190> going<00:04:19.489> in<00:04:19.639> straight<00:04:20.030> so

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
to make sure it's going in straight so

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.900 
to make sure it's going in straight so
you<00:04:20.660> don't<00:04:20.810> cross<00:04:21.049> thread<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:21.530> this<00:04:22.430> new<00:04:22.699> one

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
you don't cross thread it this new one

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.430 
you don't cross thread it this new one
is<00:04:23.090> designed<00:04:23.449> real<00:04:23.720> well<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.080> you<00:04:24.169> shouldn't
