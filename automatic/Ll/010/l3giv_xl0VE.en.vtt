00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.080
 and today I bring you 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.080
 hatsune miku remaining projects 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.080
 projective 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.760
 hatsune miku diva project 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:34.410
 the projective version is is a 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.440
 Adaptation of PCE PCPE Sorry the game 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.150
 psp adapted it to the despite the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.390
 computer so you could play 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.390
 here 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.510
 seeing him 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.510
 cousin believe that you can be armed down 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.990
 as a link that is written in the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.120
 game though good in short 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.950
 they will leave a file in the file 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.950
 real or distrust as they are 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:11.740
 ok they open it and inside this will be 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:14.170
 the in the the application so they can 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.080
 play what you ok but before 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.410
 show him how to play good from 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.290
 show them that yes they work forgiveness this 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.670
 good folder this folder originally 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.100
 the game simply comes with two 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.530
 songs that are these two these returns 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.750
 to this idea I put it to be downloaded 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.430
 okay 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.860
 so they can do the three songs 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.740
 they have to download it from a page that 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.750
 they will be left under the description ok 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.540
 because it makes us good because I do not have 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.160
 open in order 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.460
 and you are simply what you are going to do 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:51.200
 is to decompress the file they came in 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.000
 folders without internet of the whole file 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.980
 real just come to this folder and 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.440
 this folder is the only thing that they are going to 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.990
 extract here in are later because it is 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.950
 better so to the test 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.600
 we put you on the click 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.600
 and we wait for you to initiate us 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:20.200
 as it says and psp psp 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.530
 ok doubt 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.590
 is controlled with an intro and the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.040
 arrows to move well is summarized 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.640
 that the girls with the object and you 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.680
 they will find out the controls 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.580
 diet that does not give them much because 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.580
 I have many playing 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.790
 no no no no I do not know very well 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.319
 although it would not be very well we 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.319
 agreements the tests 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.190
 ilicitana 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.480
 God 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.480
 I'm good at this 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.560
 that which predispose norton there is a 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.560
 tree 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.610
 or good to my opinion they eat 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.050
 our products 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.720
 norton 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.580
 and centered because if they notice something something 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.920
 locked is because 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:25.280
 I have others I have the video editor 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.280
 open in the probate with infinite videos 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:33.360
 good and we stop ok that only 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.270
 When you click the stop button, the 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.520
 ok end 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.040
 well this has been everything you know here 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.080
 is this as they have it here what 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.450
 can create a shortcut and what 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.990
 You can put on your desk where 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.990
 you want 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.300
 I know him that way 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:03.019
 the race 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:08.940
 I usually use it in the whole folder 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:10.519
 I went then I invite you to spend my 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.290
 page between the psychological 1 point 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.290
 blogspot.com 2.3 mx point 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.169
 two
