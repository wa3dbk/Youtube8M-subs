00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello dear friends this is mine 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:10.500
 second video with sound first video was 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:15.480
 with with sound is the decor for your home 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.650
 peace I do not know there was a swing now I 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.650
 I will make it quieter 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:32.239
 there were swings were swings 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:39.030
 wardrobe then painful now I'll show you 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:41.790
 how to build a portal to the lower world and the portal 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.350
 in the end to build a portal to the bottom 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.770
 the world we need obsidian and flint 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.870
 immediately say if you already know these 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.809
 recipes are better than many look further 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.480
 it will be even more interesting to build 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.890
 portal in the end we need to go to 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.399
 decorative blocks 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.890
 and there will be a portal in the end and so for 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.280
 rental portal as you probably know for 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.470
 if newcomers there they are a portal to the end 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:17.009
 open the eye through the eye of ender 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.710
 further so i would like to say there is still 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.100
 skeleton drier here is his head skull 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.009
 the skeletons of the teacher we take there still 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.400
 just a desiccant I'll show you how 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.400
 it's done it's done like this 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.490
 still need to head but here he will not 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.630
 appear because I don't know the version 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.229
 their 152 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.590
 they don't appear for some reason they only 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.520
 appear in the lower world so let's get started 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.380
 for the construction of the lower world put 4 blocks 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.400
 obsidian and up are also four blocks and 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:03.540
 right side too 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:05.760
 on the sides and on top we still leave wrong 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:14.550
 so here is the will 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:18.630
 Now we take Flint We take Flint and Olya 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.310
 ready we go there we suffered 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.520
 to another world 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:29.410
 for beginners who do not play on the first day 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.630
 as if this is the lower world here everything 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.400
 lava 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:39.800
 here here is the quartz of the lower world 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:45.340
 podlagivaet little lag lag lag 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.340
 oh ooh ooh okay, okay 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.799
 so right now all the desk I find not in vain kim che 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:02.810
 right now I'll show you how to build 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:04.489
 take 2 blocks of sand shower on the left 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.879
 set and right 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.549
 we take the skull the skull ate the skeletons with 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:18.019
 teachers and be sure to put it this way 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:20.980
 here so here and so here that is something 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.980
 we can't do it 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.670
 put 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.360
 something they called 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.730
 then in 152 it is not called at all 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.280
 forgive me dear friends not worth it 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.069
 caused for beginners you probably wanted 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:05.300
 look well let's go to the ordinary world 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:08.060
 maybe we will try now in i 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:17.019
 I'll take the equipment then I will give you 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:17.019
 I will show it for this here 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:39.260
 this now try this not 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:44.030
 burning arrow we put 2 blocks on the left and 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:48.020
 on the right, no, I don't know 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:52.070
 why as i repeat to newbies 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.110
 I wanted to see well, sorry, I don't know 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.979
 why we are not called now 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.350
 build 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:05.090
 put the portal in 4 more precisely three blocks then 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:11.750
 not how the portal is built in the lower but necessary 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:16.330
 there break three blocks 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:19.249
 we get a hole down below 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.400
 but this is not necessarily a question not suddenly 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:28.370
 go and put the eye of ender everywhere 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:31.879
 and watch carefully it does not ignite 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.969
 now we take break where you want but 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:40.069
 to be in the corner tattoo tattoo tattoo tattoo 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:45.620
 tattoo tattoo is put or mulberries break 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:52.479
 wala again we suffered dragon ender 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.479
 and where is this dragon here it is dragon and 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:06:00.289
 if you play creativity better 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:07.789
 destroy these things here because 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:11.900
 he uses them to restore lives 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:14.089
 I advise you to destroy them because 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:20.419
 if he destroy them he will 

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:23.810
 replenish life well the next series we 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:26.599
 we will win it and see what later 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.189
 will be when we win it all bye
