worthy<00:05:18.650> of<00:05:18.860> its<00:05:19.100> use<00:05:19.340> and<00:05:19.610> of<00:05:20.000> course<00:05:20.210> if<00:05:20.330> you

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
worthy of its use and of course if you

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.240 
worthy of its use and of course if you
look<00:05:20.630> on<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:20.840> back<00:05:20.960> here<00:05:21.020> it's<00:05:21.740> going<00:05:22.010> to<00:05:22.100> have

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
look on the back here it's going to have

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.010 
look on the back here it's going to have
the<00:05:22.790> mud<00:05:23.000> flaps<00:05:23.300> that<00:05:23.450> are<00:05:23.600> showing<00:05:23.900> their

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
the mud flaps that are showing their

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.320 
the mud flaps that are showing their
showing<00:05:24.350> often<00:05:25.010> on<00:05:25.250> the<00:05:25.730> back<00:05:25.880> of<00:05:25.910> these<00:05:26.120> mud

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
showing often on the back of these mud

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.090 
showing often on the back of these mud
flaps<00:05:26.660> and<00:05:26.990> it<00:05:27.470> just<00:05:27.590> kind<00:05:27.800> of<00:05:27.860> gives<00:05:27.980> a

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
flaps and it just kind of gives a

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.310 
flaps and it just kind of gives a
realistic<00:05:28.670> tone<00:05:28.880> to<00:05:29.150> it<00:05:29.180> of<00:05:29.870> course<00:05:30.110> like<00:05:30.230> I

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
realistic tone to it of course like I

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.340 
realistic tone to it of course like I
