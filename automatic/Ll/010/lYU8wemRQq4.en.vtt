with iPad tuned we've made advances in
both<00:00:09.670> form<00:00:10.030> and<00:00:10.150> function<00:00:10.620> there<00:00:11.620> is<00:00:11.710> so

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
both form and function there is so

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.199 
both form and function there is so

orientation and in full 1080p we've done

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.570 
orientation and in full 1080p we've done
things<00:04:23.330> with<00:04:23.630> his<00:04:23.750> ipad<00:04:23.930> that<00:04:24.680> we<00:04:24.800> never<00:04:25.250> could

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
things with his ipad that we never could

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.180 
things with his ipad that we never could
have<00:04:25.640> done<00:04:25.820> before<00:04:26.169> it's<00:04:27.169> because<00:04:27.470> there's<00:04:28.100> a

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
have done before it's because there's a

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.080 
have done before it's because there's a
lot<00:04:28.220> of<00:04:28.430> new<00:04:28.789> innovation<00:04:29.450> driving<00:04:30.669> it<00:04:31.669> starts

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
lot of new innovation driving it starts

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.330 
lot of new innovation driving it starts
with<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.419> new<00:04:32.600> dual-core<00:04:33.140> a5<00:04:33.200> chip<00:04:34.010> that's

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
with the new dual-core a5 chip that's

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.370 
with the new dual-core a5 chip that's
added<00:04:34.789> a<00:04:34.850> lot<00:04:35.030> more<00:04:35.090> speed<00:04:35.570> two<00:04:35.810> things<00:04:36.020> you<00:04:36.200> do

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
added a lot more speed two things you do

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.830 
added a lot more speed two things you do
every<00:04:36.410> day<00:04:36.680> like<00:04:37.340> surfing<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.970> web<00:04:38.150> sending

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
every day like surfing the web sending

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.770 
every day like surfing the web sending

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
email and multitasking in fact it's up

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.230 
email and multitasking in fact it's up
to<00:04:41.900> twice<00:04:42.110> as<00:04:42.350> fast<00:04:42.530> but<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.640> place<00:04:43.880> with<00:04:44.090> me

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
to twice as fast but the place with me

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.120 
to twice as fast but the place with me
the<00:04:44.390> biggest<00:04:44.660> jump<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:45.289> with<00:04:45.590> graphics

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
the biggest jump is with graphics

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.010 
the biggest jump is with graphics
there's<00:04:46.640> performance<00:04:47.270> that's<00:04:47.479> up<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.750> nine

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
there's performance that's up to nine

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.920 
there's performance that's up to nine
times<00:04:48.380> faster<00:04:48.970> you'll<00:04:49.970> really<00:04:50.330> notice<00:04:50.630> this

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
times faster you'll really notice this

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.220 
times faster you'll really notice this
in<00:04:51.140> games<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:51.830> apps<00:04:52.160> that<00:04:52.400> use<00:04:52.550> a<00:04:52.580> lot<00:04:52.850> of

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
in games and apps that use a lot of

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.800 
in games and apps that use a lot of
and<00:04:53.410> for<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:54.490> first<00:04:54.700> time<00:04:55.000> we've<00:04:55.450> built<00:04:55.690> a

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
and for the first time we've built a

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.440 
and for the first time we've built a
gyro<00:04:56.260> in<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.560> design<00:04:56.920> pad<00:04:57.220> that<00:04:58.030> gives<00:04:58.330> you

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
gyro in the design pad that gives you

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.660 
gyro in the design pad that gives you
very<00:04:58.780> precise<00:04:59.230> control<00:04:59.800> in<00:05:00.040> multiple

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
very precise control in multiple

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.970 
very precise control in multiple
dimensions<00:05:00.820> and<00:05:01.480> it<00:05:01.750> allows<00:05:02.020> us<00:05:02.260> to<00:05:02.680> really

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
dimensions and it allows us to really

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.340 
dimensions and it allows us to really
measure<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.760> orientation<00:05:04.540> of<00:05:04.630> the<00:05:04.690> iPad<00:05:05.200> in

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
measure the orientation of the iPad in

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.130 
measure the orientation of the iPad in
space<00:05:05.940> these<00:05:06.940> new<00:05:07.210> components<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:07.960> features

add<00:05:08.620> all<00:05:09.130> kinds<00:05:09.160> of<00:05:09.610> possibilities<00:05:09.780> when<00:05:10.780> it

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
add all kinds of possibilities when it

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.350 
add all kinds of possibilities when it
comes<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.290> apps<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:11.800> even<00:05:12.670> though<00:05:12.760> we<00:05:12.940> boosted

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
comes to apps and even though we boosted

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.300 
comes to apps and even though we boosted
the<00:05:13.480> performance<00:05:14.050> we<00:05:14.320> haven't<00:05:14.740> compromised

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
the performance we haven't compromised

on battery life the new ipad still gets

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.370 
on battery life the new ipad still gets
a<00:05:18.280> full<00:05:18.520> 10<00:05:18.790> hours<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:19.750> that's<00:05:19.930> a<00:05:20.080> major

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
a full 10 hours and that's a major

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.950 
a full 10 hours and that's a major

the<00:05:36.669> original<00:05:37.209> iPad<00:05:37.709> defined<00:05:38.709> a<00:05:38.919> category<00:05:39.519> and

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:39.819 
the original iPad defined a category and

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:42.359 
the original iPad defined a category and

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:42.369 
I think that I peg tube will really

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:47.950 
I think that I peg tube will really
define<00:05:42.789> a<00:05:42.819> category<00:05:43.539> three<00:05:43.809> years<00:05:44.080> to<00:05:44.289> come
