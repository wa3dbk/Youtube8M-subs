way but I think you get a bit more few

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.520 
way but I think you get a bit more few
points<00:02:49.910> for<00:02:50.090> naps<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:53.420> also<00:02:53.750> want<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.230> share

points for naps you also want to share
energy<00:02:54.770> ten<00:02:55.490> times<00:02:56.410> from<00:02:57.410> that's<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.800> maximum

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
energy ten times from that's the maximum

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.180 
energy ten times from that's the maximum
it<00:02:58.880> gives<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.360> more<00:02:59.570> fuel<00:02:59.840> points<00:03:00.290> as<00:03:00.410> well
