00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.800
 all right 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.469
 today its forest clan landscape is great 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.270
 elite welcome to the web review 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.980
 and if they have not realized they are 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.869
 about customs because you do not 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.000
 channel channel I will start to upload 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.710
 all the videos that come out and are new 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.300
 over here well welcome those videos 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.680
 to demonstrate skills but so that 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.840
 see how the weapon works in the hands of 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.310
 an average wimpy like I am and 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.830
 you can also give a little love and 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.170
 lean that button I like and about 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.030
 all share favorites are the 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.800
 I would appreciate infinitely also have 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.280
 the annotations on the bottom 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.899
 left there those purple performances 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.969
 they serve to jump to different parts 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.980
 of the video I recommend them so that 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.719
 go to the part of greatest interest or 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.850
 can see the full video that is what 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.710
 I would highly recommend if you do not have 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.329
 nothing to say in the comments 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.519
 neither leave without comment can 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.530
 comment with the word chocolate and 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.379
 well, let's take a look at the history of 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.019
 weapon that is the vp the universal machine 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.899
 ratatouille is a weapon made by white in 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.299
 the country of germany since 1999 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.610
 and it's for a pretty submachine gun 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:11.470
 powerful with a point 40 smith and wesson 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.810
 in this version or vp 45 little in 1.45 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.940
 that makes it even more powerful and with greater 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.580
 power of impact the rate of shots 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.370
 of 650 however it is not very fast but 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.780
 the power makes up for it in this 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.250
 uncomfortable sub machine gun is 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.490
 practically exactly that in life 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.560
 The same is true a gun lock 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.170
 the rank of sergeant and has the ammunition 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.120
 of 35 bullets in the magazine by 105 bullets 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.010
 in the reserve what makes it one of the 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.560
 sub machine guns that are based on 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.990
 cartridge because for example the app 19 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.729
 It has a much larger cartridge but 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.560
 it is not a cartridge as such but it is a 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.390
 barrel was a price of 4,165 dgp for 7 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.619
 days and other prices can see them 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.360
 on screen in the other statistics 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.300
 we will also see them in detail 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.160
 little later the damage 37 makes it a 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.619
 of submachine guns with greater damage 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.930
 in the game obviously has already been 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.640
 surpassed by other weapons of nx by 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.270
 example but as for heads of the 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.340
 stronger guns firing so they 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.020
 many people who like the damage more than 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.370
 the speed may prefer your 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.400
 machine gun at the time of choosing 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.920
 a portability of 75 is enough 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.980
 fast but it's not as fast as by 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.950
 example a crisis for example a 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.530
 scorpion for example street 79 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.930
 pretty fast for a weapon in general 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.740
 rather faster than for example 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.750
 say an ak-47 even but obviously 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.569
 is slower than say another 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.959
 scorpion time for example a p 90 is 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.640
 much faster this is like the 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.569
 combination of an assault rifle 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.910
 and a sub-machine gun that is to say for 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.940
 who seek harm more than cadence 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.739
 shot the precision of 67 many believe 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.540
 that this weapon when firing slow have 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.510
 a lot of damage is very accurate but it is not 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.700
 actually this weapon even though that 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.220
 has that damage of 37 that is a death 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.350
 of four shots practically always if 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.380
 is not that if not sometimes a 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.300
 little bit more precision is not so 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.760
 good so neither should it be used 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.470
 in greater than average distance if they see 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.030
 someone in the middle distance could 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.670
 kill him but obviously it's not the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.340
 territory already of this sub machine gun 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.620
 kick kick the weapon is 73 points 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.709
 that while it does not look like much really 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.540
 yes it's pretty good enough in the 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.090
 how it moves as one would say 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.730
 that you have at least 70 more 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.709
 less than kick the gun but it's 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.260
 pretty controllable by controllable me 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.989
 I mean that this weapon is easy to 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.720
 manage to stay in your position in 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.519
 point to where you want and also you 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.799
 can help find some headsets 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.250
 something something like so lucky 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:57.350
 was when to give the neck to the chest and 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.910
 suddenly to headshot well let's continue 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.769
 forward that can help you 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.570
 recoil so it's not so bad in the 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.400
 meaning buildings that can be 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.209
 make this weapon are the following 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.710
 charger suppressor and look is exactly 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.810
 all 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.420
 the suppressor is well recommended since 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.890
 it's a strategy that many who 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.960
 have taken a long time to buy 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.750
 they have used us with this weapon they do not 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.240
 essential for to be super 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.730
 machine gun but you can try it is not 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.770
 so bad the combination when talking 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.880
 of the charger is extremely 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.130
 recommended a charger 2 because although 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.890
 the recharge is a little slow and 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.020
 slow I mean still quite slow is 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.820
 good since it gives you 15 extra bullets what 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.560
 gives you the same capacity as a penalty 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.920
 sale of 50 bullets 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.660
 maybe 50 bullets with a year 37 is deadly 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.060
 It is a machine of a bubble pen if 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.950
 They know how to aim perfectly the sight 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.600
 recommended since you should not use this 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.240
 long distance weapon and everything that is 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.490
 in half a short distance it is easier 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.050
 aim from the hip mode 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.850
 shot that has me only 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.390
 automatic and it will give you a 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.720
 rating of 4 out of 4 if 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.070
 it is definitely more a 4 with 3 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.290
 definitely it's the classic weapons 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.540
 of gp that can be used in combat 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.160
 melee maybe if they like a 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.930
 little speed cadence 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.370
 but it's not a weapon for you but if 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.350
 they like the damage and they know how to aim 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.380
 quite well is one of the best 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.930
 weapons that can make your investment in 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.310
 short range maps so some 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.680
 advice that this weapon would give you is 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.270
 jump like crazy bitches on one side 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.550
 towards the other that they do not give them the 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.260
 shooting at you the fact that 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.170
 can move so easily with this 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.330
 gun makes it possible to aim at the head 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.100
 and be moving and the enemy does not 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.540
 can see so easily however 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.430
 as the firing rate is not so 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.110
 great as in other submachine guns 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.600
 maybe they can not waste so 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.830
 easily the bullets since failing two or 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.990
 three bullets means that by 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.540
 they can probably be dead with 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.300
 this weapon and good up to here the review 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.490
 of the vp if you liked the review by 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.290
 please give me I like to share the video 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.000
 above all and subscribe so that it does not 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.860
 lose any new video when it comes out
