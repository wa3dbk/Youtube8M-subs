pull<00:02:49.140> both<00:02:49.350> capsules<00:02:49.800> out<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.100> way<00:02:51.290> Fahd<00:02:52.290> boy

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
pull both capsules out that way Fahd boy

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.400 
pull both capsules out that way Fahd boy
which<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:53.910> also<00:02:54.180> add<00:02:54.570> mass<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.170> if<00:02:55.320> you

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
which you can also add mass to if you

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.870 
which you can also add mass to if you
want<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.650> make<00:02:55.739> them<00:02:55.860> really<00:02:56.070> heavy<00:02:56.310> helps<00:02:56.790> to

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
want to make them really heavy helps to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.729 
want to make them really heavy helps to
trim<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.239> mass<00:02:57.390> down<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.660> little<00:02:57.930> bit<00:02:58.079> but<00:02:58.620> you

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
trim the mass down a little bit but you

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.140 
trim the mass down a little bit but you
can<00:02:58.860> add<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> stewpot<00:02:59.549> boy<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.940> could<00:03:00.060> have

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
can add a stewpot boy you could have

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.030 
can add a stewpot boy you could have
mass<00:03:00.299> to<00:03:00.510> these<00:03:00.660> too<00:03:00.930> although<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.620> capsules

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
mass to these too although the capsules

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.530 
mass to these too although the capsules
are<00:03:02.160> pretty<00:03:02.310> heavy<00:03:02.489> themselves<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.329> it<00:03:03.390> has<00:03:03.510> a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
are pretty heavy themselves so it has a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.080 
are pretty heavy themselves so it has a
really<00:03:03.870> good<00:03:04.019> weight<00:03:04.280> pod<00:03:05.280> way<00:03:05.519> of<00:03:05.610> course<00:03:05.850> our

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
really good weight pod way of course our

be set the reason by the way that I

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.330 
be set the reason by the way that I
don't<00:03:48.130> recommend<00:03:48.880> using<00:03:49.830> modified<00:03:50.830> crystal

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
don't recommend using modified crystal

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.460

case<00:03:51.550> with<00:03:52.060> nothing<00:03:52.480> on<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.690> end<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:53.440> you

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
case with nothing on the end so you

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.680 
case with nothing on the end so you
always<00:03:53.740> have<00:03:53.980> something<00:03:54.940> on<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.300> end<00:03:55.450> is

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
always have something on the end is

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.110 
always have something on the end is
because<00:03:56.170> in<00:03:56.440> order<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.830> charge<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.940> have

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
because in order to charge it you have

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.760 
because in order to charge it you have
to<00:03:58.270> be<00:03:58.360> able<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.600> pull<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.990> capsule<00:03:59.230> out<00:03:59.560> of

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
to be able to pull the capsule out of

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.020 
to be able to pull the capsule out of
there<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:02.460> can<00:04:03.460> actually<00:04:03.640> be<00:04:03.820> pretty

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
there and that can actually be pretty

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.510 
there and that can actually be pretty
hard<00:04:04.300> to<00:04:04.390> do<00:04:04.540> it<00:04:04.660> especially<00:04:04.900> when<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.200> fresh

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
hard to do it especially when the fresh

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.290 
hard to do it especially when the fresh
looks<00:04:06.520> like<00:04:06.670> right<00:04:06.850> now<00:04:07.000> it's<00:04:07.150> actually

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
looks like right now it's actually

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.520 
looks like right now it's actually
catching<00:04:07.870> on<00:04:08.020> the<00:04:08.200> leash<00:04:08.970> attachment<00:04:10.530> so

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
catching on the leash attachment so

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.700 
catching on the leash attachment so
those<00:04:12.250> are<00:04:12.400> like<00:04:12.430> brand<00:04:12.760> new<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.540> need<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.620> do

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
those are like brand new you need to do

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.539 
those are like brand new you need to do
that<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:15.010> access<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.520> charging<00:04:15.910> jack<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.360> if

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
that to access the charging jack and if

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:25.410 
that to access the charging jack and if
the<00:04:18.549> crystal<00:04:19.030> goes<00:04:19.720> all<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.080> way<00:04:20.230> down<00:04:24.420> you've

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
the crystal goes all the way down you've

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.970 
the crystal goes all the way down you've
got<00:04:25.570> nothing<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:25.930> grab<00:04:26.170> there's<00:04:26.590> no<00:04:26.770> way<00:04:26.920> to

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
got nothing to grab there's no way to

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.940 
got nothing to grab there's no way to
like<00:04:27.370> get<00:04:28.030> it<00:04:28.150> out<00:04:28.270> it's<00:04:28.600> really<00:04:28.810> difficult<00:04:29.290> so

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
like get it out it's really difficult so

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.660 
like get it out it's really difficult so
that's<00:04:30.370> why<00:04:30.550> that<00:04:31.230> rig<00:04:32.230> is<00:04:32.530> not<00:04:33.070> a<00:04:33.100> thing

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
that's why that rig is not a thing

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.500 
that's why that rig is not a thing
this<00:04:34.030> however<00:04:34.270> is<00:04:34.510> and<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:36.040> this<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:37.210> its

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
this however is and so is this and its

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.380 
this however is and so is this and its
really<00:04:37.600> nice<00:04:38.170> I'm<00:04:38.470> really<00:04:38.680> fond<00:04:38.890> of<00:04:39.010> this<00:04:39.100> rig

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
really nice I'm really fond of this rig

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.980 
really nice I'm really fond of this rig
