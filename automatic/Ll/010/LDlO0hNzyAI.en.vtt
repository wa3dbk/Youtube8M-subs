poorly animated and just terrible story
it's<00:03:30.640> taken<00:03:30.940> in<00:03:31.030> weird<00:03:31.390> directions<00:03:31.420> but<00:03:32.410> this

one<00:03:32.770> I<00:03:32.800> think<00:03:32.860> is<00:03:33.280> certainly<00:03:33.490> the<00:03:33.850> exception

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
one I think is certainly the exception

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.960 
one I think is certainly the exception
and<00:03:34.540> that<00:03:34.600> is<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.650> lion<00:03:35.980> came<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.580> Simba's

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970
