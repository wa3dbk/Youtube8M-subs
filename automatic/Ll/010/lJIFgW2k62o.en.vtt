00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.109
 at this time from now explain 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:10.049
 how one of the many 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.389
 Evenings we know how to do tonight 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.500
 let's make a papaya jam or 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.500
 orange and pineapple 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:31.850
 the three fruits we put in this one 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.450
 in this life and then we put the 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.510
 amount of sugar that 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.899
 what is necessary 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.699
 after this we have to be moving 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.559
 moving the conscience so that it does not 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.300
 hit for therefore also also 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.879
 we have to see a suitable container 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.239
 which is you can see with one of these as 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:53.239
 those stainless steel and we have to go 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.190
 waiting until it gives the consistency 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.710
 adequate but we have to be all the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.930
 movement time so that we are not 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:06.110
 paste and control them from the moment of this one 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:10.039
 after this after this 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.649
 we boil the jars to 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.690
 be able to consider the time that you 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.140
 they do and it does not work 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.520
 I have bottles that last us one year 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.520
 when they are 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.439
 when they are done properly 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:37.910
 we can make the delay for example that 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:42.520
 we can do with cherry 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.510
 another of which we can do mango 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:51.400
 Apple 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:54.260
 video other than papaya we have amount of 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.320
 we can do 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.630
 in leaving my intention is to do these 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.030
 products because they are completely 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.270
 natural my products do not have 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.910
 absolutely no chemicals including 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.350
 we can make jams that for 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.770
 people who have diabetes 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.660
 all we have is the duration in 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.660
 this product is not greater 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.260
 then this product we have to in the 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.510
 container that product your glories a lot 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.390
 less time too for example 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.780
 our jams so they have for 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.050
 example standing we decided to beat 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.050
 with 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.680
 yes 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.090
 amount of desserts for all 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.650
 then this product serves 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.060
 for all the people who really 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.060
 like to feel 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.350
 we love we love the kitchen 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.930
 is what I can start you saying 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.930
 this moment about our 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.930
 jams
