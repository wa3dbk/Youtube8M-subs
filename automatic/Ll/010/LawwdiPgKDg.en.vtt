Watchtower<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.430> very<00:00:47.820> important<00:00:48.329> for<00:00:48.390> this

Watchtower is very important for this
map<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.719> believe<00:00:49.020> because<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.440> gives<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
map I believe because it gives you the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.170 
map I believe because it gives you the
view<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.340> pretty<00:00:50.610> much<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> center<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
view of pretty much the center of the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.650 
view of pretty much the center of the
map<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.100> most<00:00:53.100> likely<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.550> mass<00:00:54.149> we're<00:00:54.360> moving

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
back will be able to clean this up I

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.380 
back will be able to clean this up I
believe<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:50.030> GG<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.630> is<00:02:50.750> called<00:02:51.380> by<00:02:51.500> mass<00:02:52.390> so

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
believe and GG it is called by mass so

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.570 
believe and GG it is called by mass so
yeah<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.959> was<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> pretty<00:02:54.950> interesting<00:02:55.190> game

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
yeah that was a pretty interesting game

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.530 
yeah that was a pretty interesting game
it<00:02:55.850> was<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.360> was<00:02:56.450> pretty<00:02:56.630> fast<00:02:58.390> basically<00:02:59.390> that

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
it was it was pretty fast basically that

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.190 
it was it was pretty fast basically that
I<00:02:59.690> think<00:02:59.900> when<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.350> came<00:03:00.769> down<00:03:00.799> to<00:03:01.930> mask<00:03:02.930> here

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
I think when it came down to mask here

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.830 
I think when it came down to mask here
loading<00:03:03.560> his<00:03:03.709> throw<00:03:04.100> twice<00:03:04.730> actually<00:03:05.120> so

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
loading his throw twice actually so

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.180 
loading his throw twice actually so
that's<00:03:06.079> you<00:03:06.500> know<00:03:06.530> that's<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:07.010> lot<00:03:07.160> of

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
that's you know that's a lot of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.380 
that's you know that's a lot of

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
resources wasted and you know eventually

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.479
