find a party for 12 new things and say

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.230

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
he gets more people and I think that

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.519 
he gets more people and I think that
they've<00:00:22.830> been<00:00:22.980> doing<00:00:23.279> things<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:24.420> win<00:00:24.630> now<00:00:24.840> and

that's<00:00:27.330> what<00:00:27.539> probably<00:00:28.050> captivated<00:00:28.740> me<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
that's what probably captivated me the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.500
