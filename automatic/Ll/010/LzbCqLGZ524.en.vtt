another<00:00:07.140> video<00:00:07.500> for<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:07.890> talking<00:00:08.429> about<00:00:08.610> how

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
another video for you talking about how

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.549 
another video for you talking about how
to<00:00:08.849> pick<00:00:09.120> out<00:00:09.240> longboard<00:00:09.870> wheels<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.320> kind<00:00:10.500> of

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
to pick out longboard wheels and kind of

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.530 
to pick out longboard wheels and kind of
the<00:00:10.620> differences<00:00:10.980> between<00:00:11.160> them<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.240> yes

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
the differences between them so I yes

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.629 
the differences between them so I yes
get<00:00:12.780> started<00:00:13.139> first<00:00:13.500> one<00:00:13.740> we<00:00:14.160> want<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.460> show

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
get started first one we want to show

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.519 
get started first one we want to show
you<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.059> really<00:00:15.660> nice<00:00:15.870> basic<00:00:16.139> one<00:00:16.379> from

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
you is a really nice basic one from

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.250 
you is a really nice basic one from
sector<00:00:16.740> 9<00:00:17.010> great<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:17.970> just<00:00:18.090> cruising<00:00:18.630> carving

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
sector 9 great for just cruising carving

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.920 
sector 9 great for just cruising carving
it's<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> really<00:00:20.490> soft<00:00:20.699> wheel<00:00:21.000> softer<00:00:21.510> urethane

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
it's a really soft wheel softer urethane

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.620 
it's a really soft wheel softer urethane
so<00:00:22.789> it'll<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.880> great<00:00:24.029> for<00:00:24.240> just<00:00:24.420> gripping

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
so it'll be great for just gripping

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.380 
so it'll be great for just gripping
hugging<00:00:25.140> turns<00:00:25.350> all<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.740> good<00:00:25.859> stuff<00:00:26.099> so

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
hugging turns all that good stuff so

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.450 
hugging turns all that good stuff so
yeah<00:00:27.390> 75<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> durometer<00:00:29.099> that's<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
yeah 75 a is the durometer that's the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.110 
yeah 75 a is the durometer that's the
hardness<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> softer<00:00:30.960> side

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
hardness and so it's on the softer side

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.610 
hardness and so it's on the softer side
so<00:00:33.120> yeah<00:00:33.270> next<00:00:33.510> up<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:33.899> wanted<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.230> go<00:00:34.350> into

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
so yeah next up we wanted to go into

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.040 
so yeah next up we wanted to go into
more<00:00:34.860> slide<00:00:35.460> specific<00:00:35.910> wheels<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.510> these<00:00:36.719> are

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
more slide specific wheels so these are

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.200 
more slide specific wheels so these are
the<00:00:37.410> orangutan<00:00:37.950> Baloo's<00:00:38.340> they're<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> new

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the orangutan Baloo's they're a new

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.170 
the orangutan Baloo's they're a new
wheel<00:00:39.420> from<00:00:39.660> orangutan<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:40.950> got<00:00:41.129> in

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
wheel from orangutan that we just got in

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.369 
wheel from orangutan that we just got in
the<00:00:42.180> big<00:00:42.329> thing<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.930> these<00:00:43.170> are

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the big thing here is that these are

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.420 
the big thing here is that these are
actually<00:00:43.760> pre<00:00:44.760> broken<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.210> urethane<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.440> what

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
actually pre broken in urethane so what

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.830 
actually pre broken in urethane so what
that<00:00:47.520> does<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.789> allows<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.450> initiate<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that does is allows you to initiate a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.209 
that does is allows you to initiate a
slide<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> lot<00:00:49.410> easier<00:00:49.739> because<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.190> don't

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
slide a lot easier because you don't

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.220 
slide a lot easier because you don't
have<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.550> fight<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.940> new<00:00:51.149> urethane<00:00:51.629> when

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
have to fight that new urethane when

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.709 
have to fight that new urethane when
you're<00:00:52.350> trying<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.649> start<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
you're trying to start it and then the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.970 
you're trying to start it and then the
other<00:00:54.870> slide<00:00:55.140> wheel<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.469> wanted<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> show<00:00:55.920> you

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
other slide wheel we wanted to show you

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.700 
other slide wheel we wanted to show you
is<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.879> zombie<00:00:57.090> hogs<00:00:57.420> really<00:00:58.140> similar<00:00:58.350> wheel

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
is the zombie hogs really similar wheel

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.170 
is the zombie hogs really similar wheel
the<00:00:58.980> big<00:00:59.160> difference<00:00:59.309> we<00:00:59.579> wanted<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> get<00:00:59.969> into

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the big difference we wanted to get into

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.529 
the big difference we wanted to get into
is<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.750> these<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.739> side<00:01:02.129> set<00:01:02.539> bearing

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
is that these have a side set bearing

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.690 
is that these have a side set bearing
mount<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.710> Baloo's<00:01:05.040> actually<00:01:05.580> our

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
mount and then the Baloo's actually our

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.580 
mount and then the Baloo's actually our
Center<00:01:06.060> set<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> bearings<00:01:07.110> mount<00:01:07.320> right

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
Center set so the bearings mount right

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.160 
Center set so the bearings mount right
in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> middle<00:01:08.210> big<00:01:09.210> difference<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.659> these

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
in the middle big difference there these

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.080 
in the middle big difference there these
do<00:01:10.590> add<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:11.070> bit<00:01:11.189> more<00:01:11.220> grip<00:01:11.580> if<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.820> do

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
do add a little bit more grip if you do

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.760 
do add a little bit more grip if you do
want<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.450> little<00:01:12.780> bit<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.930> carve<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.439> well<00:01:13.619> as

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
want a little bit of carve as well as

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.190 
want a little bit of carve as well as
slide<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:14.700> these<00:01:14.880> ones<00:01:15.210> are<00:01:15.509> really

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
slide and then these ones are really

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.990 
slide and then these ones are really
long<00:01:16.500> lasting<00:01:16.950> because<00:01:17.400> once<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.729> starts

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
long lasting because once it starts

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.570 
long lasting because once it starts
coning<00:01:18.479> from<00:01:18.960> multiple<00:01:19.619> uses<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.460> can

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
coning from multiple uses you can

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.950 
coning from multiple uses you can
actually<00:01:20.700> flip<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> wheel<00:01:21.210> over<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.750> almost

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
actually flip the wheel over it's almost

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.179 
actually flip the wheel over it's almost
like<00:01:22.140> having<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.470> whole<00:01:22.560> new<00:01:22.740> set<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:22.979> wheels

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
like having a whole new set of wheels

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.070 
like having a whole new set of wheels
you<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:23.729> wreak<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.330> them<00:01:24.540> from<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> other<00:01:24.900> way

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
you can wreak on them from the other way

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.289 
you can wreak on them from the other way
so<00:01:25.650> definitely<00:01:26.040> nice<00:01:26.159> wheels<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:26.700> sliding<00:01:27.000> be

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
so definitely nice wheels for sliding be

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.410 
so definitely nice wheels for sliding be
sure<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.540> check<00:01:27.750> them<00:01:27.869> out<00:01:28.820> next<00:01:29.820> shape<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
sure to check them out next shape and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.370 
sure to check them out next shape and
style<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:30.990> want<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.259> get<00:01:31.380> into<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.670> more

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
style we want to get into is the more

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.960 
style we want to get into is the more
more<00:01:34.380> carving<00:01:34.950> more<00:01:35.159> downhill<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.640> lot<00:01:35.820> more

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
more carving more downhill a lot more

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.010 
more carving more downhill a lot more
grippy<00:01:36.360> wheel<00:01:37.850> big<00:01:38.850> difference<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
grippy wheel big difference here is the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.749 
grippy wheel big difference here is the
shape<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:40.979> remember<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.310> these<00:01:41.430> ones

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
shape so if you remember in these ones

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.789 
shape so if you remember in these ones
they're<00:01:41.970> very<00:01:42.150> rounded<00:01:42.630> off<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.290> edges<00:01:43.500> here

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
they're very rounded off the edges here

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.310 
they're very rounded off the edges here
so<00:01:43.979> with<00:01:44.850> these<00:01:45.030> wheels<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.990> get<00:01:46.200> that

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
so with these wheels you get that

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.870 
so with these wheels you get that
squared<00:01:46.710> off<00:01:46.860> edge<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.640> lot<00:01:47.850> of

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
squared off edge so you get a lot of

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.840 
squared off edge so you get a lot of
grip<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.450> lot<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> lot<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.189> control<00:01:50.579> out<00:01:50.610> of

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
grip a lot of a lot of control out of

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.910 
grip a lot of a lot of control out of
these<00:01:50.970> because<00:01:51.450> when<00:01:52.200> you're<00:01:52.320> turning<00:01:52.560> it'll

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
these because when you're turning it'll

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.069 
these because when you're turning it'll
actually<00:01:53.040> compress<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.970> dig<00:01:54.570> into<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.869> road

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
actually compress and dig into the road

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.899 
actually compress and dig into the road
a<00:01:55.320> little<00:01:55.740> more<00:01:55.890> one<00:01:56.219> more<00:01:56.250> grip<00:01:56.579> there

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
a little more one more grip there

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.539 
a little more one more grip there
so<00:01:57.659> difference<00:01:58.560> too<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.920> these<00:01:59.070> are<00:01:59.310> just

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
so difference too is these are just

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.679 
so difference too is these are just
standard<00:01:59.729> urethane<00:02:00.240> they're<00:02:00.360> not<00:02:00.509> pretty

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
standard urethane they're not pretty

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.539 
standard urethane they're not pretty
broken<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.500> add<00:02:01.710> extra<00:02:02.159> grip<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.520> well

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
broken in so you add extra grip as well

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.550 
broken in so you add extra grip as well
and<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.540> between<00:02:04.079> these<00:02:04.229> two<00:02:04.409> wheels

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
and then between these two wheels

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.440 
and then between these two wheels
specifically<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.939> going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
specifically this one is going to be the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.600 
specifically this one is going to be the
center<00:02:06.719> set<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.560> one's<00:02:07.799> also<00:02:07.979> side<00:02:08.310> set

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
center set and this one's also side set

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.760 
center set and this one's also side set
so<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.239> can<00:02:09.720> get<00:02:09.869> into<00:02:10.020> some<00:02:10.050> sliding<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
so you can get into some sliding and

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.890 
so you can get into some sliding and
also<00:02:11.310> these<00:02:11.550> are<00:02:11.610> flippable<00:02:12.030> then<00:02:12.540> these<00:02:12.690> have

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
also these are flippable then these have

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.559 
also these are flippable then these have
that

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
that

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.890 
that
your<00:02:13.719> little<00:02:13.870> grip<00:02:14.109> on<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.349> edges<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
your little grip on the edges and the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.080 
your little grip on the edges and the
final<00:02:17.230> one<00:02:17.319> we<00:02:17.409> wanted<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.739> talk<00:02:17.980> about<00:02:18.090> nice

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090
