00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.160
 warning the next video with your 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.689
 information regarding movement 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.049
 physical that requires supervision of the 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.049
 person 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.310
 hello and welcome to this tutorial in the 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.550
 which will teach you how to make a going down 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.609
 fritz or also called flag ok we're going to 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.769
 begin this trick is to perform 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.870
 a mortal back or back link but 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.240
 supporting our hands 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.380
 it's a movement that will not be difficult if 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.080
 at least they have a good 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.630
 elasticity in the back and know how to do 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.250
 patriarchy although they are also going to 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.400
 need a little effort in your 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.140
 arms at the beginning practice your account 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.780
 so that you have more flexibility in 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.210
 your back then do it again but 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.250
 in this way doubling you little by little 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.559
 back until your hands touch 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.100
 the ground and try to go from taking out a 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.510
 foot so I have a notion of this 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.190
 requires great flexibility but if 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.230
 you can do it then you should not have 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.800
 problems to triple 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.170
 remember to stretch your wrists and back 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.470
 whenever they are going to do a back and 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.470
 sweet 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.420
 one of them is assistance 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.900
 but leading to explain 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.400
 I had to learn the solos 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.400
 you feel ways that I'm going to show you 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.350
 performs like a macaque or wheels with 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.680
 hands backwards throwing you sideways or 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.090
 crooked that gives you more confidence up 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.670
 that little by little I lower it interesting 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.799
 [Music] 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.979
 and the other progression is with the back 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.130
 raised little by little look on the ground 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.200
 with hands but not knowing so much 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.250
 upwards but most of all towards 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.770
 back is to say without jumping a lot little to 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.030
 little we are practicing it until what 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.030
 completely clean 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.410
 ok the technique is starting from the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.540
 initial of three courses we press 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.280
 knees trunk 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.879
 and in that moment we lost our balance 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.920
 backwards a 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.920
 jump with backward arching 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.500
 the arms and we will support them at the level of 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.550
 the shoulders 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.690
 with only seven points flexing the 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.270
 knees 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.440
 an important point to always look at 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.780
 my hands 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.200
 ok I'm reviewing everything looked this 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.200
 way 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:03:07.140
 [Music] 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.750
 although this was all for today if you 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.609
 liked the video subscribe to share it and 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.609
 dalila and see you
