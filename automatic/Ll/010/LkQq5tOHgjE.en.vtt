00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.819 

it's<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.590> shame<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.010> guy<00:01:01.100> who<00:01:01.160> built<00:01:01.460> this<00:01:01.610> dies

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
it's a shame the guy who built this dies

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.680 
it's a shame the guy who built this dies
one<00:01:03.829> year<00:01:04.010> before<00:01:04.190> it<00:01:04.460> was<00:01:04.519> finished<00:01:04.699> and<00:01:05.510> that

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
one year before it was finished and that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:16.130 
one year before it was finished and that
would<00:01:05.810> really<00:01:06.049> suck

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.680 

you<00:01:16.620> never<00:01:16.830> really<00:01:17.220> get<00:01:17.370> to<00:01:17.430> experience<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
you never really get to experience the

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.000 
you never really get to experience the
locations<00:01:19.200> whether<00:01:19.320> you've<00:01:19.470> jumped<00:01:19.740> all<00:01:19.979> over

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
locations whether you've jumped all over

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:31.460 
locations whether you've jumped all over
it<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:26.960> find<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.110> very<00:01:28.909> very<00:01:29.909> fulfilling<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.810> see

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
it I find it very very fulfilling to see

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.719 
it I find it very very fulfilling to see
here<00:01:32.300> not<00:01:33.300> just<00:01:33.860> not<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.160> architecture

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
here not just not just the architecture

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.830 
here not just not just the architecture
with<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.910> people<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.360> boost<00:01:39.690> of

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
with the people you get that boost of

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.260 
with the people you get that boost of
energy<00:01:42.950> as<00:01:43.950> soon<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.310> they<00:01:44.490> start<00:01:44.790> moving<00:01:44.940> I

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
energy as soon as they start moving I

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.580 
energy as soon as they start moving I
start<00:01:45.570> thinking<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.170> I've<00:01:46.290> become<00:01:46.560> a

start thinking and I've become a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
start thinking and I've become a
different<00:01:46.770> person<00:01:46.950> when<00:01:47.310> there's<00:01:47.490> more

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
different person when there's more
