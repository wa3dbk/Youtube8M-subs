 Home is a pretty quick at times sometimes its a little too slow 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.519

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.160
 the sound is also very good I found I can not compare at all 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
 actually with the x10 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.890
 It does not have the device with a mobile on and design 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.929
 whatever was in the back to see the impression 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.000
 a 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.919

 many throws them very well 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.869
 in the meantime, the future becomes 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.929
