00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.700
 ever spent what I do 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.210
 sometimes the mods come 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.000
 tablets what I do is 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.070
 unzip them for an easier say 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.050
 I 'm going to get married 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.310
 but for the moment to install only the 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:15.430
 time lapse we select it 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.430
 and we move here will accept 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.250
 has added as you can see there 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.810
 r tells me it is the same here 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.220
 we close from close and go to 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.540
 tear 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.540
 open our mantra 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.610
 we wait for now 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.590
 we wait for ready face here what we are going 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.190
 to do is create a new profile we give 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:52.540
 the new profile 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:55.180
 I do not know if 365 are good and here what 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.710
 let's do is choose the version of 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.320
 the folder and in the files that 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.980
 we place then in our way 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:07.020
 in this case of diego 120 65 we give 16 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.020
 profile play at the end 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.280
 and we hope that now the game 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.530
 we wait for now 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.110
 we finish in a player 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.830
 we open the world that is a world because 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.020
 previously created 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.870
 here we hope so that the 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.430
 pound there is this 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.180

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.180

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.810

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.380
 as you can see 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.480
 on the left side, good on the upper side 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.150
 right of the screen is the mount 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.670
 installed 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.459

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.220
 the modes can be the same of it 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.670
 shape is only replaced by the folder 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.670

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.930
