 hello you are tired of the world of 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.730
 batteries of the connection breaks of the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.350
 fingers that click in the wrong place 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.240
 to do this we believed the mobile 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.550
 claj a laptop with an autonomy of 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.710
 almost 24 hours he picks up the option 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.040
 fringes and in all the countries of the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.020
 world 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.880
 it has a screen that allows you not to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.230
 support a little by for the small sum 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.449
 from 3500 euros 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:31.080
 this laptop will change the way you 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:32.969
 play offshore clash and so beauvois 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.290
