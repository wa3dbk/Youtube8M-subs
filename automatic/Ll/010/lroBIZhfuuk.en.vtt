00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.380
 alaska latina in today's video I'm going 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.200
 to teach a better makeup that I've 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.660
 recently bought I think it's something that 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.850
 things that you are going to like and they are super 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.010
 well of price and that you will beat the 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.590
 Sure penalty can start by the store 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.230
 to make up since I hope the 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.689
 you know a lot this store has 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.090
 delighted because from that to three 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.280
 thousand lost the order has brought me two 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.440
 small gifts you know he said that 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.040
 it's fine the best this store has 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.460
 is that you bring things if you live in the 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.059
 peninsula 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.760
 in Spain after super mega things 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.949
 fast in a day of bring it I am going to 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.199
 leave all the links with the full price 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.850
 and all the information below is worth 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.120
 to start with what has least 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.180
 liked that is this mica makeup 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.129
 pro evolution is the ivory tone 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.830
 the truth is that it leaves a lot that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.380
 wish you think it's going to be mate is not 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.980
 mate, you think you're throwing 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.880
 Water 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.490
 as a day chau 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 I do not understand what was wrong is that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.060
 for example I have cast and that the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.670
 housing get me in half because 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.770
 for now he sucks for half then what 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.659
 I tried with the brush that we 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.610
 struggle must be given as there also 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.670
 putting in the suck and nothing approves 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.170
 with my hands and I'm going 18 a damage 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.229
 tremendous because I started doing that 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.899
 well and the cheese was beginning to crack and 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.590
 as it has come out small groups and I know what is 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.950
 happening here or not and not what 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.950
 I get it 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.599
 the only thing that is to run away from 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.670
 house and does not have the makeup there and of 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:59.159
 starmedia where the kitchen well so 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.289
 have the cargo canacar here and then 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.490
 color yes that is the truth that the saint 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.149
 of the makeup that has calculation 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.579
 this lipstick is from the mica brand 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.649
 revolution the number of those who do not 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:14.990
 It is this color that this is like a 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.330
 Little Rosso is as such 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.520
 but the truth is that it started that we 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.130
 we have killed and that one pass was going to 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.310
 see and is that you see almost nothing or be 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.670
 to give you color and such is fine but not 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.620
 it's super powerful so crisis sites 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.980
 milk and if it is with lipstick is worth 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.070
 the second brand of lipstick is that of 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.200
 jean and the truth is that I wanted a 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.410
 dark color like the one I 've put 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.430
 is that it does not look like anything 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.590
 yes i am perpignan t 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.810
 just like it's like bike shine like 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.159
 Shine and lip gloss is not 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.549
 glitter but that is like singing the 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:01.129
 lips does not do anything else is not given 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.400
 a brightness on the colored lips no longer 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.170
 kill them and super colorful or anything this 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.480
 is number two the last thing that does not 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.879
 I liked this lipstick 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.489
 of extension I expected it from another 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:18.769
 you see it like that and this does not look like that 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:21.829
 paints but I'm not like that 90 of a 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.810
 last super mate and super good I do not know 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.220
 and apart you see it as mate and it does not reach 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.220
 be mate of everything 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:37.240
 it would be more alive more fuchsia this 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.030
 this is the purple 11 what has 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.810
 past that I like this proofreader has 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:49.440
 delighted to really wear it and 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:54.130
 I flip is the tone 10 matter 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:59.470
 and it's from essence is super good 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:02.050
 I really do not have anything of 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.240
 it's true mate mate that you throw it 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.400
 civil and it looks pretty good to see is not 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.330
 of the best but for the price that 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.330
 have please 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:21.610
 I really like this lipstick from the 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:25.240
 brand milan and this the 163 matters was going and 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:28.480
 I loved this lover look what 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.780
 color is gorgeous is super fuchsia 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.720
 if you want to give color or life to your 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.150
 lips or highlighting them is the best lipstick 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.670
 this color is really beautiful in 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.230
 Seriously it locks up for girls who dream if 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.510
 we're skinny and it's all 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.860
 you know the brand of wotan white and woman 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:50.689
 this range I do not know if you know that the tones 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.559
 they are always similar to those of others 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:56.179
 to say the same and paint super mattes 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:59.119
 all right 

00:04:56.179 --> 00:05:01.579
 is that they are I love precious strands 

00:04:59.119 --> 00:05:04.489
 is the one that will be worn with one pass 

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:06.829
 it happens all the color I do not know is not that it is 

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:09.169
 really lovely you this color one 

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:12.319
 of the place with fairy 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.870
 what you see is super we see a man 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:15.950
 you see it here so dark but it was so 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.920
 Dark 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.800
 that is, it gives place is super nice 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.930
 I do not know, I think we do 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.250
 dark can try and the truth is that 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.830
 I liked it a lot 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.330
 the only package of the cap go go 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.950
 to pass 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.350
 with all the makeup that I bought 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:37.700
 in this market you can see me 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:41.390
 previous I picked up number 4 from landline and 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:43.010
 cover of deliplus and why not 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.900
 I found the sane we are going to be 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.960
 sincere and now is that there was not 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.040
 sections are no longer dark, but yes 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.890
 it's true that for people it's very 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.310
 little stone is not enough 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:58.550
 tones for them today I bought the 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.170
 0-2 and the truth is that there is not much 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.490
 difference in tone is rather the 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.990
 color one is more pink and others more like 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.540
 brownish orange is not known is that 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.070

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.260

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.900
 I'm going to teach this one that is 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.220
