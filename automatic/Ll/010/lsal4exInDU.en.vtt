00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
vehicle but to me it's more like a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.540 
vehicle but to me it's more like a
utility<00:00:54.660> slash<00:00:54.899> heavy<00:00:55.170> duty<00:00:55.469> vehicle<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.070> but

moment you can't really see why us
that's<00:02:37.630> one<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.080> annoying<00:02:38.500> things<00:02:38.760> yeah

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
that's one of the annoying things yeah

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.320 
that's one of the annoying things yeah
we'll<00:02:39.910> just<00:02:39.940> keep<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.300> white<00:02:40.510> for<00:02:40.540> now<00:02:40.900> and

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
we'll just keep it white for now and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.140 
we'll just keep it white for now and
respray<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.600> for<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.380> main<00:02:44.680> color<00:02:45.150> we're

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
respray so for the main color we're

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.750 
respray so for the main color we're
gonna<00:02:46.300> keep<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.980> black<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.250> then<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.489> per

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
lesson we're gonna try oh well there's

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.490 
lesson we're gonna try oh well there's
some<00:02:52.510> corporate<00:02:52.900> lessons<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.170> can<00:02:53.230> do<00:02:53.380> with

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
some corporate lessons you can do with

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.979 
some corporate lessons you can do with
bright<00:02:53.830> colors<00:02:54.250> but<00:02:55.060> for<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.540> I'm<00:02:55.930> just

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
bright colors but for this I'm just

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.310 
bright colors but for this I'm just
gonna<00:02:56.230> go<00:02:56.380> with<00:02:56.560> ice<00:02:56.950> why<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.730> then<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:57.940> think

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
gonna go with ice why and then I think

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.180 
gonna go with ice why and then I think
secondary<00:02:59.320> color<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.620> can<00:02:59.680> either<00:02:59.980> have<00:03:00.160> it

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
secondary color I can either have it

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.640 
secondary color I can either have it
chrome<00:03:00.760> but<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:01.630> think<00:03:01.840> Chrome's<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.290> little<00:03:02.470> too

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
chrome but I think Chrome's a little too

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.830 
chrome but I think Chrome's a little too
much<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.190> if<00:03:03.520> there's<00:03:03.730> one<00:03:03.910> color<00:03:04.209> I'm

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
much and if there's one color I'm

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.290 
much and if there's one color I'm
actually<00:03:05.050> really<00:03:05.440> enjoying<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:06.100> look<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.550> its

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300

just brings a bit of variety into the

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.020 
just brings a bit of variety into the
into<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.890> gaming<00:04:50.100> as<00:04:50.460> you<00:04:50.640> can<00:04:50.730> see<00:04:50.850> in<00:04:50.970> the

industrial<00:04:52.860> vehicle<00:04:53.670> but<00:04:54.420> I<00:04:54.450> think<00:04:54.990> in<00:04:55.320> races

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
industrial vehicle but I think in races

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.880 
industrial vehicle but I think in races
its<00:04:56.550> off-road<00:04:57.090> obviously<00:04:57.750> in<00:04:57.990> races<00:04:58.710> there's

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
its off-road obviously in races there's

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.150 
its off-road obviously in races there's
no<00:04:59.010> actual<00:04:59.220> industrial<00:05:00.030> category<00:05:00.870> so<00:05:01.650> there

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
no actual industrial category so there

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.590 
no actual industrial category so there
we<00:05:02.250> go<00:05:02.280> we're<00:05:02.550> taking<00:05:02.790> it<00:05:02.850> back<00:05:02.880> into<00:05:03.150> our<00:05:03.270> guys

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
we go we're taking it back into our guys
