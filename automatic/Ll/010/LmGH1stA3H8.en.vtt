and this must be a map monster thing
that's<00:01:44.889> going<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.069> go<00:01:45.189> and<00:01:45.340> rip<00:01:45.520> through

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
that's going to go and rip through

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.879 
that's going to go and rip through
everything<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.200> know<00:01:47.319> some<00:01:47.529> people<00:01:47.560> said

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
everything so I know some people said

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:50.039 
everything so I know some people said
that<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.130> little<00:01:48.520> bad<00:01:49.149> part<00:01:49.539> of<00:01:49.599> the<00:01:49.689> student<00:01:49.990> is

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
that a little bad part of the student is

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.319 
that a little bad part of the student is
that<00:01:50.170> it's<00:01:50.409> a<00:01:50.529> rare<00:01:50.770> choice<00:01:51.099> but<00:01:51.729> really<00:01:52.149> I

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
that it's a rare choice but really I

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:53.819 
that it's a rare choice but really I
can't<00:01:52.599> see<00:01:52.779> people<00:01:53.020> taking<00:01:53.229> more<00:01:53.499> than<00:01:53.529> two

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
can't see people taking more than two

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.019 
can't see people taking more than two
units<00:01:54.159> of<00:01:54.219> these<00:01:54.369> anyway<00:01:54.669> I<00:01:54.700> think<00:01:54.939> it's

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:55.029 
units of these anyway I think it's

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:57.120 
units of these anyway I think it's
really<00:01:55.209> just<00:01:55.299> going<00:01:55.479> to<00:01:55.539> be<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:56.139> one<00:01:56.409> big<00:01:56.740> unit

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
really just going to be the one big unit

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.499 
really just going to be the one big unit
there<00:01:57.340> might<00:01:57.459> be<00:01:57.490> some<00:01:57.849> people<00:01:58.029> without<00:01:58.240> out

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
there might be some people without out

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.330 
there might be some people without out
there<00:01:58.719> that<00:01:58.869> do<00:01:58.959> the<00:01:59.079> two<00:01:59.289> units<00:01:59.649> of<00:01:59.859> four<00:02:00.130> or

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
there that do the two units of four or

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.389 
there that do the two units of four or
something<00:02:00.490> or<00:02:01.419> three<00:02:01.779> but<00:02:02.259> really<00:02:02.709> I<00:02:02.950> really

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
something or three but really I really

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.550 
something or three but really I really
think<00:02:03.609> in<00:02:04.419> the<00:02:04.539> competitive<00:02:05.049> setting<00:02:05.380> it's

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
think in the competitive setting it's

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.010 
think in the competitive setting it's
giving<00:02:05.950> me<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.069> big<00:02:06.459> unit<00:02:06.880> maybe<00:02:07.719> as<00:02:07.989> a

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
giving me the big unit maybe as a

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.809 
giving me the big unit maybe as a
flanker<00:02:08.590> you'd<00:02:08.709> have<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:08.890> small<00:02:09.190> unit<00:02:09.459> but<00:02:09.489> you

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
flanker you'd have a small unit but you

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.400 
flanker you'd have a small unit but you
know<00:02:10.060> your<00:02:10.420> main<00:02:10.660> ones<00:02:10.869> going<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.080> be<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.230> big

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410

/<00:02:59.349> only<00:02:59.860> overrun<00:03:00.280> d<00:03:00.549> 6<00:03:00.880> or<00:03:01.030> whatever<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.390> is<00:03:01.450> but

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
/ only overrun d 6 or whatever it is but

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.680 
/ only overrun d 6 or whatever it is but
it's<00:03:02.709> just<00:03:03.010> kind<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.370> ridiculous<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.660> I

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
it's just kind of ridiculous and so I

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.180 
it's just kind of ridiculous and so I
mean<00:03:04.989> with<00:03:05.140> these<00:03:05.319> guys<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.560> can't<00:03:05.860> do<00:03:06.010> that

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
mean with these guys you can't do that

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.039 
mean with these guys you can't do that
with<00:03:06.400> demi<00:03:06.760> graphs<00:03:07.180> worth<00:03:07.480> more<00:03:07.720> on<00:03:07.810> Fang

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
with demi graphs worth more on Fang

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.449 
with demi graphs worth more on Fang
they're<00:03:08.530> going<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.739> go<00:03:08.890> in<00:03:09.010> there<00:03:09.130> kill

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
they're going to go in there kill

whatever<00:03:09.640> they<00:03:09.880> want<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.329> then<00:03:10.690> reform<00:03:11.200> is

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
whatever they want and then reform is

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.140 
whatever they want and then reform is

they<00:03:13.599> won't<00:03:13.840> be<00:03:13.989> able<00:03:14.079> to<00:03:14.319> do<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.190> mean

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
they won't be able to do that so I mean

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.949 
they won't be able to do that so I mean
for<00:03:15.940> people<00:03:15.970> that<00:03:16.239> are<00:03:16.329> really<00:03:16.569> worried<00:03:16.870> about

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
for people that are really worried about

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.259 
for people that are really worried about
this<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.769> easy<00:03:18.040> thing<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.459> do<00:03:18.640> is<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:19.030> mean<00:03:19.180> not

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
this the easy thing to do is I mean not

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.580 
this the easy thing to do is I mean not
only<00:03:19.329> should<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.750> maybe<00:03:19.989> be<00:03:20.170> adding<00:03:20.470> in<00:03:20.560> the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
only should you maybe be adding in the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.229 
only should you maybe be adding in the
war<00:03:20.860> machines<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:21.459> stuff<00:03:21.610> like<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:21.819> to<00:03:22.000> take

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
war machines and stuff like that to take

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.539 
war machines and stuff like that to take
them<00:03:22.480> out<00:03:22.630> but<00:03:23.260> also<00:03:23.590> just<00:03:23.920> make<00:03:24.280> sure<00:03:24.459> you

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
them out but also just make sure you

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.309 
them out but also just make sure you
have<00:03:24.700> those<00:03:24.819> throwaway<00:03:25.180> units<00:03:25.599> right<00:03:25.780> put

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
have those throwaway units right put

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.960 
have those throwaway units right put
them<00:03:26.500> up<00:03:26.620> put<00:03:26.859> them<00:03:26.889> on<00:03:27.100> an<00:03:27.190> angle<00:03:27.549> something

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
them up put them on an angle something

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.390 
them up put them on an angle something
ready<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.239> flank<00:03:28.480> done<00:03:29.049> I'm<00:03:29.500> sure<00:03:29.980> they'll<00:03:30.190> be

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
ready to flank done I'm sure they'll be

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.979 
ready to flank done I'm sure they'll be
the<00:03:30.639> little<00:03:30.790> juggle<00:03:31.239> role<00:03:31.480> they're<00:03:31.810> gonna

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
the little juggle role they're gonna

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.690 
the little juggle role they're gonna
have<00:03:32.200> their<00:03:32.230> own<00:03:32.350> Warhounds<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.430> you're

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
have their own Warhounds and you're

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.009 
have their own Warhounds and you're
going<00:03:33.819> to<00:03:33.880> have<00:03:34.000> like<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.180> little<00:03:34.389> dance<00:03:34.720> of

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
going to have like a little dance of

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.809 
going to have like a little dance of
redirecting<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.829> all<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.100> stuff<00:03:36.250> but

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
redirecting and all this stuff but

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.090 
redirecting and all this stuff but
really<00:03:37.209> for<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.079> most<00:03:38.230> case<00:03:38.530> I<00:03:38.709> think<00:03:38.739> that

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
really for the most case I think that

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.979 
really for the most case I think that
you<00:03:39.220> definitely<00:03:39.459> have<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.569> ace<00:03:40.720> up<00:03:40.959> your

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
you definitely have the the ace up your

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.110 
you definitely have the the ace up your
own<00:03:41.260> sleeve<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:41.829> have<00:03:42.040> power<00:03:42.370> so<00:03:42.940> there

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
own sleeve and you have power so there

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.550 
own sleeve and you have power so there
you<00:03:43.150> have<00:03:43.269> it<00:03:43.420> that's<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.109> new<00:03:44.200> skull

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
you have it that's the new skull

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.860 
you have it that's the new skull
crushers<00:03:45.069> coming<00:03:46.030> out<00:03:46.150> there<00:03:46.450> probably<00:03:46.660> have

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
crushers coming out there probably have

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.020 
crushers coming out there probably have
a<00:03:46.930> big<00:03:47.109> impact<00:03:47.290> but<00:03:48.100> really<00:03:48.459> they<00:03:48.639> also<00:03:48.790> have<00:03:48.940> a

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
a big impact but really they also have a

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.970 
a big impact but really they also have a
huge<00:03:49.389> drawback<00:03:49.690> so<00:03:50.170> I<00:03:50.200> don't<00:03:50.590> think<00:03:50.769> they're

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
huge drawback so I don't think they're

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.160 
huge drawback so I don't think they're
gonna<00:03:51.040> ever<00:03:51.280> be<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.940> upper<00:03:52.209> echelons<00:03:52.389> other

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
gonna ever be the upper echelons other

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.930 
gonna ever be the upper echelons other
than<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.769> time<00:03:54.010> where<00:03:54.190> they<00:03:54.280> catch<00:03:54.519> somebody

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
than the time where they catch somebody

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.330 
than the time where they catch somebody
unaware<00:03:55.389> and<00:03:55.660> just<00:03:56.049> go<00:03:56.440> and<00:03:56.560> cross<00:03:56.859> them<00:03:57.069> and

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
unaware and just go and cross them and

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.400 
unaware and just go and cross them and
there<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:57.970> go<00:03:58.000> but<00:03:58.480> there<00:03:59.170> you<00:03:59.260> have<00:03:59.290> it

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410
