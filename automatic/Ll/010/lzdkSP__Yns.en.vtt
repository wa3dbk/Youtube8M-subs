00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.960
 Accompaniment for a multitude of dishes 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.220

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.290
 nutritious and with fewer calories than if 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.419
 the brake today we are going to make them in the oven 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.760
 with a little bit of paprika a recipe 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.070
 whole life so when cooking has been 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.520
 said we will need olive oil 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.430
 paprika sweet pepper and a potato 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.540
 medium well washed for each diner 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.400
 make sure you take all the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.309
 society because we are going to cook them with 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.320
 the included skin we will start departing 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.750
 cut them in half and making cuts in the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.610
 meat vertically and diagonally to 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.480
 that penetrates well the heat of the furnace and 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.480
 the condiments 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.000
 we will place them in a baking tray 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.070
 and we will cover them first with the paprika 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.869
 sweet you can also use smoked or 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.960
 spicy but always of quality because 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.010
 if not bitter then with pepper to taste 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.380
 and finally with salt 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.210
 with a kitchen brush or with your fingers 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.950
 if you do not have this utensil as joe 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.810
 We will be making the condiments 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.610
 penetrate well in the cuts of the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.140
 potatoes so that the juice of these 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.140
 mix with them to the fullest 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.440
 ah 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.630
 for so much 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.910
 we bathe it with a little oil of 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.430
 olive and we put them in the oven that will be 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.070
 between 200 and 230 degrees centigrade 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.210
 for about 30 or 45 minutes or until 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.640
 those of ais well golden and juicy 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.409
 and then we would only have to place the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.820
 we would have our potatoes ready 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.619
 well to eat them alone with a 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.540
 little bit of aioli or as an accompaniment 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.729
 of infinite dishes with meat 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.070
 combine great for example with a 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.840
 meatball in mustard sauce that will be 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.119
