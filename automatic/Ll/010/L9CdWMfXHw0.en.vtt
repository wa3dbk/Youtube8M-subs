the<00:00:25.230> reason<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.590> like<00:00:25.710> showing<00:00:25.950> kv-5<00:00:26.640> replays

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
the reason I like showing kv-5 replays

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.960 
the reason I like showing kv-5 replays
is<00:00:27.420> because<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.349> own<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.740> tank<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.490> never

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
is because I own this tank and I never

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.510 
is because I own this tank and I never
really<00:00:30.420> was<00:00:31.020> able<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.590> make<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.949> work<00:00:32.190> for<00:00:32.220> me

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
really was able to make it work for me

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.220 
really was able to make it work for me
because<00:00:32.760> of<00:00:33.150> that<00:00:33.270> little<00:00:33.720> machine<00:00:34.080> gun

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
because of that little machine gun

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.869 
because of that little machine gun
turret<00:00:34.470> at<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.620> front<00:00:34.830> there<00:00:34.980> was<00:00:35.550> pretty

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
turret at the front there was pretty

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.939 
turret at the front there was pretty
much<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.270> guaranteed<00:00:36.930> penetrating<00:00:37.559> hit<00:00:37.739> to

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
much a guaranteed penetrating hit to

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.939 
much a guaranteed penetrating hit to
anybody<00:00:38.520> who<00:00:38.760> had<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.239> half-decent<00:00:39.900> gun<00:00:40.379> now

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
anybody who had a half-decent gun now

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.310 
anybody who had a half-decent gun now
obviously<00:00:41.309> even<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:42.120> getting<00:00:42.570> penetrated

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
obviously even with getting penetrated

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.990 
obviously even with getting penetrated
every<00:00:43.739> single<00:00:44.190> time<00:00:44.370> from<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> front<00:00:44.940> this

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
every single time from the front this

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.389 
every single time from the front this
tank<00:00:45.329> still<00:00:45.540> has<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.960> very<00:00:46.440> large<00:00:46.829> amount<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
tank still has a very large amount of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.270 
tank still has a very large amount of
hit<00:00:47.670> points<00:00:47.700> at<00:00:48.920> 1784<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.070> tia<00:00:50.309> being<00:00:50.579> t<00:00:50.760> it

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
hit points at 1784 it's tia being t it

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.790 
hit points at 1784 it's tia being t it
so<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.489> thing<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:53.969> able<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.450> soak<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.290> good

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
so this thing was able to soak up a good

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.440 
so this thing was able to soak up a good
old<00:00:56.040> brilliant<00:00:56.579> shot<00:00:56.820> they're<00:00:57.030> setting<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
old brilliant shot they're setting the

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.049 
old brilliant shot they're setting the
guy<00:00:57.600> right<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.170> fire<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:58.680> luckily<00:00:59.129> he<00:00:59.579> has<00:00:59.850> a

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
guy right on fire but luckily he has a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.270 
guy right on fire but luckily he has a
fire<00:01:00.360> extinguisher<00:01:00.510> yeah<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.920> giant

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
fire extinguisher yeah with this giant

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.639 
fire extinguisher yeah with this giant
health<00:01:02.700> pool<00:01:02.969> then<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.750> thing<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.259> still

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
health pool then this thing was still

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.130 
health pool then this thing was still
very<00:01:04.830> difficult<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.149> shift<00:01:06.630> off<00:01:06.899> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
very difficult to shift off the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
very difficult to shift off the
battlefield<00:01:07.440> just<00:01:07.920> because<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.460> its<00:01:08.850> hit

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
battlefield just because of its hit

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.800 
battlefield just because of its hit
points<00:01:10.729> but<00:01:11.729> if<00:01:11.940> you<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.240> how<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.450> play<00:01:12.690> it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
points but if you know how to play it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.020 
points but if you know how to play it
properly<00:01:12.990> then<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.800> are<00:01:13.950> able<00:01:14.160> to<00:01:14.460> angle<00:01:14.970> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
properly then you are able to angle it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.109 
properly then you are able to angle it
nicely<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.720> engage<00:01:16.560> things<00:01:16.920> at<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.520> medium<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
nicely and engage things at a medium to

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.090 
nicely and engage things at a medium to
long<00:01:18.300> distance<00:01:18.780> then<00:01:19.020> they<00:01:19.259> can't<00:01:19.619> pick<00:01:19.830> up<00:01:19.950> a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
long distance then they can't pick up a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.620 
long distance then they can't pick up a
little<00:01:20.340> machine<00:01:20.580> gun<00:01:20.700> turret<00:01:20.940> and<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.149> can<00:01:21.479> be

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
little machine gun turret and you can be

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.499 
little machine gun turret and you can be
a<00:01:21.660> right<00:01:21.990> Beast<00:01:22.410> and<00:01:22.709> almost<00:01:23.700> impossible<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
a right Beast and almost impossible to

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.240 
a right Beast and almost impossible to
shift<00:01:24.869> off<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.319> battlefield<00:01:25.590> when<00:01:25.979> played

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
shift off the battlefield when played

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.710 
shift off the battlefield when played
correctly

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
correctly

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.390 
correctly
so<00:01:28.350> obviously<00:01:28.650> for<00:01:28.920> anybody<00:01:29.190> who<00:01:29.250> doesn't

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
so obviously for anybody who doesn't

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.020 
so obviously for anybody who doesn't
know<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.940> kv-5<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.080> 88<00:01:31.920> premium<00:01:32.550> heavy<00:01:32.700> tank

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
know the kv-5 is 88 premium heavy tank

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.240 
know the kv-5 is 88 premium heavy tank
for<00:01:33.480> the<00:01:33.870> Russians<00:01:34.350> I'm<00:01:34.530> fairly<00:01:34.740> sure<00:01:34.830> cost

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
for the Russians I'm fairly sure cost

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.160 
for the Russians I'm fairly sure cost
seven<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> half<00:01:35.670> thousand<00:01:36.210> gold<00:01:36.360> which<00:01:36.960> is

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
seven and a half thousand gold which is

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.170 
seven and a half thousand gold which is
significantly<00:01:37.770> cheaper<00:01:37.980> than<00:01:38.370> the<00:01:38.430> other<00:01:38.820> T

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
significantly cheaper than the other T

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
the other good thing about this tank is

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.450 
the other good thing about this tank is
its<00:01:56.940> ability<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.660> run<00:01:58.320> things<00:01:58.710> because<00:01:59.190> if<00:01:59.220> you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
its ability to run things because if you

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.740 
its ability to run things because if you
look<00:01:59.640> at<00:01:59.760> the<00:01:59.850> size<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.390> thing<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.720> thing

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
look at the size of the thing the thing

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.040 
look at the size of the thing the thing
is<00:02:01.110> an<00:02:01.229> absolute<00:02:01.490> giant<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.240> when<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.780> run

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
is an absolute giant so when you run

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.140 
is an absolute giant so when you run
somebody<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.770> are<00:02:04.950> almost<00:02:05.400> certainly<00:02:05.910> going

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
somebody you are almost certainly going

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.730 
somebody you are almost certainly going
to<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:06.420> some<00:02:06.630> serious<00:02:06.810> damage<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.320> them<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
to do some serious damage to them and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.449 
to do some serious damage to them and
then<00:02:08.040> definitely<00:02:08.520> take<00:02:09.360> out<00:02:09.570> their<00:02:10.130> trucks<00:02:11.130> in

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
then definitely take out their trucks in

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.120 
then definitely take out their trucks in
the<00:02:11.730> process<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:13.470> just<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:13.830> come<00:02:14.010> around

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
the process so just going to come around

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.740 
the process so just going to come around
the<00:02:14.340> side<00:02:14.370> here<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.850> try<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.090> get<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.270> shot<00:02:15.540> on

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
the side here and try and get a shot on

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.940 
the side here and try and get a shot on

this here V sorry this is six is six

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.020 
this here V sorry this is six is six
obviously<00:02:20.310> not<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.459> hundred<00:02:20.640> percent<00:02:20.760> sure

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
obviously not a hundred percent sure

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.610 
obviously not a hundred percent sure
where<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.420> shoot<00:02:21.780> because<00:02:21.959> he<00:02:22.050> hit<00:02:22.260> him<00:02:22.380> right

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
where to shoot because he hit him right

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.380 
where to shoot because he hit him right
in<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.920> tracks<00:02:23.310> there<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.790> was<00:02:23.910> unable<00:02:24.090> to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
in the tracks there and was unable to

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.030 
in the tracks there and was unable to
get<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.570> penetrating<00:02:25.170> hit<00:02:27.800> finally<00:02:28.800> somebody

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
get a penetrating hit finally somebody

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.550 
get a penetrating hit finally somebody
is<00:02:29.220> able<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.820> put<00:02:30.000> some<00:02:30.180> damage<00:02:30.510> through<00:02:30.900> that

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
is able to put some damage through that

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.530 
is able to put some damage through that
little<00:02:31.830> machine<00:02:32.280> gun<00:02:32.519> turret<00:02:34.580> but<00:02:35.580> looks<00:02:36.480> like

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
little machine gun turret but looks like

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.660 
little machine gun turret but looks like
the<00:02:36.720> enemy<00:02:36.840> has<00:02:37.200> flooded<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.860> center<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
the enemy has flooded the center of the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.090 
the enemy has flooded the center of the
map<00:02:38.850> there<00:02:39.180> for<00:02:39.780> transit<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.140> cat<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.680> six

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
map there for transit a cat that is six

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.200 
map there for transit a cat that is six
and<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.280> distance

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
and the distance

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.150 
and the distance
looks<00:02:44.210> like<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.600> is<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.260> other<00:02:45.440> is<00:02:45.710> six<00:02:45.950> here

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
looks like the is the other is six here

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.440 
looks like the is the other is six here
has<00:02:46.430> been<00:02:46.460> able<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.510> get<00:02:47.960> some<00:02:48.170> damage<00:02:48.530> through

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.410 

but<00:02:53.450> gets<00:02:53.810> himself<00:02:54.020> taken<00:02:54.950> out<00:02:55.130> by<00:02:55.550> his<00:02:55.910> allies

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
but gets himself taken out by his allies

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.640 
but gets himself taken out by his allies
so<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.720> other<00:02:56.840> good<00:02:56.960> thing<00:02:57.020> about<00:02:57.170> this<00:02:57.410> tank

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
so the other good thing about this tank

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.470 
so the other good thing about this tank
is<00:02:57.710> you<00:02:57.830> can<00:02:57.950> use<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.400> push<00:02:58.730> down<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:59.180> flank

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
is you can use it to push down the flank

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.530 
is you can use it to push down the flank
and<00:02:59.690> just<00:03:00.410> brute<00:03:00.710> force<00:03:01.100> your<00:03:01.280> way<00:03:01.400> through<00:03:01.670> if

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
and just brute force your way through if

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.540 
and just brute force your way through if
you<00:03:02.750> ever<00:03:02.780> see<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.170> kv-5<00:03:03.590> brute<00:03:04.040> forcing<00:03:04.460> his

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
you ever see a kv-5 brute forcing his

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.240 
you ever see a kv-5 brute forcing his
way<00:03:04.580> through<00:03:05.030> then<00:03:05.390> definitely<00:03:06.140> go<00:03:06.470> with<00:03:06.890> him

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
way through then definitely go with him

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.960 
way through then definitely go with him
as<00:03:07.460> he<00:03:07.820> is<00:03:07.850> a<00:03:08.420> massive<00:03:09.020> bullet<00:03:09.320> sponge<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.970> the

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
as he is a massive bullet sponge and the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.490 
as he is a massive bullet sponge and the
enemy<00:03:11.210> for<00:03:11.360> some<00:03:11.510> reason<00:03:11.810> even<00:03:11.930> though<00:03:12.140> he's

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
enemy for some reason even though he's

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.770 
enemy for some reason even though he's
sort<00:03:12.800> of<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.190> enemy<00:03:13.460> will<00:03:13.730> still<00:03:14.180> try<00:03:14.390> and

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
sort of the enemy will still try and

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.770 
sort of the enemy will still try and
take<00:03:15.020> him<00:03:15.260> out<00:03:15.410> ahead<00:03:16.160> of<00:03:16.460> you<00:03:16.640> so<00:03:17.270> to<00:03:17.330> not<00:03:17.630> be<00:03:17.750> a

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
take him out ahead of you so to not be a

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.560 
take him out ahead of you so to not be a
good<00:03:17.960> idea<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.530> go<00:03:18.860> with<00:03:19.070> this<00:03:19.250> guy<00:03:19.460> and<00:03:19.730> let

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
good idea to go with this guy and let

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.300 
good idea to go with this guy and let
him<00:03:20.600> punch<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.380> hole<00:03:21.410> through<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:22.040> enemy's

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
him punch a hole through the enemy's

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.070 
him punch a hole through the enemy's
lines<00:03:22.520> while<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:23.030> come<00:03:23.300> through<00:03:23.480> as<00:03:23.690> well<00:03:23.870> and

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
lines while you come through as well and

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.670 
lines while you come through as well and
mock<00:03:24.560> up<00:03:25.990> now<00:03:26.990> you<00:03:27.050> will<00:03:27.200> have<00:03:27.260> noticed<00:03:27.500> that

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
mock up now you will have noticed that

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.170 
mock up now you will have noticed that
for<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:27.980> majority<00:03:28.040> of<00:03:28.400> this<00:03:28.550> match<00:03:28.760> this<00:03:28.970> guy

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
for the majority of this match this guy

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.760 
for the majority of this match this guy
was<00:03:29.450> using<00:03:29.690> gold<00:03:30.140> ammunition<00:03:32.410> I'll<00:03:33.410> let<00:03:33.620> you

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
was using gold ammunition I'll let you

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.860 
was using gold ammunition I'll let you
decide<00:03:33.950> whether<00:03:34.610> you<00:03:34.940> agree<00:03:35.300> with<00:03:35.330> that<00:03:35.510> or

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
decide whether you agree with that or

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.740 
decide whether you agree with that or
not<00:03:36.110> but<00:03:36.140> one<00:03:36.410> thing<00:03:36.560> i<00:03:36.620> will<00:03:36.650> see<00:03:37.010> is<00:03:37.070> that<00:03:37.280> the

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
not but one thing i will see is that the

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.240 
not but one thing i will see is that the
penetration<00:03:38.750> of<00:03:38.840> this<00:03:39.020> tank<00:03:39.260> and<00:03:39.500> this<00:03:39.830> gun<00:03:40.070> is

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
penetration of this tank and this gun is

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.920 
penetration of this tank and this gun is
pretty<00:03:40.730> abysmal<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.420> only<00:03:41.570> has<00:03:41.750> an<00:03:41.840> average

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
pretty abysmal it only has an average

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.700 
pretty abysmal it only has an average
penetration<00:03:42.260> of<00:03:43.240> 175<00:03:44.240> I<00:03:44.300> think<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:45.290> definitely

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
penetration of 175 I think so definitely

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.530 
penetration of 175 I think so definitely
underpowered<00:03:46.460> forward<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:47.240> in<00:03:47.360> fact

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
underpowered forward to you in fact

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.150 
underpowered forward to you in fact
there<00:03:47.720> are<00:03:47.750> tier<00:03:47.990> six<00:03:48.320> tanks<00:03:48.560> which<00:03:48.830> can<00:03:49.010> have

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
there are tier six tanks which can have

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.470 
there are tier six tanks which can have
a<00:03:49.190> gun<00:03:49.430> with<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.120> same<00:03:50.440> penetration<00:03:51.440> so<00:03:52.480> using

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
a gun with the same penetration so using

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.270 
a gun with the same penetration so using
the<00:03:53.570> gold<00:03:53.780> ammunition<00:03:54.230> on<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:54.410> gold<00:03:54.740> tank<00:03:55.010> I'll

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
the gold ammunition on a gold tank I'll

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.400 
the gold ammunition on a gold tank I'll
let<00:03:55.610> you<00:03:55.820> decide<00:03:56.000> whether<00:03:56.690> you<00:03:57.020> agree<00:03:57.380> with

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
let you decide whether you agree with

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.260 
let you decide whether you agree with
that<00:03:57.560> or<00:03:57.860> not<00:03:58.070> personally<00:03:58.610> I<00:03:58.640> think<00:03:58.790> if<00:03:59.120> he's

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
that or not personally I think if he's

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.360 
that or not personally I think if he's
got<00:03:59.570> the<00:03:59.930> cash<00:04:00.290> to<00:04:00.470> waste<00:04:00.650> then<00:04:00.950> fair<00:04:01.340> enough

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
got the cash to waste then fair enough

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.240 
got the cash to waste then fair enough
and<00:04:01.820> let<00:04:02.000> them<00:04:02.120> go<00:04:02.330> ahead<00:04:02.600> and<00:04:02.810> do<00:04:03.140> that

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
and let them go ahead and do that

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.640 
and let them go ahead and do that
because<00:04:04.250> even<00:04:04.790> with<00:04:04.970> a<00:04:05.180> full<00:04:05.900> tank<00:04:06.200> probably

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
because even with a full tank probably

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.590 
because even with a full tank probably
not<00:04:06.770> going<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:06.980> make<00:04:07.040> a<00:04:07.340> profit<00:04:07.790> but<00:04:08.360> as<00:04:08.480> you

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
not going to make a profit but as you

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.360 
not going to make a profit but as you
can<00:04:08.690> see<00:04:08.840> with<00:04:09.020> a<00:04:09.080> significant<00:04:09.770> amount<00:04:09.950> of<00:04:10.130> tea

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
can see with a significant amount of tea

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.940 
can see with a significant amount of tea
its<00:04:10.610> tier<00:04:11.030> sevens<00:04:11.450> on<00:04:11.570> each<00:04:11.690> side<00:04:12.020> that<00:04:12.590> extra

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
its tier sevens on each side that extra

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.690 
its tier sevens on each side that extra
penetration<00:04:13.670> was<00:04:13.940> probably<00:04:14.630> necessary<00:04:15.700> so

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
penetration was probably necessary so

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.490 
penetration was probably necessary so

so<00:06:51.950> it's<00:06:52.100> just<00:06:52.370> is<00:06:52.700> that<00:06:52.970> Amelia<00:06:53.300> 6<00:06:53.660> it<00:06:53.960> is

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.169 
so it's just is that Amelia 6 it is

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:55.690 
so it's just is that Amelia 6 it is
indeed<00:06:54.320> mayor<00:06:54.620> six<00:06:54.950> in<00:06:55.070> the<00:06:55.130> key<00:06:55.280> of<00:06:55.310> e<00:06:55.460> five

indeed mayor six in the key of e five

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.760 
indeed mayor six in the key of e five
left<00:06:56.030> this<00:06:56.510> shot<00:06:56.750> should<00:06:56.990> go<00:06:57.200> through<00:06:57.500> and

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
left this shot should go through and

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.620 
left this shot should go through and
indeed<00:06:58.010> it<00:06:58.160> didn't<00:06:58.460> took<00:06:58.550> all<00:06:58.700> these<00:06:58.760> last<00:06:59.030> 76

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.630
