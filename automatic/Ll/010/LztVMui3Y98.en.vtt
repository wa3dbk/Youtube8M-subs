mushrooms pretty small and some shallots

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.330 
mushrooms pretty small and some shallots
these<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.959> used<00:02:16.170> in<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.410> salad<00:02:16.830> dressing<00:02:16.920> last

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.740 
these I used in a salad dressing last
night<00:02:17.550> but<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.730> just<00:02:17.970> happen<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.390> have<00:02:18.450> some

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
night but I just happen to have some

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:29.240 
night but I just happen to have some
leftovers<00:02:19.410> let's<00:02:20.010> add<00:02:20.250> them<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.700> pan

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.580 

adding<00:02:30.060> your<00:02:30.210> vegetables<00:02:30.720> first<00:02:31.020> make<00:02:31.350> sure

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
adding your vegetables first make sure

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.160 
adding your vegetables first make sure
they<00:02:31.800> get<00:02:31.950> cooked<00:02:32.430> nicely<00:02:32.970> before<00:02:33.450> adding

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
they get cooked nicely before adding

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.690 
they get cooked nicely before adding
your<00:02:34.260> eggs<00:02:34.500> otherwise<00:02:35.010> you'll<00:02:35.280> end<00:02:35.370> up<00:02:35.550> with

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
your eggs otherwise you'll end up with

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.400 
your eggs otherwise you'll end up with
some<00:02:35.910> raw<00:02:36.090> vegetables<00:02:36.240> when<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.050> eat<00:02:37.230> your

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
some raw vegetables when you eat your

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.040 
some raw vegetables when you eat your
eggs<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.090> small<00:02:39.240> point<00:02:39.660> whenever<00:02:39.870> you

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
eggs so just a small point whenever you

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.900 
eggs so just a small point whenever you
crack<00:02:40.320> eggs<00:02:40.560> crack<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.040> on<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.160> flat<00:02:41.550> surface

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
crack eggs crack it on a flat surface

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.060 
crack eggs crack it on a flat surface
rather<00:02:42.510> than<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.080> side<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.320> your<00:02:43.470> bowl<00:02:43.680> it

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
rather than on the side of your bowl it

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.220 
rather than on the side of your bowl it
tends<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.370> crack<00:02:44.640> much<00:02:45.000> more<00:02:45.390> evenly<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:46.050> way

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
tends to crack much more evenly that way

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.290 
tends to crack much more evenly that way
I<00:02:46.500> always<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.490> to<00:02:47.520> add<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.790> little<00:02:48.060> bit<00:02:48.209> of

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300
