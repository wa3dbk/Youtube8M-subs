going to show you how to put them on
there<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.779> explain<00:00:31.320> okay<00:00:32.099> what<00:00:32.460> these<00:00:32.640> do

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
there just to explain okay what these do

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.510 
there just to explain okay what these do
the<00:00:33.930> push<00:00:34.110> rod<00:00:34.290> has<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> hole<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.130> comes<00:00:35.370> all

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
the push rod has a hole that comes all

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.400 
the push rod has a hole that comes all
the<00:00:35.610> way<00:00:35.640> up<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.059> off<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.180> lifter<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:37.230> this

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the way up and off the lifter what this

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.560 
the way up and off the lifter what this
tip<00:00:37.710> does<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.309> actually<00:00:38.550> go<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.360> rocker

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
tip does is actually go in the rocker

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.440 
tip does is actually go in the rocker
arm<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.350> covers<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.340> hole<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.120> way<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
arm and covers that hole so this way the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.840 
arm and covers that hole so this way the
oil<00:00:42.480> isn't<00:00:43.020> shooting<00:00:43.200> up<00:00:43.500> over<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> rockers

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
oil isn't shooting up over the rockers

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.340 
oil isn't shooting up over the rockers
while<00:00:45.090> you're<00:00:45.239> trying<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.570> adjust<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.170> because

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
while you're trying to adjust it because

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.959 
while you're trying to adjust it because
you<00:00:46.590> don't<00:00:46.770> want<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> oil<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.460> shoot<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
you don't want the oil to shoot on the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.340 
you don't want the oil to shoot on the
exhaust<00:00:48.239> while<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.690> running<00:00:48.840> because<00:00:49.230> it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
exhaust while it's running because it

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.830 
exhaust while it's running because it
can<00:00:49.440> catch<00:00:49.680> five<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.730> actually<00:00:51.390> stops<00:00:51.660> you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
can catch five this actually stops you

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.139 
can catch five this actually stops you
all<00:00:52.020> from<00:00:52.170> coming<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.640> way<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.850> don't

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
all from coming up so this way you don't

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.119 
all from coming up so this way you don't
catch<00:00:54.360> any<00:00:54.570> fires<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.500> doesn't<00:00:55.770> leave<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> whole

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
catch any fires it doesn't leave a whole

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.150 
catch any fires it doesn't leave a whole
big<00:00:56.340> mess<00:00:56.840> mix<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.960> lot<00:00:58.109> easier<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.739> adjust<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
big mess mix a lot easier to adjust the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:12.190 
big mess mix a lot easier to adjust the
valves<00:00:59.520> they<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.329> simply<00:01:00.480> clip<00:01:00.899> on

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.460 

and<00:01:12.380> they're<00:01:13.070> ready<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:13.490> go<00:01:14.200> now<00:01:15.200> we're<00:01:15.380> going

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
and they're ready to go now we're going

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.130 
and they're ready to go now we're going

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
to start the engine with the stoppers in

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:33.990 
to start the engine with the stoppers in
place

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.940 

now<00:01:35.000> we've<00:01:35.210> taken<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.750> front<00:01:36.050> four<00:01:36.290> off<00:01:36.560> and

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
now we've taken the front four off and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.180 
now we've taken the front four off and
we<00:01:37.550> still<00:01:37.790> have<00:01:37.970> them<00:01:38.150> on<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.420> back<00:01:38.600> ones<00:01:39.190> now

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
we still have them on the back ones now

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:50.470 
we still have them on the back ones now
we'll<00:01:40.430> start<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.760> engine<00:01:49.150> once<00:01:50.150> you<00:01:50.300> plug

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
we'll start the engine once you plug

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.450 
we'll start the engine once you plug
these<00:01:50.690> holes<00:01:50.750> no<00:01:51.230> more<00:01:51.410> oil<00:01:51.620> come<00:01:51.980> up<00:01:52.160> through

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
these holes no more oil come up through

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.280 
these holes no more oil come up through
the<00:01:52.580> push<00:01:52.760> rod<00:01:53.000> from<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.660> lifter<00:01:54.110> and

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
the push rod from the lifter and

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.230 
the push rod from the lifter and
actually<00:01:55.130> keep<00:01:55.400> it<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:55.700> this<00:01:55.790> way<00:01:55.940> you<00:01:56.000> can

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
actually keep it so this way you can

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.470 
actually keep it so this way you can
adjust<00:01:56.360> your<00:01:56.720> valves<00:01:57.110> or<00:01:57.230> do<00:01:57.320> any<00:01:57.500> kind<00:01:57.590> of

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480
