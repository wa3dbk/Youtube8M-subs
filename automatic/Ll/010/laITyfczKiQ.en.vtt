you can see the medium that's just me I

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.700 
you can see the medium that's just me I
fold<00:04:41.970> down<00:04:42.120> my<00:04:42.300> socks<00:04:42.599> sometimes<00:04:42.900> so<00:04:43.500> when<00:04:43.680> I

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
fold down my socks sometimes so when I

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.560 
fold down my socks sometimes so when I
do<00:04:43.830> I<00:04:44.370> like<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.759> different<00:04:45.150> look<00:04:45.300> and<00:04:45.479> a

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
different wording materials wise I think

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.370 
different wording materials wise I think

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
the yarn is kind of coming out it's

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.439 
the yarn is kind of coming out it's
fraying<00:05:05.880> on<00:05:06.210> this<00:05:06.449> side<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:07.080> on<00:05:07.169> that<00:05:07.440> side<00:05:08.449> so

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
fraying on this side and on that side so

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.219 
fraying on this side and on that side so
these<00:05:09.949> might<00:05:10.949> be<00:05:11.280> these<00:05:11.820> might<00:05:12.240> be<00:05:12.479> more

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
these might be these might be more

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
maybe just the washing machine hasn't

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:24.589 
maybe just the washing machine hasn't
caught<00:05:23.310> up<00:05:23.340> so<00:05:23.550> these<00:05:23.699> woods<00:05:23.940> yet<00:05:24.120> as<00:05:24.180> much<00:05:24.419> as
