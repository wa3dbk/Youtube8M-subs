00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.340
 hello live miracle technology me 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.010
 name is Sergey melanoma is winter in Russia 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.019
 It was a cold topic of new technologies 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.120
 in heating as important as ever 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.430
 for example one of the issues that solve 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.699
 almost everyone who does repairs is needed 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.380
 or not a warm floor and if you put it then 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:30.960
 What we have in the studio are three main types 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:35.190
 electric water and its newfangled 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.219
 infrared modification now we have them 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.030
 compare and by the way discuss the issue a 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.960
 is it helpful to walk on always 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.960
 heated surface 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.840
 very cool and keep oksana and 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.059
 Lights against warm floors say that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.699
 for a person it is more natural to have 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.769
 feet cold surface each 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.019
 three children each and they say that itâ€™s not yet 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.869
 barefoot russia came into motion 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.190
 sat in queues with chlorine and now 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.350
 forgotten the way even epidemics nothing 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.720
 everything is not so clear the doctor says I'm not 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.210
 wheel hardening moderately course 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.220
 useful but longer than 4 hours 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.830
 cold floor contact 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.380
 reflex narrows the vessels in the nasopharynx and 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.899
 cold is almost inevitably coming from 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.940
 human physiology i will say that legs in 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:34.619
 warmer is better than cold feet 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.020
 time-tested way to perform 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.479
 Dr. desire to wear slippers at 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.310
 Petersburg designer Lyudmily Razgulyaev 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.009
 well-being and on this is built a whole 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.350
 business she makes a beautiful home 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.840
 shoes already sewn five collections conquers 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.360
 fashion stores and does not accept warm 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.040
 flooring and walking barefoot and in this no 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.649
 absolutely no aesthetics 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.399
 when you walk down the street you are beautiful 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.829
 shoes 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.869
 why when you go around your house 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.490
 bare legs but if there are small children 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.039
 what can there be talk about 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.320
 aesthetics actress and TV presenter Evelina 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.600
 bloody dance in your country house 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.640
 specially for the birth of the seed put 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.360
 heating cover but recently 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.970
 doubted 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.070
 What if the harmful radiation of an electric 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.680
 sex can hurt the baby 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.440
 with us on a visit to the actress came 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.870
 expert at least 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.230
 they are semi electromagnetic level 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.480
 rises with the help of instrumentation specialist 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.180
 determine how warm floor affects 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.610
 air humidity in the room and also what 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.080
 he radiates response there after a few 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.520
 minutes is everything good in the house if any 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.420
 there may be recommendations 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.400
 because whether to do hot less 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.930
 may be hot for a while 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.100
 turn off we are going to 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.380
 floor heating shop 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.350
 here they promise to tell you about the pros and 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.610
 cons of existing modifications 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.770
 electric ones in our house 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.230
 the heroines are pretty problematic in the installation 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.970
 require pouring concrete and therefore repair 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.610
 stretch for several weeks 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.370
 besides if any part of the cable will give 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.170
 failure fails the whole system but 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.090
 electric floor warms the room 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.310
 faster than water and does not have 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.210
 competitors when you need to heat the bathroom 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.130
 or kitchen 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.960
 electric floor heating irreplaceable 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.450
 Coverage option 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.480
 tiles are installed strictly under 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.350
 screed and screed she will best 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.000
 the cat is electric floor heating 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.890
 decided to install the developers 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.560
 unique object in Yekaterinburg 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.989
 apartment building here are batteries and generally without 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.890
 central hot water 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.370
 warms boilers 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.480
 instead of heating, warm floors work 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.790
 thermostats allow you to do any 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.340
 temperature in each room is an example in 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.350
 child's warmer in the kitchen can be cooler 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.519
 set the schedule and the warm floor will start 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:04.070
 warm up one hour before the arrival of the owners 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:06.590
 Batteries in the wallpaper can be until another 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.080
 glue not risers experimental 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.610
 the house has just passed but the builders have already 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.560
 saved on heating 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.690
 and the tenants in the first weeks paid for 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.269
 electricity less than they would have spent on 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.430
 traditional heating is probably the reason 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.690
 the fact that he is less heat loss on the way 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.680
 hot water to consumer 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:29.870
 this project will be at least no more expensive 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.790
 than home central heating 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.460
 another kind of warm floors in the doghouse have 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.830
 public utilities in 10 officially heated 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.280
 banned in all apartment buildings 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.400
 Moscow 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.920
 The law came out in 2004 with the rationale that 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.440
 the owners of the hydra floors steal heat from 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.310
 their neighbors water in the pipe comes from 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.680
 common riser 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.260
 and there returns to already with a loss 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:56.060
 temperatures of 20 or even 30 degrees 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.470
 if suddenly someone from the neighbors is discovered 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.590
 such floors have a neighbor 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.720
 then in general it threatens this person 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.110
 how are you not dismantling these works 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.420
 bringing the apartment house into a room 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.870
 original condition and possible 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.880
 fine per person and yet write off 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.770
 from the bills this species early he remains 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.320
 the most economical and durable 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.090
 option in cottages and townhouses but 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.830
 only provided that they are correctly selected 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.710
 non-metal pipes 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.690
 and of cross-linked polyethylene pipe has 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.530
 stitches sewn at the molecular level 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.790
 either by chemical or electronic error 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.520
 metal plastic it consists of many 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.700
 layers 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.169
 respectively, over time, this pipe 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.840
 1 separation occurs 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.600
 begins to narrow the diameter appears 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.910
 resistance floor stops warming 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.610
 Muscovite Victor ravens fan of 3 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.410
 modern type of warm floors 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.720
 infrared film miracle heater on 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.730
 kind of no thicker Whatman paper heat up and 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.980
 heat here black graphite 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.670
 strip from the navel it enters the copper 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.160
 conductor 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.140
 can be put under carpet or linoleum 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.600
 can be built portable heater 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.510
 very pleased with the 2 contacts in nicely 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.960
 the outlet heats the room literally 2

 linear meter two red buttons 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.540
 any man can do it himself 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:22.090
 warming Victor became even winter 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.780
 the landscape from the back side 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.970
 the picture 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.890
 heat insulator and all the same film 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.610
 certainly warm floors based on 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.130
 this principle 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.220
 the fastest to install just a few 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.240
 hours without any screeds and concrete 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.130
 manufacturers still rest on the fact that 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.680
 infrared waves somehow especially 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.660
 good for health but this moment 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.740
 experts suggest passing by 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:47.440
 any heat to the ears 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.860
 generated by the waves she 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.380
 is infrared but what about 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.490
 electromagnetic waves country house 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.950
 Evelina Blonde 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.770
 expert installed a room with electro 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:02.160
 floors the field level is 5 times higher than in 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.820
 other rooms but you should not be afraid 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.000
 marked located on the left 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:09.100
 the permissible level is noticeably worse 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.530
 moisture floor heating 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.620
 really dry the air in the room and 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.480
 willens only 25 percent and this is two 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.760
 times less than recommended by doctors 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.310
 as if it all affects the mucous 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.740
 shell where the most important thing is 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.560
 well ventilate the room and 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.930
 use humidifiers 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:31.270
 found the right device in the house and right there 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:34.090
 was plugged in and vera 

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:37.150
 total say goodbye to warm floors at all 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:39.200
 not necessarily i love fried 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.180
 potatoes she say fat 

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.300
 la give but i will never refuse her 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:46.430
 so there is pleasure from which 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.730
 impossible to refuse even if you 

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.740
 scare some frightening 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.460
 the consequences therefore filming we are with you 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:58.360
 will be 

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:58.360
 be played on warm floors yes
