there are two great things to remember
when<00:00:46.010> making<00:00:46.250> kebabs<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:47.120> first<00:00:47.390> is<00:00:47.629> is<00:00:47.780> that

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
when making kebabs the first is is that

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.390 
when making kebabs the first is is that
you<00:00:47.989> want<00:00:48.170> everything<00:00:48.589> cut<00:00:48.769> to<00:00:48.980> just<00:00:49.220> about

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
you want everything cut to just about

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.430 
you want everything cut to just about
the<00:00:49.549> same<00:00:49.760> size<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.360> second<00:00:50.900> is<00:00:51.019> is<00:00:51.260> that

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
the same size and the second is is that

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.479 
the same size and the second is is that
you<00:00:51.500> want<00:00:51.769> the<00:00:51.949> skewers

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
you want the skewers

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.640 
you want the skewers
to<00:00:52.670> sit<00:00:52.940> in<00:00:53.059> water<00:00:53.269> for<00:00:53.570> ten<00:00:53.809> minutes<00:00:54.049> now<00:00:54.379> the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
to sit in water for ten minutes now the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.560 
to sit in water for ten minutes now the
reason<00:00:55.129> we<00:00:55.250> want<00:00:55.460> them<00:00:55.610> to<00:00:55.699> be<00:00:55.790> waterlogged

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
reason we want them to be waterlogged

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.820 
reason we want them to be waterlogged
is<00:00:56.659> because<00:00:57.080> we<00:00:57.199> want<00:00:57.409> to<00:00:57.500> make<00:00:57.589> sure<00:00:57.710> that

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
is because we want to make sure that

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.140 
is because we want to make sure that
they<00:00:57.949> don't<00:00:58.129> burn<00:00:58.369> when<00:00:58.640> they<00:00:58.729> go<00:00:58.850> on<00:00:58.970> to<00:00:59.059> the

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
they don't burn when they go on to the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.240 
they don't burn when they go on to the
barbecue<00:00:59.600> so<00:00:59.960> we've<00:01:00.110> got<00:01:00.290> six<00:01:00.589> skewers<00:01:00.979> here

inside we're gonna start by trimming off
both<00:02:01.490> ends<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:02.299> now<00:02:02.810> we're<00:02:02.959> going<00:02:03.049> to<00:02:03.139> be

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
both ends and now we're going to be

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.410 
both ends and now we're going to be
standing<00:02:03.469> it<00:02:03.740> up<00:02:03.859> straight<00:02:04.249> the<00:02:04.850> reason<00:02:05.209> we<00:02:05.329> do

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
standing it up straight the reason we do

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.239 
standing it up straight the reason we do
that<00:02:05.450> is<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:05.899> we<00:02:05.959> can<00:02:06.049> slices<00:02:06.530> down<00:02:06.799> stay

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
that is so that we can slices down stay

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.219 
that is so that we can slices down stay
close<00:02:07.639> to<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:07.969> skin<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.360> remove<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.990> peel
