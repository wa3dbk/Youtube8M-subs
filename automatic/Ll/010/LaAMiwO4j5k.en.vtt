4 age of extinction deluxe class snarl
along<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.820> images<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.899> new<00:00:37.170> deluxe<00:00:37.680> class

along with images of a new deluxe class
bumblebee<00:00:38.730> figure<00:00:39.260> so<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> think<00:00:40.500> it's<00:00:40.829> worth

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
bumblebee figure so I think it's worth

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.950 
bumblebee figure so I think it's worth
mentioning<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.790> these<00:00:42.149> images<00:00:42.780> are

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
mentioning that these images are

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.560 
mentioning that these images are
technically<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.180> Takara<00:00:45.180> releases<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.980> in

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
technically of Takara releases but in

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.569 
technically of Takara releases but in
snarls<00:00:48.570> case<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.170> possibly<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.010> bumblebees

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
snarls case and possibly in bumblebees

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.209 
snarls case and possibly in bumblebees
case<00:00:50.910> they're<00:00:51.570> going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.050> pretty<00:00:52.320> close<00:00:52.800> to

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
case they're going to be pretty close to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.170 
case they're going to be pretty close to
what<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.030> expect<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.930> American<00:00:55.500> releases

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
what we can expect of American releases

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.650 
what we can expect of American releases
so<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.140> mind<00:00:58.170> let's<00:00:58.710> get<00:00:59.070> started

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
so with that in mind let's get started

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.319 
so with that in mind let's get started
so<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.230> side<00:01:01.920> by<00:01:02.190> side<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
so here we have side by side the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.020 
so here we have side by side the
original<00:01:03.899> images<00:01:04.409> revealed<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.280> deluxe<00:01:05.640> class

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
original images revealed of deluxe class

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.960 
original images revealed of deluxe class
snarl<00:01:06.720> along<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.890> new<00:01:08.100> images<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
snarl along with the new images of the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.140 
snarl along with the new images of the
Takara<00:01:09.390> deluxe<00:01:09.960> class<00:01:10.290> snarl<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.880> thing<00:01:12.119> that

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
Takara deluxe class snarl one thing that

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.940 
Takara deluxe class snarl one thing that
I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.810> significant<00:01:13.470> about<00:01:13.650> these

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
I think is significant about these

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.039 
I think is significant about these
images<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.090> even<00:01:15.360> though<00:01:15.630> they<00:01:15.840> are

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
images is that even though they are

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.280 
images is that even though they are
Takara<00:01:16.700> these<00:01:17.700> kind<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.180> images<00:01:18.540> usually<00:01:19.140> give

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
Takara these kind of images usually give

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
Takara these kind of images usually give
us<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.560> better<00:01:19.710> idea<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.820> figures

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
us a better idea of what the figures

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.690 
us a better idea of what the figures
might<00:01:21.450> look<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:22.259> example<00:01:22.320> there<00:01:23.220> aren't

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
might look like for example there aren't

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.850 
might look like for example there aren't
as<00:01:23.880> polished<00:01:24.689> up<00:01:24.930> they<00:01:25.380> don't<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
as polished up they don't have the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.910 
as polished up they don't have the
glares<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.110> crazy<00:01:28.110> lighting<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.799> that

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
glares and the crazy lighting and that

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.219 
glares and the crazy lighting and that
kind<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.220> stuff<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.850> usually<00:01:30.090> these<00:01:30.540> secondary

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
kind of stuff so usually these secondary

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
kind of stuff so usually these secondary
images<00:01:31.740> give<00:01:32.009> us<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.250> better<00:01:32.340> idea<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.909> what<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
images give us a better idea of what the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.350 
images give us a better idea of what the
toy<00:01:33.479> will<00:01:33.720> actually<00:01:34.140> look<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:36.119> while

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
toy will actually look like so so while

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.560 
toy will actually look like so so while
this<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.930> an<00:01:37.320> image<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.799> Takara<00:01:38.220> snarl<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.939> think

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
this is an image of Takara snarl I think

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.630 
this is an image of Takara snarl I think
this<00:01:39.780> might<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.049> more<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> American

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
this might be more what the American

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.149 
this might be more what the American
release<00:01:41.939> looks<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.259> said<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.710> mean

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
release looks like with that said I mean

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.010 
release looks like with that said I mean
there's<00:01:44.369> not<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.610> whole<00:01:44.909> lot<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.270> differences

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
there's not a whole lot of differences

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.380 
there's not a whole lot of differences
from<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.470> original<00:01:46.920> image<00:01:47.040> here<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.759> mean

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
from the original image here I mean

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.600 
from the original image here I mean
pretty<00:01:48.600> much<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.350> said<00:01:49.649> because<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
pretty much like I said because of the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.490 
pretty much like I said because of the
way<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.970> images<00:01:51.390> are<00:01:51.540> shot<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.140> shade<00:01:52.380> of

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
way the images are shot the shade of

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.050 
way the images are shot the shade of
green<00:01:52.740> looks<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.189> little<00:01:53.369> bit<00:01:53.579> different<00:01:54.000> that

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
green looks a little bit different that

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.539 
green looks a little bit different that
could<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.600> be<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> two-car<00:01:55.380> variant<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.340> on

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
could just be a two-car variant but on

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.609 
could just be a two-car variant but on
I'm<00:01:56.820> guessing<00:01:57.750> that's<00:01:57.840> more<00:01:58.110> what<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.380> Greens

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
I'm guessing that's more what the Greens

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.620 
I'm guessing that's more what the Greens
going<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.979> look<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.579> figure<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.119> think

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
going to look like on the figure I think

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.480 
going to look like on the figure I think
I<00:02:00.719> prefer<00:02:00.930> what<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> original<00:02:01.500> image<00:02:01.950> look

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
I prefer what the original image look

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.520 
I prefer what the original image look
like<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> little<00:02:03.060> bit<00:02:03.360> better<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:03.899> anyways<00:02:04.320> it

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
like a little bit better but anyways it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.499 
like a little bit better but anyways it
still<00:02:04.799> looks<00:02:05.009> cool<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.610> was<00:02:05.969> kind<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.210> worried

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
still looks cool I was kind of worried

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.730 
still looks cool I was kind of worried
they<00:02:06.630> might<00:02:06.810> get<00:02:07.049> rid<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.259> some<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
they might get rid of some of the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.460 
they might get rid of some of the
translucent<00:02:08.550> stuff<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.690> spike<00:02:10.110> still

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
translucent stuff but the spike still

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.589 
translucent stuff but the spike still
look<00:02:10.649> translucent<00:02:10.950> along<00:02:11.790> with<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> body<00:02:12.300> and

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
look translucent along with the body and

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.670 
look translucent along with the body and
some<00:02:12.810> stuff<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.410> 10

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
some stuff on the 10

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.709 
some stuff on the 10
else<00:02:13.799> so<00:02:14.069> that<00:02:14.099> all<00:02:14.459> looks<00:02:14.640> cool<00:02:14.909> so<00:02:15.390> instead

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:15.719 
else so that all looks cool so instead

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.599 
else so that all looks cool so instead
of<00:02:15.780> source<00:02:16.019> mode<00:02:16.349> still<00:02:16.709> looks<00:02:16.920> like<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.129> good

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
of source mode still looks like a good

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.990 
of source mode still looks like a good
figure<00:02:18.170> next<00:02:19.170> we<00:02:19.349> move<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.769> robot<00:02:20.219> mode<00:02:20.459> now

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.479 
figure next we move on to robot mode now
at<00:02:21.180> first<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.750> was<00:02:21.989> very<00:02:22.260> excited<00:02:22.500> about<00:02:23.219> the

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
at first I was very excited about the

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.309 
at first I was very excited about the
deluxe<00:02:23.819> class<00:02:24.060> nor<00:02:24.420> when<00:02:24.689> I<00:02:24.719> seen<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.200> images

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
deluxe class nor when I seen the images

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.559 
deluxe class nor when I seen the images
of<00:02:25.620> him<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.069> robot<00:02:26.370> mode<00:02:26.609> and<00:02:26.909> I've<00:02:27.209> got<00:02:27.390> to

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
of him and robot mode and I've got to

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.630 
of him and robot mode and I've got to
say<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.989> these<00:02:28.170> new<00:02:28.409> images<00:02:28.709> still<00:02:29.189> make<00:02:29.459> the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
say that these new images still make the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.759 
say that these new images still make the
figure<00:02:29.849> look<00:02:30.209> really<00:02:30.629> cool<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.109> mean<00:02:31.409> I<00:02:31.439> can't

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
figure look really cool I mean I can't

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.129 
figure look really cool I mean I can't
think<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.069> any<00:02:32.250> real<00:02:32.459> downsides<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.359> mean<00:02:34.019> the

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:34.139 
think of any real downsides I mean the

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.199 
think of any real downsides I mean the
coloring<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.799> shoulders<00:02:35.400> looks<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.969> little

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
coloring on the shoulders looks a little

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.759 
coloring on the shoulders looks a little
bit<00:02:36.540> different<00:02:37.049> but<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.409> nothing<00:02:37.590> really

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
bit different but it's nothing really

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.949 
bit different but it's nothing really
good<00:02:38.340> or<00:02:38.400> bad<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.090> once<00:02:39.269> again<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.719> could

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
good or bad and once again that could

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.879 
good or bad and once again that could
just<00:02:40.200> be<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.349> two-car<00:02:40.739> variant<00:02:42.469> still<00:02:43.469> overall

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
just be a two-car variant still overall

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.159 
just be a two-car variant still overall
the<00:02:44.159> design<00:02:44.310> looks<00:02:44.760> great<00:02:45.180> nothing<00:02:46.049> has

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:46.169 
the design looks great nothing has

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:48.199 
the design looks great nothing has
really<00:02:46.200> changed<00:02:46.470> with<00:02:47.040> these<00:02:47.220> images<00:02:47.790> like

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
really changed with these images like

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.729 
really changed with these images like
the<00:02:48.389> color<00:02:48.599> scheme<00:02:48.870> looks<00:02:49.230> like<00:02:49.379> you<00:02:49.620> have

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
the color scheme looks like you have

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.429 
the color scheme looks like you have
nice<00:02:49.980> articulation<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:51.299> could<00:02:52.049> see<00:02:52.230> they're

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
nice articulation I could see they're

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.979 
nice articulation I could see they're
still<00:02:52.739> continuing<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.639> weird<00:02:54.000> elf<00:02:54.269> shoes<00:02:54.689> for

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
still continuing the weird elf shoes for

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.459 
still continuing the weird elf shoes for
the<00:02:55.079> Dinobots<00:02:55.620> but<00:02:56.040> yeah<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:57.000> guess<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:58.019> guess

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.469 
the Dinobots but yeah I guess I guess

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.990 
the Dinobots but yeah I guess I guess
since<00:02:58.650> they<00:02:58.889> started<00:02:59.129> it<00:02:59.430> they<00:02:59.579> may<00:02:59.730> as<00:02:59.849> well

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
since they started it they may as well

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.240 
since they started it they may as well
finish<00:03:00.329> it<00:03:00.510> with<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.900> rest<00:03:01.079> of<00:03:01.230> them<00:03:01.439> but

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
finish it with the rest of them but

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.770 
finish it with the rest of them but
before<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.730> get<00:03:02.819> off<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.120> topic<00:03:03.480> of

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
before I get off the topic of

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.289 
before I get off the topic of
articulation<00:03:04.709> wanted<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.609> mention<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.060> I've

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
articulation wanted to mention that I've

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.390 
articulation wanted to mention that I've
heard<00:03:06.510> some<00:03:06.780> things<00:03:06.959> that<00:03:07.169> his<00:03:07.620> hands<00:03:08.099> might

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
heard some things that his hands might

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.940 
heard some things that his hands might
be<00:03:08.430> stuck<00:03:09.000> in<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.329> position<00:03:09.870> as<00:03:10.260> they<00:03:10.590> are<00:03:10.739> in

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
be stuck in the position as they are in

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.599 
be stuck in the position as they are in
the<00:03:11.040> image<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:12.530> sort<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.620> like<00:03:13.799> stripes<00:03:14.340> he

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
the image is sort of like stripes he

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.610 
the image is sort of like stripes he
doesn't<00:03:14.909> really<00:03:15.090> have<00:03:15.419> wrist<00:03:15.930> swivel<00:03:16.469> you

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
doesn't really have wrist swivel you

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.430 
doesn't really have wrist swivel you
know<00:03:16.739> technically<00:03:17.400> he<00:03:17.699> does<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.840> doesn't

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
know technically he does but it doesn't

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.960 
know technically he does but it doesn't
really<00:03:19.530> work<00:03:19.709> because<00:03:20.129> of<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.489> way<00:03:20.609> his<00:03:20.729> arms

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
really work because of the way his arms

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.000 
really work because of the way his arms
are<00:03:21.090> structured<00:03:21.659> I've<00:03:22.229> heard<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.859> about

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
are structured I've heard that about

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.520 
are structured I've heard that about
this<00:03:23.310> figure<00:03:23.699> as<00:03:23.849> well<00:03:24.239> I<00:03:24.659> mean<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.290> haven't

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
this figure as well I mean I haven't

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.589 
this figure as well I mean I haven't
looked<00:03:25.949> at<00:03:26.099> the<00:03:26.250> images<00:03:26.609> long<00:03:26.909> enough<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.359> form

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
looked at the images long enough to form

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.300 
looked at the images long enough to form
an<00:03:27.690> opinion<00:03:27.780> about<00:03:28.199> that<00:03:28.560> it'd<00:03:28.919> be<00:03:28.949> pretty

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
an opinion about that it'd be pretty

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.429 
an opinion about that it'd be pretty
disappointing<00:03:30.209> if<00:03:30.359> his<00:03:30.629> wrists<00:03:30.959> were<00:03:31.169> stuck

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
disappointing if his wrists were stuck

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.800 
disappointing if his wrists were stuck
in<00:03:31.470> those<00:03:31.769> weird<00:03:32.040> positions<00:03:32.609> but<00:03:32.970> i<00:03:33.269> mean<00:03:33.750> i

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
in those weird positions but i mean i

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.589 
in those weird positions but i mean i
could<00:03:33.959> probably<00:03:34.290> settle<00:03:34.829> for<00:03:35.099> it<00:03:35.569> outside<00:03:36.569> of

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
could probably settle for it outside of

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.080 
could probably settle for it outside of
that<00:03:36.900> we<00:03:37.169> finally<00:03:37.650> know<00:03:38.010> what<00:03:38.189> snarls<00:03:38.699> weapon

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
that we finally know what snarls weapon

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.030 
that we finally know what snarls weapon
is<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.780> was<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.109> confusing<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.829> tell

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
is and it was so confusing to tell

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.580 
is and it was so confusing to tell
before<00:03:41.220> because<00:03:41.909> Hasbro<00:03:42.449> obviously<00:03:43.079> had<00:03:43.349> it

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
before because Hasbro obviously had it

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.649 
before because Hasbro obviously had it
pointing<00:03:44.069> upside<00:03:44.430> down<00:03:44.669> in<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:44.879> image<00:03:45.209> no

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
pointing upside down in the image no

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.530 
pointing upside down in the image no
surprise<00:03:46.139> there<00:03:46.500> but<00:03:47.069> anyways<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:47.699> is<00:03:47.909> a<00:03:48.090> big

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
surprise there but anyways it is a big

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.679 
surprise there but anyways it is a big
awesome<00:03:49.229> looking<00:03:49.439> acts<00:03:49.799> so<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.639> mean<00:03:51.000> maybe<00:03:51.509> it

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:51.689 
awesome looking acts so I mean maybe it

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.089 
awesome looking acts so I mean maybe it
could<00:03:51.840> have<00:03:51.930> been<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.079> little<00:03:52.319> bit<00:03:52.620> longer<00:03:52.799> at

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
could have been a little bit longer at

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.069 
could have been a little bit longer at
the<00:03:53.189> bottom<00:03:53.609> but<00:03:53.849> overall<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.540> looks<00:03:54.569> really

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
translucent might be spring loaded but

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.390 
translucent might be spring loaded but

cool<00:04:35.230> to<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.890> extent<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.580> I<00:04:36.700> thought<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.090> was

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
cool to the extent that I thought it was

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.630 
cool to the extent that I thought it was
a<00:04:37.270> different<00:04:37.660> mold<00:04:38.200> from<00:04:38.650> an<00:04:38.920> American<00:04:39.460> bum

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
beginning to see that these two figures

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.650 
beginning to see that these two figures
may<00:04:49.000> in<00:04:49.450> fact<00:04:49.720> be<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.380> same<00:04:50.680> mold<00:04:51.360> now<00:04:52.360> I<00:04:52.390> don't

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
may in fact be the same mold now I don't

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.990 
may in fact be the same mold now I don't
know<00:04:52.960> if<00:04:53.080> there's<00:04:53.350> remoting<00:04:54.160> done<00:04:54.340> here<00:04:54.820> or

Hasbro in the picture but the Takara
version<00:05:03.630> definitely<00:05:04.630> looks<00:05:04.900> better<00:05:05.020> and

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
version definitely looks better and

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.430

pretty much every single sense I mean

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.560 
pretty much every single sense I mean
our<00:05:08.590> one<00:05:08.800> looks<00:05:09.040> weird<00:05:09.400> up<00:05:09.640> in<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:09.940> shoulders

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
our one looks weird up in the shoulders

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.080 
our one looks weird up in the shoulders
the<00:05:11.080> back<00:05:11.560> kibble<00:05:12.040> isn't<00:05:12.280> really<00:05:12.550> arranged

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
the back kibble isn't really arranged

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.810 
the back kibble isn't really arranged
nicely<00:05:13.380> he's<00:05:14.380> holding<00:05:14.770> those<00:05:14.920> weird<00:05:15.370> spinning

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
nicely he's holding those weird spinning

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
disk and stuff it's just does not look

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.630 
disk and stuff it's just does not look
that<00:05:19.600> good<00:05:19.990> but<00:05:20.260> two<00:05:20.350> curbs<00:05:20.860> one<00:05:21.190> looks<00:05:21.430> so

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
that good but two curbs one looks so

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.880 
that good but two curbs one looks so
much<00:05:21.820> better<00:05:22.200> but<00:05:23.200> if<00:05:23.320> you<00:05:23.470> look<00:05:23.680> at<00:05:23.860> the

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
much better but if you look at the

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.040 
much better but if you look at the
designs<00:05:24.340> of<00:05:24.550> both<00:05:24.850> they<00:05:25.150> do<00:05:25.210> look<00:05:25.780> like

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
designs of both they do look like

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.320 
designs of both they do look like
they're<00:05:26.290> in<00:05:26.410> fact<00:05:26.650> are<00:05:27.010> the<00:05:27.310> same<00:05:27.550> mold<00:05:27.940> I'm

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
they're in fact are the same mold I'm

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.659 
they're in fact are the same mold I'm
hoping<00:05:29.110> that's<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:29.620> case<00:05:29.740> because<00:05:30.250> I<00:05:30.400> would

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
hoping that's the case because I would

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.100 
hoping that's the case because I would
really<00:05:30.880> like<00:05:31.120> to<00:05:31.330> get<00:05:31.510> something<00:05:31.840> like

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
really like to get something like

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.290 
really like to get something like
evolutions<00:05:32.710> now<00:05:32.919> bumblebee<00:05:33.310> and<00:05:33.490> transform

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
evolutions now bumblebee and transform

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.590 
evolutions now bumblebee and transform
him<00:05:34.510> as<00:05:34.750> the<00:05:35.140> Takara<00:05:35.530> image<00:05:35.950> shows<00:05:36.250> but<00:05:37.150> maybe

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
him as the Takara image shows but maybe

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.420 
him as the Takara image shows but maybe
has<00:05:37.900> where<00:05:38.169> remoted<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:38.950> so<00:05:39.220> it<00:05:39.280> would<00:05:39.400> look

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
has where remoted it so it would look

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.280 
has where remoted it so it would look
like<00:05:39.610> that<00:05:40.060> I<00:05:40.360> don't<00:05:40.540> know<00:05:40.660> why<00:05:40.840> they<00:05:41.050> do<00:05:41.110> it

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
like that I don't know why they do it

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.520 
like that I don't know why they do it
but<00:05:41.590> this<00:05:41.770> is<00:05:41.830> Hasbro<00:05:42.580> so<00:05:42.880> you<00:05:43.419> never<00:05:43.570> know<00:05:43.870> but

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
but this is Hasbro so you never know but

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.310 
but this is Hasbro so you never know but
they<00:05:44.740> do<00:05:44.800> look<00:05:44.980> to<00:05:45.460> be<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:45.700> same<00:05:45.940> mold<00:05:46.270> and<00:05:46.600> my

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
they do look to be the same mold and my

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.740 
they do look to be the same mold and my
suspicions<00:05:48.070> were<00:05:48.310> further<00:05:48.760> confirmed<00:05:49.450> after

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
suspicions were further confirmed after

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.409 
suspicions were further confirmed after
I<00:05:49.960> took<00:05:50.140> a<00:05:50.560> look<00:05:50.800> at<00:05:51.010> both<00:05:51.220> vehicle<00:05:51.820> modes<00:05:52.090> I

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
I took a look at both vehicle modes I

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.450 
I took a look at both vehicle modes I
mean<00:05:52.780> they're<00:05:52.960> pretty<00:05:53.200> much<00:05:53.260> identical<00:05:53.620> and

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
mean they're pretty much identical and

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.070 
mean they're pretty much identical and
you<00:05:54.550> could<00:05:54.700> tell<00:05:54.910> by<00:05:55.150> all<00:05:55.180> the<00:05:55.419> cracks<00:05:55.750> and

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
you could tell by all the cracks and

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.680 
you could tell by all the cracks and
crevices<00:05:56.650> and<00:05:56.680> the<00:05:56.919> vehicles<00:05:57.370> that<00:05:57.669> they<00:05:58.419> look

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
crevices and the vehicles that they look

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.409 
crevices and the vehicles that they look
to<00:05:58.870> be<00:05:58.900> about<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.560> same<00:05:59.830> so<00:06:00.280> probably<00:06:01.060> is<00:06:01.270> the

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
to be about the same so probably is the

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.350 
to be about the same so probably is the
same<00:06:01.630> figure<00:06:02.190> overall<00:06:03.190> I<00:06:03.220> hope<00:06:03.610> the<00:06:03.820> American

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
same figure overall I hope the American

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.659 
same figure overall I hope the American
evolutions<00:06:05.020> now<00:06:05.290> and<00:06:05.680> Autobots<00:06:06.130> United

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
evolutions now and Autobots United

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.970 
evolutions now and Autobots United
bumblebee<00:06:07.120> does<00:06:07.720> turn<00:06:07.990> out<00:06:08.140> to<00:06:08.200> be<00:06:08.470> as<00:06:08.590> good<00:06:08.800> as

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
bumblebee does turn out to be as good as

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.490 
bumblebee does turn out to be as good as
the<00:06:09.130> Takara<00:06:09.490> one<00:06:09.790> locks<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:10.390> after<00:06:11.260> seeing

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
the Takara one locks and after seeing

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.040 
the Takara one locks and after seeing
that<00:06:11.620> the<00:06:11.860> car<00:06:12.070> images<00:06:12.610> actually<00:06:13.270> considered

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
that the car images actually considered

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.170 
that the car images actually considered
that<00:06:14.140> this<00:06:14.290> mold<00:06:14.740> might<00:06:15.250> not<00:06:15.430> be<00:06:15.610> a<00:06:15.640> bad<00:06:15.700> fit

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
that this mold might not be a bad fit

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.010 
that this mold might not be a bad fit
for<00:06:16.210> stinger<00:06:16.840> I<00:06:17.820> mean<00:06:18.820> the<00:06:18.970> most<00:06:19.180> ideal<00:06:19.450> thing

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
for stinger I mean the most ideal thing

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.990 
for stinger I mean the most ideal thing
would<00:06:20.080> be<00:06:20.440> for<00:06:20.470> stinger<00:06:21.130> to<00:06:21.310> get<00:06:21.460> his<00:06:21.580> own<00:06:21.730> mode

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
would be for stinger to get his own mode

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.330 
would be for stinger to get his own mode
but<00:06:22.270> if<00:06:22.390> they<00:06:22.540> weren't<00:06:22.780> I<00:06:23.050> mean<00:06:23.340> repainting

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
but if they weren't I mean repainting

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.580 
but if they weren't I mean repainting
this<00:06:24.520> bumblebee<00:06:25.090> mode<00:06:25.360> wouldn't<00:06:25.930> be<00:06:26.320> such<00:06:26.560> a

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
this bumblebee mode wouldn't be such a

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.370 
this bumblebee mode wouldn't be such a
bad<00:06:26.800> move<00:06:27.100> i<00:06:27.280> mean<00:06:27.460> as<00:06:27.580> long<00:06:27.760> as<00:06:27.940> they<00:06:28.380> remoted

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
bad move i mean as long as they remoted

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.020 
bad move i mean as long as they remoted
the<00:06:29.500> head<00:06:29.710> would<00:06:29.980> be<00:06:30.160> the<00:06:30.280> main<00:06:30.490> thing<00:06:30.790> and

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
the head would be the main thing and

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.440 
the head would be the main thing and
then<00:06:31.120> may<00:06:31.360> fixed<00:06:31.870> up<00:06:32.020> some<00:06:32.320> of<00:06:32.470> the<00:06:33.150> car<00:06:34.150> parts

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:34.450 
then may fixed up some of the car parts

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.180 
then may fixed up some of the car parts
to<00:06:34.720> make<00:06:34.750> it<00:06:35.050> look<00:06:35.200> more<00:06:35.440> like<00:06:35.620> stingers

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
to make it look more like stingers

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.830 
to make it look more like stingers
alternate<00:06:36.789> mode<00:06:37.000> you<00:06:37.539> know<00:06:37.600> and<00:06:37.750> obviously

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
alternate mode you know and obviously

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.990 
alternate mode you know and obviously
recolor<00:06:38.650> it<00:06:38.890> do<00:06:39.039> all<00:06:39.070> that

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
recolor it do all that

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.090 
recolor it do all that
I<00:06:40.060> could<00:06:40.390> be<00:06:40.510> happy<00:06:40.870> with<00:06:41.050> that<00:06:41.170> stinger<00:06:41.890> if

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
I could be happy with that stinger if

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.580 
I could be happy with that stinger if
they<00:06:42.370> did<00:06:42.550> it<00:06:42.670> right<00:06:42.700> but<00:06:43.690> what<00:06:43.990> to<00:06:44.260> see<00:06:44.440> what

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
they did it right but what to see what

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.430 
they did it right but what to see what
happens<00:06:45.150> anyways<00:06:46.150> that<00:06:46.480> sums<00:06:46.780> it<00:06:46.900> up<00:06:47.020> for<00:06:47.350> this

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
happens anyways that sums it up for this

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.340 
happens anyways that sums it up for this
video<00:06:47.650> guys<00:06:47.890> I<00:06:48.520> know<00:06:49.210> it's<00:06:49.480> not<00:06:49.660> the<00:06:49.720> biggest

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350 
video guys I know it's not the biggest

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.740 
video guys I know it's not the biggest
most<00:06:50.590> exciting<00:06:51.250> news<00:06:51.460> on<00:06:51.670> figures<00:06:52.120> but<00:06:52.480> I

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
most exciting news on figures but I

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.170 
most exciting news on figures but I
figured<00:06:53.380> I'd<00:06:53.500> do<00:06:53.650> a<00:06:53.680> video<00:06:53.950> on<00:06:54.100> it<00:06:54.430> anyways<00:06:54.880> I

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
figured I'd do a video on it anyways I

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.630 
figured I'd do a video on it anyways I
think<00:06:55.930> the<00:06:56.020> images<00:06:56.440> of<00:06:56.470> the<00:06:56.650> new<00:06:56.890> releases<00:06:57.220> are

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:57.640 
think the images of the new releases are

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.400 
think the images of the new releases are
showing<00:06:58.000> the<00:06:58.090> age<00:06:58.210> of<00:06:58.330> extinction<00:06:58.780> line<00:06:59.170> to

00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.410 
showing the age of extinction line to

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.530 
showing the age of extinction line to
still<00:06:59.710> be<00:06:59.860> going<00:07:00.010> strong<00:07:00.190> but<00:07:01.030> you<00:07:01.150> guys<00:07:01.300> can

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:01.540 
still be going strong but you guys can

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.120 
still be going strong but you guys can
