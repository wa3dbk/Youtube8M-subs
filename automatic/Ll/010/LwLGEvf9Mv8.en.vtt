00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
actually pick these up is because one

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.960

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
I think about these replicas and I did

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.189 
I think about these replicas and I did
pick<00:00:22.890> them<00:00:23.010> up<00:00:23.070> from<00:00:23.130> dhgate.com<00:00:24.080> from<00:00:25.080> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
up for about 95 to 100 dollars and in

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.359 
up for about 95 to 100 dollars and in
comparison<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.619> four<00:00:31.859> or<00:00:31.949> five<00:00:32.070> hundred

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
comparison to four or five hundred

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.170 
comparison to four or five hundred
dollars<00:00:32.640> that's<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.809> bad<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:35.120> these<00:00:36.120> are

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
dollars that's not that bad so these are

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.959 
dollars that's not that bad so these are
originally<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.350> retail<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:38.100> go<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:38.940> about

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
originally in retail they go for about

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.299 
originally in retail they go for about
four<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.510> five<00:00:39.540> hundred<00:00:39.870> dollars<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.920> let's

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
four to five hundred dollars so let's

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.299 
four to five hundred dollars so let's
simply<00:00:41.640> get<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.719> with<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.020> unboxing<00:00:43.770> so

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
right here on the right side we do have

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.440 
right here on the right side we do have
a<00:00:46.230> little<00:00:46.350> tab<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.920> always<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
dr dre headphones and all these replicas

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.799 
dr dre headphones and all these replicas
so<00:00:51.360> my<00:00:52.050> box<00:00:52.379> did<00:00:52.649> come<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> little<00:00:53.100> beat<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.489> but

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
so my box did come a little beat up but

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.510

i'm<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.199> too<00:00:55.980> worried<00:00:56.190> about<00:00:56.219> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
i'm not really too worried about that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.910 
i'm not really too worried about that
because<00:00:56.789> these<00:00:57.030> are<00:00:57.180> replicas<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:58.770> got

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
then we have a little conversion thing

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.530 
then we have a little conversion thing
for<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.890> stereos<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.640> stuff<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> 1<00:01:51.390> by

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
for like stereos and stuff it is a 1 by

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.260 
for like stereos and stuff it is a 1 by
4<00:01:51.570> inch<00:01:52.049> little<00:01:52.860> cable<00:01:53.159> adapter<00:01:53.850> right<00:01:53.970> there

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
4 inch little cable adapter right there

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
4 inch little cable adapter right there
and<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:54.990> actually<00:01:55.140> easily<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.920> comes

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
and you can actually easily it comes

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.160 
and you can actually easily it comes
attached<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.149> actual<00:01:57.450> cable<00:01:57.840> right<00:01:58.140> there

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
attached to the actual cable right there

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.469 
attached to the actual cable right there
so<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.649> won't<00:01:58.680> lose<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.399> or<00:01:59.700> anything<00:02:00.000> or<00:02:00.420> you

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
so you won't lose it or anything or you

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.539 
so you won't lose it or anything or you
can<00:02:00.750> actually<00:02:00.899> take<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.380> off<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:02.130> doesn't

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
can actually take it off it doesn't

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.459 
can actually take it off it doesn't
really<00:02:02.700> matter<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.600> mean<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.140> comes<00:02:04.350> in

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
really matter but I mean it comes in

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.679 
really matter but I mean it comes in
handy<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.950> ever<00:02:04.979> use<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.460> often<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.479> stuff

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
handy if you ever use it often and stuff

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.510 
handy if you ever use it often and stuff

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
of the box we do

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.100

take<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.650> look<00:02:16.950> at<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.280> thing<00:02:17.550> here<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.510> is

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
take a look at this thing here this is

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.080 
take a look at this thing here this is
actually<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.470> little<00:02:19.680> carrying<00:02:20.310> case<00:02:20.370> for<00:02:20.640> it

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
actually a little carrying case for it

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
actually a little carrying case for it
and<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:23.010> like<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.460> cloth<00:02:24.030> carrying<00:02:24.570> case<00:02:24.810> I

don't really think it would protect your
headphones<00:02:29.910> at<00:02:30.120> all<00:02:30.330> because<00:02:30.990> it's<00:02:31.410> just<00:02:31.500> like

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
that but these are actually rotatable

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.660 
that but these are actually rotatable
ear<00:03:06.240> cups<00:03:06.570> right<00:03:06.810> here<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.620> they're<00:03:08.190> more<00:03:08.400> for

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
ear cups right here so they're more for

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
like DJing and everything and we got the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.770 
like DJing and everything and we got the
little<00:03:11.010> band<00:03:11.310> here<00:03:11.580> we<00:03:11.700> can<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:12.000> course<00:03:12.300> extend

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
little band here we can of course extend

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.150 
little band here we can of course extend
them<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.110> it'll<00:03:13.290> be<00:03:13.320> bigger<00:03:13.620> for<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.890> bigger

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
them so it'll be bigger for a bigger

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.750 
them so it'll be bigger for a bigger
head<00:03:14.460> and<00:03:14.730> all<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.600> so<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.709> mean<00:03:17.250> these<00:03:17.490> are

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
head and all that so I mean these are

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.699

feeling really really good they're like
metal<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.320> they're<00:03:22.770> not<00:03:22.890> actually<00:03:23.160> too<00:03:23.580> heavy

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
metal and they're not actually too heavy

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.690 
metal and they're not actually too heavy
for<00:03:24.240> it<00:03:24.450> being<00:03:24.690> like<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:24.930> metal<00:03:25.380> kind<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.770> finish

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
for it being like a metal kind of finish

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.090 
for it being like a metal kind of finish
and<00:03:26.730> all<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:27.959> here's<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.709> quick<00:03:28.920> little
