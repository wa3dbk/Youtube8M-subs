00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.240
 everyone today I bring you a video about the 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.660
 importance of breakfast for both 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.010
 children as for adults I know there are 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.570
 many children who arrive at school without 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.880
 breakfast or without breakfast as appropriate 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.800
 can be lifted late for whatever 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.510
 and then it 's in good, now now 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.520
 is ready so what they 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.740
 do the same thing because it would happen to me 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.869
 exactly like them then 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.840
 Well, it is preferable before a tad 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.670
 before and have a good breakfast because the 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.370
 children are good energy consumers 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.760
 butt and because we but they still 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.470
 better then what foods should 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.059
 always be at breakfast with the 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.470
 dairy cereals and fruit the fruit then to 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.839
 through a fruit stone of a 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.290
 juice even a yogurt but good better 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:57.430
 fruit or dairy juice the typical the boy 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.400
 with the head with the cheese 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.230
 or a yogurt and then finally good 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.640
 the cereals already in toasted of paco ' 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.340
 because accompanied by first lady before 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.980
 tomato keel with oil and sagar or 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.750
 of oil and salt as you want or cereals 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.190
 good then video type pretty fiber and 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.740
 all these things that contribute so much 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.600
 energy is not typical special to 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.729
 As it comes out on TV they carry the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.229
 yogurt and then these saplings 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.840
 it just has to be sticky and 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.450
 greasy that does not come at all well 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.729
 then try to stay in that for 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.850
 a good breakfast is essential not 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.340
 I can repeat both for them and for 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.380
 us even if you have time if you 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.570
 like if you will get used to eating 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.190
 quite at breakfast because we have 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.229
 to have 25 percent of all 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.850
 food then try in a rite of 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.030
 Well, maybe a little bit of 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.680
 payment ham of york ham with a 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.990
 little bit of tomato something like that or ham 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.729
 Serrano for them to 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.590
 get used little by little if we are after 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.880
 pick up on cookies or cookie 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.110
 found in the car on the way to 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.000
 school 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.250
 Well, they will not go well and this is true 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.230
 your life then mid-morning buns 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.610
 sticky chocolate that are 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.190
 very nice buggy the first one that 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.290
 love but try it because that takes 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.030
 the second small caldito with cold cuts 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.200
 depending on what setting we put it as I have 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.660
 said there is not much that has been said 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.720
 a turkey breast one ham york 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.500
 a turkey mortadella things like a juice 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.140
 It's worth a yogurt, a dairy, a sandwich 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.240
 cheese stuff is worth what good then 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.760
 this is good because during the day they go 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.180
 to have enough energy to face 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.220
 the morning very well and just think 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.820
 you with that work and you are 45 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:46.120
 hours working as hard as you are but 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:47.890
 of cells have lunch something I do not know 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.190
 that then you see how they are inflating 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.320
 to the water bottle 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.470
 They are not hungry although they because they have 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.390
 been running while playing jumping 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.670
 et cetera by then it is very important 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.030
 that go well if there is a 2 I go back to 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.910
 repeat both the children and us 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.480
 I told you what breakfast every day 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.970
 orange juice coffee with milk with cereals 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.850
 and if it gives me time if I'm hungry what 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.200
 be it a piece of fruit or a yogurt and 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.050
 you increase all morning mid morning 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.270
 well another juice and maybe a sandwich 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.880
