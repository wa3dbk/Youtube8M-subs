will they will resort to saying that
you're<00:00:34.440> hacking<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:35.010> that's<00:00:35.190> exactly<00:00:35.309> what

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
you're hacking but that's exactly what

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.220 
you're hacking but that's exactly what
happens<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.239> game<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.450> actually<00:00:36.690> joined<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
happens in this game I actually joined a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.020 
happens in this game I actually joined a
conquest<00:00:37.649> domination<00:00:37.860> game<00:00:38.250> with<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> couple

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
conquest domination game with a couple

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.880 
conquest domination game with a couple
of<00:00:39.059> my<00:00:39.180> buddies<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.260> actually<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.559> low

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
of my buddies and this is actually a low

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.299 
of my buddies and this is actually a low
population<00:00:41.250> server<00:00:42.140> it<00:00:43.140> doesn't<00:00:43.890> have<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> lot

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
population server it doesn't have a lot

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.799 
population server it doesn't have a lot
of<00:00:44.340> people<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.239> that's<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.600> good<00:00:45.750> thing

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
of people in it and that's a good thing

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.900 
of people in it and that's a good thing
because<00:00:46.140> when<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.590> want<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.920> stay<00:00:47.160> sane<00:00:47.579> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
because when you want to stay sane and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.000 
because when you want to stay sane and
conquest<00:00:48.629> domination<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:49.289> close<00:00:49.500> quarters<00:00:49.890> in

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
conquest domination or close quarters in

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.470 
conquest domination or close quarters in
general<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.700> want<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.940> point<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> lower

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
general you want to point the lower

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.180 
general you want to point the lower
population<00:00:51.809> servers<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.860> because<00:00:53.070> they're

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
population servers just because they're

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.520 
population servers just because they're
more<00:00:53.399> fun<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.449> still<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> lot<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.050> action

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
more fun you still get a lot of action

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.740 
more fun you still get a lot of action
but<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.160> action<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.610> more<00:00:56.879> spread<00:00:57.360> out<00:00:57.390> it's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
but that action is more spread out it's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.270 
but that action is more spread out it's
not<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.170> much<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.410> they're<00:00:58.800> constantly

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
not so much that they're constantly

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.189 
not so much that they're constantly
spawning<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.969> throughout<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.989> game

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
spawning on you throughout this game

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.380 
spawning on you throughout this game
though<00:01:01.410> i<00:01:01.440> think<00:01:01.710> i'd<00:01:01.800> drop<00:01:01.829> around<00:01:02.309> 95<00:01:03.059> kills

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
though i think i'd drop around 95 kills

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.179 
though i think i'd drop around 95 kills
and<00:01:03.690> you're<00:01:03.989> probably<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.350> wow<00:01:04.500> with<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.890> PP

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and you're probably like wow with the PP

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.130 
and you're probably like wow with the PP
19<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.760> yeah<00:01:05.880> it's<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.420> high-ticket<00:01:06.630> server

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
19 and yeah it's a high-ticket server

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.330 
19 and yeah it's a high-ticket server
when<00:01:07.380> you're<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> server<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.100> while<00:01:08.310> i

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
when you're in a server for a while i

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.760 
when you're in a server for a while i
think<00:01:08.610> i<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.810> game<00:01:09.990> last<00:01:10.229> maybe<00:01:10.560> like

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
think i think the game last maybe like

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.399 
think i think the game last maybe like
20<00:01:11.130> minutes<00:01:11.340> 25<00:01:12.000> minutes<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.080> fairly

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
20 minutes 25 minutes so it's a fairly

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.429 
20 minutes 25 minutes so it's a fairly
long<00:01:13.740> game<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.280> those<00:01:14.939> games<00:01:15.210> tend<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.810> field

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
long game and those games tend to field

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.620 
long game and those games tend to field
a<00:01:16.560> lot<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.830> kills<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.759> people<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.509> this

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
a lot of kills but the people in this

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.969 
a lot of kills but the people in this
particular<00:01:18.780> game<00:01:19.080> were<00:01:19.320> getting<00:01:19.590> very<00:01:19.830> upset

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
particular game were getting very upset

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.740 
particular game were getting very upset
with<00:01:20.310> me<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:20.670> they<00:01:21.119> thought<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.570> was

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
with me because they thought that I was

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.749 
with me because they thought that I was
hacking<00:01:21.990> because<00:01:22.470> i<00:01:22.590> was<00:01:22.770> actually<00:01:22.979> putting

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
hacking because i was actually putting

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.609 
hacking because i was actually putting
up<00:01:24.000> decent<00:01:24.450> numbers<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> weapon<00:01:25.409> that

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
up decent numbers with a weapon that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
up decent numbers with a weapon that
just<00:01:26.009> isn't<00:01:26.159> really<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.729> good<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.240> i've

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
just isn't really that good and i've

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.149 
just isn't really that good and i've
talked<00:01:27.750> about<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.049> past<00:01:28.290> videos<00:01:28.409> how<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.890> just

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
talked about in past videos how I just

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.490 
talked about in past videos how I just
really<00:01:29.490> don't<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.909> pv<00:01:30.180> 19<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:31.320> just

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
really don't like the pv 19 it's just

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.020 
really don't like the pv 19 it's just
really<00:01:31.680> not<00:01:31.860> my<00:01:32.040> cup<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.310> tea<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.579> don't<00:01:32.880> really

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
really not my cup of tea I don't really

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.819 
really not my cup of tea I don't really
see<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:33.659> being<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> weapons<00:01:34.560> that

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
see it as being one of the weapons that

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.370 
see it as being one of the weapons that
I<00:01:34.950> would<00:01:35.280> want<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.150> use<00:01:36.420> or<00:01:36.659> even<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
recently came to the realization that

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.520

sour taste in my mouth and give a good
good<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.430> guess<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> good<00:02:12.180> review<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.750> guess

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
good I guess a good review I guess

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.770 
good I guess a good review I guess
that's<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.290> easiest<00:02:13.530> way

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
that's the easiest way

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.260 
that's the easiest way
coin<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.230> when<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.069> reality<00:02:15.250> i<00:02:15.610> think<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:15.970> PP

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
coin it when in reality i think the PP

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.900 
coin it when in reality i think the PP
19<00:02:16.720> isn't<00:02:17.260> always<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.680> best<00:02:17.920> weapon<00:02:18.580> for<00:02:18.790> the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
19 isn't always the best weapon for the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.670 
19 isn't always the best weapon for the
job<00:02:19.150> now<00:02:19.420> did<00:02:19.450> i<00:02:19.720> did<00:02:19.990> it<00:02:20.110> do<00:02:20.230> well<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.560> this

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
job now did i did it do well in this

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.860 
job now did i did it do well in this
situation<00:02:20.980> yes<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:22.150> reason<00:02:22.270> why<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.630> did

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
situation yes and the reason why it did

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.690 
situation yes and the reason why it did
well<00:02:23.080> was<00:02:23.319> because<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.860> has<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.069> lot<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.370> ammo

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
well was because it has a lot of ammo

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.699 
well was because it has a lot of ammo
and<00:02:25.510> it's<00:02:25.630> got<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.780> really<00:02:25.930> good<00:02:26.020> hip<00:02:26.260> fire<00:02:26.470> I

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
and it's got a really good hip fire I

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.740 
and it's got a really good hip fire I
you<00:02:27.370> know<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.580> high<00:02:27.670> rate<00:02:27.850> of<00:02:27.880> fire<00:02:28.000> at<00:02:28.420> what

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
you know the high rate of fire at what

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.720 
you know the high rate of fire at what
is<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:28.990> 900<00:02:29.410> rounds<00:02:29.530> per<00:02:29.800> minute<00:02:29.920> that's

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
is it 900 rounds per minute that's

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.890 
is it 900 rounds per minute that's
definitely<00:02:31.090> nice<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:31.300> have<00:02:31.569> in<00:02:31.720> close

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
definitely nice to have in close

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.780 
definitely nice to have in close
quarters<00:02:32.290> but<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.950> doesn't<00:02:33.370> help<00:02:33.489> that<00:02:33.610> it

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
quarters but it doesn't help that it

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.150 
quarters but it doesn't help that it
only<00:02:33.940> does<00:02:34.180> 16<00:02:34.690> points<00:02:35.110> I've<00:02:35.380> been<00:02:35.410> damaged<00:02:35.980> at

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
only does 16 points I've been damaged at

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.250 
only does 16 points I've been damaged at
its<00:02:36.280> maximum<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:37.060> right<00:02:37.420> up<00:02:37.450> close<00:02:37.720> it's<00:02:38.050> doing

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
its maximum so right up close it's doing

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.280 
its maximum so right up close it's doing
16.7<00:02:39.220> damage<00:02:39.610> which<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.360> some<00:02:40.630> of<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.840> minimum

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
16.7 damage which is some of the minimum

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.660 
16.7 damage which is some of the minimum
on<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.470> lot<00:02:41.709> of<00:02:41.830> weapons<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.250> know<00:02:42.340> it's<00:02:42.520> some

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
on a lot of weapons you know it's some

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.460 
on a lot of weapons you know it's some
of<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.790> further<00:02:43.120> out<00:02:43.209> distances<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.200> lot<00:02:44.380> of

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
of the further out distances a lot of

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.830 
of the further out distances a lot of
those<00:02:44.590> weapons<00:02:44.800> are<00:02:45.040> doing<00:02:45.310> 16.7<00:02:46.300> damage<00:02:46.630> so

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
those weapons are doing 16.7 damage so

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.840 
those weapons are doing 16.7 damage so
this<00:02:47.709> thing<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:47.920> very<00:02:48.220> interesting<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.790> think

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
this thing is very interesting I think

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.210 
this thing is very interesting I think
what<00:02:49.180> really<00:02:49.510> makes<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:50.170> attractive<00:02:50.290> in<00:02:51.010> some

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
what really makes it attractive in some

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.890 
what really makes it attractive in some
regards<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.000> fact<00:02:52.269> that<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.540> does<00:02:52.690> have<00:02:52.870> a

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
regards is the fact that it does have a

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.410 
regards is the fact that it does have a
lot<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.170> ammo<00:02:53.500> now<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:53.980> don't<00:02:54.580> be<00:02:54.850> like<00:02:55.090> me<00:02:55.120> in

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.280 
this game play I was an engineer and I
didn't<00:02:57.910> do<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.150> on<00:02:58.209> purpose<00:02:58.330> i<00:02:58.840> kept<00:02:59.110> i

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
realized that i shouldn't be an engineer

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.390 
realized that i shouldn't be an engineer
like<00:03:01.300> five<00:03:01.600> times<00:03:01.840> throughout<00:03:02.170> this<00:03:02.319> game<00:03:02.530> but

bar as soon as I die because I want to

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.910 
bar as soon as I die because I want to
get<00:03:13.750> back<00:03:13.870> in<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.170> action<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.590> mean<00:03:14.709> who<00:03:14.800> wants

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
get back in the action I mean who wants

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.650 
get back in the action I mean who wants
to<00:03:15.100> sit<00:03:15.280> there<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.459> watch<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.850> spawn<00:03:16.090> screen<00:03:16.450> so

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
to sit there and watch a spawn screen so

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.240 
to sit there and watch a spawn screen so
i<00:03:16.930> keep<00:03:17.260> forgetting<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.769> switch<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.160> either

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
i keep forgetting the switch to either

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.940 
i keep forgetting the switch to either
recon<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:18.910> or<00:03:19.060> support<00:03:19.930> i<00:03:20.110> eventually<00:03:20.500> do

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
recon it or support i eventually do

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.130 
recon it or support i eventually do
later<00:03:21.250> on<00:03:21.340> in<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.670> video<00:03:21.790> but<00:03:22.720> i<00:03:22.750> find<00:03:23.019> that

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
later on in the video but i find that

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.860 
later on in the video but i find that
either<00:03:23.290> playing<00:03:23.590> recon<00:03:24.130> maybe<00:03:25.030> assault<00:03:25.540> but

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
either playing recon maybe assault but

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.630 
either playing recon maybe assault but
yeah<00:03:26.200> i'm<00:03:26.470> not<00:03:26.620> really<00:03:26.769> a<00:03:26.860> big<00:03:27.040> assault<00:03:27.430> player

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
yeah i'm not really a big assault player

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.610 
yeah i'm not really a big assault player
but<00:03:27.940> recon<00:03:28.269> or<00:03:28.420> support<00:03:28.780> tends<00:03:29.079> to<00:03:29.290> be<00:03:29.440> the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
but recon or support tends to be the

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.000 
but recon or support tends to be the
best<00:03:29.860> idea<00:03:30.269> when<00:03:31.269> using<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.630> PP<00:03:31.900> 19<00:03:32.320> typically

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
best idea when using the PP 19 typically

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.199 
best idea when using the PP 19 typically
support<00:03:33.430> because<00:03:33.549> you<00:03:33.700> can<00:03:33.820> resupply

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
support because you can resupply

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.479 
support because you can resupply
yourself<00:03:34.780> but<00:03:35.019> like<00:03:35.799> I<00:03:35.890> was<00:03:36.010> saying<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.340> high

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
yourself but like I was saying the high

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.250 
yourself but like I was saying the high
ammo<00:03:36.760> counts<00:03:37.180> are<00:03:37.329> really<00:03:37.690> what<00:03:37.870> makes<00:03:38.079> this

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
ammo counts are really what makes this

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.560 
ammo counts are really what makes this
weapon<00:03:38.590> attractive<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.090> don't<00:03:40.239> really<00:03:40.360> aim

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
weapon attractive and I don't really aim

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.509 
weapon attractive and I don't really aim
it<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.780> lot<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:41.110> mean<00:03:41.590> if<00:03:41.680> you<00:03:41.769> watch<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.310> way<00:03:42.489> I

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
it a lot I mean if you watch the way I

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.250 
it a lot I mean if you watch the way I
get<00:03:42.820> a<00:03:42.850> lot<00:03:43.060> of<00:03:43.090> these<00:03:43.269> kills<00:03:43.570> I'm<00:03:43.870> just<00:03:44.109> hip

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
get a lot of these kills I'm just hip

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.870 
get a lot of these kills I'm just hip
firing<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:44.920> from<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.519> lot<00:03:45.730> of<00:03:45.760> people

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
firing it and from a lot of people

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.550 
firing it and from a lot of people
standpoints<00:03:46.660> they<00:03:46.750> might<00:03:46.930> watch<00:03:47.109> this<00:03:47.410> and

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
standpoints they might watch this and

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.170 
standpoints they might watch this and
say<00:03:47.650> well<00:03:47.829> this<00:03:47.920> is<00:03:48.100> sloppier<00:03:48.579> wasting<00:03:49.030> a<00:03:49.090> lot

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
say well this is sloppier wasting a lot

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.880 
say well this is sloppier wasting a lot
of<00:03:49.239> ammo<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.810> yeah<00:03:50.170> that's<00:03:50.410> true<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:50.799> am

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
of ammo and yeah that's true I am

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.770 
of ammo and yeah that's true I am
wasting<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.670> ton<00:03:51.850> of<00:03:51.880> ammo<00:03:52.209> I<00:03:52.329> will<00:03:52.480> be<00:03:52.660> the

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
wasting a ton of ammo I will be the

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.110 
wasting a ton of ammo I will be the
first<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:53.140> tell<00:03:53.320> you<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:53.459> this<00:03:54.459> was<00:03:54.700> not<00:03:54.850> one

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
first to tell you that this was not one

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.180 
first to tell you that this was not one
of<00:03:55.150> my<00:03:55.329> best<00:03:55.630> games<00:03:55.840> in<00:03:56.109> terms<00:03:56.320> of<00:03:56.470> aim<00:03:56.709> i<00:03:56.739> think

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
of my best games in terms of aim i think

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.819 
of my best games in terms of aim i think
using<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.150> PP<00:03:58.450> 19<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.079> just<00:03:59.230> trying<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.680> get

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
using the PP 19 and just trying to get

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.470 
using the PP 19 and just trying to get
hip<00:04:00.010> fire<00:04:00.190> kills<00:04:00.519> may<00:04:00.700> be<00:04:00.760> made<00:04:01.060> me<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:01.239> little

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
hip fire kills may be made me a little

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.140 
hip fire kills may be made me a little
bit<00:04:01.630> lazy<00:04:01.959> but<00:04:02.650> it's<00:04:02.769> effective<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.549> I<00:04:03.940> think

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
bit lazy but it's effective and I think

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.460 
bit lazy but it's effective and I think
that's<00:04:04.299> really<00:04:04.390> what's<00:04:04.780> important<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:05.290> don't

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
that's really what's important I don't

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.500 
that's really what's important I don't
really<00:04:05.590> care<00:04:05.859> about<00:04:06.010> accuracy<00:04:06.459> I<00:04:06.760> know<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.329> lot

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
really care about accuracy I know a lot

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.670 
really care about accuracy I know a lot
of<00:04:07.540> people<00:04:07.630> try<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.079> say<00:04:08.380> well<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.650> know

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
of people try to say well you know

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.960 
of people try to say well you know
accurate<00:04:09.130> players<00:04:09.340> are<00:04:09.519> good<00:04:09.640> players<00:04:09.850> and

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
accurate players are good players and

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.400 
accurate players are good players and
you're<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.209> hundred<00:04:10.540> percent<00:04:10.690> correct<00:04:11.200> when

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
you're a hundred percent correct when

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.620 
you're a hundred percent correct when
you<00:04:11.500> say<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:11.859> however<00:04:12.100> I<00:04:12.670> don't<00:04:13.209> think<00:04:13.480> it's

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
you say that however I don't think it's

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.210 
you say that however I don't think it's
really<00:04:14.019> that<00:04:14.049> big<00:04:14.470> of<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:14.650> deal<00:04:14.799> to<00:04:14.859> waste

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
really that big of a deal to waste

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.800 
really that big of a deal to waste
ammunition<00:04:15.549> I<00:04:15.940> mean<00:04:16.090> if<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.299> look<00:04:16.539> at<00:04:16.690> my

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
ammunition I mean if you look at my

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.449 
ammunition I mean if you look at my
accuracy<00:04:17.289> on<00:04:17.530> battlefield<00:04:17.979> 3<00:04:18.220> you<00:04:18.340> would

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
accuracy on battlefield 3 you would

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.310 
accuracy on battlefield 3 you would
probably<00:04:18.940> gasp<00:04:19.239> because<00:04:19.870> i<00:04:19.930> think<00:04:19.989> it's<00:04:20.200> like

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
probably gasp because i think it's like

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.110 
probably gasp because i think it's like
seventeen<00:04:20.799> percent<00:04:20.950> or<00:04:21.430> something<00:04:21.880> really

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
seventeen percent or something really

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.940 
seventeen percent or something really
low<00:04:22.360> like<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:23.080> that<00:04:23.500> can<00:04:23.680> be<00:04:23.770> attributed

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
low like that and that can be attributed

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.520 
low like that and that can be attributed
to<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.430> fact<00:04:24.460> that<00:04:24.789> i<00:04:24.940> do<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.330> lot<00:04:25.599> of<00:04:25.659> ammo<00:04:26.080> dump

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
to the fact that i do a lot of ammo dump

engaging me if there's multiple targets
i<00:04:37.030> tend<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.450> pop<00:04:37.630> fire<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.139> hip<00:04:38.260> fire<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.830> what

i tend to pop fire the hip fire and what

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.409 
i tend to pop fire the hip fire and what
i<00:04:39.100> mean<00:04:39.190> by<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.490> is<00:04:39.669> i<00:04:39.850> let<00:04:40.030> off<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.240> trigger

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
i mean by that is i let off the trigger

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:41.940 
i mean by that is i let off the trigger
like<00:04:40.780> you<00:04:40.900> saw<00:04:41.050> me<00:04:41.169> do<00:04:41.290> right<00:04:41.440> there<00:04:41.590> get<00:04:41.800> back

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
like you saw me do right there get back

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.980 
like you saw me do right there get back
on<00:04:42.130> target<00:04:42.370> that<00:04:43.000> way<00:04:43.120> I'm<00:04:43.270> not<00:04:43.300> just<00:04:43.630> spraying

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
on target that way I'm not just spraying

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.110 
on target that way I'm not just spraying
spraying<00:04:44.680> my<00:04:44.860> lead<00:04:45.130> hose<00:04:45.370> all<00:04:45.610> over<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:45.910> place

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
spraying my lead hose all over the place

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.460 
spraying my lead hose all over the place
to<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.360> point<00:04:46.570> where<00:04:46.690> I<00:04:46.750> run<00:04:46.960> out<00:04:47.020> of<00:04:47.139> ammo

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
to the point where I run out of ammo

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.540 
to the point where I run out of ammo
because<00:04:47.650> even<00:04:47.860> though<00:04:47.950> you've<00:04:48.100> got<00:04:48.220> fifty

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
because even though you've got fifty

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.190 
because even though you've got fifty
five<00:04:48.760> rounds<00:04:49.150> you<00:04:49.510> still<00:04:49.720> got<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:49.960> remember

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
five rounds you still got to remember

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.710 
five rounds you still got to remember
you're<00:04:50.530> shooting<00:04:51.310> no<00:04:51.520> 900<00:04:52.270> rounds<00:04:52.360> per<00:04:52.600> minute

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
you're shooting no 900 rounds per minute

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.930 
you're shooting no 900 rounds per minute
so<00:04:53.050> those<00:04:53.380> 55<00:04:53.889> rounds<00:04:54.310> aren't<00:04:54.460> going<00:04:54.669> to<00:04:54.760> last

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
so those 55 rounds aren't going to last

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.970 
so those 55 rounds aren't going to last
that<00:04:55.120> long<00:04:55.360> but<00:04:56.320> one<00:04:56.470> of<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.620> great<00:04:56.800> things

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
that long but one of the great things

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.220 
that long but one of the great things
about<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.280> PP<00:04:57.550> 19<00:04:57.910> that<00:04:58.090> i<00:04:58.120> can<00:04:58.419> say<00:04:58.660> positive

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
about the PP 19 that i can say positive

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.930 
about the PP 19 that i can say positive
about<00:04:59.500> it<00:04:59.560> is<00:04:59.860> even<00:05:00.250> though<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.550> doesn't<00:05:00.669> do<00:05:00.910> a

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
about it is even though it doesn't do a

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.030 
about it is even though it doesn't do a
lot<00:05:01.090> of<00:05:01.240> damage<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:01.780> even<00:05:02.080> though<00:05:02.260> i<00:05:02.290> tend<00:05:02.800> to

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
lot of damage and even though i tend to

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.610 
lot of damage and even though i tend to
not<00:05:03.370> really<00:05:03.790> like<00:05:04.000> it<00:05:04.180> that<00:05:04.390> much<00:05:04.419> it<00:05:05.260> does

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
not really like it that much it does

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.950 
not really like it that much it does
have<00:05:05.890> a<00:05:05.919> very<00:05:06.400> very<00:05:06.700> low<00:05:07.000> recoil<00:05:07.270> which<00:05:07.690> makes

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
have a very very low recoil which makes

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.690 
have a very very low recoil which makes
this<00:05:08.140> thing<00:05:08.380> awesome<00:05:08.950> for<00:05:09.190> long-range

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
this thing awesome for long-range

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.640 
this thing awesome for long-range
sniping<00:05:10.210> now<00:05:10.690> is<00:05:10.840> it<00:05:10.960> going<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.169> take<00:05:11.290> a<00:05:11.350> lot<00:05:11.590> of

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
sniping now is it going to take a lot of

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.350 
sniping now is it going to take a lot of
kills<00:05:11.950> yeah<00:05:12.160> probably<00:05:12.550> but<00:05:12.820> if<00:05:13.030> you're<00:05:13.150> if

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
kills yeah probably but if you're if

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.760 
kills yeah probably but if you're if
you're<00:05:13.540> popping<00:05:13.960> people<00:05:14.110> in<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.470> head<00:05:14.590> you

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
you're popping people in the head you

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.610 
you're popping people in the head you
can<00:05:14.919> take<00:05:15.070> him<00:05:15.190> down<00:05:15.370> fairly<00:05:15.669> quickly<00:05:16.060> so

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
can take him down fairly quickly so

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.140 
can take him down fairly quickly so
after<00:05:17.620> my<00:05:17.770> experiences<00:05:18.310> with<00:05:18.340> this<00:05:18.640> weapon<00:05:18.820> I

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
after my experiences with this weapon I

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.020 
after my experiences with this weapon I
waited<00:05:19.840> a<00:05:20.020> couple<00:05:20.050> days<00:05:20.530> to<00:05:20.919> finish<00:05:21.370> off<00:05:21.729> you

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
waited a couple days to finish off you

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.490 
waited a couple days to finish off you
know<00:05:22.150> do<00:05:22.360> some<00:05:22.570> more<00:05:22.720> some<00:05:22.990> more<00:05:23.020> games<00:05:23.320> with

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
know do some more some more games with

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.170 
know do some more some more games with
the<00:05:23.590> PP<00:05:23.860> 19<00:05:24.220> that<00:05:24.430> way<00:05:24.610> I<00:05:24.639> wasn't<00:05:25.060> you<00:05:25.150> know

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
the PP 19 that way I wasn't you know

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.440 
the PP 19 that way I wasn't you know
fresh<00:05:25.570> off<00:05:25.810> my<00:05:26.020> high<00:05:26.260> of<00:05:26.440> my<00:05:26.620> 95<00:05:27.610> kill<00:05:28.000> game<00:05:28.240> on

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
fresh off my high of my 95 kill game on

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.570 
fresh off my high of my 95 kill game on
close<00:05:28.690> quarters<00:05:29.139> and<00:05:29.320> I<00:05:29.950> kind<00:05:30.160> of<00:05:30.190> SAT<00:05:30.370> back

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
close quarters and I kind of SAT back

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.969 
close quarters and I kind of SAT back
and<00:05:30.640> thought<00:05:30.850> about<00:05:30.970> it<00:05:31.360> PP<00:05:31.900> 19<00:05:32.350> isn't<00:05:32.770> that

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
and thought about it PP 19 isn't that

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.890 
and thought about it PP 19 isn't that
bad<00:05:33.250> maybe<00:05:33.700> I<00:05:33.790> was<00:05:34.030> a<00:05:34.060> little<00:05:34.120> bit<00:05:34.600> overzealous

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
bad maybe I was a little bit overzealous

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.750 
bad maybe I was a little bit overzealous
when<00:05:35.380> I<00:05:35.440> said<00:05:35.710> it's<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:35.979> worst<00:05:36.190> weapon<00:05:36.580> in<00:05:36.669> the

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
when I said it's the worst weapon in the

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.310 
when I said it's the worst weapon in the
game<00:05:36.910> I<00:05:36.970> still<00:05:37.390> think<00:05:37.780> there's<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:38.080> lot<00:05:38.260> of

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
game I still think there's a lot of

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.409 
game I still think there's a lot of
weapons<00:05:38.560> I'd<00:05:38.860> rather<00:05:39.100> have<00:05:39.460> and<00:05:39.820> a<00:05:40.180> lot<00:05:40.210> of

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
weapons I'd rather have and a lot of

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.690 
weapons I'd rather have and a lot of
situations<00:05:40.720> in<00:05:41.229> the<00:05:41.320> PP<00:05:41.590> 19<00:05:41.979> I'm<00:05:42.220> still<00:05:42.490> having

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
situations in the PP 19 I'm still having

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.250 
situations in the PP 19 I'm still having
a<00:05:42.880> hard<00:05:42.910> time<00:05:43.180> trying<00:05:43.660> to<00:05:43.870> think<00:05:44.080> of<00:05:44.200> a

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
a hard time trying to think of a

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.560 
a hard time trying to think of a
situation<00:05:44.440> where<00:05:44.919> the<00:05:45.010> PP<00:05:45.280> 19<00:05:45.669> really<00:05:46.120> excels

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
situation where the PP 19 really excels

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.529 
situation where the PP 19 really excels
but<00:05:47.320> it<00:05:47.410> is<00:05:47.590> an<00:05:48.010> okay<00:05:48.490> weapon<00:05:48.880> you<00:05:49.030> can<00:05:49.240> get

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
but it is an okay weapon you can get

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.210 
but it is an okay weapon you can get
good<00:05:49.720> yeah<00:05:50.110> look<00:05:50.470> at<00:05:50.560> that<00:05:50.590> stupid<00:05:50.950> knife

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220
