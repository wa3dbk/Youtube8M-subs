for old leaders these two leaders are in
generic<00:00:17.460> packaging<00:00:18.180> just<00:00:18.300> because<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.779> did<00:00:18.960> not

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
generic packaging just because I did not

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.560 
generic packaging just because I did not
want<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.910> point<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.150> any<00:00:21.210> specific

basically we've all been there go to the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.370 
basically we've all been there go to the
store<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.160> buy<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> liter<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:36.030> open<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.020> up<00:00:37.110> and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
store you buy a liter you open it up and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.260 
store you buy a liter you open it up and
it's<00:00:37.829> coiled<00:00:38.730> mess<00:00:39.090> such<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:41.149> you<00:00:42.149> know

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
it's coiled mess such as this you know

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.549 
it's coiled mess such as this you know
you<00:00:42.360> go<00:00:42.600> through<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> process<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.200> stretching

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
you go through the process of stretching

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.569 
you go through the process of stretching
and<00:00:43.820> straightening<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.059> tugging<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.200> it

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
and straightening it tugging on it

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.000 
and straightening it tugging on it
trying<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:48.050> get<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> point<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.770> can

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
trying to get to the point that you can

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.600 
trying to get to the point that you can
fly<00:00:50.670> fish<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:52.350> problem<00:00:52.559> with<00:00:53.280> having

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
fly fish with it the problem with having

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.910 
fly fish with it the problem with having
coils<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.570> leader<00:00:54.780> such<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.649> that

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
coils and a leader such as this is that

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.760 
coils and a leader such as this is that
energy<00:00:56.340> travels<00:00:56.730> through<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> straight<00:00:57.180> line

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
energy travels through a straight line

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.610 
energy travels through a straight line
there's<00:00:58.770> not<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> whole<00:00:59.100> lot<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.539> straightness

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
there's not a whole lot of straightness

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.709 
there's not a whole lot of straightness
shown<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.760> even<00:01:03.090> when<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.510> flying

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
shown here so even when this is flying

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.210 
shown here so even when this is flying
through<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> air<00:01:04.080> after<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.890> know<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
through the air after you you know it

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.440 
through the air after you you know it
straightens<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.700> when<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.880> put<00:01:06.030> pressure<00:01:06.210> on

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
straightens out when you put pressure on

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.030 
straightens out when you put pressure on
it

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
it

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.090 
it
but<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.310> has<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.909> memory<00:01:09.720> built<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.170> so

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
but it has the memory built in so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.710 
but it has the memory built in so
therefore<00:01:11.490> your<00:01:11.610> casting<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.390> not<00:01:12.540> what

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
therefore your casting is just not what

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.910 
therefore your casting is just not what
it<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:13.110> could<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.960> basically<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.860> is

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
it really could be so basically that is

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.760 
it really could be so basically that is
one<00:01:17.340> problem<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> standard

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
one problem with the this is a standard

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.700 
one problem with the this is a standard
tapered<00:01:20.189> monofilament<00:01:20.700> cleaner<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.530> is

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
tapered monofilament cleaner now this is

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.640 
tapered monofilament cleaner now this is
a<00:01:22.740> step<00:01:23.220> up<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.880> one<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> larger

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
a step up this is one of the larger

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.289 
a step up this is one of the larger
distributors<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.830> furrow<00:01:26.580> bleeders<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
distributors of furrow bleeders on the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.859 
distributors of furrow bleeders on the
market<00:01:28.820> but<00:01:29.820> again<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.210> open<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
market but again you open it out of the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.649 
market but again you open it out of the
container<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.880> go<00:01:32.880> through<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> process<00:01:33.540> of

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
container you go through the process of

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.240 
container you go through the process of
untangling<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:36.829> you<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.070> do<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
untangling it and you have to do the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.330 
untangling it and you have to do the
same<00:01:38.430> thing<00:01:39.290> straight<00:01:40.290> knit<00:01:40.560> tag<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.159> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
same thing straight knit tag on it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.770 
same thing straight knit tag on it
stretch<00:01:41.610> it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
stretch it

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.910 
stretch it
try<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.500> uncoil<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.820> know<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:46.140> no<00:01:46.799> matter

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
try to uncoil it you know and no matter

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.080 
try to uncoil it you know and no matter
what<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.820> one's<00:01:48.030> been

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
what you do and this one's been

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.389 
what you do and this one's been
straightened<00:01:48.600> already<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> few<00:01:49.110> times<00:01:49.290> now<00:01:49.560> it

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
straightened already a few times now it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.050 
straightened already a few times now it
never<00:01:50.899> fully<00:01:52.790> loses<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.149> memory<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.720> again

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
never fully loses the memory and again

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.010 
never fully loses the memory and again

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
curves or kinks on memory in a liter

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.870 
curves or kinks on memory in a liter
equates<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.140> loss<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.799> energy<00:02:01.979> bottom<00:02:02.700> line

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
equates to loss of energy bottom line

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.930 
equates to loss of energy bottom line
that's<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:04.439> law<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.619> physics<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:06.770> here

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
that's just the law of physics so here

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.900 
that's just the law of physics so here
is<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.000> thread<00:02:09.539> for<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.750> leader

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
is a thread for a leader

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.240 
is a thread for a leader
and<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:12.200> basically<00:02:12.530> open<00:02:12.740> it<00:02:12.950> out<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.190> the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
and you basically open it out of the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.820

offer two ends one with a metal loop
which<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.540> really<00:02:59.900> difficult<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.440> see<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:00.920> this

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
which is really difficult to see in this

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.850 
which is really difficult to see in this
video<00:03:01.490> and<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:02.930> show-up<00:03:03.110> loop<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:03.740> can

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
video and a show-up loop that you can

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.590 
video and a show-up loop that you can
tell<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.130> tip<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.370> directly<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.850> this<00:03:05.360> makes

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
tell you tip it directly to this makes

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.520 
tell you tip it directly to this makes
time<00:03:06.110> tip<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:06.530> very<00:03:06.710> easy<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:09.020> then<00:03:09.200> basically

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
time tip it very easy and then basically

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.080 
time tip it very easy and then basically
you<00:03:09.620> tie<00:03:09.860> on<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.100> length<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.370> tip<00:03:10.580> it<00:03:10.730> anywhere

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
you tie on a length of tip it anywhere

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.820 
you tie on a length of tip it anywhere
