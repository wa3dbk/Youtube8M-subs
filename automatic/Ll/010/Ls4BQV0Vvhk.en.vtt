00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
guy that people expect the world of but

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.630 
guy that people expect the world of but
maybe<00:01:25.229> he's<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.560> not<00:01:25.679> that<00:01:25.799> type<00:01:26.039> of<00:01:26.250> player

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.880 
maybe he's just not that type of player
does<00:01:27.240> he<00:01:27.420> possess<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.810> picture<00:01:28.259> perfect<00:01:28.469> swing

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890

does he possess a picture perfect swing
he<00:01:29.069> absolutely<00:01:29.490> does<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.479> think<00:01:30.749> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
he absolutely does but I think the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.599 
he absolutely does but I think the
expectations<00:01:31.679> have<00:01:31.799> been<00:01:31.829> way<00:01:32.130> too<00:01:32.159> high<00:01:32.579> on

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
expectations have been way too high on

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.669 
expectations have been way too high on
him<00:01:33.030> that's<00:01:33.569> just<00:01:33.689> let<00:01:33.929> him<00:01:34.049> play<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.259> see<00:01:34.560> how

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
him that's just let him play and see how

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.029 
him that's just let him play and see how
he<00:01:34.740> does<00:01:34.829> today<00:01:35.420> strike<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.689> Gonzalez<00:01:37.140> he's

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
he does today strike to Gonzalez he's

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.279 
he does today strike to Gonzalez he's
got<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.369> careful<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.880> two<00:01:39.840> strikes<00:01:40.140> out

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
got to be careful here two strikes out

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:41.539 
got to be careful here two strikes out
and<00:01:40.349> they're<00:01:40.560> probably<00:01:40.829> gonna<00:01:41.099> throw<00:01:41.399> him<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
and they're probably gonna throw him the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.800 
and they're probably gonna throw him the
slider<00:01:41.880> here<00:01:42.270> he<00:01:42.509> struggled<00:01:42.959> with<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:44.689> and<00:01:45.689> now

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
slider here he struggled with it and now
