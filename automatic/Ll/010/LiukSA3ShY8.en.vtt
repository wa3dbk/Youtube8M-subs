00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140

can<00:02:56.400> move<00:02:56.580> around<00:02:56.700> it's<00:02:57.180> got<00:02:57.300> fantastic<00:02:57.480> range

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
can move around it's got fantastic range

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.150 
can move around it's got fantastic range
of<00:02:58.170> Parsons<00:02:58.560> well<00:02:58.710> which<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:58.950> great<00:02:59.130> for

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
of Parsons well which is great for

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.010 
of Parsons well which is great for
playing<00:02:59.490> him<00:02:59.610> as<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.790> left<00:03:00.150> midfielder<00:03:00.630> that's

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
playing him as a left midfielder that's

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.150 
playing him as a left midfielder that's
probably<00:03:01.260> where<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.440> would<00:03:01.620> say<00:03:01.770> his<00:03:01.920> best

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
probably where I would say his best

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.950 
probably where I would say his best
position<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.670> due<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.090> his<00:03:03.210> lack<00:03:03.240> of<00:03:03.420> pace<00:03:03.720> I

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
position is due to his lack of pace I

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.660 
position is due to his lack of pace I
don't<00:03:04.320> really<00:03:04.410> see<00:03:04.500> him<00:03:04.680> being<00:03:04.860> as<00:03:05.040> dynamic<00:03:05.310> as

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
don't really see him being as dynamic as

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.330 
don't really see him being as dynamic as
a<00:03:06.000> left<00:03:06.210> winger<00:03:06.480> or<00:03:06.660> as<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:07.110> left<00:03:07.350> forward<00:03:07.800> but

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
a left winger or as a left forward but

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.860
