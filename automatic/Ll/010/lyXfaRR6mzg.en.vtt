00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
 everyone knows or peps and 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.290
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.730
 new video on how to download 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.270
 the ideal is for free 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.040
 applications 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.599
 so you can see to see no you 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.480
 can have for now I'm stupid 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.949
 but that's just what it is 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.270
 that one of the fc was simply 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.090
 bonuses or points that can be purchased 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.920
 directly on applications to 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.930
 from a store the most 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.590
 often but it's often with 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.460
 real money 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.460
 and like 50% of people who have a 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.860
 iphone or ipod we do not like to pay 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.200
 so the app I will show you 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.600
 that she works 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.980
 so here I bought knows how much 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.360
 those thirty thousand points I bought 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.239
 thirty thousand points out of twelve diop 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.219
 normally he asks me to confirm 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.360
 the transaction and my password you 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.430
 can you see that it's adding 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.370
 directly and no penny was removed 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.719
 On my account 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.149
 so this app 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.850
 she is on cydia so yes he 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.520
 must own an ipod or an iphone 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.379
 jailbroken 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.350
 personally I sweat the finder 5.1.1 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:14.250
 it should not be a problem for 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:18.080
 the other firmwares except for the 6.0 I 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.960
 do not know if they are walking on the 6.0 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:28.799
 finally you will see that for yourself but 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.810
 one is the bone 6.0 it is really for 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.870
 the ipod or iphone jailbroken know 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.510
 truly not 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.070
 a great finally I find what is 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.370
 most cydia apps do not 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.800
 not walk and sources installs 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.780
 cover no longer so he must go 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.480
 you have to add this source 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.480
 he must neither at point org slash rest 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:02:01.690
 So this one must horde get loose 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:06.490
 rest here you add it ok you have 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:11.070
 in or search and you go on 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.070
 ip unlocker bl it's just 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.080
 supported the OCCAR dlc so you install the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.960
 I'm already going to install which I'm not going 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.870
 their only one because already 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.110
 would perform the registration and this 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.720
 would be useless 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.010
 then once you're going to raise 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.740
 your idevice 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:39.160
 you can the forgiveness app is 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.620
 installed so you can go back on 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.470
 the game you want and install 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.180
 the bonus so it does not work out 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.520
 all applications but the 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.180
 applications or it does not work it's 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.040
 really rare so it does not work 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.500
 either they tell you that the store is 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:02.440
 inaccessible self and the application leaves 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.070
 but it's rare so once I have 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.020
 downloaded 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.680
 you can go to the store and as 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.560
 you saw it just now 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.200
 well it just works 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.940
 so especially if he asks you to 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.650
 confirm the transaction and your word of 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.209
 past 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.360
 do not limit because that means 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.450
 whether the plant to be planted is 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.240
 the application does not work finally there 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.990
 is no reason that 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.400
 that it does not work or that 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.370
 the installation had planted of course 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.800
 but especially she had never been 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.990
 Your password 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.140
 owen or never confirmed a 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:44.640
 transaction 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.640
 so it's long this loading it so 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.030
 go 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:14.290
 olala named clear during this time 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:18.850
 I do not mind going to Ben 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.020
 so so like any alcohol wanted 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.900
 show it just now you can 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:28.080
 buy your points or opaque or where I do not 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:33.670
 know what in more applications 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:36.880
 send it there it was not pulling a 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:39.420
 short video but a mini tutorial on 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.960
 how to have the dlc applications 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:45.460
 free from cydia so 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.220
