00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
I really use those too often but I do

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.059 
I really use those too often but I do
have<00:04:08.449> them<00:04:08.750> I<00:04:08.930> used<00:04:09.379> to<00:04:09.500> use<00:04:09.620> them<00:04:09.799> a<00:04:09.889> bunch

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
have them I used to use them a bunch

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.240 
have them I used to use them a bunch

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
these are just some fine liner ones in

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.059 
these are just some fine liner ones in
different<00:04:13.549> colors<00:04:15.880> little<00:04:16.880> pack

which is ever-diminishing

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.850 
which is ever-diminishing
which<00:04:25.740> is<00:04:25.919> unfortunate<00:04:26.610> because<00:04:26.789> I<00:04:27.860> don't

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
which is unfortunate because I don't

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.800 
which is unfortunate because I don't
know<00:04:29.009> if<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.250> can<00:04:29.370> get<00:04:29.520> more<00:04:29.849> so<00:04:30.240> I'm<00:04:30.419> really

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
know if I can get more so I'm really

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.439 
know if I can get more so I'm really
holding<00:04:31.139> off<00:04:31.289> using<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:32.130> standard<00:04:32.910> USPS

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
holding off using a standard USPS

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.159 
holding off using a standard USPS
because<00:04:34.130> I'm<00:04:35.130> running<00:04:35.340> low<00:04:35.669> so<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:36.660> do<00:04:36.900> have<00:04:37.110> a

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
because I'm running low so I do have a

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.920 
because I'm running low so I do have a
bunch<00:04:37.289> more<00:04:37.410> of<00:04:37.650> these<00:04:38.569> somewhere<00:04:39.569> else<00:04:39.720> and
