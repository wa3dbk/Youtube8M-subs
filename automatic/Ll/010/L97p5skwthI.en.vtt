still<00:01:37.770> think<00:01:37.950> he'll<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.160> a<00:01:38.190> 94<00:01:38.670> rated<00:01:38.910> card<00:01:39.120> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
still think he'll be a 94 rated card I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.280 
still think he'll be a 94 rated card I
believe<00:01:39.420> there's<00:01:39.600> something<00:01:39.870> in<00:01:39.960> his<00:01:40.050> EA

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
believe there's something in his EA

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.290 
believe there's something in his EA
clause<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.920> his<00:01:40.980> contract<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.520> he<00:01:42.000> has<00:01:42.120> to<00:01:42.210> be

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
clause in his contract that he has to be

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.030 
clause in his contract that he has to be
the<00:01:42.390> highest<00:01:42.660> rated<00:01:42.960> player<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.350> game<00:01:43.530> so

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the highest rated player on the game so

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.350 
the highest rated player on the game so
get<00:01:44.220> onto<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.550> and<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.760> other<00:01:44.790> two<00:01:45.090> players

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
get onto that and the other two players

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.630 
get onto that and the other two players
with<00:01:45.510> what<00:01:45.660> I<00:01:45.690> later<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.220> terms<00:01:47.370> of<00:01:47.490> his

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
with what I later on but in terms of his

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.040 
with what I later on but in terms of his
stats<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:48.090> drops<00:01:48.300> his<00:01:48.390> pace<00:01:48.600> down<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.870> little

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
stats with drops his pace down a little

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.320 
stats with drops his pace down a little
bit<00:01:49.230> obviously<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.430> world<00:01:50.640> cup<00:01:50.850> does<00:01:51.090> not

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
bit obviously the world cup does not

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.650 
bit obviously the world cup does not
include<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:52.410> he<00:01:52.560> did<00:01:52.800> in<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.760> last<00:01:54.180> season

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
include what he did in the last season

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.870 
include what he did in the last season
so<00:01:54.870> during<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.590> World<00:01:55.770> Cup<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.130> saw<00:01:56.340> him<00:01:56.520> skip

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
so during the World Cup I saw him skip

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.670 
so during the World Cup I saw him skip
plus<00:01:57.120> past<00:01:57.570> players<00:01:57.900> at<00:01:58.140> their<00:01:58.290> front<00:01:58.500> and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
plus past players at their front and

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.440 
plus past players at their front and
center<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.580> if<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.760> was<00:01:59.850> based<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.180> World

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
center and so if it was based on World

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.180 
center and so if it was based on World
Cup<00:02:00.690> stats<00:02:01.080> I'd<00:02:01.350> give<00:02:01.470> his<00:02:01.590> pace<00:02:01.830> probably

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
Cup stats I'd give his pace probably

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.130 
Cup stats I'd give his pace probably
maybe<00:02:02.340> one<00:02:02.610> upgrade<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.450> terms<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.990> for

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
maybe one upgrade but in terms of for

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.360 
maybe one upgrade but in terms of for
Barcelona<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.740> year<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.040> know<00:02:05.070> he<00:02:05.250> was

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
Barcelona this year you know he was

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.860 
Barcelona this year you know he was
injured<00:02:05.580> a<00:02:05.700> lot<00:02:05.730> and<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.420> didn't<00:02:06.660> really<00:02:06.690> see

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
injured a lot and I didn't really see

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.960 
injured a lot and I didn't really see
him<00:02:07.170> use<00:02:07.320> his<00:02:07.350> pace<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.920> much<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.670> decided

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
him use his pace that much so I decided

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.249 
him use his pace that much so I decided
to<00:02:09.119> drop<00:02:09.209> his<00:02:09.269> pace<00:02:09.599> down<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.869> little<00:02:10.050> bit

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
to drop his pace down a little bit

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.900 
to drop his pace down a little bit
dribbling<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.129> shooting<00:02:11.190> kept<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.790> same

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
dribbling and shooting kept the same

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.540 
dribbling and shooting kept the same
because<00:02:12.210> obviously<00:02:12.330> as<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:12.630> said<00:02:12.840> he<00:02:13.320> he<00:02:13.950> was

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
because obviously as I said he he was

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.040 
because obviously as I said he he was
injured<00:02:15.030> for<00:02:15.150> most<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.450> season<00:02:15.570> but<00:02:15.810> still

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
injured for most of the season but still

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.750 
injured for most of the season but still
managed<00:02:16.320> about<00:02:16.500> 48<00:02:17.130> goals<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.460> think<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.670> was

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
managed about 48 goals I think it was

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.130 
managed about 48 goals I think it was
something<00:02:18.000> ridiculous<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.050> was

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
something ridiculous so it was

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.770 
something ridiculous so it was
absolutely<00:02:19.470> fantastic<00:02:20.270> he<00:02:21.270> also<00:02:21.390> bagged<00:02:21.660> a

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
absolutely fantastic he also bagged a

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.660 
absolutely fantastic he also bagged a
ton<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.170> assists<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:22.680> season<00:02:22.890> so

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
ton of assists this season so

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.490 
ton of assists this season so
upgrading<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.300> passing<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.720> little<00:02:24.900> bit<00:02:25.050> kept

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
upgrading is passing a little bit kept

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.080 
upgrading is passing a little bit kept
defending<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.980> same<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.640> we've<00:02:26.790> dropped<00:02:26.910> his

heading down a little bit because you

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.809

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
heading by one because I don't think he

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.650 
heading by one because I don't think he
scored<00:04:48.400> that<00:04:48.490> many<00:04:48.550> you<00:04:48.790> know<00:04:48.880> even<00:04:49.030> I<00:04:49.330> think

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
scored that many you know even I think

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.720 
scored that many you know even I think
he's<00:04:49.780> six<00:04:50.020> foot<00:04:50.170> four<00:04:50.470> six<00:04:50.770> foot<00:04:50.920> five<00:04:51.130> for

such<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:51.910> tall<00:04:52.150> bloke<00:04:52.330> he<00:04:52.510> doesn't<00:04:52.750> score<00:04:52.900> that

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
such a tall bloke he doesn't score that

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.630 
such a tall bloke he doesn't score that
many<00:04:53.200> headers<00:04:53.560> so<00:04:54.010> I<00:04:54.070> thought<00:04:54.190> I'd<00:04:54.340> drop<00:04:54.490> his

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
many headers so I thought I'd drop his

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.600 
many headers so I thought I'd drop his
heading<00:04:54.910> down<00:04:55.090> a<00:04:55.120> little<00:04:55.360> bit<00:04:55.540> but<00:04:55.990> overall

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
heading down a little bit but overall
