 gives very nice things and I say it does 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.250
 because it is a little detail and because simple and 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.229
 he simply wants to give things that 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.479
 day because you know what the 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.369
 intention is what counts but what happens 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.410
 when at work the school 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.850
 friends , their 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.850
 famous exchanges 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.180
 to begin with, it 's in your papers and in the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.950
 mentalist arrive off 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.420
 and in this same list they come to put the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.980
 things that they do not like or 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.420
 when he is with friends he is very father 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.700
 because you want or not you already know the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.370
 people their tastes and all that already more or 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.140
 the less you know what to give what happened 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.760
 you touched in the exchange look at 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.040
 card or visit fort with this pretty 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.260

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.840
 thousands of love that the presence 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.120
 nothing you put a chain so that 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.770
 It smells delicious I would love it 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.200
 give away pure truths 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.200
 you no longer need your tenacity and that nothing 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.550
 I already know you I already know you 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.590
 but seriously good friends you 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.360
 they know one way or another but what 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.250
 happens when the exchanges are from 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.290
 work of the school that if they believe you to 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.240
 your boss and you touched the thermos ballast or that 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.010
 You had to give the gift to the girl who 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.090
 more hates open tele you have to take your 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.090
 little piece of paper is like this thanks after 115 your quota 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.440
 and this does not change of paper is that I 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.590
 touched man i wish and the truth does not fall 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.590
 all right 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.040
 but good the truth is very typical that 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.660
 the pieces of paper that become the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.099
 exchanges get to put things 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.720
 that they like so that they can 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.730
 give away not if the person touched you 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.620
 name or something like that know what it is that you 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.060
 like it there and then you laugh at some of 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.310
 these things that you came to put but 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.400
 the truth is that you never peel the list 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.170
 it's never like a curse to know 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.760
 you tell me if it's not true you put on 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.380
 on the list that you are allergic to 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.890
 chocolates the first thing they bring to you is 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.680
 this 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.680
 mediate chocolatitos the richest 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.269
 what I mean but good in the end 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.840
 not really the chocolatitos and they happen 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.269
 in an exchange 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.480
 but the things that give that really 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:20.239
 because that's how they hated the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.400
 person what happens and so you buy him 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.410
 a teddy bear of 100 pretty pesitos 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.750
 nice and you look for the best and try that 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.280
 that they looked very sick and 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.049
 lasted to see if I am no matter what you 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.489
 You have passed the price because you know that 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.080
 it's worth it and you know if you 're going to give it 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.360
 a person who actually cares for him 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.099
 and place to defend he goes to sleep with him and 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.660
 she will hug him and she will love it and 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.239
 good typical you already endeavor to 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.610
 buy your gift and this beautiful and you 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.160

 because you loved it and you loved it and it 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.910

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.790
 gift that they have to give as a 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:09.140
 scarf some shorts are some movies 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.670
 or some gloves so that the gift 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.819
 be equal not different from color 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.590
 different size different style but 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.109
 that can give them again I repeat 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.030
 what is the matter with people 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.709
