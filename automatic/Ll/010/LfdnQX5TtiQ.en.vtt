00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.369
 revolucion Putin before I leave with him 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.029
 talked asked to pass the most 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.579
 good wishes 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.300
 you have very good working contacts 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:35.610
 personal contact and it is very important for 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.980
 between the court of a real relationship you are like two 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.329
 the leader of our states you set the vector 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.550
 political development 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.500
 this fact that you already four times in this 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.989
 year met says a lot and not 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.940
 just met and on each of your 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.449
 meeting this new arrangement is all this 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.829
 new incentive for our grandfathers with 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.390
 ministries and departments to step up on 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.300
 working contacts to implement those 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.519
 agreed that reached on 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.870
 top level 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.780
 We believe that the inter-parliamentary model 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.970
 This is a very important part in general. 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.220
 the whole complex of Russian Kyrgyz 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.220
 relationships we can and should play 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.440
 important role on our interstate 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.850
 relationship the relevance of this is increasing 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.520
 Now somehow the Kyrgyz Republic 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.119
 actively involved in the process of Eurasian 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.360
 integration to this, respectively, require 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.770
 making a big package 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.670
 regulatory legal acts and in 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.430
 harmonization 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.040
 our national legislations and in 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.620
 In this context, we need to be even tighter 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.230
 Gorbunki press 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.530
 federal assembly council of federation still 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.560
 work harder synchronize our 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.790
 execution actions 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.010
 domestic procedures I already 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.830
 colleagues said yesterday that when 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.540
 concerns Kyrgyzstan and political 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.360
 leadership of parliament is absolute 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.330
 consensus side expansion and development 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.220
 links with Kyrgyzstan therefore you always give 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.370
 I will highlight the street to consider including 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.920
 priority we ratified the whole 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.830
 package of agreements and contracts which 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.700
 were imprisoned and of course today 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.550
 the main issue on the agenda is the movement 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.430
 Kirghiz side of Eurasian integration 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.890
 we really appreciate this choice not only 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.530
 political leadership of the Kyrgyz people 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.710
 Kyrgyz because you are absolutely right 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.490
 what our peoples bind and common 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.290
 history of friendship of mutual respect 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.910
 sympathy today in this complex 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.950
 global world one by one 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.440
 no state will be able to call 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.600
 only by joining forces multiply our 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.970
 efforts we can be competitive 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.680
 capable we can create new 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.470
 opportunities for accelerated development 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.170
 our Canada and Eurasian economic 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.209
 union 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.340
 in my opinion has great prospects 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.819
 he is very attractive and economically 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.970
 beer in terms of that capacity 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.970
 which the state has 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.770
 this is an integrational union and how are you 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.730
 know interest in him is big not only 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:17.319
 cis countries here Kyrgyzstan but also 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.680
 foreign countries think that's 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.280
 will give more such extra give birth and 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.880
 we have negotiated parliament now 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.819
 sucked meeting with the prime minister and 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.220
 very happy such a good combat 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.799
 mindset to complete it 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.560
 years on all domestic 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.150
 procedures it is clear that it is not simple 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.519
 the task here is really everyone needs 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.590
 roll up your sleeves because so much 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:49.760
 short time it is necessary to take not only 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.500
 document package important it and technically 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.410
 standards and regulations 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.989
 this infrastructure since case 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.290
 incorporating Kyrgyzstan single economic 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.360
 union on this will be better than our borders 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.120
 Customs Union and Eurasian 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.280
 economic union but the main thing is 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.510
 political will we feel it is 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.400
 on the unity of the president executive and 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.609
 legislative power and support 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.489

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.470

 Eurasian Economic Union he 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:30.950
 based on equal absolutely base 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.960
 no older younger you know everything 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.720
 the decision will be made by consensus a 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.120
 This is a guarantee that national 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.260
 interests of each country 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.729
 features will be taken into account when 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:46.210
 decision making and russia provided 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:50.330
 ready to continue to provide support

 Eurasian Economic Union also 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.910
 it seems very good to me 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.460
 effective format for creating Russian 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.220
 Kyrgyz Development Fund with content

 problem- free problem- free we don't have 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.040
 some contradictions fruitful 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.230
 Cooperation of Russia and Kyrgyzstan is not 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.240
 only important factor of our bilateral 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.120

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:40.789
 breakthrough we can say that Gazprom 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:43.849
 went to Kyrgyzstan and became the owner for 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:45.859
 transport networks is very important and it is 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:46.669
 the world's largest company with large 

00:06:45.859 --> 00:06:48.829
 potential 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:51.499
 they plan to invest more big

 provide guaranteed gas supply 

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:05.689
 with increasing need for 

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:09.049
 economic development is a reduced price 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:13.369
