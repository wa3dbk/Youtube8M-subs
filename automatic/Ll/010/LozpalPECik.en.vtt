00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.290
 take a square sheet then alas in 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.290
 two diagonally 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.590
 then folded this tip on this one 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.450
 then this point on that one 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.930
 do the same thing on the other side 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.269

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.659
 this 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.190
 we get this very classic form 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.010
 for origamis you have to take this 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.880
 part so with the side that opens 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.450
 to the left and the foot on the center 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.450
 like this 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.770
 make the same fold on the other side 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.310
 make the same fold since the water in not 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.310
 taking that this flaw not the others 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.190
 return the sheet repay the same 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.080
 parties that just now 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.080
 either the sides towards the center 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:33.349
 you should get this form you have to 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:39.830
 open on this side then lower this 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:42.160
 part it does the same thing of the other 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.160
 side 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.920
 then you have to open its parts the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.180
 open to fold back on itself in 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.180
 along the central line 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.550
 plus half on the back 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.930
 do the same thing on the other side 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.360
 turn everything around and do the same thing 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.360
 this side 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.470
 once you have finished his prices he 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:12.490
 must pay this part down to 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:14.850
 maximum always along the line 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.850
 power plant 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.200
 tour and do the same thing of the other 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.200
 side 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.740
 tour and do the same thing on the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.740
 two other parties 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.570
 once you have this form you 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.490
 just open the center is 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.790
