definitely preseason is always a good

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.569 
definitely preseason is always a good
time<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:45.350> prove<00:00:46.350> yourself<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.280> you've<00:00:47.399> got

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
time to prove yourself so if you've got

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.479 
time to prove yourself so if you've got
to<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.570> start<00:00:48.980> from<00:00:49.980> start<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.309> season

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to get a start from start the season

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.869 
to get a start from start the season
which<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.879> did<00:00:51.000> last<00:00:51.210> year<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:52.850> luckily<00:00:53.850> I

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
which I did last year and luckily I

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.240 
which I did last year and luckily I
continued<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.510> form<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.890> helped

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
continued that form and that helped

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.950 
continued that form and that helped
towards<00:00:56.550> more<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.329> season<00:00:57.600> ahead<00:00:57.690> last

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
towards more the season ahead last

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.200 
towards more the season ahead last
season<00:00:58.260> yes<00:00:58.410> or<00:00:58.590> preseason<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.670> important<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
season yes or preseason is important and

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.260 
season yes or preseason is important and
hopefully<00:01:00.420> after<00:01:01.260> another<00:01:01.590> good<00:01:01.770> start<00:01:02.270> did

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
hopefully after another good start did

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.479 
hopefully after another good start did
you<00:01:03.359> expect<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.799> full<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.040> season

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
you expect to have that full of season

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.399 
you expect to have that full of season
as<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.790> did<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.479> last<00:01:06.510> campaign<00:01:06.869> play

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
as you did in the last campaign play

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.050 
as you did in the last campaign play
that<00:01:07.590> many<00:01:07.799> games<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.670> much<00:01:08.820> publicity

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
that many games have that much publicity

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.850 
that many games have that much publicity
do<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.200> well<00:01:10.760> too<00:01:11.760> far<00:01:12.000> didn't<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.540> done<00:01:12.860> much

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
do that well too far didn't I done much

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.590 
do that well too far didn't I done much
better<00:01:14.040> than<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.310> switch<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.700> towards<00:01:15.000> just

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
better than a switch a towards just

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.630 
better than a switch a towards just
being<00:01:16.020> around<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.560> team<00:01:16.590> staying<00:01:17.070> involved

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
being around the team staying involved

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.600 
being around the team staying involved
it's<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.450> tough<00:01:18.659> League<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.170> obviously<00:01:20.040> being

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
18 it's hard to be consistent in that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.940 
18 it's hard to be consistent in that

about the championships are going into
the<00:02:44.190> season<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.610> know<00:02:44.760> what<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.000> expect

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
the season and I know what to expect

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.570 
the season and I know what to expect
more<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.920> like<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:46.980> said<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.160> feel<00:02:47.220> like<00:02:47.430> I've

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
more and like I said I feel like I've
