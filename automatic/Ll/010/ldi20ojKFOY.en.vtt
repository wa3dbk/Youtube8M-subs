isn't there Alex Oh have you ever scored
a<00:00:04.319> better<00:00:04.589> girl<00:00:04.799> than<00:00:04.830> that<00:00:05.069> one<00:00:05.330> of<00:00:06.330> Scott's

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
a better girl than that one of Scott's

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.870 
a better girl than that one of Scott's
similar<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.770> go<00:00:08.010> when<00:00:08.280> i<00:00:08.309> played<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:08.639> no

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
similar to that go when i played in no

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.379 
similar to that go when i played in no
way<00:00:09.059> for<00:00:09.719> rosenberg<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:10.469> i<00:00:10.920> think<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.150> one<00:00:12.210> is

way for rosenberg so i think this one is
better<00:00:12.660> because<00:00:13.549> it<00:00:14.549> was<00:00:14.820> further<00:00:15.480> back<00:00:16.010> on

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
better because it was further back on

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.630 
better because it was further back on

why that happens

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.609 
why that happens
we<00:01:54.770> have<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.640> continue<00:01:55.939> to<00:01:56.180> play<00:01:56.390> good<00:01:57.079> every
