00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.380 
automatic straight at the gate the rate
of<00:02:23.100> fire<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.459> little<00:02:23.970> slow<00:02:24.300> but<00:02:26.090> that's<00:02:27.090> fine

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
of fire is a little slow but that's fine

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.740 
of fire is a little slow but that's fine
because<00:02:27.739> it's<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:29.010> steady<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.790> there's<00:02:30.569> such

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
because it's so steady and there's such

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.440 
because it's so steady and there's such
little<00:02:31.200> recoil<00:02:31.680> on<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.310> you're<00:02:33.030> spread<00:02:33.300> is

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
little recoil on it and you're spread is

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.600 
little recoil on it and you're spread is
pretty<00:02:33.750> tightly<00:02:35.630> secure<00:02:36.709> so<00:02:37.709> if<00:02:38.310> there's<00:02:38.520> a

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
pretty tightly secure so if there's a

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.490 
pretty tightly secure so if there's a
candidate<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.690> were<00:02:39.780> only<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.140> get<00:02:40.260> one

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
candidate you were only going to get one

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.610 
candidate you were only going to get one
gold<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:41.810> think<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:42.900> one<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.260> one's<00:02:43.470> up

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
gold I think this one this one's up

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.390 
gold I think this one this one's up
there<00:02:43.650> pretty<00:02:44.010> high<00:02:44.220> on<00:02:44.250> my<00:02:44.550> list<00:02:46.400> probably

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
there pretty high on my list probably

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.740 
there pretty high on my list probably
the<00:02:47.550> m8a1<00:02:48.000> would<00:02:48.750> be<00:02:48.870> your<00:02:48.989> next<00:02:49.320> one<00:02:50.420> or<00:02:51.420> they

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
the m8a1 would be your next one or they

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.740 
the m8a1 would be your next one or they
and<00:02:51.959> 94<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.709> 94<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.370> really<00:02:53.580> good<00:02:53.760> what<00:02:54.720> a

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
and 94 and 94 is really good what a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.130 
and 94 and 94 is really good what a
little<00:02:54.959> bit<00:02:55.080> I've<00:02:55.200> actually<00:02:55.380> used<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:56.090> and

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
little bit I've actually used it and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.520 
little bit I've actually used it and
there<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.410> know<00:02:59.870> don't<00:03:00.870> want<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.080> jump<00:03:01.230> on<00:03:01.350> be
