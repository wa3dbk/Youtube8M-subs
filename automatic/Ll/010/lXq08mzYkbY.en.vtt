need to fill in these holes around the

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.529 
need to fill in these holes around the
house<00:05:06.380> I<00:05:06.590> think<00:05:06.770> I'm<00:05:06.830> gonna<00:05:06.979> use<00:05:07.250> grass<00:05:08.090> or

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
house I think I'm gonna use grass or

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:10.749 
house I think I'm gonna use grass or
dirt<00:05:08.570> I<00:05:08.900> should<00:05:09.080> say<00:05:09.289> all<00:05:09.770> sort<00:05:10.310> of<00:05:10.400> around<00:05:10.610> the

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
dirt I should say all sort of around the

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.189 
dirt I should say all sort of around the
perimeter<00:05:11.180> of<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.330> house<00:05:11.479> I<00:05:11.780> am<00:05:11.900> going<00:05:12.139> to

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
perimeter of the house I am going to

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.260 
perimeter of the house I am going to
fill<00:05:12.380> this<00:05:12.500> all<00:05:12.680> in<00:05:12.860> with<00:05:13.400> stone<00:05:13.789> instead<00:05:14.120> of

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
fill this all in with stone instead of

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.629 
fill this all in with stone instead of
cobblestone<00:05:14.810> and<00:05:15.050> if<00:05:15.979> you're<00:05:16.130> wondering<00:05:16.490> why

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
cobblestone and if you're wondering why

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.089 
cobblestone and if you're wondering why
I<00:05:16.669> still<00:05:17.210> don't<00:05:17.449> know<00:05:17.539> there's<00:05:18.500> no<00:05:18.740> good

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
I still don't know there's no good

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.800 
I still don't know there's no good
reason<00:05:19.310> I<00:05:19.610> could<00:05:19.789> just<00:05:19.940> use<00:05:20.060> cobblestone<00:05:20.330> but

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
reason I could just use cobblestone but

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.200 
reason I could just use cobblestone but
some<00:05:21.050> part<00:05:21.289> of<00:05:21.410> me<00:05:21.470> feels<00:05:21.710> like<00:05:21.800> well<00:05:22.130> for<00:05:23.000> some

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
some part of me feels like well for some

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.879 
some part of me feels like well for some
reason<00:05:23.479> I<00:05:23.539> started<00:05:23.780> using<00:05:24.110> stone<00:05:24.500> and<00:05:24.770> now<00:05:24.860> I

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
reason I started using stone and now I

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.070 
reason I started using stone and now I
have<00:05:25.130> to<00:05:25.250> finish<00:05:25.520> I've<00:05:26.210> got<00:05:26.510> it<00:05:26.630> I've<00:05:26.780> got<00:05:26.810> to

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
have to finish I've got it I've got to

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.070 
have to finish I've got it I've got to
do<00:05:27.229> it<00:05:27.349> the<00:05:27.500> way<00:05:27.620> I<00:05:27.650> started<00:05:28.210> but<00:05:29.210> after<00:05:29.720> that<00:05:30.050> I

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
do it the way I started but after that I

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.040 
do it the way I started but after that I
don't<00:05:30.260> know<00:05:30.409> maybe<00:05:30.650> it's<00:05:30.889> fancy<00:05:31.539> like<00:05:32.539> molding

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
don't know maybe it's fancy like molding

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.480 
don't know maybe it's fancy like molding
along<00:05:33.139> the<00:05:33.440> roof<00:05:33.620> of<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.830> house<00:05:34.010> there's

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
along the roof of the house there's

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.330 
along the roof of the house there's
still<00:05:34.849> more<00:05:34.970> to<00:05:35.090> be<00:05:35.150> done<00:05:35.240> but<00:05:35.889> you<00:05:36.889> know<00:05:37.159> some

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
still more to be done but you know some

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.010 
still more to be done but you know some
more<00:05:37.430> final<00:05:37.820> touches<00:05:38.060> little<00:05:38.720> finishing

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
more final touches little finishing

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.279 
more final touches little finishing
things<00:05:39.610> but<00:05:40.610> I<00:05:40.639> think<00:05:40.880> for<00:05:41.030> the<00:05:41.090> most<00:05:41.300> part<00:05:41.630> the

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
things but I think for the most part the

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.520 
things but I think for the most part the
the<00:05:42.320> bulk<00:05:42.919> of<00:05:43.070> the<00:05:43.220> work<00:05:43.370> is<00:05:43.520> done<00:05:43.729> here<00:05:43.760> and

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
the bulk of the work is done here and

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.300 
the bulk of the work is done here and
let's<00:05:45.530> go<00:05:45.650> see<00:05:45.680> if<00:05:45.889> you<00:05:46.010> had<00:05:46.099> any<00:05:46.220> more

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
let's go see if you had any more

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.920 
let's go see if you had any more
monsters<00:05:46.729> spawn<00:05:46.940> monsters<00:05:47.419> started<00:05:47.720> spawning

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
monsters spawn monsters started spawning

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.240 
monsters spawn monsters started spawning
again<00:05:48.260> I'm<00:05:48.380> not<00:05:48.470> sure<00:05:48.650> why<00:05:48.770> they<00:05:48.889> stopped<00:05:49.130> in

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
again I'm not sure why they stopped in

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.850 
again I'm not sure why they stopped in
the<00:05:49.340> first<00:05:49.550> place<00:05:49.900> but<00:05:50.900> if<00:05:51.259> we<00:05:51.349> head<00:05:51.440> down<00:05:51.590> here

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
the first place but if we head down here

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.860 
the first place but if we head down here
yeah<00:05:52.729> we're<00:05:53.030> doing<00:05:53.120> we're<00:05:53.449> actually<00:05:53.630> not

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
yeah we're doing we're actually not

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.330 
yeah we're doing we're actually not
doing<00:05:53.930> too<00:05:54.289> bad<00:05:54.500> we're<00:05:54.770> not<00:05:54.889> getting<00:05:55.130> a<00:05:55.190> whole

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
doing too bad we're not getting a whole

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.189 
doing too bad we're not getting a whole
lot<00:05:55.370> of<00:05:55.550> monster<00:05:55.880> spawning<00:05:56.210> but<00:05:56.900> we're<00:05:57.050> not

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
lot of monster spawning but we're not

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.080 
lot of monster spawning but we're not
getting<00:05:57.349> none<00:05:57.680> at<00:05:57.830> all<00:05:57.919> either<00:05:58.190> so<00:05:58.849> we've<00:05:58.970> had

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
getting none at all either so we've had

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.249 
getting none at all either so we've had
a<00:05:59.150> few<00:05:59.509> zombies<00:06:00.289> a<00:06:00.650> spider<00:06:01.280> and<00:06:01.699> an<00:06:01.849> Enderman

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
a few zombies a spider and an Enderman

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.330 
a few zombies a spider and an Enderman
hopefully<00:06:03.259> this<00:06:03.590> will

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.790 

I'm<00:06:07.340> getting<00:06:07.940> blown<00:06:08.630> sideways<00:06:09.200> I<00:06:09.530> guess

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
I'm getting blown sideways I guess

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.340 
I'm getting blown sideways I guess
through<00:06:10.280> the<00:06:10.460> to<00:06:10.760> the<00:06:10.910> wall<00:06:11.090> that's<00:06:11.300> weird<00:06:11.540> but

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
through the to the wall that's weird but

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:22.510 
through the to the wall that's weird but
hopefully<00:06:13.750> this<00:06:14.750> has<00:06:14.990> got<00:06:15.230> to<00:06:15.350> go<00:06:21.250> that's<00:06:22.250> just

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
hopefully this has got to go that's just

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.080 
hopefully this has got to go that's just
ridiculous

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
ridiculous

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.120 
ridiculous
