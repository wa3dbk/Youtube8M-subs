 I'll show you 5 newest tweaks and sitting 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.599
 of them are paid and free in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.090
 description below this video you will find 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.370
 repositories where you can download all these 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.420
 tweaks are completely free for everyone 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.789
 enjoy your viewing 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.800
 we start and our first tweak 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.289
 called active duty in this tweak 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.510
 there are three features first when you click 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.760
 any icons on your docks she commit 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.369
 not big jumps before the launch itself 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.710
 applications just like poppy second 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.540
 feature of the new dock any program 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.910
 in the dock which is in active 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.730
 mode icon is highlighted not great 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.160
 at the bottom of the panel naturally 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.440
 remove the application from multitasking 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.890
 active applications highlighting these 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.500
 icons 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.200
 well, and the last in my opinion will disappear 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.370
 The most useful feature of this tweak 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.680
 when will he do 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.829
 any notice from one of 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.320
 applications that are in dota 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.460
 the icon will start to bounce 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.430
 signaling that for example i have 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.629
 there is an unread message or from Moscow time 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.320
 or some 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.170
 tweet in settings you can change 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.330
 the parameters of this tweet allows means when 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.990
 clicking the application its icon will be 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.930
 bounce 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.009
 a notification upon notification she also 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.869
 will bounce 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.729
 and here you can change the interval 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.689
 the time between which will take place 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.140
 every jump 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.479
 with the notification of course and our mail 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.729
 still jumping this kind of not very 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.840
 liked and think deserves big 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.210
 attention so swing you will not regret 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.700
 but this time small but very comfortable 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.920
 tweak forest cluster that allows us 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.929
 enable mode do not disturb right from 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.170
 lock screen all we need 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:48.420
 make it a short swipe right so 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.090
 the most you turn on the so-called quiet 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.399
 mode and having done the same thing you him 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.679
 disable this century will be in particular 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.859
 useful to those who constantly use 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:01.350
 do not disturb with this mode 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.479
 weighs quite a bit and will not affect 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.149
 on the speed and on the battery of your device 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.190
 so swing don't regret the next one 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.649
 tweak we called them the world who 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.170
 slightly embellished boring and familiar 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.579
 interface of your device this view 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.860
 invites us to add various 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.709
 animation pop up banner 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.200
 Alert popup alert notifications 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.060
 as well as multitasking panels 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.890
 in setting up pop-up banners 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.319
 notifications we have the opportunity 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.629
 change how it will appear on the left 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.019
 right and left to fall from above 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.739
 or go up straight media also we 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.019
 we can choose 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.720
 effects of approaching or decreasing 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.350
 banner when appearing still we can 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.810
 to change 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.750
 how on will fade go away from 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.910
 left right up and even dissolve 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.130
 well finally we have the opportunity 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.859
 changes in the rate of appearance of the banner 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.200
 notice i have it faster 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.829
 right slower best to put 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.660
 to the right 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:02.270
 slow so you can see the effect 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.370
 in the pop-up alert settings 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.980
 you are also given a small sheet 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.670
 animation window can now appear 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.840
 bouncing off gradually increasing or 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.720
 decreasing 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.070
 only 4 animations of your choice finally 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.170
 multitasking panels 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.240
 now we have only three 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:32.630
 animations it can appear 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:35.480
 increasing like this also decreasing well 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.240
 and finally, by the way, I want to say 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.380
 all who will become century uxa all this 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.210
 will look much better it was 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.940
 tweak is not the world and it is pretty cool 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.780
 Refreshes the interface of your device so 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.940
 what swing 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.950
 Well, the next tweak we have called 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.690
 multi dock this view allows both 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.410
 add second line for icons 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.270
 applications 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.720
 so increase the total 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.980
 applications in standard docks 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.160
 worn out this view you will be able through 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.500
 multi dock settings in rose you can 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.800
 choose the maximum number of docks 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.800
 be 5 aikan sportline number 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.110
 applications at dock maximum can be 15 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.330
 scary to even think that it will work 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.959
 let's try to change the amount 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:24.290
 docks for 3 and see what we will have 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.630
 Well, here are 3 docks and 6 applications per 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.540
 dock if properly configure this view 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.710
 who may be very comfortable and 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.680
 beautiful so swing don't regret 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.540
 well, the last for today twix autolog 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.210
 which minim is leading the lock screen 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.970
 thus making your device more 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.090
 fresh and original it reduces height 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.030
 block with clock and slider unlock 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.250
 so that the center of the screen has stopped 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.800
 one hundred pixels more that will allow you 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.860
 do not crop the desired image except 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.750
 addition you will have more space for 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.040
 notification center alerts as well as 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.890
 settings I will erase 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.830
 you can take a slider watch and hide the date 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.200
 on the lock screen so lovers 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.750
 customize your kill this view 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.040
