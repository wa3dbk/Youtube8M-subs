00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
medical background he is out there

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.859 
medical background he is out there
looking<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.040> Pascal<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.700> well<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.299> now<00:01:12.510> not<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
looking at Pascal as well and now not a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.969 
looking at Pascal as well and now not a
good<00:01:13.170> sign<00:01:13.439> they're<00:01:13.680> bringing<00:01:14.040> out<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.340> board

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
good sign they're bringing out the board

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.469 
good sign they're bringing out the board
so<00:01:16.979> they're<00:01:17.250> bringing<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> board<00:01:18.030> out<00:01:18.210> right

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
so they're bringing the board out right

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.719 
so they're bringing the board out right
now<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.229> probably<00:01:19.650> how<00:01:19.830> Pascal<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.369> going

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
now that is probably how Pascal is going

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.690 
now that is probably how Pascal is going
to<00:01:20.820> exit<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.360> game<00:01:21.689> as<00:01:22.159> they<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.369> want<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.499 
while but that's irrelevant right now is
they<00:01:37.860> want<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> make<00:01:38.250> sure<00:01:38.280> pastel<00:01:38.909> morenci<00:01:39.390> is

ok more medical staff out there on the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.609 
ok more medical staff out there on the
ice<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.170> look<00:01:43.320> at<00:01:43.470> Pascal<00:01:44.270> in<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:46.320> far<00:01:46.590> corner

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
ice to look at Pascal in the far corner

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.800 
ice to look at Pascal in the far corner
of<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> Hartford<00:01:47.700> don't<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.270> right<00:01:48.479> they

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
of the Hartford don't to the right they

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.780 
of the Hartford don't to the right they
will<00:01:50.149> get<00:01:51.149> Pascal<00:01:51.720> set<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.049> now<00:01:52.200> he's<00:01:52.350> moving

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
will get Pascal set up now he's moving

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.520 
will get Pascal set up now he's moving
so<00:01:53.790> obviously<00:01:54.270> that's<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.720> good<00:01:54.899> sign<00:01:55.200> his

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
