 revision number 104 a magazine that 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.180
 as always it's worth three euros with 95 this 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.580

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.080

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.489

 editions I will not say anything yet and 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.800

 so closed as you can see from behind 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.500
 as always it takes a little bit of 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.020
 advertising in this case of zoom and sport 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.180

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.610

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:53.979
 sergio marcos del villarreal boiled 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.520

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.960

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.750

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.880
 things related to collections of 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:18.010
 panini and the rest then with players 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.010
 Equipment information from other countries 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.370
 let's see if there is some kind of 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.440
 information about whether it will come out 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.030
 some new collection this summer here 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.819
 in Spain 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.480
 from what I see at the moment I do not see anything 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.480
 interesting 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.500
 and now the typical poles of 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.460
 every month with the magazine we have a morata 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.120
 with the juve 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.510
 keep a poster of real madrid other 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.510
 of the barça 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.200
 of gea with the manchester and everything etc 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.200
 we follow 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.850
 For the moment little thing brings this 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.760
 football magazine to see that I do not leave anything 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.310
 Well, very little publicity to say 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.630
 that this month of good these months of 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.840
 spring summer we will not have 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.390
 many new collections 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.170
 so this is what gives the 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.650
 magazine played with a little bit of 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.769
 advertising the first page of the 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.500
 adrenaline update well up 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.140
 here he played number 104 that of the month of 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.300
 June let's say 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.530
 I repeat it goes from three euros to 95 and now 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.870
 I'm going to show you I 'll leave the magazine 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.900
 here the limited editions that brings 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.069
 this magazine are four are base charts 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.959
 as you see 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.659
 forgive me the session but to me 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.010
 they look like a guarrada or can not be 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.469
 I want to sell this magazine that 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.480
 come to us these limited editions already 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:56.480
 I will not discuss the selection of players 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.859
 because everyone has their tastes and 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.060
 they have to include players of all 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.319
 the teams do not already know that to me 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.389
 I like football and I do not care what they put 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.700
 the players of getafe granada almería 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.870
 of tc is that I do not care about the only thing 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.730
 I complain is that it can not be that 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.530
 take out limited editions letters 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.269
 base is that where you have seen a 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.739
 limited edition of letter to base and 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.870
 there's no chrome on it or anything 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.310
 is included in the same design as the 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.739
 letter or they have not killed anything 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.079
 they have only put this layer of 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.240
 limited edition the letter has nothing 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.770
 of special as you see from behind 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.560
 they have no code they can not be used 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.540
 on-line 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.190
 so well this is my opinion about 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.360
 the letters I think if I wanted to mind 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.850
 in the magazine what they could have done 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.889
 draw a face had for example and 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.169
 nothing would have happened or a letter 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.150
 of limited division but normal ya 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.310
 I say that the choice of players 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.200
 is the same or I will not discuss the 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.610
 everyone has their tastes but good yes 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.480
 that it 's true that I for example in the 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.430
 Sevilla had no betting is 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.410
 surgical if not I do not know Christ and at the same 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.200
 He is a player who has more charisma 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.340
 I think of Córdoba I do not know many 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.260
 so I can not say those of the 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.680
 Spanish or would have put then in sergio 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.330
 Garcia for example or stuani I do not know but 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.919
 duarte then I do not know what you want that you 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.530
 say and for the gestation, then live and 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.260
 good or taught them there will be one by one the 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.620
 first is sergio rico limited edition 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.620
 of seville as you see I repeat are letters 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.880
 base 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.449
 the next one is clean del córdoba 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.240
 limited edition 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:25.330
 is your Spanish art edition 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.699
 Limited will force limited edition 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.099
 also of the getafe as these are the 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:33.249
 four limited editions that the 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.479
 magazine game number 104 those of jade 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.870
 so that you can see the 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.870
 four together 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.349
 I repeat I do not like anything I'm in 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.819
 disagreement with these limited letters 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:46.090
 being limited as they would have to have 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:49.279
 because the same design as the previous ones 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.319
 or else not something different but let's go 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.639
 a car base never life or that is what 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.979
 if they wanted to sell the magazine 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.080
 I repeat I had to have removed because I do not know 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.819
 or limited editions of others 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.669
 collections or of this same I do not know but 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.379
 this is this so not for me not a region 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.909
 this in total disagreement why I say 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:07.099
 that next month's rooms could 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.990
 have saved but well said this is 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.550
 in my opinion surely you 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.729
 or maybe you will have another sharing 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.199
 the same but good mine and from here 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.150
 The most humble one is that I'm telling you 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:19.159
 I like nothing I would have preferred 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.439
 limited editions of all life and not 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.819
 base letters and why not also as 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:25.580
 tradition of players a little bit more 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.990
 charismatic in things I say no no no 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.960
 It's critical because everyone has their 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.919
 tastes and can choose for those who 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.889
 Give wins but hey I would 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:35.270
 chosen others so nothing this is what 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:38.089
 which gives itself the game magazine number 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.469
 104 does not have anything else so nothing like 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:40.819
 always but only if you liked this 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:42.259
 a boxing a comment because you think 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:43.520
 both the magazine and these editions 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:44.840
 limited 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.220
 and nothing to dig all the times by 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.300
 watch the video and let me know what 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.810
 next is a greeting today has been 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.810
 worked up
