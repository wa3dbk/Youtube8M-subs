breathing heavy in between each rep will

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.780 
breathing heavy in between each rep will
make<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.650> difference<00:04:46.979> of<00:04:47.070> getting<00:04:47.280> six<00:04:47.580> reps

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
make the difference of getting six reps

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.810 
make the difference of getting six reps
