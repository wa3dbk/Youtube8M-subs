now<00:00:00.329> you<00:00:00.450> will<00:00:00.539> need<00:00:00.810> three<00:00:01.260> of<00:00:01.589> these<00:00:01.860> modules

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:04.100 
now you will need three of these modules

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.390 
now you will need three of these modules
three<00:00:05.100> in<00:00:05.310> order<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.910> do<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.299> unit<00:00:07.220> now<00:00:08.220> what

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
three in order to do the unit now what

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.339 
three in order to do the unit now what
we're<00:00:08.519> going<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.700> do<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:09.120> we're<00:00:09.900> going<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.080> take

we're going to do is we're going to take

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.660 
we're going to do is we're going to take
this<00:00:11.099> section<00:00:11.790> right<00:00:11.820> here<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.980> this<00:00:13.980> channel

this section right here and this channel
right<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.480> what<00:00:15.780> we're<00:00:15.929> going<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.109> use<00:00:16.350> to

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
right here is what we're going to use to

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.790 
right here is what we're going to use to
slip<00:00:16.859> into<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.220> next<00:00:17.580> module<00:00:18.560> making<00:00:19.560> sure

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
slip into the next module making sure

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.000 
slip into the next module making sure
that<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.160> have<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:21.020> short<00:00:22.020> flap<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.859> into

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
that you have this short flap going into

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.310 
that you have this short flap going into
a<00:00:23.189> full-size<00:00:23.699> flap<00:00:24.060> now<00:00:24.779> I've<00:00:24.869> seen<00:00:25.109> some

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
a full-size flap now I've seen some

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.839 
a full-size flap now I've seen some
instructions<00:00:25.949> where<00:00:26.250> they<00:00:26.430> will<00:00:26.550> just<00:00:26.699> tell

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
instructions where they will just tell

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.290 
instructions where they will just tell
you<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.119> slip<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.720> like<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.519> I<00:00:29.519> prefer<00:00:30.060> to

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
you to slip it in like this I prefer to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.139 
you to slip it in like this I prefer to
slip<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.080> down<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.710> making<00:00:32.219> sure<00:00:32.550> that

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
slip it down like this making sure that

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.340 
slip it down like this making sure that
this<00:00:34.070> half-lap<00:00:35.809> slides<00:00:36.809> over<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:39.230> part<00:00:40.230> of

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
this half-lap slides over this part of

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:51.520 
this half-lap slides over this part of
the<00:00:40.440> model<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:43.610> going<00:00:44.610> down<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:45.000> channel

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.090 

you<00:00:52.129> will<00:00:53.500> have<00:00:54.500> to<00:00:54.680> make<00:00:54.800> sure<00:00:54.829> you're

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
you will have to make sure you're

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:03.610 
you will have to make sure you're
actually<00:00:55.250> in<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:55.610> channel<00:01:00.790> slide<00:01:02.620> sliding

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
actually in the channel slide sliding

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.749 
actually in the channel slide sliding
that<00:01:03.970> half<00:01:04.970> lap<00:01:05.330> over<00:01:05.659> that<00:01:06.400> that<00:01:07.400> makes<00:01:07.640> a

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
that half lap over that that makes a

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.060 
that half lap over that that makes a
much<00:01:07.970> cleaner<00:01:08.619> tighter<00:01:11.920> joining<00:01:12.920> of<00:01:13.009> the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
much cleaner tighter joining of the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.490 
much cleaner tighter joining of the
modules<00:01:13.810> okay<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:14.960> then<00:01:15.049> we<00:01:15.110> do<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.259> same

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
modules okay and then we do the same

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.730 
modules okay and then we do the same
thing<00:01:15.770> on<00:01:16.009> this<00:01:16.759> one<00:01:17.440> making<00:01:18.440> sure<00:01:18.619> we're

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
thing on this one making sure we're

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.590 
thing on this one making sure we're
going<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:18.920> slip<00:01:19.130> through<00:01:19.270> these<00:01:20.270> channels

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
going to slip through these channels

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:30.340 
going to slip through these channels
right<00:01:20.930> here<00:01:26.050> that<00:01:27.050> side<00:01:27.380> that<00:01:27.710> side<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:29.350> it

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
right here that side that side and it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.330 
right here that side that side and it
just<00:01:30.560> slips<00:01:30.860> right<00:01:31.250> in<00:01:31.720> with<00:01:32.720> that<00:01:33.340> sliding

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
just slips right in with that sliding

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.219 
just slips right in with that sliding
over<00:01:35.590> that<00:01:36.590> module<00:01:37.569> okay<00:01:38.569> now<00:01:38.899> that<00:01:38.929> we<00:01:39.200> have

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
over that module okay now that we have

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.040 
over that module okay now that we have
it<00:01:40.270> assembled<00:01:42.130> we'll<00:01:43.130> go<00:01:43.580> ahead<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.240> lock<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
it assembled we'll go ahead and lock the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.649 
it assembled we'll go ahead and lock the
whole<00:01:45.080> thing<00:01:45.470> together<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:46.039> then<00:01:46.909> finally

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
whole thing together and then finally

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.080 
whole thing together and then finally
join<00:01:48.319> it<00:01:48.440> together<00:01:48.789> now<00:01:49.789> those<00:01:51.819> squash<00:01:52.819> holes

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
join it together now those squash holes

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.569 
join it together now those squash holes
that<00:01:53.270> we<00:01:53.390> made<00:01:53.830> allow<00:01:54.830> us<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:56.180> do<00:01:56.360> that

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
that we made allow us to do that

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.399 
that we made allow us to do that
reversible<00:01:58.579> don't<00:01:58.939> do<00:01:59.210> these<00:01:59.869> because<00:02:00.229> we'll

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
reversible don't do these because we'll

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.929 
reversible don't do these because we'll
need<00:02:00.560> those<00:02:00.829> open<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:02.000> do<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.509> final<00:02:02.780> assembly

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
need those open to do the final assembly

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:12.520 
need those open to do the final assembly
so<00:02:04.939> you're<00:02:05.090> just<00:02:05.240> going<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.509> fold<00:02:05.780> in<00:02:09.009> all<00:02:11.530> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
so you're just going to fold in all the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.990 
so you're just going to fold in all the
corners<00:02:12.769> along<00:02:14.799> those<00:02:15.799> squash<00:02:16.519> holes<00:02:16.820> that

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
corners along those squash holes that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.930 
corners along those squash holes that
may<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:17.180> folding<00:02:17.840> in<00:02:17.989> like<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:18.940> vitz

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
may just folding in like this vitz

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.020 
may just folding in like this vitz
paying<00:02:20.709> paying<00:02:21.709> special<00:02:22.250> attention<00:02:22.430> when<00:02:22.940> you

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
paying paying special attention when you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.259 
paying paying special attention when you
get<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.359> where<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> modules<00:02:24.049> are<00:02:24.200> joined<00:02:25.269> that

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
get to where the modules are joined that

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.520 
get to where the modules are joined that
those<00:02:26.480> are<00:02:26.780> nice<00:02:27.109> and<00:02:27.350> tight<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.810> we<00:02:30.260> just

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
those are nice and tight and we just

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.640 
those are nice and tight and we just
slowly<00:02:31.250> go<00:02:32.180> through<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.810> entire<00:02:32.900> model<00:02:33.380> this

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
slowly go through the entire model this

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
slowly go through the entire model this
way<00:02:35.109> we<00:02:36.109> have<00:02:36.230> another<00:02:37.150> joint<00:02:39.880> this

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.410 

and<00:02:48.790> again<00:02:49.599> leaving<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.380> last<00:02:50.620> one<00:02:50.860> open<00:02:51.420> now

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
and again leaving the last one open now

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.199 
and again leaving the last one open now
the<00:02:53.290> next<00:02:53.530> step<00:02:53.709> is<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:55.630> fold<00:02:56.230> down<00:02:56.610> along<00:02:57.610> this

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
the next step is to fold down along this

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.990 
the next step is to fold down along this
crease<00:02:58.569> right<00:02:58.780> here<00:02:59.459> again<00:03:00.459> leaving<00:03:00.880> the

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
crease right here again leaving the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.370 
crease right here again leaving the
first<00:03:01.270> module<00:03:01.510> open<00:03:01.930> because<00:03:02.050> we'll<00:03:02.260> need

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
first module open because we'll need

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.300 
first module open because we'll need
that<00:03:02.530> open<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.040> do<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.670> connection<00:03:04.180> open

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
that open to do the the connection open

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.640 
that open to do the the connection open
this<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.850> can<00:03:07.030> just<00:03:07.180> fold<00:03:07.450> down<00:03:07.660> on<00:03:08.020> that

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
this and you can just fold down on that

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.320 
this and you can just fold down on that
crease<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.670> when<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.880> close<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.060> back<00:03:10.270> up

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
crease and when you close it back up

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.620 
crease and when you close it back up
make<00:03:10.720> sure<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.170> this<00:03:11.350> doesn't<00:03:11.680> poke<00:03:12.459> out<00:03:12.670> now

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
make sure that this doesn't poke out now

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.080 
make sure that this doesn't poke out now
when<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:13.959> open<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.319> next<00:03:14.470> one<00:03:14.790> you'll<00:03:15.790> fold

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
when you open the next one you'll fold

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.130 
when you open the next one you'll fold
it<00:03:16.269> down<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.750> you'll<00:03:17.680> see<00:03:17.980> that<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.840> squash

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
it down and you'll see that the squash

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.470 
it down and you'll see that the squash
will<00:03:20.380> now<00:03:20.560> fold<00:03:20.920> over<00:03:21.310> each<00:03:22.030> piece<00:03:22.390> like<00:03:22.750> that

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
will now fold over each piece like that

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.820 
will now fold over each piece like that
okay<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:26.110> you're<00:03:26.319> just<00:03:26.440> going<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.680> go

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
okay and so you're just going to go

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:34.020 
okay and so you're just going to go
through<00:03:27.480> folding<00:03:28.480> down<00:03:31.080> like<00:03:32.080> that<00:03:32.850> now<00:03:33.850> when

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
through folding down like that now when

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.690 
through folding down like that now when
you<00:03:34.150> get<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.510> one<00:03:35.040> where<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.190> modules<00:03:36.580> are

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
you get to the one where the modules are

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.300 
you get to the one where the modules are
joined<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.360> want<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.660> pay<00:03:37.840> close<00:03:38.739> attention

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
joined you want to pay close attention

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.410 
joined you want to pay close attention
to<00:03:39.340> make<00:03:39.519> sure<00:03:39.790> that<00:03:40.780> this<00:03:41.470> folds

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
to make sure that this folds

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.360 
to make sure that this folds
symmetrically<00:03:43.420> down<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:47.769> makes<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.069> model

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
symmetrically down it makes the model

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.680 
symmetrically down it makes the model
look<00:03:48.519> neater<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.709> then<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:52.150> just<00:03:52.360> continue

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
look neater and then you just continue

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.440 
look neater and then you just continue
on<00:03:53.760> down<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.970> line<00:03:55.920> folding<00:03:57.030> making<00:03:58.030> sure<00:03:58.239> all

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
on down the line folding making sure all

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.160 
on down the line folding making sure all
those<00:03:58.660> folds<00:03:59.109> tuck<00:03:59.410> in<00:03:59.560> nicely

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.650 

again<00:04:04.950> making<00:04:05.220> sure<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.880> where<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.240> joins

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
again making sure that where the joins

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.750 
again making sure that where the joins
are<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:08.790> make<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.180> as<00:04:10.280> low<00:04:11.280> profile<00:04:11.730> as

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
are you make that as low profile as

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:22.600 
are you make that as low profile as
possible<00:04:13.790> fold<00:04:14.790> down<00:04:15.030> again<00:04:18.109> pull<00:04:19.109> down<00:04:21.169> and

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
possible fold down again pull down and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.790 
possible fold down again pull down and
leaving<00:04:23.610> this<00:04:24.000> one<00:04:24.240> open<00:04:24.690> because<00:04:25.470> you're<00:04:25.680> on

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
leaving this one open because you're on

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.409 
leaving this one open because you're on
the<00:04:25.830> last<00:04:26.160> module<00:04:27.650> flip<00:04:28.650> them<00:04:28.860> all<00:04:29.010> over<00:04:29.419> and

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
the last module flip them all over and

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:41.760 
the last module flip them all over and
do<00:04:31.410> all<00:04:31.620> that<00:04:31.650> one<00:04:32.310> more<00:04:32.550> time

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.490 

again<00:04:42.400> making<00:04:42.639> sure<00:04:43.030> that<00:04:43.300> these<00:04:43.509> pieces

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
again making sure that these pieces

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.700 
again making sure that these pieces
don't<00:04:47.500> pop<00:04:47.830> up

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.440 

you<00:04:53.220> have<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.430> joint<00:04:53.790> that<00:04:54.030> we<00:04:54.090> need<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.270> make

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
you have a joint that we need to make

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.960 
you have a joint that we need to make
sure<00:04:54.980> is<00:04:55.980> symmetrically<00:04:56.910> fold<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.300> over<00:04:58.970> in

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
sure is symmetrically fold it over in

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:30.800 
sure is symmetrically fold it over in
that<00:05:00.150> up

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.970 

ok

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:42.399 

and<00:05:35.630> there<00:05:36.630> we<00:05:36.810> have

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:48.489 

our<00:05:44.289> mondal<00:05:45.289> now<00:05:45.860> next<00:05:46.669> last<00:05:47.419> part<00:05:47.929> is<00:05:48.169> of

course<00:05:48.709> to<00:05:49.929> slip<00:05:50.929> this<00:05:51.709> part<00:05:52.689> through<00:05:53.689> here

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:53.959 
course to slip this part through here

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:56.139 
course to slip this part through here
just<00:05:54.199> like<00:05:54.289> we<00:05:54.349> did<00:05:54.559> all<00:05:54.709> the<00:05:54.830> other<00:05:54.919> ones<00:05:55.149> and

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:56.149 
just like we did all the other ones and

00:05:56.149 --> 00:06:00.009 
just like we did all the other ones and
that<00:05:57.309> can<00:05:58.309> be<00:05:58.429> made<00:05:58.580> much<00:05:58.759> easier<00:05:58.819> if<00:05:59.419> you<00:05:59.629> grab

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:00.019 
that can be made much easier if you grab

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:03.429 
that can be made much easier if you grab
a<00:06:00.459> module<00:06:01.459> behind<00:06:01.879> the<00:06:02.749> one<00:06:02.899> you<00:06:03.019> want<00:06:03.169> if<00:06:03.349> you

biggest problem will just be all the

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:39.009 
biggest problem will just be all the
precreasing<00:06:37.069> you<00:06:37.399> did<00:06:37.579> is<00:06:37.759> not<00:06:38.599> made<00:06:38.839> them

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:39.019 
precreasing you did is not made them

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:46.310 
precreasing you did is not made them
straight<00:06:39.289> but

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.390 

that<00:06:46.920> was<00:06:47.340> fairly<00:06:47.610> painless<00:06:48.440> slips<00:06:49.440> over<00:06:49.620> now

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
that was fairly painless slips over now

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.740 
that was fairly painless slips over now
you<00:06:50.460> can<00:06:50.820> see<00:06:52.490> the<00:06:53.490> fireworks<00:06:53.760> module<00:06:54.390> almost

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
you can see the fireworks module almost

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.870 
you can see the fireworks module almost
completed<00:06:55.880> and<00:06:56.880> on<00:06:57.390> this<00:06:57.570> side<00:06:57.840> we<00:06:58.140> just<00:06:58.880> do

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.870 
one on this side now complete it the
outside<00:07:15.920> now<00:07:16.920> in<00:07:17.040> order<00:07:17.190> to<00:07:17.340> make<00:07:17.490> doing<00:07:17.790> the

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 
outside now in order to make doing the

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.740 
outside now in order to make doing the
inside<00:07:18.590> easier<00:07:19.590> I<00:07:19.800> found<00:07:20.460> that<00:07:20.820> instead<00:07:21.690> of

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750 
inside easier I found that instead of

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.840 
inside easier I found that instead of
trying<00:07:22.410> to<00:07:22.470> work<00:07:22.710> inside<00:07:23.160> there<00:07:23.460> you<00:07:23.700> just

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:23.850 
trying to work inside there you just

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.780 
trying to work inside there you just
take<00:07:24.090> the<00:07:24.270> model<00:07:24.950> you<00:07:25.950> turn<00:07:26.160> it<00:07:26.310> inside<00:07:26.760> out

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:26.790 
take the model you turn it inside out

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.210 
take the model you turn it inside out
like<00:07:27.180> that<00:07:27.450> and<00:07:27.720> now<00:07:28.620> these<00:07:28.800> are<00:07:29.010> on<00:07:29.130> the

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 
like that and now these are on the

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.160 
like that and now these are on the
outside<00:07:29.580> it<00:07:29.820> makes<00:07:30.000> you<00:07:30.120> much<00:07:30.510> easier<00:07:30.900> to<00:07:31.050> get

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.170 
outside it makes you much easier to get

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:39.800 
outside it makes you much easier to get
to<00:07:32.420> do<00:07:33.420> the<00:07:36.260> reverse<00:07:37.260> fold<00:07:37.560> and<00:07:37.860> fold<00:07:38.810> that

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:39.810 
to do the reverse fold and fold that

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:48.580 
to do the reverse fold and fold that
down<00:07:39.990> a<00:07:42.740> the<00:07:43.740> last<00:07:44.040> one

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:48.590 

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:53.110 

pulling<00:07:48.890> it<00:07:49.010> down<00:07:50.170> and<00:07:51.190> all<00:07:52.190> that's<00:07:52.550> left<00:07:52.790> is

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 
pulling it down and all that's left is

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.150 
pulling it down and all that's left is
to<00:07:53.210> kind<00:07:53.840> of<00:07:53.960> go<00:07:54.170> through<00:07:54.530> and<00:07:56.680> tighten<00:07:57.680> up<00:07:57.950> the

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.160 
to kind of go through and tighten up the

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.600 
to kind of go through and tighten up the
folds<00:07:59.170> and<00:08:00.400> there<00:08:01.400> you<00:08:01.520> have<00:08:01.550> a<00:08:02.150> dollar<00:08:03.110> bill

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:03.610 
folds and there you have a dollar bill

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:12.580 
folds and there you have a dollar bill
