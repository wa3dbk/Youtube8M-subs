the anslee peace drone this was an
airplane<00:00:18.869> design<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.380> came<00:00:19.590> up<00:00:19.740> when<00:00:19.890> I

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
airplane design that I came up when I

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.880 
airplane design that I came up when I
very<00:00:20.039> first<00:00:20.310> got<00:00:20.789> into<00:00:21.240> fpv<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.590> needed

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
very first got into fpv and I needed

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.009 
very first got into fpv and I needed
something<00:00:23.070> with<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.310> pusher<00:00:23.609> motor<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
something with a pusher motor with the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.130 
something with a pusher motor with the
nose<00:00:25.590> free<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.250> fpv<00:00:26.699> gear<00:00:26.970> needed<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.810> be<00:00:27.930> foam

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
nose free for fpv gear needed to be foam

nose free for fpv gear needed to be foam
board<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.560> wanted<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.890> large<00:00:29.099> wingspan<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.910> was

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
board I wanted a large wingspan that was

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.110 
board I wanted a large wingspan that was
stable<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.109> efficient<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:32.669> called<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
stable and efficient and I called it the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.299 
stable and efficient and I called it the
peace<00:00:33.300> drone<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:34.380> original<00:00:34.739> idea<00:00:35.010> was<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
peace drone the original idea was to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.400 
peace drone the original idea was to
make<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.489> sort<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.940> predator<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.540> plane<00:00:36.840> with

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
make a sort of predator like plane with

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.400 
make a sort of predator like plane with
a<00:00:37.440> V<00:00:37.680> tail<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.430> standard<00:00:38.940> plan<00:00:39.480> form<00:00:39.809> with

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
a V tail and a standard plan form with

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.840 
a V tail and a standard plan form with
the<00:00:40.559> camera<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:40.950> front<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.430> found<00:00:41.700> it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
the camera up front but I found it

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.340 
the camera up front but I found it
incredibly<00:00:41.969> hard<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.629> get<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.930> center<00:00:43.260> of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
incredibly hard to get the center of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.420 
incredibly hard to get the center of
gravity<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.829> right<00:00:43.950> position<00:00:44.309> without

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
gravity in the right position without

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.090 
gravity in the right position without
putting<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.910> wing<00:00:45.090> way<00:00:45.510> far<00:00:45.840> back<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
putting the wing way far back to the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.700 
putting the wing way far back to the
tail<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.300> therefore<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.110> decided<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
tail and therefore I just decided to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.229 
tail and therefore I just decided to
flip<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.010> around<00:00:50.100> make<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> new<00:00:50.640> wing<00:00:50.789> section

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
flip it around make a new wing section

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.029 
flip it around make a new wing section
put<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> front<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> main<00:00:52.860> wing

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
put that in the front and the main wing

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.100 
put that in the front and the main wing
in<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.250> rear<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.850> rid<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> tail<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.809> make

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
in the rear get rid of the tail and make

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.590 
in the rear get rid of the tail and make
a<00:00:55.140> canard<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.890> came<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> idea<00:00:57.360> piece

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
a canard I came up with the idea piece

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.900 
a canard I came up with the idea piece
drone<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.500> couple<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.920> reasons<00:00:59.039> one<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.609> I

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
drone for a couple of reasons one is I

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.930 
drone for a couple of reasons one is I
was<00:01:00.329> using<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.050> roll<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.500> tie-dye<00:01:02.250> tape<00:01:02.730> this

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
was using a roll of a tie-dye tape this

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.670 
was using a roll of a tie-dye tape this
is<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> original<00:01:03.329> actual<00:01:04.229> piece<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.619> own

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
is the original actual piece for own

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.490 
is the original actual piece for own
fuselage<00:01:05.129> right<00:01:05.339> here<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.840> it's<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.960> drone<00:01:07.260> in

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
fuselage right here and it's a drone in

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.109 
fuselage right here and it's a drone in
the<00:01:07.590> sense<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.070> couple<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.400> years<00:01:08.520> ago<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the sense that a couple of years ago the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.880 
the sense that a couple of years ago the
term<00:01:09.479> drone<00:01:09.810> wasn't<00:01:10.049> quite<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.409> negative<00:01:10.770> as

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
term drone wasn't quite as negative as

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.530 
term drone wasn't quite as negative as
it<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.159> now<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.939> kind<00:01:12.420> of

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
it is now and I like the kind of

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.340 
it is now and I like the kind of
juxtaposition<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.470> piece<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.220> drone<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
juxtaposition of piece and drone and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.469 
juxtaposition of piece and drone and
it's<00:01:16.350> done<00:01:16.710> well<00:01:16.920> until<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.330> word

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
it's done well until now that the word

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.240 
it's done well until now that the word
drone<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.930> kind<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.350> frowned<00:01:19.500> upon<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.979> RC

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
drone is kind of frowned upon in the RC

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.499 
drone is kind of frowned upon in the RC
community<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.820> I'd<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> give<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
community so I'd like to give it a

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.679 
community so I'd like to give it a
little<00:01:22.020> bit<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> name<00:01:22.590> revision<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.509> now

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689

and<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:17.910> was<00:03:18.030> kind<00:03:18.270> of<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.390> mixed<00:03:18.720> success<00:03:18.900> I

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
and it was kind of a mixed success I

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.550 
and it was kind of a mixed success I
found<00:03:20.160> for<00:03:20.520> my<00:03:20.640> uses<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.660> additional<00:03:22.380> weight

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
found for my uses the additional weight

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.740 
found for my uses the additional weight
and<00:03:22.860> complexity<00:03:23.670> was<00:03:23.910> not<00:03:24.180> really<00:03:24.420> worth<00:03:24.600> it

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
and complexity was not really worth it

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.270 
and complexity was not really worth it
so<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.500> would<00:03:25.620> be<00:03:25.710> up<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:26.010> builders

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
so that would be up to the builders

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.640 
so that would be up to the builders

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
at each of these dual hatches and go

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.390 
at each of these dual hatches and go
over<00:04:07.020> the<00:04:07.110> wing<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.500> over<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.010> wing<00:04:08.160> there

you<00:04:09.180> can<00:04:09.330> see<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.570> shafts<00:04:09.810> stay<00:04:10.110> nice<00:04:10.770> and

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
you can see the shafts stay nice and

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.710 
you can see the shafts stay nice and
nestled<00:04:11.310> up<00:04:11.430> against<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.880> sides<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.330> the

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
nestled up against the sides of the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.030 
nestled up against the sides of the
fuselage<00:04:13.110> oh<00:04:13.230> they're<00:04:13.410> well<00:04:13.560> out<00:04:13.590> of<00:04:13.710> the<00:04:13.890> way

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.740 
fuselage oh they're well out of the way
this<00:04:14.880> would<00:04:15.060> be<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.240> main<00:04:15.390> battery

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
this would be the main battery

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.750 
this would be the main battery
compartment<00:04:16.290> here<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.980> an<00:04:17.100> auxilary<00:04:17.430> battery

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
compartment here and an auxilary battery

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.280 
compartment here and an auxilary battery
compartment<00:04:18.180> or<00:04:18.270> video<00:04:18.480> gear<00:04:18.720> could<00:04:18.960> go<00:04:19.049> here

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
compartment or video gear could go here

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.500 
compartment or video gear could go here
and<00:04:20.010> that's<00:04:20.160> a<00:04:20.220> nice<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.549> accessible<00:04:21.090> the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
and that's a nice and accessible the

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.680 
and that's a nice and accessible the
reason<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:21.810> went<00:04:21.930> with<00:04:22.049> two<00:04:22.790> hatches<00:04:23.790> is<00:04:24.000> to

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
reason I went with two hatches is to

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.320 
reason I went with two hatches is to
allow<00:04:25.050> separation<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.400> components<00:04:27.120> but

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
allow separation of the components but

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.800 
allow separation of the components but
also

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
also

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.750 
also
it<00:04:28.260> allows<00:04:28.500> stiffening<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.130> central<00:04:29.580> part

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
it allows stiffening the central part

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.430 
it allows stiffening the central part
and<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.240> found<00:04:30.570> helps<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:31.020> mitigate<00:04:31.410> some

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
and that I found helps to mitigate some

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.680 
and that I found helps to mitigate some
of<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.889> torsional<00:04:32.340> effect<00:04:32.610> but<00:04:33.180> still<00:04:33.450> allow

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
of the torsional effect but still allow

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.330 
of the torsional effect but still allow
very<00:04:34.020> good<00:04:34.230> access<00:04:34.650> through<00:04:34.919> both<00:04:35.070> of<00:04:35.100> these

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
very good access through both of these

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.129 
very good access through both of these
hatches<00:04:35.760> individually<00:04:36.450> to<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.690> components
