little bit didn't get you know close to

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.629 
little bit didn't get you know close to
freezing<00:00:10.019> but<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.860> kind<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.099> reminded<00:00:11.429> me<00:00:11.460> it's

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
freezing but it kind of reminded me it's

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.160 
freezing but it kind of reminded me it's
time<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.690> do<00:00:12.809> it

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
time to to do it

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.589 
time to to do it
we're<00:00:13.410> gonna<00:00:13.500> get<00:00:13.710> down<00:00:13.830> tonight<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.400> about<00:00:14.599> 34

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
we're gonna get down tonight to about 34

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.750 
we're gonna get down tonight to about 34
35<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.379> what<00:00:16.500> they<00:00:16.619> said<00:00:16.859> who<00:00:17.160> knows<00:00:17.340> what<00:00:17.670> it's

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
35 is what they said who knows what it's

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.609 
35 is what they said who knows what it's
gonna<00:00:17.880> do<00:00:18.090> we're<00:00:18.449> outside<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.020> Dallas<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.439> kind

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
gonna do we're outside of Dallas in kind

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.859 
gonna do we're outside of Dallas in kind
of<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.770> rural<00:00:19.920> area<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:21.150> gets<00:00:21.359> colder<00:00:21.720> than

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
of a rural area so it gets colder than

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.410 
of a rural area so it gets colder than
what<00:00:21.960> they<00:00:22.140> say<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:23.400> figured<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.180> time<00:00:24.210> to

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
what they say so I figured it's time to

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.210 
what they say so I figured it's time to
do<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.630> all<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> supplies<00:00:25.710> I've<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.099> been

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
do it all the supplies I've just been

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.830 
do it all the supplies I've just been
putting<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.550> off<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.640> putting<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.970> off<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.420> I

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
putting it off and putting it off so I

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.240 
putting it off and putting it off so I
guess<00:00:28.019> I'll<00:00:28.349> just<00:00:28.470> film<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.039> show<00:00:29.189> you

sport whatever you want to call it it is

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.479 
sport whatever you want to call it it is
absolutely<00:00:55.410> crucial<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.129> winterize

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
absolutely crucial that you winterize

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.959 
absolutely crucial that you winterize
especially<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.289> iowa<00:00:58.289> because<00:00:58.710> they<00:00:58.829> use<00:00:59.100> raw

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
especially in iowa because they use raw

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.389 
especially in iowa because they use raw
water<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.020> lake<00:01:01.500> or<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.829> ocean<00:01:01.920> it

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
water from the lake or the ocean it

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.920 
water from the lake or the ocean it
pumps<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.760> through<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.090> engine<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.600> water

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
pumps it through the engine and water

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.260 
pumps it through the engine and water
sits<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.439> engine<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.129> sits<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.119> it

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
sits in that engine and it sits and it

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.170 
sits in that engine and it sits and it
can<00:01:06.689> corrode<00:01:07.220> if<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.520> long<00:01:08.700> enough<00:01:09.000> but

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
can corrode if it's it's long enough but

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.460 
can corrode if it's it's long enough but
the<00:01:09.299> big<00:01:09.450> problem<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.900> freezing

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the big problem is freezing

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.810 
the big problem is freezing
what<00:01:10.860> happens<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:11.189> water<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.580> when<00:01:11.729> it

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
what happens with water is when it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.210 
what happens with water is when it
freezes<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.299> expands<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.110> when<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:13.950> inside

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
freezes it expands and when it's inside

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.399 
freezes it expands and when it's inside
of<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.369> narrow<00:01:14.580> passage<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.180> metal<00:01:15.600> concrete<00:01:15.990> or

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
of a narrow passage of metal concrete or

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.530 
of a narrow passage of metal concrete or
whatever<00:01:16.710> yeah<00:01:17.490> when<00:01:17.820> water<00:01:18.000> freezes<00:01:18.299> it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
whatever yeah when water freezes it

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.420 
whatever yeah when water freezes it
expands<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.439> crack<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.920> block<00:01:20.130> and

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
expands and it can crack the block and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.100 
expands and it can crack the block and
then<00:01:20.549> your<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.180> ruined<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.630> also<00:01:21.720> cracks

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
then your it's ruined it also cracks

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.350 
then your it's ruined it also cracks
manifolds<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.860> cracks<00:01:23.070> out<00:01:23.280> drives<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
manifolds it cracks out drives so the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.120 
manifolds it cracks out drives so the
key<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.990> get<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.500> water<00:01:25.650> out<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
key is to get all the water out of the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.670 
key is to get all the water out of the
engine<00:01:26.549> also<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.720> want<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> spray<00:01:28.350> fogging

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
engine also you want to spray fogging

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.620 
engine also you want to spray fogging
oil<00:01:29.040> inside<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> engine<00:01:29.909> which<00:01:30.180> basically

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
oil inside the engine which basically

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.390

marine<00:03:02.070> formula<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.610> probably<00:03:02.970> suckered<00:03:03.360> and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
marine formula I probably suckered and

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.420 
marine formula I probably suckered and
vine<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.840> but<00:03:03.959> anyway<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.769> also<00:03:04.920> helps<00:03:05.370> that

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
vine it but anyway it also helps that

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.850 
vine it but anyway it also helps that
ethanol<00:03:05.820> from<00:03:06.209> turning<00:03:06.720> into<00:03:06.860> basically

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
ethanol from turning into basically

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.590 
ethanol from turning into basically
separating<00:03:08.489> from<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.730> fuel<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.300> turning

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
separating from the fuel and turning

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.420 
separating from the fuel and turning
into<00:03:09.720> water<00:03:10.050> which<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.560> don't<00:03:10.800> want<00:03:10.860> first

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
into water which you don't want first

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.660 
into water which you don't want first
time<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.730> fired<00:03:11.970> up<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:13.130> in<00:03:14.130> this<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:14.550> the

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
time you fired up in in this in the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.009 
time you fired up in in this in the
spring<00:03:15.060> time<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:16.430> we<00:03:17.430> have<00:03:17.549> our<00:03:18.329> fogging<00:03:18.660> oil

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
spring time and we have our fogging oil

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.819 
spring time and we have our fogging oil
this<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.160> engine<00:03:20.850> store-brand<00:03:21.829> doesn't

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
this is engine store-brand doesn't

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.890 
this is engine store-brand doesn't
matter<00:03:22.950> which<00:03:23.160> one<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.430> use<00:03:23.570> I've<00:03:24.570> even<00:03:24.810> heard

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
matter which one you use I've even heard

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.710 
matter which one you use I've even heard
people<00:03:24.959> using<00:03:25.560> wd-40<00:03:26.370> but<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.820> figured<00:03:27.209> this

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
people using wd-40 but I figured this

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.390 
people using wd-40 but I figured this
stuff's<00:03:28.019> like<00:03:28.350> five<00:03:28.650> bucks<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:29.070> lasts<00:03:29.250> you

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
stuff's like five bucks it lasts you

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.039 
stuff's like five bucks it lasts you
through<00:03:29.640> four<00:03:29.850> years<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.329> just<00:03:30.630> happened<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:30.989> be

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
through four years I just happened to be

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.360 
through four years I just happened to be
out<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.410> because<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.650> restored<00:03:32.070> my<00:03:32.220> boat

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
out of it because I restored my boat

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.890 
out of it because I restored my boat
last<00:03:32.579> year<00:03:32.820> I<00:03:32.850> didn't<00:03:33.209> use<00:03:33.420> this<00:03:33.660> stuff

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
last year I didn't use this stuff

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.240 
last year I didn't use this stuff
because<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.410> engine<00:03:34.680> was<00:03:34.799> out<00:03:34.890> of<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.070> boat

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
because the engine was out of the boat

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.670 
because the engine was out of the boat
and<00:03:35.459> my<00:03:35.760> other<00:03:35.880> kin<00:03:36.209> was<00:03:36.450> pretty<00:03:36.900> much<00:03:37.019> shot<00:03:37.320> so

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
and my other kin was pretty much shot so

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.530 
and my other kin was pretty much shot so
you'll<00:03:38.310> see<00:03:38.489> what<00:03:38.640> this<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:38.970> used<00:03:39.150> for<00:03:39.209> here<00:03:39.480> in

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
you'll see what this is used for here in

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.729 
you'll see what this is used for here in
a<00:03:39.600> little<00:03:39.720> bit<00:03:40.040> so<00:03:41.040> also<00:03:41.840> this<00:03:42.840> right<00:03:43.170> here<00:03:43.470> you

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
a little bit so also this right here you

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.039 
a little bit so also this right here you
see<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:43.980> funnel<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.730> then<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.120> goes<00:03:45.780> into<00:03:45.989> a

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
see the funnel and then it goes into a

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.160 
see the funnel and then it goes into a
garden<00:03:46.440> hose<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.610> comes<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:48.030> an<00:03:48.150> end<00:03:48.510> like

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
garden hose and it comes to an end like

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.229 
garden hose and it comes to an end like
this<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:50.430> goes<00:03:50.670> on<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:52.530> little<00:03:53.030> ear<00:03:54.030> muffs

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
this that goes on the little ear muffs

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.630 
this that goes on the little ear muffs
on<00:03:54.540> your<00:03:55.110> out<00:03:55.230> drive<00:03:55.500> like<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:55.950> said<00:03:56.220> you'll<00:03:56.489> see

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
on your out drive like I said you'll see

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.210 
on your out drive like I said you'll see
what<00:03:56.760> that's<00:03:56.880> all<00:03:57.030> about<00:03:57.090> here<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.870> little<00:03:58.019> one

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
what that's all about here a little one

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.590 
what that's all about here a little one
first<00:03:59.220> thing<00:03:59.519> I<00:03:59.790> do<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:01.110> make<00:04:01.910> sure<00:04:02.910> first<00:04:03.420> of

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
first thing I do is make sure first of

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.789 
first thing I do is make sure first of
all<00:04:03.750> I've<00:04:03.870> got<00:04:03.900> about<00:04:04.170> three-quarters<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.709> the

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
all I've got about three-quarters of the

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.039 
all I've got about three-quarters of the
tank<00:04:05.070> in<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.910> boat<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:06.540> don't<00:04:06.570> want<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.870> full

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
tank in the boat you don't want a full

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.300 
tank in the boat you don't want a full
tank<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.410> don't<00:04:07.560> want<00:04:07.709> to<00:04:07.769> entertain<00:04:07.950> because

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
tank you don't want to entertain because

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.280 
tank you don't want to entertain because
if<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.459> have<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.609> full<00:04:08.820> tank<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.239> it<00:04:09.780> gets<00:04:09.959> warm

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
if you have a full tank and it gets warm

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.840 
if you have a full tank and it gets warm
or<00:04:10.530> anything<00:04:10.680> like<00:04:10.859> that<00:04:10.920> it<00:04:11.100> can<00:04:11.190> expand<00:04:11.670> and

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
or anything like that it can expand and

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.220 
or anything like that it can expand and
the<00:04:11.940> fuel<00:04:12.150> can<00:04:12.299> spill<00:04:12.570> out<00:04:12.600> you<00:04:12.900> don't<00:04:13.019> want

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
the fuel can spill out you don't want

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.539 
the fuel can spill out you don't want
that<00:04:13.380> excessed<00:04:13.680> bad<00:04:13.829> for<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.070> environment

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
that excessed bad for the environment

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.370 
that excessed bad for the environment
you<00:04:15.239> don't<00:04:15.390> want<00:04:15.510> empty<00:04:15.750> tank<00:04:15.989> because<00:04:16.229> that

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
you don't want empty tank because that

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.080 
you don't want empty tank because that
promotes<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.859> fact<00:04:17.070> that<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.430> water<00:04:17.850> can

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
promotes the fact that the water can

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.400 
promotes the fact that the water can
actually<00:04:18.269> build<00:04:18.870> up<00:04:18.989> in<00:04:19.140> there<00:04:19.260> and

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
actually build up in there and

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.259 
actually build up in there and
condensation<00:04:20.039> and<00:04:20.280> cause<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:20.580> you<00:04:21.000> know<00:04:21.090> water

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
condensation and cause a you know water

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.270 
condensation and cause a you know water
contamination<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.959> your<00:04:22.049> fuel<00:04:22.349> so<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.099> first

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
contamination to your fuel so the first

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.580 
contamination to your fuel so the first
thing<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:23.550> do<00:04:23.610> is<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.360> want<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.690> treat<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.320> gas

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
thing I do is I want to treat the gas

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.300 
thing I do is I want to treat the gas
take<00:04:26.090> contents<00:04:27.230> before<00:04:28.230> I<00:04:28.440> start<00:04:28.889> and<00:04:29.040> run<00:04:29.190> it

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
take contents before I start and run it

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.530 
take contents before I start and run it
for<00:04:29.430> this<00:04:29.550> last<00:04:29.760> time<00:04:29.970> before<00:04:30.120> what<00:04:30.389> before

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
for this last time before what before

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.290 
for this last time before what before
winterization<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.620> what<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.250> do<00:04:32.370> then<00:04:32.790> is<00:04:33.060> you

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
winterization and what I do then is you

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.260 
winterization and what I do then is you
you<00:04:33.540> run<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.050> stable<00:04:34.260> in<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.979> gas<00:04:35.430> tank<00:04:35.790> for

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
you run the stable in the gas tank for

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.150 
you run the stable in the gas tank for
probably<00:04:37.080> let<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.530> engine<00:04:37.770> get<00:04:37.889> to<00:04:37.979> full

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
probably let the engine get to full

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.189 
probably let the engine get to full
running<00:04:38.370> temperature<00:04:38.850> so<00:04:39.060> that<00:04:39.210> way<00:04:39.330> all<00:04:39.660> the

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
running temperature so that way all the

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.900 
running temperature so that way all the
stable<00:04:40.500> is<00:04:40.680> mixed<00:04:41.010> through<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.250> gas<00:04:41.430> tank<00:04:41.729> in

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
stable is mixed through the gas tank in

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.060 
stable is mixed through the gas tank in
its<00:04:42.120> all<00:04:42.330> through<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.690> fuel<00:04:43.169> lines<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.650> in

its all through the fuel lines and in

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.520 
its all through the fuel lines and in
the<00:04:44.190> engine<00:04:44.550> or<00:04:44.729> I'd<00:04:45.120> say<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.449> carburetor<00:04:45.870> so

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
the engine or I'd say the carburetor so

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.840 
the engine or I'd say the carburetor so
that's<00:04:46.800> what<00:04:46.949> I'm<00:04:47.040> gonna<00:04:47.130> do<00:04:47.310> right<00:04:47.340> now<00:04:47.520> I'm

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
that's what I'm gonna do right now I'm

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.550 
that's what I'm gonna do right now I'm
gonna<00:04:47.940> go<00:04:48.120> ahead<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.389> do<00:04:48.630> this<00:04:48.780> run<00:04:49.440> the

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
gonna go ahead and do this run the

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.409 
gonna go ahead and do this run the
garden<00:04:49.860> hose<00:04:50.010> over<00:04:50.280> there<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:50.669> and<00:04:50.880> run<00:04:51.210> it<00:04:51.330> on

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
garden hose over there and and run it on

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:58.350 
garden hose over there and and run it on
earmuffs<00:04:51.780> like<00:04:51.960> I<00:04:52.080> would<00:04:52.260> any<00:04:52.440> other<00:04:52.470> time

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:07.140 

the<00:04:58.509> stable<00:04:58.930> in<00:04:59.169> the<00:04:59.319> gas<00:05:00.220> tank

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.030 

so<00:05:07.330> now<00:05:07.510> got<00:05:07.750> it<00:05:07.870> started<00:05:08.139> make<00:05:08.500> sure<00:05:08.530> all<00:05:08.889> the

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
so now got it started make sure all the

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.529 
so now got it started make sure all the
water<00:05:09.550> is<00:05:09.760> on<00:05:09.910> and<00:05:10.419> it's<00:05:10.600> covering<00:05:10.960> water

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.690 

so<00:05:14.780> all

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.520 

okay<00:05:18.700> so<00:05:18.760> the<00:05:19.060> engine<00:05:19.330> is<00:05:19.450> fully<00:05:20.020> warmed<00:05:20.380> up

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
okay so the engine is fully warmed up

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.400 
okay so the engine is fully warmed up
and<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.520> thermostat<00:05:21.790> opens<00:05:22.300> so<00:05:22.540> have<00:05:23.110> plenty

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
and the thermostat opens so have plenty

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.870 
and the thermostat opens so have plenty
of<00:05:23.530> stuff<00:05:23.710> circulating<00:05:24.310> through<00:05:24.490> the<00:05:24.580> engine

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
of stuff circulating through the engine

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.840 
of stuff circulating through the engine
now<00:05:25.570> it<00:05:25.900> is<00:05:26.020> time<00:05:26.290> to<00:05:26.500> disconnect<00:05:27.040> the<00:05:27.490> garden

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
now it is time to disconnect the garden

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.480 
now it is time to disconnect the garden
hose<00:05:28.060> and<00:05:28.330> then<00:05:29.080> use<00:05:29.350> our<00:05:29.590> little<00:05:29.770> funnel<00:05:30.130> and

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
hose and then use our little funnel and

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.430 
hose and then use our little funnel and
garden<00:05:30.790> hose<00:05:30.910> attachment<00:05:31.540> what<00:05:32.200> we're<00:05:32.320> going

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
garden hose attachment what we're going

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.470 
garden hose attachment what we're going
to<00:05:32.470> do<00:05:32.680> is<00:05:32.830> we're<00:05:33.010> actually<00:05:33.190> going<00:05:33.580> to<00:05:33.670> put<00:05:34.360> it

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
to do is we're actually going to put it

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.580 
to do is we're actually going to put it
on<00:05:34.630> to<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:35.730> earmuffs<00:05:36.730> down<00:05:37.060> there<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:37.600> then

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
on to the earmuffs down there and then

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.350 
on to the earmuffs down there and then
we're<00:05:38.740> gonna<00:05:38.830> take<00:05:39.130> our<00:05:41.640> alcohol<00:05:42.640> mix<00:05:43.150> or

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
we're gonna take our alcohol mix or

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.300 
we're gonna take our alcohol mix or
antifreeze<00:05:43.810> and<00:05:44.020> dump<00:05:44.650> it<00:05:44.800> in<00:05:44.890> there<00:05:45.040> with<00:05:45.190> the

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
antifreeze and dump it in there with the

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.970 
antifreeze and dump it in there with the
engine<00:05:45.670> running<00:05:46.060> now<00:05:46.180> this<00:05:47.170> is<00:05:47.380> not<00:05:47.560> something

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
engine running now this is not something

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.350 
engine running now this is not something
you<00:05:48.100> do<00:05:48.250> and<00:05:48.400> you<00:05:48.520> leave<00:05:48.730> this<00:05:48.910> stuff<00:05:49.090> in<00:05:49.240> the

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
you do and you leave this stuff in the

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.760 
you do and you leave this stuff in the
engine<00:05:49.600> that's<00:05:49.750> kind<00:05:50.020> of<00:05:50.080> a<00:05:50.170> cheater<00:05:50.410> way<00:05:50.620> of

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
engine that's kind of a cheater way of

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.170 
engine that's kind of a cheater way of
winterizing<00:05:51.250> you<00:05:51.490> actually<00:05:51.790> still<00:05:52.000> have<00:05:52.090> to

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
winterizing you actually still have to

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.460 
winterizing you actually still have to
drain<00:05:52.390> the<00:05:52.450> engine<00:05:52.870> which<00:05:52.990> you'll<00:05:53.140> see<00:05:53.170> here

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
drain the engine which you'll see here

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.890 
drain the engine which you'll see here
in<00:05:53.530> a<00:05:53.590> little<00:05:53.800> bit<00:05:53.920> but<00:05:54.670> this<00:05:55.000> this<00:05:55.270> way<00:05:55.480> this

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
in a little bit but this this way this

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.420 
in a little bit but this this way this
what<00:05:56.080> it<00:05:56.170> does<00:05:56.320> is<00:05:56.470> it<00:05:56.620> flushes<00:05:56.860> all<00:05:57.130> the<00:05:57.250> water

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
what it does is it flushes all the water

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.030 
what it does is it flushes all the water
out<00:05:57.670> and<00:05:57.850> it<00:05:58.390> makes<00:05:59.080> sure<00:05:59.230> that<00:05:59.260> all<00:05:59.470> that<00:05:59.830> met

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
out and it makes sure that all that met

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.560 
out and it makes sure that all that met
pink<00:06:00.310> stuff<00:06:00.580> or<00:06:00.700> the<00:06:00.760> antifreeze<00:06:01.000> gets<00:06:01.360> into

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
pink stuff or the antifreeze gets into

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.270 
pink stuff or the antifreeze gets into
all<00:06:01.720> the<00:06:01.750> little<00:06:02.110> passages<00:06:02.620> so<00:06:02.830> that<00:06:02.980> way<00:06:03.100> if

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
all the little passages so that way if

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.920 
all the little passages so that way if
there's<00:06:03.460> anything<00:06:03.700> left<00:06:04.060> whenever<00:06:04.480> you<00:06:04.660> drain

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
there's anything left whenever you drain

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.200 
there's anything left whenever you drain
the<00:06:05.080> engine<00:06:05.410> you<00:06:05.920> don't<00:06:06.100> have<00:06:06.340> you<00:06:07.000> don't<00:06:07.030> have

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
the engine you don't have you don't have

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.730 
the engine you don't have you don't have
any<00:06:07.390> freeze<00:06:07.660> problems<00:06:08.110> now<00:06:08.290> that's<00:06:08.470> probably

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
any freeze problems now that's probably

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.170 
any freeze problems now that's probably
being<00:06:08.860> a<00:06:08.950> little<00:06:08.980> over-ambitious<00:06:09.430> but<00:06:10.060> you

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
being a little over-ambitious but you

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.790 
being a little over-ambitious but you
know<00:06:10.300> I'd<00:06:10.720> rather<00:06:10.840> be<00:06:11.020> safe<00:06:11.230> than<00:06:11.260> sorry<00:06:11.470> so

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
know I'd rather be safe than sorry so

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.160 
know I'd rather be safe than sorry so
what<00:06:12.550> we're<00:06:12.700> gonna<00:06:12.760> do<00:06:12.970> right<00:06:13.120> now<00:06:13.300> is<00:06:13.570> hook

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.170 
what we're gonna do right now is hook

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.080 
what we're gonna do right now is hook
this<00:06:14.290> up<00:06:14.350> and<00:06:14.680> then<00:06:15.190> let<00:06:15.370> the<00:06:15.490> pink<00:06:15.640> stuff<00:06:15.850> run

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
this up and then let the pink stuff run

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.030 
this up and then let the pink stuff run
and<00:06:16.270> what<00:06:16.360> you<00:06:16.450> do<00:06:16.570> is<00:06:16.690> you<00:06:16.780> just<00:06:16.810> dump<00:06:17.170> the<00:06:17.350> the

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
and what you do is you just dump the the

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.370 
and what you do is you just dump the the
pink<00:06:18.310> into<00:06:18.580> the<00:06:18.910> funnel<00:06:19.540> until<00:06:19.720> you<00:06:19.930> see<00:06:20.110> pink

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
pink into the funnel until you see pink

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.070 
pink into the funnel until you see pink
coming<00:06:20.710> out<00:06:20.830> of<00:06:20.980> the<00:06:21.100> exhaust<00:06:21.970> port<00:06:22.360> and<00:06:22.570> then

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
coming out of the exhaust port and then

00:06:23.080 --> 00:07:25.409 
coming out of the exhaust port and then
we'll<00:06:23.230> go<00:06:23.320> on<00:06:23.350> to<00:06:23.500> the<00:06:23.590> fogging<00:06:23.890> of<00:06:24.130> the<00:06:24.220> engine

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:25.419 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:28.270 

okay<00:07:26.419> so<00:07:26.479> you<00:07:26.690> saw<00:07:27.020> the<00:07:27.080> pink<00:07:27.740> stuff<00:07:27.949> coming

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 
okay so you saw the pink stuff coming

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.620 
okay so you saw the pink stuff coming
out<00:07:28.400> down<00:07:28.669> there<00:07:28.880> and<00:07:29.150> that's<00:07:29.270> the<00:07:29.449> way<00:07:29.509> we're

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630 
out down there and that's the way we're

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.909 
out down there and that's the way we're
gonna<00:07:29.690> leave<00:07:29.960> it<00:07:30.080> for<00:07:30.199> right<00:07:30.380> now<00:07:30.560> but<00:07:30.830> the

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:30.919 
gonna leave it for right now but the
