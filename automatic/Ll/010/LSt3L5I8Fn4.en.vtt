 hello my name is andres perez manager 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.580
 of technical marketing and 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.770
 communications area oil and 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.870
 caterpillar gas I'm here in the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.639
 Offshore technology conference 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.049
 2013 that is being carried out in the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.700
 City of Houston in Texas 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.350
 We hope you had the opportunity 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.090
 to visit us during the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.010
 exhibition but in case that does not 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.990
 has been possible to accompany by some 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.369
 minutes to give you a brief tour 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.160
 about the products that we are 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.630
 exhibiting this year let's start with the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.330
 more imposing unit than caterpillar 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.550
 has on display this year the engine 35 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.040
 12 designed specifically for 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.920
 Well stimulation applications with 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.719
 hydraulic fracturing operations 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.300
 This engine is an engine designed with 2 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.670
 thousand 250 horsepower or 2500 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.969
 horsepower at 1800 revolutions 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.860
 per minute two configurations are 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.110
 available air cooling with 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.180
 air and air with water to really 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.219
 have the opportunity to apply it to 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.789
 any type of application 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.859
 hydraulic fracturing this engine 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.899
 the most significant thing that has happened with 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.400
 this engine this year is that it meets 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.890
 the regulations 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.110
 of the environmental protection agency 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.370
 US Environmental epa has 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.440
 four final 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.810
 this is a significant reduction in 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.210
 the pollutants in the exhaust gases 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.550
 and to achieve this caterpillar has 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.190
 introduced reduction technologies 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.530
 nitrogen oxide in combination with a 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.140
 Catalytic oxidation converter for 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.290
 thus reduce means significantly 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.590
 to the pollutants in the gases of 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.299
 escape 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.000
 let's talk now about some details 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.850
 about this caterpillar engine has 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.920
 decreased installation complexity 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.109
 of this engine in the facilities of 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.409
 our customers and for this we are 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.700
 providing a complete package with 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.340
 all the technologies and all the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.709
 components included in a package that 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.560
 complies with tier 4 regulations 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:58.299
 final as you can see all the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.490
 Necessary components are mounted on 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.469
 the engine as are the cleaners 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.929

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.060
 also the muffler converters 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.700
 catalytic and all the lines that are 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.929
 necessary for the motor to be 100% 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.120
 functional 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.810
 this engine also unlike the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.670
 Tier 2 engines or the previous generation 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.430
 has the distribution system of 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.690
 common rail fuel that is a 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.239
 high pressure fuel system 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.400
 that helps us improve efficiency and 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.220
 also reduce the pollutants that 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.280
 come out of the exhaust gases as we have 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.840
 talked about the 3512 engines for 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.660
 Well stimulation applications 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.960
 are designed for easy integration and 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.790
 this also includes space 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.970
 with the caterpillar line of 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.900
 transmissions such as the th 55 and the c 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.680
 x 48 this year we have available the
