00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.170 
okay
make<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.810> line<00:03:50.400> make<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.430> line<00:03:51.670> that<00:03:51.819> looks<00:03:52.030> like

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
make a line make a line that looks like

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.710 
make a line make a line that looks like
this<00:03:52.420> vertical<00:03:53.139> line<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:53.590> then<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:55.000> start

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
this vertical line and then you start

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.979 
this vertical line and then you start
from<00:03:55.959> about<00:03:56.319> I<00:03:56.590> would<00:03:56.680> say<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.400> top<00:03:57.940> top<00:03:58.690> part

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
from about I would say the top top part

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.780 
from about I would say the top top part
not<00:03:59.200> all<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.530> way<00:03:59.620> to<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.829> top<00:04:00.010> here<00:04:00.280> but

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
not all the way to the top here but

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.520 
not all the way to the top here but
towards<00:04:01.389> maybe<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.810> little<00:04:01.930> bit<00:04:02.079> higher<00:04:02.290> than

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
towards maybe a little bit higher than

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.199 
towards maybe a little bit higher than
halfway<00:04:02.799> mark<00:04:03.190> this<00:04:03.370> would<00:04:03.549> be<00:04:03.639> halfway<00:04:04.000> mark

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
halfway mark this would be halfway mark

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.640 
halfway mark this would be halfway mark
but<00:04:04.450> I'd<00:04:04.540> say<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:04.750> little<00:04:04.840> bit<00:04:04.989> higher<00:04:05.440> than

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
but I'd say a little bit higher than

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.650 
but I'd say a little bit higher than
halfway<00:04:05.889> mark<00:04:06.220> you<00:04:06.910> then<00:04:07.090> make<00:04:07.299> a<00:04:07.530> circle<00:04:08.530> okay

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
halfway mark you then make a circle okay

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:21.640 
halfway mark you then make a circle okay
like<00:04:10.660> that

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.709 

you
