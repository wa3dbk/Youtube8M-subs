I

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.049 

frostbites<00:00:11.280> been<00:00:11.459> in<00:00:11.549> development<00:00:11.670> since

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
frostbites been in development since

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.749 
frostbites been in development since
2006<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.379> there's<00:00:13.799> always<00:00:13.980> been<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.280> road<00:00:14.549> map

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
2006 and there's always been a road map

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.380 
2006 and there's always been a road map
and<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.029> plan<00:00:15.299> for<00:00:16.020> gen<00:00:16.439> 4<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.039> beyond<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.090> I

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
and a plan for gen 4 and beyond so I

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.179 
and a plan for gen 4 and beyond so I
like<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.750> think<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:19.110> frostbite<00:00:19.619> as<00:00:19.950> an

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
like to think of frostbite as an

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.760 
like to think of frostbite as an
evolutionary<00:00:20.970> process<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.810> frostbite<00:00:22.199> 3<00:00:22.439> is

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
evolutionary process and frostbite 3 is

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.650 
evolutionary process and frostbite 3 is
the<00:00:23.130> next<00:00:23.430> step<00:00:23.669> in<00:00:23.849> that<00:00:23.910> evolution

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the next step in that evolution

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.200 
the next step in that evolution
frostbite<00:00:25.560> 3<00:00:25.770> is<00:00:25.919> a<00:00:25.949> really<00:00:26.550> powerful<00:00:26.700> tool

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
frostbite 3 is a really powerful tool

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.269 
frostbite 3 is a really powerful tool

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
crashes into the ocean you'll see the

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.199 
crashes into the ocean you'll see the
water<00:02:45.470> reaction<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.519> debris<00:02:46.819> will<00:02:47.030> then

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
water reaction and the debris will then

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.930 
water reaction and the debris will then
float<00:02:47.630> on<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.440> waves<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:48.889> a<00:02:49.010> very<00:02:49.250> very<00:02:49.700> cool

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
float on the waves it's a very very cool

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.629 
float on the waves it's a very very cool
dynamic<00:02:50.600> engine<00:02:50.989> things<00:02:51.410> just<00:02:51.530> happen<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.400> it

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
dynamic engine things just happen and it

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:57.160 
dynamic engine things just happen and it
seems<00:02:52.970> right

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.780 

in<00:02:58.170> frostbite<00:02:58.590> 3<00:02:58.739> we've<00:02:58.950> made<00:02:59.129> a<00:02:59.159> priority<00:02:59.459> of

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
in frostbite 3 we've made a priority of

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.850 
in frostbite 3 we've made a priority of
a<00:03:00.000> much<00:03:00.390> more<00:03:00.629> believable<00:03:00.860> emotionally

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
a much more believable emotionally

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.619 
a much more believable emotionally
believable<00:03:02.370> characters<00:03:02.909> there's<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.269> whole

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
believable characters there's a whole

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.809 
believable characters there's a whole
slew<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.170> features<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:04.920> frostbite<00:03:05.400> that

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
slew of features in frostbite that

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.210 
slew of features in frostbite that
support<00:03:06.659> that<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.230> one<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:08.040> most

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
support that and one of the most

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.580 
support that and one of the most
important<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:09.269> way<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.720> person's<00:03:10.409> eyes

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
important is the way a person's eyes

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.890 
important is the way a person's eyes
look<00:03:11.159> the<00:03:11.670> way<00:03:11.760> we<00:03:11.790> render<00:03:12.209> characters<00:03:12.659> is

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
look the way we render characters is

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.780 
look the way we render characters is
better<00:03:13.530> than<00:03:13.709> ever<00:03:13.890> before<00:03:14.280> we're<00:03:14.579> doing

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
better than ever before we're doing

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.369 
better than ever before we're doing
subsurface<00:03:15.239> scattering<00:03:15.480> models<00:03:16.110> we<00:03:16.230> have

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
subsurface scattering models we have

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.920 
subsurface scattering models we have
parallax<00:03:16.920> animation<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:17.909> the<00:03:18.060> iris<00:03:18.450> you'll

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
parallax animation in the iris you'll

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.350 
parallax animation in the iris you'll
notice<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.709> looks<00:03:20.040> like<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> real<00:03:20.579> I<00:03:20.790> you'll

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
notice it looks like a real I you'll

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.410 
notice it looks like a real I you'll
back<00:03:21.510> me<00:03:21.540> up<00:03:21.690> right<00:03:22.310> frostbite<00:03:23.310> 3<00:03:23.579> is<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:24.209> much

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
back me up right frostbite 3 is so much

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.850 
back me up right frostbite 3 is so much
more<00:03:24.450> powerful<00:03:24.900> than<00:03:25.110> any<00:03:25.290> engine<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.680> ever

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
more powerful than any engine I ever

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.520 
more powerful than any engine I ever
used<00:03:26.069> before<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.879> it's<00:03:27.359> not<00:03:27.540> just<00:03:27.599> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
used before and it's not just the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.589 
used before and it's not just the
specific<00:03:29.010> features<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.730> framework<00:03:30.030> it's

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
specific features in the framework it's

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.390 
specific features in the framework it's
the<00:03:30.780> fact<00:03:30.989> that<00:03:31.140> we're<00:03:31.410> collaborating<00:03:32.099> with

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
the fact that we're collaborating with

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.240 
the fact that we're collaborating with

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
other teams around the world in the past

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.369 
other teams around the world in the past
before<00:03:35.670> we<00:03:36.090> have<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.540> frostbite<00:03:36.959> team<00:03:37.200> we

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
before we have the frostbite team we

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.229 
before we have the frostbite team we
were<00:03:37.500> building<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.160> new<00:03:38.310> engine<00:03:38.519> every<00:03:39.030> time

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
were building a new engine every time

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.970 
were building a new engine every time
and<00:03:39.540> we<00:03:39.629> were<00:03:39.720> kind<00:03:39.870> of<00:03:39.989> stumbling<00:03:40.440> constantly

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
and we were kind of stumbling constantly

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.000 
and we were kind of stumbling constantly
now<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:42.030> have<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.659> team<00:03:42.870> here<00:03:43.140> to<00:03:43.319> focus<00:03:43.650> on

now to have the team here to focus on
new<00:03:44.159> releases<00:03:44.579> with<00:03:45.180> new<00:03:45.450> good<00:03:45.720> is<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.230> means

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
new releases with new good is it means

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.319 
new releases with new good is it means
