00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.140
 Hello, the second part of the video 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.969
 painting Lexus advised in decided 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.900
 take off show what happened like this 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.080
 Now our car looks beautiful 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.080
 brilliance 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.670
 but with rubbish there are grains of sand 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.769
 will try to polish somehow though 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:35.059
 this thing I do not like me is not very good 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:41.660
 it turns out to do so 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:45.270
 cleaned everything up to the metal hood and roof 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.820
 here did not become because lay old 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.780

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.190

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:00.090

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.520
 as they say 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:17.509
 Probably then they will ask to do not even 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:20.400
 I know I had 500 grams of paint 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:30.229
 just feared that my not enough 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:34.829
 As if the body had painted nothing enough 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:37.380
 peel off as if the hacks of many years 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.450
 paper so the paint doesn't fly off but me 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:50.540
 until nothing flew to whom thank God 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:50.540
 while I glue so here 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:02:00.390

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:04.979

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:11.730

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:42.379
 Just in case a satisfactory 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:50.599
 creature appropriate measure 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:54.690

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:11.239

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:14.010
 here we are the compressor 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.720
 pressure regulator which is so common 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.280
 They say I do not know how to regulate 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.200
 pressure here it is inexpensive and 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.690
 moisture separator too yesterday before 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.230

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:36.419
 handy lid just fingers 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:40.709

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:10.790
 attached polishing machine not 68 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.880
 dozens passed very long and 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.880
 a chore 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:27.680

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:34.250
