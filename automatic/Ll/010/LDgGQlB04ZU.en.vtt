00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 the powerful instrument hyponen yourself 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.790
 when it does not emit any sound 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.540
 when the accordion falls in the right hands 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:18.000
 also known as an accordion 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:20.330
 it 's impossible not to get upset 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.820

 touched the instrument for the first time 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.800
 was the beginning of a passion started by the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.800
 the harder type the accordion of eight 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:50.250
 low though small as well 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:51.059
 more complex but the pace is on 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.680
 blood 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.860
 learned by observing the generations 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.859
 previous grandfather's accordion to only the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.800
 father and then by the tinho the famous happy 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.250
 days of the accordion from whom he inherited the name 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.630
 the accordion and the talent I was to be the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.960
 successor of the album 18 bass but despite 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:16.140
 of the routine of life agents I separated 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.700
 I went out of my city and now 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.830
 straight return and was baptized with the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.340
 whole new bible bringing this 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.880
 My father's uncle's story of my 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.770
 Grandma 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.799
 the difference between the two instruments 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.070
 it's not just the size of the accordion 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.750
 weighs an average of 13 pounds and each 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.420
 only one note 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.869
 already the accordion of eight lows of these 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.110
 only two pounds and each of the lows 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:50.899
 able to issue two notes, which 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.899
 this small being much more complex 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:01.369
 each button it has two tones 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:04.430
 you make a two tone note 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.460
 the normal accordion you make a chord 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.350
 either opening or closing the accordion was 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.680
 brought to Brazil through the 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.720
 Italian and German immigrants is a 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.630
 athletic instrument that adapts to 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.709
 various rhythms like tango samba bolero 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.810
 There is no doubt that 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.920
 fit very well in rhythm 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.900

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.690
 but equal function anywhere in the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.300
 world 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.830
