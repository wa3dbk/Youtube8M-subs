too<00:00:22.420> far<00:00:22.690> at<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:22.930> coast<00:00:23.140> and<00:00:23.260> we<00:00:23.380> were<00:00:23.440> going

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620 
too far at the coast and we were going

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.800 
too far at the coast and we were going
towards<00:00:24.010> it<00:00:24.190> the<00:00:24.640> RIP<00:00:25.000> is<00:00:25.120> moving<00:00:25.420> so<00:00:25.600> fast

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
towards it the RIP is moving so fast

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.750 
towards it the RIP is moving so fast
that<00:00:26.230> it<00:00:26.860> was<00:00:26.980> obvious<00:00:27.310> we<00:00:27.460> weren't<00:00:27.670> gonna

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
that it was obvious we weren't gonna

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.200 
that it was obvious we weren't gonna
make<00:00:27.970> it

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
make it

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.590 
make it

straight out towards us it partly seemed

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.930 
straight out towards us it partly seemed

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
been seen about four hours earlier we

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.979 
been seen about four hours earlier we
flew<00:00:56.800> up<00:00:56.830> the<00:00:57.100> coast<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.730> examined<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:58.629> foot

flew up the coast and examined the foot

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.060 
flew up the coast and examined the foot
of<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.170> cliffs<00:00:59.379> in<00:00:59.559> case<00:00:59.739> the<00:00:59.890> surface

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.340 

it<00:01:08.240> entered<00:01:08.540> these<00:01:08.630> first<00:01:08.960> stages<00:01:09.260> of

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
it entered these first stages of

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.440 
it entered these first stages of
hypothermia<00:01:09.530> that<00:01:09.920> was<00:01:10.010> clear<00:01:10.280> now<00:01:10.490> you

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
hypothermia that was clear now you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.700 
hypothermia that was clear now you
wanted<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:11.840> shiver<00:01:12.050> there<00:01:12.620> was<00:01:12.770> nothing<00:01:13.070> there

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
wanted to shiver there was nothing there

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.530 
wanted to shiver there was nothing there
we<00:01:15.710> have<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.070> get<00:01:16.190> into<00:01:16.340> Shore<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.000> Pete<00:01:17.420> was

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
we have to get into Shore and Pete was

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.820 
we have to get into Shore and Pete was
right<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.050> maybe<00:01:18.170> we<00:01:18.410> should<00:01:18.440> have<00:01:18.590> done<00:01:18.770> that

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
right and maybe we should have done that

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.430 
right and maybe we should have done that
all<00:01:19.100> along<00:01:19.430> I<00:01:19.790> was<00:01:20.540> having<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.930> rest<00:01:21.170> for

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
all along I was having to rest for

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.500 
all along I was having to rest for
probably<00:01:22.340> longer<00:01:22.610> than<00:01:22.729> I'd<00:01:22.940> actually<00:01:23.240> spent

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
probably longer than I'd actually spent

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.930 
probably longer than I'd actually spent
paddling<00:01:23.960> who<00:01:24.560> then<00:01:24.890> beginning<00:01:25.430> to<00:01:25.550> realize

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
paddling who then beginning to realize

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.090 
paddling who then beginning to realize
that<00:01:26.300> it<00:01:26.660> was<00:01:26.810> just<00:01:26.990> not<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:27.170> reality<00:01:27.410> that<00:01:28.010> we

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
that it was just not a reality that we

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.760 
that it was just not a reality that we
were<00:01:28.190> going<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.340> paddle<00:01:28.670> towards<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.030> shore

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
were going to paddle towards the shore

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.500 
were going to paddle towards the shore
I'm<00:01:30.770> certain<00:01:31.190> that<00:01:31.280> I<00:01:31.340> have<00:01:31.490> never<00:01:31.670> found

panning up and down the cliffs with a
searchlight<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.310> we<00:01:43.460> just<00:01:43.640> be<00:01:43.729> thinking<00:01:44.000> that

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
searchlight and we just be thinking that

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
of The X Files and to think that we were

certainly we were we were descending on

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.440 
certainly we were we were descending on
the<00:03:00.800> spot<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.070> we'd<00:03:01.340> left<00:03:01.580> for<00:03:01.850> 1/2<00:03:02.120> hours

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450
