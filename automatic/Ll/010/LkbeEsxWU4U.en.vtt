00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.890
 we come back in the way of time statements like in the big city needs 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.290
 It's not too hard and the public transport is not 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.110
 Always right one sees already with huge suitcases in public 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.190
 On the way, they know what I'm talking about 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.770
 Young men exhaling thought that the project can have a little life 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.200
 called and what that is exactly and how the it processes that they tell me 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.150
 even three of them are 4 AQ Khan is an indication that the sheet and Andreas Krieger 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:34.060
 secret noise makes you sick then Hicom Opel stands for these shortcuts second 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.120
 she wages war Mike k so the first two letters of what this 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.429
 you can almost think what it's all about you can do that 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:42.300
 Car in front 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.640
 someone's life or how it works 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.610
 as well as this Germany's first private car sharing 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.790
 then the question is asked and pulling so many cars to stand knows what 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.830
 Used to lose value if not used how can you do that 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.180
 Always improve and that's why we thought it would be nice if I did 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.670
 own a car with this shot of internet site 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.830
 can and landlords to others continue this from smoking that means he has 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.430
 a website where you can rent foreign cars 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.200
 just like Liza mycare de da you just go when you have a car 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.060
 you just do not need Stefan Aust was online available to users in the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.120
 Region or in its environment and the users but just jump on the 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.670
 rather 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.399
 page 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.030
 You could rent the car okay if anyone can join or Wienerberger 

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:28.020
 It costs strength, for example 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.740
 Well, so the registration is free 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.880
 To set his own car online can determine how much money he has 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.270
 and the special is that we a full insurance 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.940
 on top of that put the whole then secure okay that is if someone 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.310
 with my car 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.800
 I feel it will be him on the strong nerves this time the money 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.850
 adjourned for the car again or again 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.830
 That's exactly the crux of Highstreet the whole of Berlin 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.290
 finally quite exactly so regardless of the fusion shot the artists out 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.539
 Finally we expose our partner of the Samarkand of the Württemberg 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.060
 always a fully comprehensive protection bullet wounds 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.000
 the landlord would be paid before therefore are not aware height of 7 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.139
 Euro 50 per day on top 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.059
 and so the whole ride is safely backed RP at night so that 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:15.419
 mainly students but there 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.449
 Mölders 19 did not tear off an heirloom 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:23.209
 which absolutely broad-minded Werner of course does not drive bad 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.710
 Of course, both studies do not have their own car 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.060
 which is very expensive 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.010
 but we also have to provide working people with playback 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.709
 want during their working hours 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.709
 in the amount of then Sion must be and then the hair because I too 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.709
 small ten percent or 20 years old is yesterday 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.760
 3 mentioned 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.750
 lackluster far beyond that, so there is trouble 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.440
 Aarau and old Mercedes or maybe just Steffen Hausen Porsche 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.620
 should also be right on the tube of the third World Cup in a row at Christmas 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.520
 Landing Ortega's harvest season and is available to make a request 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.190
 and then see if their cars make the composite confused and then 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.900
 let's go 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.200
 There you will not see what car squad provides then in 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.560
 which city or around Aachen in which area 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.859
 when the car is available 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.159
 more Werne search function 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.079
 on the tape I show my nice card on the all cars 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.959
 The scanners are available 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.299
 and then you can choose the car you want 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.109
 stocky the Porsche is or the cheap VW Golf already in the lead 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.569

 my request job must be flexible missing 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.300
 You can see that it was enough to 13 violates the 15 04 clock 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.720
 already or even much faster that is the foot can take percent 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.530
 if he is not so flexible or he just might not play 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.189
