00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.290
 hello everyone tabales here from crack 10 and 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.700
 good today I bring you a tutorial of the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.290
 pounds kings of taking the flag in the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.370
 slums map is worth a new series that 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.440
 is going to start on my channel and well what 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.420
 we must first place ourselves in the house 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.400
 blue and that our partners kill 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.500
 the enemies are worth we have to 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.000
 place now I can put the video and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.310
 well we have to place here where 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.320
 where I'm going to place myself now and what 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.029
 we have to try is that our 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.009
 you know that he went to 42 and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.840
 us normally and competitive 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.910
 so then our partners 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.190
 they have to kill all the enemies 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.200
 as soon as possible and then for us 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.210
 we are going to put here preferably 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.739
 with a long weapon to catch the rest 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.480
 since I want you to notice the black 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.920
 bird on the mini map above go to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.980
 to be continuously appearing there 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.649
 so I have thrown the black bird 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.840
 so you can see perfectly where they are going 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.969
 appear all the time there and if our 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.960
 friends then we give them our companions weapon 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.370
 all the equipment 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.559
 at the time of reappearing to reappear 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.510
 there the only way they would have would be 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.159
 go behind the whole map and 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.630
 they would waste so much time therefore 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.060
 we could take many flags 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.210
 so then if we have you here nothing 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.950
 for more controllers and pound them 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.270
 we control the respado ning and fix it 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.009
 see what happens we could not take 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.659
 all the flags we would like if 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.190
 as long as we kill them nothing else 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.540
 that were for the cisen then 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.700
 good and here was just action doing 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.680
 not just with a friend since the others 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.630
 those of the other team were bots and good 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.420
 that's why I bring this tutorial and 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.920
 Well, here you can see that my colleagues 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.070
 they have color with which to place in a 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.380
 specific site is worth now I will teach you 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.149
 where it is and well you see is like a 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.280
 moment a massacre in nothing more than 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.229
 reappear I put four seconds of 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.470
 reappearance in the competitive are 7.5 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.670
 football then here and those already 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.340
 You see in the black bird above the minimum 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.229
 they are all the time 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.390
 and appear and nothing else reappear with a 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.549
 long weapon is preferable preferably 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.130
 we can kill them more easily 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.359
 ok and good here you see we could 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.429
 get all the flags we want 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.859
 and then so the king is for one of 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.360
 the enemies be this one as one of 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:10.869
 our colleagues must be here 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.790
 where will I now put this video now 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.980
 ok in this garage here that is 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.840
 in front of your flag because you have to 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.599
 to be a companion of ours has to 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.799
 being here is worth it so that 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.780
 enemies are constantly 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.060
 appearing there because if not the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.620
 enemies would reappear in another 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.319
 site then well if our 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.670
 partner is here is going to prevent the 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.290
 elements appear around here then 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.209
 they will reappear all the time where 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.610
 you just saw and it's going to be easier 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.260
 kill will serve you who is catching 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.750
 responsible in this case was me then 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.579
 it's not going to make it easier that it's going to be 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.260
 easier to kill them and good over 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.209
 if they come from behind to be able to leave 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.640
 Well, our partner is going to be here 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.530
 to kill him and that while another is 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.090
 taking out the flag and then this one 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.799
 respond we can control it too 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.970
 from another part that is from the 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.950
 next that I'm going to show you 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.310
 what happens that this is not very safe anymore 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.200
 that if you look at the mini map there 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.300
 we can perfectly catch the answer 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.530
 from here now you see it you see that they are 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.840
 appearing there constantly too 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.550
 but it's easier to catch it from the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.500
 another from the other site to finish off 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.600
 see it's worth because from here on taken 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.850
 Well, the bad thing here is that you are 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.400
 looking perfectly but changing the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.620
 rest still some and instead of reappearing 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.110
 where they appeared there that are where 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.340
 appear now because they can reappear 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.260
 little later then you already 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.910
 they would come from behind and in three fields 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.830
 melodies controlled one hundred percent so 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.920
 so much I recommend the first way that 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.170
 we have seen and well now step 3 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.209
 when we change sides like 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.380
 we would do the rest then from the other 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.850
 side not good, well, we have to 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.220
 place behind this car you're going to 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.620
 see now and the same our partner 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.150
 you also have to place in if you have 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.100
 what to place in a specific site 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.500
 word that I will teach this first thing 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.000
 what I want you to see as skin 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.340
 respond then well we have to 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.270
 come here to this police car 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.560
 preferably to this part from here to 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.510
 the area on the left of the car to 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.739
 then put the many here in the background 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.280
 We are sorry for the pont for 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.280
 change automatically 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.610
 so you can see that they are all the time 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.970
 reappearing there fixed in the minimap 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.010
 so then good 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.620
 You see right now kill this one because 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.790
 since we were a friend and I was 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.890
 they need three people for this 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.230
 I answer that it happens that since we were in a 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.730
 friend me then we could not have that 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.940
 third person so that responsible for 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.190
 100% good but you'll see now how it goes 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.310
 pretty good one that should be 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.380
 exit and you see me he answers there and 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.620
 behind this car with a gun with a 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.240
 long gun preferably we take they went 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.360
 to be constantly reappearing there 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.640
 forward of a little step is good you see that 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.900
 it's nothing more than they appear because we're going 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.890
 to kill us with a long weapon 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.050
 so if you want to go back 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.430
 we can also kill them and we're going to 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.350
 to be able to draw all the flags that 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.610
 we want not in the competitive base 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.960
 is one of the most important things is 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.729
 know skin answered here 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.710
 a minute can take a lot of ways 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.419
 was to mount a game if the one that is 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.699
 catching him he answers well and the 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.889
 others position themselves correctly and 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.870
 so then well here you see me 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.639
 growing I choose the weapons of the soil and 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.979
 without another looking all the time there 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.349
 constantly there it is worth since my 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.060
 partner was doing it right 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:16.970
 located in the correct position so that 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.979
 the enemies appear there is that they are 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.180
 all the time reappearing there you are 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.099
 seeing in the black bird above in the 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.330
 minimap and good and if the one that is 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.639
 killing now should not reappear 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.800
 there with a third person but as already 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.940
 I told you that we were only two, not what 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.650
 I can do well then well 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.780
 fourth the fourth step is that our 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.280
 partner must be placed here or inside 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.500
 of the blue house that we have on the right 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.930
 so that it responds correctly not 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.300
 so then well now you are going to see my 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.099
 partner and it was located here and 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.720
 You can also get inside the house 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.620
 blue is that we see on the right too 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.909
 it can be there inside but 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.190
 preferably here in the container 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.780
 this yellow and it gets behind and covers 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.919
 just in case you change them the answer does not 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.509
 leave neither on the right and on the 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.210
 left and while I'm asking 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.470
 the rest and another partner is in the if 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.419
 in the last place that I'm going to show you 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.710
 because the room instead of defending could 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.420
 bring flags perfectly 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.610
 since we would have all the responsos 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.750
 controlled then well then here in 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.420
 the blue house there is 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.920
 perfectly good and good partner 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.720
 that we would miss that we did not do it well 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.260
 why reappear on the right then 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.490
 It should be placed where you 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.020
 I will position now then 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.550
 good if there was a partner here 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.650
 they would be constantly reappearing 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.600
 where you just saw in the hall that and 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.340
 control we would do the risk one hundred percent 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.630
 so then I hope it serves you to 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.460
 the competitive one and I encourage you to what 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.750
 try, I hope you liked the 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.400
 jce subscribe favorites to comment and 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.400
 until the next kids goodbye
