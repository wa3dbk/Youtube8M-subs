00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello my name is alexander 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.469
 investigations being a knife teacher 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.790
 battlefield and today we will talk about the knife business card 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.219
 sensational 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.680
 such means invention as a knife business card 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.510
 or a knife credit card 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.660
 as they say myths and realities well 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:26.160
 let's see here we have a knife 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:32.750
 business card means so disclosed 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.969
 folded it put means so 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.370
 stretched showed at this time and you 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.550
 we take a knife business card as usual because 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.969
 what like any knife that you take he 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.820
 immediately points you to dark another 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.379
 sides we talk about liquid and do 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.699
 so we did it we did 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.600
 cut but in this case the knife broke 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:03.960
 one blow is fulfilled if we speak of 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.680
 difficult moments of an extreme situation then 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.260
 we can not count on him but 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.780
 able to properly hold a knife if we 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.780
 now take three years physics let's say 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.490
 take the other one and so we spent the first 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.140
 first test you first test showed that 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.829
 if it is not right to hold a knife 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.490
 in fact it can harm both 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.770
 harm how not to what i will think about 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.110
 that the knife for me will be 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.140
 good means for self defense on 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.770
 actually an illusion but on the other hand 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.100
 if I hold the knife in effect 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.470
 he can really help me 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.400
 most need to be first grip 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.410
 pay attention like a regular knife 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.410
 because on the bend on the bend is weak 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.470
 compound plastics if we talk about 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.540
 the fact that we are increasing the lever like this 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.630
 that's the way the sun is already grabbed by another 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:13.550
 so in this position of species I have 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:21.310
 it is possible to keep a knife logan 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:26.330
 first and work for you that is 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.250
 hold correctly he gives the right 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.440
 opportunity well i mean as a matter of fact on 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.150
 he can already pesach the corpse of the situation but 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.890
 you need to correctly understand how 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.530
 work all these forms of entrances 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.440
 cut injections like this 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.720
 closed position then she gives you 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.380
 good opportunity to take advantage of 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.620
 difficult moment 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.480
 then this is the main thing right its holders 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.550
 as they say correct 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:01.989
 a knife in the right hands and he gives himself 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:04.760
 give good means what cons still 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.620
 plus and we showed that if we 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:16.250
 correctly we keep it look 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:20.360
 well cuts and and he also stabbing then 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.300
 the same thing breaks and it will remain even 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.330
 it can always be removed or always 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.540
 can be combined then let's go now 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.070
 let's talk about the third test now we 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.130
 take it means a knife business card 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.710
 but it is laid out like this 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.250
 submit here in this position all 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:43.070
 we put we set his residence or 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.130
 a wallet where he can essentially 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:50.600
 be like this we think about 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.500
 knife business card is let's say I have a knife 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.990
 for self defense 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.630
 well now let's introduce ourselves and why 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.730
 you go and then attack just 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.020
 you are trying to get it at this moment 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.430
 visit us go nowhere is laughter and 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.260
 sin 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.330
 does it mean why you need a knife visit what are you 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.460
 perfectly understood my dear viewer 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.180
 so if you donâ€™t already have a knife 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.489
 tetanus 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:22.670
 or you say where you left him forgot 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.640
 do you have a knife purse or card holders 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.090
 and you know what suddenly in the near future 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.800
 somewhere there will be some dangerous situation in 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.510
 that moment you can just like 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.810
 says if I prepare means 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.810
 armed 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:43.100
 I take a knife gum get it good luck 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.700
 hands in this position here my he already 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.610
 I am ready for it as we have already examined I 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:53.900
 this moment when somewhere there yourself 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.030
 prepared at this moment somewhere on from 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:01.640
 readiness 2 you keep it you have 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.940
 ready here as a matter of fact either so either u 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.580
 you 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.960
 if you keep it as we said 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:12.870
 tight or you stick in your pocket somewhere 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.099
 go then you essentially can already 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.210
 being ready you can 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.569
 to defend 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.840
 it already hit that is we if we 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:26.020
 speak for our siempre let's say we 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:30.240
 we fold him in this position we 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:33.520
 laid down here but we how we created it 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.610
 mock model as if I put something 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:42.849
 swing and there opportunity in this 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:46.180
 case to create and work already as 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:48.580
 if i have a real one that is visible 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.560
 how many nights can i use it 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.810
 and how can I use it when 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.389
 correct grip 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.229
 1 significant preparation second is 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.180
 correct grip 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:02.259
 well, and therefore be able to at least 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.330
 enjoys but i will say so in practice 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.600
 if we are talking about self defense man 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.190
 takes out a knife and 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.230
 the man he attacked you 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.020
 whether he will already need to think 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.420
 to the population and this is what i think is one of 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.510
 such important points on whether a person 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:22.120
 who are less experienced and he has 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.460
 the weapon's priority is essentially 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.960
 can already protect herself 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.940
 and it means to you once more as they say 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.370
 pooh no pen yes and 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.160
 with you there was a big locksmith 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.540
 a request who is willing means to know more 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.430
