00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:13.879
 On the photo you see a portrait of a young girl from Zaonezhsk in a wedding suit, 

00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:19.495
 the main element of which was a headdress, consisting of a net-bottom and a crown. 

00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:25.745
 I demonstrate making a replica of the under-mesh mesh headdress that is stored in our funds. 

00:00:26.299 --> 00:00:29.022
 Headgear worn this way - 

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:32.383
 like a little boy wore it. 

00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:39.510
 Previously, the net-down was made of horsehair and small river pearls. 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.711
 In the absence of such materials, I use ordinary fishing line and small beads. 

00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:48.625
 Net-bottom consisted of five segments. 

00:00:49.517 --> 00:00:53.602
 You can see each segment. 

00:00:54.477 --> 00:01:00.551
 I have already made one segment - it consists of arched rows interconnected. 

00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:05.411
 Such segments were stitched together, and the net itself was turned down. 

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:10.274
 At first I twisted the line in several additions into such ropes, 

00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:14.088
 which in the future I will connect with small beads, 

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.399
 which is now called "monastic". 

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:19.762
 It is very similar in size to freshwater pearls. 

00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:24.549
 In the funds of our museum, I removed the paper pattern of each segment. 

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:32.748
 I attach such patterns to the roller and make a segment by its shape. 

00:01:34.576 --> 00:01:37.762
 I string the beads 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.199
 and already fishing line with beads 

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:48.155
 I connect each rope with each other. 

00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:43.255
 Longitudinal ropes could be connected not only by such circles, but also by diamonds. 

00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:52.757
 After all the segments have been ready, they need to be interconnected. 

00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:56.516
 I take two items and stitch them together. 

00:03:13.218 --> 00:03:16.732
 After all the segments are connected, 

00:03:16.852 --> 00:03:23.909
 it is necessary to sew a band with the help of which the net-bottom will be put on the head. 

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:36.344
 To make the net-bottom easier to wear, 

00:03:36.464 --> 00:03:44.151
 I am duplicating a golden braid with an ordinary white cotton braid. 

00:03:53.048 --> 00:03:58.420
 Here I have already sewn a ribbon, and now the net-bottom can serve as a headdress.
