00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello to all these producers x and 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.930
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.559
 video in which I will show you 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.799
 how to download or rather install 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.020
 the demo version of gta 5 on pc yes yes 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.539
 you understood me well I was 5 out of 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.400
 pc so I see you coming with your 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.020
 questions are you going to ask me how 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.410
 that's why I propose a 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.380
 demo version of a game that is not even 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.170
 out and we agree that 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.450
 rockstar games do not even announce 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.100
 the release of the game on pc and I arrive 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.730
 with my video and I propose you the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.140
 demo version it may sound fishy on 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.149
 agrees but me what I 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.710
 will invite you to do brains go 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.390
 see on my website which is in the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.039
 description 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.629
 I explained all this a little more in 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.670
 details and I think you're going fast 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.829
 understand so we'll go to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.260
 the quick install and I will finish with 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.300
 a few words on my screen 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.879
 now you can see up to 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.930
 right the installation file that I 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.680
 will put you in a link of 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.719
 downloading 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.689
 this file there you simply have 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.030
 to open it as a director 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.030
 preferably you press next 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:19.110
 this is your choice of file 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.110
 in which you want to install gta 5 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.030
 so we're just waiting for the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.799
 demo settles I'll enjoy it for 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.540
 you touch two words on the game then 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.520
 it's clearly a bomb this game that 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.350
 made three days that I spend my 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.299
 days on we go I'm a geek and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.619
 I assume them 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.090
 frankly it's great so I 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.439
 advise I recommend it to all 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.759
 world especially that there I propose it to you 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.049
 for free so I hope you 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.909
 are you going to enjoy it ? 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:53.090
 burst here we see that the save comes 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:55.560
 to end up and we see that the icon 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.509
 appears on the left a small icon 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.310
 so here you can see that eventually 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.830
 the name of the icon is a little weird 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.970
 it's the game icon but the unspoken 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.729
 know a little weird that's all 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.569
 simply because rockstar games 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.569
 have not yet 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.360
 do things in detail for 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.950
 the moment this demo was not supposed to 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.489
 to be there I share it but she 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.069
 is not supposed to be here so here I have 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.790
 finished for my little video listen 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.379
 enjoy well and then I'm waiting for your 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.530
 feedback in comments at most 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.530
 quick
