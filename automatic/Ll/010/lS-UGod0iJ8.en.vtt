00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
and all of the spots on his chest are

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.080 
and all of the spots on his chest are
also<00:02:33.140> embroidered<00:02:33.830> which<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.160> like<00:02:34.430> because<00:02:34.820> it

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
also embroidered which I like because it

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.420 
also embroidered which I like because it
seems<00:02:35.470> more<00:02:36.470> like<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.800> would<00:02:36.920> have<00:02:37.010> been<00:02:37.040> easy

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
seems more like it would have been easy

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.610 
seems more like it would have been easy
to<00:02:37.610> go<00:02:37.880> with<00:02:38.030> something<00:02:38.270> lazy<00:02:38.630> like<00:02:39.140> some<00:02:39.350> felt

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
to go with something lazy like some felt

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.960 
to go with something lazy like some felt
or<00:02:39.830> something<00:02:40.190> there<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.460> it's<00:02:40.610> really<00:02:40.760> nice

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
or something there and it's really nice

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.460 
or something there and it's really nice
to<00:02:41.000> see<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.390> embroidered<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:42.050> adds<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.320> nice

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
to see it embroidered it adds a nice

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.220 
to see it embroidered it adds a nice

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
always call attention to the fact when

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.570 
always call attention to the fact when
the<00:03:00.050> fabric<00:03:00.440> does<00:03:00.650> change<00:03:01.040> for<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.370> color

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580

change now I want to call attention to

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.350 
change now I want to call attention to
the<00:03:03.800> fact<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:04.100> it<00:03:04.340> didn't<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.210> makes

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
the fact that it didn't and it makes

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.690 
the fact that it didn't and it makes
this<00:03:05.540> plush<00:03:05.810> very<00:03:06.110> successful<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.040> very<00:03:07.220> soft

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.970 
this plush very successful and very soft
and<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.090> would<00:03:08.270> have<00:03:08.360> absolutely<00:03:08.540> despised<00:03:09.530> if

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
and I would have absolutely despised if

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.430 
and I would have absolutely despised if
the<00:03:10.520> fabric<00:03:11.060> had<00:03:11.180> changed<00:03:11.630> on<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:11.960> blue<00:03:12.290> and

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
the fabric had changed on that blue and

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.670 
the fabric had changed on that blue and
red<00:03:12.590> peak<00:03:12.920> right<00:03:13.160> there<00:03:14.170> like<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.290> said<00:03:15.320> with

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
red peak right there like I said with

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.470 
red peak right there like I said with
his<00:03:15.860> wings<00:03:16.160> we've<00:03:16.460> got<00:03:16.670> some<00:03:16.880> very<00:03:17.150> nice

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
his wings we've got some very nice

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.200 
his wings we've got some very nice
details<00:03:18.080> there<00:03:18.410> it's<00:03:18.590> very<00:03:18.830> subtle<00:03:19.280> this

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
details there it's very subtle this

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.290 
details there it's very subtle this
swirl<00:03:20.690> but<00:03:21.590> it's<00:03:21.770> definitely<00:03:22.040> very<00:03:22.670> effective

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
swirl but it's definitely very effective

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.050 
swirl but it's definitely very effective
in<00:03:23.510> capturing<00:03:23.840> his<00:03:24.350> likeness<00:03:24.730> we've<00:03:25.730> got<00:03:25.910> the

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
in capturing his likeness we've got the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.740 
in capturing his likeness we've got the
same<00:03:26.270> swirl<00:03:26.720> on<00:03:26.960> the<00:03:27.110> back<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:28.610> on<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.570> other

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
same swirl on the back and on the other

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.090 
same swirl on the back and on the other
wing<00:03:30.790> I've<00:03:31.790> got<00:03:31.940> some<00:03:32.120> nice<00:03:32.560> stitching<00:03:33.560> in<00:03:33.950> the

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
wing I've got some nice stitching in the

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.030 
wing I've got some nice stitching in the
tail<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:35.330> tail<00:03:35.570> does<00:03:35.900> kind<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.380> bunch<00:03:36.650> up<00:03:36.890> a

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
tail the tail does kind of bunch up a

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.420 
tail the tail does kind of bunch up a
little<00:03:37.220> bit<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:39.440> top<00:03:39.800> peak<00:03:40.130> right<00:03:40.400> here

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
little bit this top peak right here

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.160 
little bit this top peak right here
definitely<00:03:41.150> looks<00:03:41.330> kind<00:03:41.600> of<00:03:41.660> odd<00:03:41.840> there's<00:03:42.110> a

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
definitely looks kind of odd there's a

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.990 
definitely looks kind of odd there's a
little<00:03:42.380> bit<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.560> bunching<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.190> that's<00:03:43.850> a

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
little bit of bunching and that's a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.850 
little bit of bunching and that's a
shame<00:03:44.240> but<00:03:44.450> fortunately<00:03:44.930> it's<00:03:45.170> his<00:03:45.260> tail<00:03:45.560> so

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
shame but fortunately it's his tail so

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.260 
shame but fortunately it's his tail so
it's<00:03:46.010> in<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.190> back<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:46.730> we<00:03:46.760> can<00:03:46.940> kind<00:03:47.180> of

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
it's in the back so we can kind of

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.640 
it's in the back so we can kind of
ignore<00:03:48.170> it

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
ignore it

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.440 
ignore it
we've<00:03:49.220> got<00:03:49.430> his<00:03:50.090> feets<00:03:50.480> are<00:03:50.720> nice<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.140> stiff

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
we've got his feets are nice and stiff

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.270 
we've got his feets are nice and stiff
sewn<00:03:53.450> together<00:03:53.720> which<00:03:54.350> is<00:03:54.530> on<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:55.040> one<00:03:55.250> hand

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
sewn together which is on the one hand

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.420 
sewn together which is on the one hand
the<00:03:55.700> kind<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.240> shame<00:03:56.480> on<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:57.470> other<00:03:57.620> hand<00:03:57.980> if

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
the kind of a shame on the other hand if

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.830 
the kind of a shame on the other hand if
they<00:03:58.760> were<00:03:58.820> separate<00:03:59.330> it<00:03:59.450> would<00:03:59.540> probably

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
they were separate it would probably

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.810 
they were separate it would probably
make<00:04:00.200> him<00:04:00.350> that<00:04:00.560> much<00:04:00.800> harder<00:04:01.160> to<00:04:01.190> stand<00:04:01.610> up

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
make him that much harder to stand up

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.100 
make him that much harder to stand up
and<00:04:02.060> we<00:04:02.750> do<00:04:02.960> have<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.530> very<00:04:03.860> subtle<00:04:05.110> stitching

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
and we do have a very subtle stitching

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.680 
and we do have a very subtle stitching
