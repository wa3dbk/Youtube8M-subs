deeper in each of these advantages just

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:46.450 
deeper in each of these advantages just
follow<00:01:39.500> us<00:01:39.740> in<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.550> following<00:01:41.080> demos

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.620 

while<00:01:47.460> Massimo<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.270> thought<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.479> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
while Massimo you just thought of that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.569 
while Massimo you just thought of that
this<00:01:48.930> machine<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.320> compact<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:50.130> actually

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
this machine is compact it actually

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.039 
this machine is compact it actually
appears<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.240> without<00:01:51.390> any<00:01:51.719> safety

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
appears to be without any safety

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.319 
appears to be without any safety
protection<00:01:52.770> there<00:01:53.219> is<00:01:53.280> no<00:01:53.460> safety<00:01:53.789> mat<00:01:54.119> is

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
protection there is no safety mat is

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:54.950 
protection there is no safety mat is
that<00:01:54.479> normal

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
that normal

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.529 
that normal
absolutely<00:01:55.560> yes<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.670> consider<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.299> with

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
absolutely yes just consider that with

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.450 
absolutely yes just consider that with
this<00:01:57.719> new<00:01:57.960> concept<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.560> machine<00:01:58.890> we<00:01:59.159> are<00:01:59.189> able

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
this new concept of machine we are able

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.580 
this new concept of machine we are able
to<00:01:59.520> avoid<00:01:59.700> any<00:02:00.090> fact<00:02:00.720> that<00:02:00.869> elements<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
to avoid any fact that elements the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.319 
to avoid any fact that elements the
stage<00:02:01.860> all<00:02:02.100> around<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.819> chain

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
stage all around of the chain

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.950 
stage all around of the chain
in<00:02:03.689> fact<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.890> machine<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.429> exactly<00:02:06.179> like<00:02:06.750> we

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
in fact the machine is exactly like we

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.410 
in fact the machine is exactly like we
can<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.289> now<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.710> only<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.130> throughput<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.209> it

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
can see now so only the throughput so it

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.570 
can see now so only the throughput so it
means<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.140> machine<00:02:10.289> can<00:02:10.649> fit<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.979> small<00:02:11.099> shops

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
means the machine can fit in small shops

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.420 
means the machine can fit in small shops
in<00:02:11.790> narrow<00:02:12.060> areas<00:02:12.510> sure<00:02:13.170> as<00:02:13.500> we<00:02:13.799> know<00:02:13.920> normally

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
in narrow areas sure as we know normally

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.280 
in narrow areas sure as we know normally
