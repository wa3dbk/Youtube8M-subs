up<00:01:04.570> until<00:01:04.780> a<00:01:05.229> few<00:01:05.979> years<00:01:06.010> ago<00:01:06.250> really<00:01:06.670> I<00:01:06.700> was

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
up until a few years ago really I was

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.030 
up until a few years ago really I was
mostly<00:01:07.510> a<00:01:07.600> six<00:01:07.900> string<00:01:08.080> player<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:08.620> I<00:01:08.740> pretty

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
mostly a six string player and I pretty

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.830 
mostly a six string player and I pretty
much<00:01:09.130> had<00:01:09.400> to<00:01:09.430> pick<00:01:09.670> up<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:10.030> whole<00:01:10.270> seven<00:01:10.479> string

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
much had to pick up a whole seven string

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.110 
much had to pick up a whole seven string
thing<00:01:11.050> for<00:01:11.320> Tony's<00:01:11.710> gig<00:01:11.950> for<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.729> first<00:01:12.940> time

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
thing for Tony's gig for the first time

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.000 
thing for Tony's gig for the first time
and<00:01:13.390> I<00:01:13.540> had<00:01:13.900> to<00:01:13.990> learn<00:01:14.170> how<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.440> use<00:01:14.680> it<00:01:14.830> very

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
and I had to learn how to use it very

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.740 
and I had to learn how to use it very
quickly<00:01:15.280> I<00:01:15.430> had<00:01:15.670> an<00:01:15.790> audition<00:01:16.060> that<00:01:16.330> was<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.479> few

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
quickly I had an audition that was a few

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.120 
quickly I had an audition that was a few
weeks<00:01:16.930> away<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:17.229> I<00:01:17.500> just<00:01:17.710> had<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:17.860> learn<00:01:18.100> a

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
weeks away and I just had to learn a

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.830 
weeks away and I just had to learn a
bunch<00:01:18.369> of<00:01:18.520> songs<00:01:18.790> that<00:01:19.060> had<00:01:19.210> seven<00:01:19.630> string

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
bunch of songs that had seven string

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.249 
bunch of songs that had seven string
material<00:01:20.350> written<00:01:21.100> on<00:01:21.340> them<00:01:21.550> and<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.990> was<00:01:23.229> a

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
material written on them and it was a

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.080 
material written on them and it was a
little<00:01:23.619> bit<00:01:23.740> of<00:01:23.860> a<00:01:23.950> learning<00:01:24.130> curve<00:01:24.369> at<00:01:24.790> first

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
little bit of a learning curve at first

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.680 
little bit of a learning curve at first
but<00:01:25.479> just<00:01:26.320> kind<00:01:26.619> of<00:01:26.820> my<00:01:27.820> trick<00:01:28.119> to<00:01:28.270> learning

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
but just kind of my trick to learning

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.960 
but just kind of my trick to learning
how<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:29.020> use<00:01:29.290> it<00:01:29.440> at<00:01:29.560> first<00:01:29.710> was<00:01:30.009> just<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.369> try

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
how to use it at first was just to try

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.790 
how to use it at first was just to try
and<00:01:31.000> play<00:01:31.240> songs<00:01:31.479> that<00:01:31.690> I<00:01:31.780> know<00:01:31.840> with<00:01:32.650> this

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
and play songs that I know with this

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.499 
and play songs that I know with this
extra<00:01:33.280> string<00:01:33.520> that<00:01:33.670> visually<00:01:34.150> made<00:01:34.330> it<00:01:34.450> a

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
extra string that visually made it a

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.870 
extra string that visually made it a
little<00:01:34.750> bit<00:01:34.869> confusing<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:35.860> once<00:01:36.550> I<00:01:36.700> got<00:01:36.850> used

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
little bit confusing and once I got used

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.180 
little bit confusing and once I got used
to<00:01:37.180> that<00:01:37.300> it<00:01:37.479> just<00:01:37.630> kind<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.899> really<00:01:38.710> started

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
to that it just kind of really started

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.040 
to that it just kind of really started
to<00:01:39.280> look<00:01:39.430> like<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.789> six<00:01:40.119> string<00:01:40.300> with<00:01:40.539> with<00:01:40.930> an

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
to look like a six string with with an

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.440 
to look like a six string with with an
extra<00:01:41.350> string<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.770> after<00:01:41.979> that<00:01:42.130> it's<00:01:42.310> just

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
extra string and after that it's just

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.969 
extra string and after that it's just
now<00:01:43.450> it's<00:01:43.479> pretty<00:01:43.869> natural<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.259> me

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.789 

as<00:01:48.159> far<00:01:48.520> as<00:01:48.549> my<00:01:48.820> music<00:01:49.090> goes<00:01:49.420> I<00:01:49.720> try<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.170> think

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
as far as my music goes I try to think

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.770 
as far as my music goes I try to think
of<00:01:51.010> a<00:01:51.100> seven<00:01:51.430> string<00:01:51.640> guitar<00:01:51.670> not<00:01:52.270> just<00:01:52.540> as<00:01:52.750> a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
of a seven string guitar not just as a

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.680 
of a seven string guitar not just as a
six<00:01:53.229> string<00:01:53.470> with<00:01:53.680> an<00:01:53.830> extra<00:01:54.250> low<00:01:54.850> string<00:01:55.270> that

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
six string with an extra low string that

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.840 
six string with an extra low string that
lets<00:01:55.900> me<00:01:56.080> dwell<00:01:56.380> on<00:01:56.409> low<00:01:57.100> octaves<00:01:57.580> all<00:01:57.729> the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
lets me dwell on low octaves all the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.370 
lets me dwell on low octaves all the
time<00:01:58.030> I<00:01:58.210> just<00:01:58.270> kind<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.690> try<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.869> think<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.290> it

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
time I just kind of try to think of it

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.490 
time I just kind of try to think of it
as<00:01:59.909> an<00:02:00.909> instrument<00:02:01.540> with<00:02:01.690> an<00:02:01.840> extended<00:02:02.320> range

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
as an instrument with an extended range

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.249 
as an instrument with an extended range
and<00:02:02.890> extended<00:02:03.310> fretboard<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:04.300> help<00:02:04.600> me<00:02:04.750> think

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
and extended fretboard to help me think

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.020 
and extended fretboard to help me think
of<00:02:05.470> other<00:02:05.680> ideas<00:02:05.890> that<00:02:06.430> maybe<00:02:06.640> I<00:02:06.729> wouldn't

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
of other ideas that maybe I wouldn't

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.359 
of other ideas that maybe I wouldn't
normally<00:02:07.149> think<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.440> just<00:02:08.770> try<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.039> kind

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
normally think of so I just try to kind

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.820 
normally think of so I just try to kind
of<00:02:09.520> incorporate<00:02:10.030> that<00:02:10.209> into<00:02:10.450> my<00:02:10.800> phrasing<00:02:11.800> and

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
of incorporate that into my phrasing and

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.250 
of incorporate that into my phrasing and
my<00:02:12.040> soloing<00:02:12.459> ideas<00:02:12.819> using<00:02:13.510> just<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.110> whole

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
my soloing ideas using just a whole

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.140 
my soloing ideas using just a whole
range<00:02:14.500> of<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.739> guitar<00:02:15.010> with<00:02:15.340> an<00:02:15.489> extra<00:02:15.850> seven

and with this premium as a backup and I
have<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.720> say<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:30.050> both<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.440> them<00:02:30.530> held<00:02:30.740> up

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
have to say that both of them held up

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.500 
have to say that both of them held up
very<00:02:31.100> well<00:02:31.190> on<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.790> road<00:02:31.970> they're<00:02:32.270> very

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
very well on the road they're very

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.660 
very well on the road they're very
consistent<00:02:32.930> instrument<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.920> they<00:02:34.520> both

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
consistent instrument and they both

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.730 
consistent instrument and they both
stayed<00:02:34.970> in<00:02:35.090> tune<00:02:35.240> very<00:02:35.570> well<00:02:38.320> it's<00:02:39.320> made<00:02:39.530> very

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
stayed in tune very well it's made very

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.590 
stayed in tune very well it's made very
easy<00:02:39.980> with<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.340> edge<00:02:40.490> zero<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:40.940> bridge

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
easy with the edge zero to bridge

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.930 
easy with the edge zero to bridge
because<00:02:42.080> you<00:02:42.260> have<00:02:42.440> this<00:02:42.680> spring<00:02:43.430> adjustment

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
because you have this spring adjustment

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.820 
because you have this spring adjustment
knob<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.900> just<00:02:45.170> could<00:02:45.560> do<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.770> very

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
knob that I just could do that very

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.130 
knob that I just could do that very
easily<00:02:46.250> just<00:02:46.520> tweaking<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.300> knob<00:02:47.480> not<00:02:47.780> having

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
easily just tweaking the knob not having

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.450 
easily just tweaking the knob not having
to<00:02:48.230> go<00:02:48.380> into<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.680> truss<00:02:48.890> rod<00:02:49.010> or<00:02:49.250> change

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
to go into the truss rod or change

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.650 
to go into the truss rod or change
anything<00:02:49.820> else

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.110 

when<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.590> have<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:53.920> play<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.130> lot<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.460> technically

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
when I have to play a lot of technically

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.930 
when I have to play a lot of technically
difficult<00:02:55.390> phrases<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.770> still<00:02:57.400> makes<00:02:57.610> it<00:02:57.790> very

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
difficult phrases it still makes it very

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.300 
difficult phrases it still makes it very
possible<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.660> this<00:02:58.750> kind<00:02:59.140> of<00:02:59.200> thin<00:02:59.440> fast<00:02:59.980> neck

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
possible and this kind of thin fast neck

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.700 
possible and this kind of thin fast neck
so<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:01.150> just<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.690> makes<00:03:02.020> it<00:03:02.170> all<00:03:02.260> doable<00:03:02.560> I

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710
