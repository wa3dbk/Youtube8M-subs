 the agreement with the selgas-fagalde foundation 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:14.519
 of cudillero in asturias 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.619
 percent 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.400
 this one is created mind of much interest for the meadow because it supposes the deposit 

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:21.849
 during six years 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.000
 of the first documented work of goya what is 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.679
 the winning aníbal 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.070
 that for the first time look at Italy from the Alps' is the original title of the 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.879
 picture 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.130
 title 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.200
 tadeo 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.220
 for the parma fine arts academy contest of spring in 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.050
 1771 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.230
 it's a play 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.620
 keel that was discovered is one of the last discovered works of goya 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.260
 because it was identified as goya 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
 in 1993 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.680
 i the deposit in the meadow museum of this painting is doubly interesting 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.050
 because psoe and meadow 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.880
 It is the collection d 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.810
 most important work of goya that exists in the world 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.860
 both in painting and drawings and prints 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.750
 i percent but it is a work that is especially if it enters 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.020
 p the years 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.880
 pinky goya is an artist 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.000
 recognized to say from the tapestry posters onwards and up 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.490
 the end of his life 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.530
 therefore have a composition that is 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.460
 very early in 1771 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.530
 when really before that 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.940
 p at this time no longer recognizes only two or three works of his hand and 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.540
 one of them lost 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.460
 in front of 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.610
 the civil war because this really informs 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.020
 percent the public 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.299
 will be able to see the development 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.430
 On cloth 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.400
 in front of the figure of goya 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.940
 that is, what is this 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.870
 From the first moment 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.150
 his artistic career 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.010
 the exact reasons are not yet known 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.460
 for which he was presented to the contest of the parma academy 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.390
 even though 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.220
 it has been thought what the connection between 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.519
 the house of the parma bourbons and the house 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.149
 by mónica in Spain 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:17.559
 it could have been an idea of ​​goya to avoid being known in parma 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:20.589
 and that the news quickly reached Spain 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:23.109
 if he knew he had won the prize 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.289
 he did not win 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:25.989
 but there is a mention 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.370
 to his painting 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.179
 and also perhaps more important and more curious is that it is mentioned 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:34.349
 per cent the mercury of france a newspaper 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.260
 not very interesting literary interesting that they mention believe that I already do 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.799
 they had 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.339
 let's say that he won an award that is presented to the contest was a work 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:44.409
 remarkable 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.479
 that 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:47.240
 it must have repercussion 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.620
 in spain messi is given to know efe hadzic kid of this boy who had 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.700
 25 years 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.899
 has won a prize ie he is an artist 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:58.389
 the one that is worth it that they have to have future not 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.799
 also that it's interesting to think 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.279
 as can be analyzed through the Italian picture of the news that 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:07.049
 appear 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.609
 on that axis 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.800
 the notebook that the pp is using 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.049
 Italy who should have bought it there in Rome 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.910
 it is interesting to think and analyze through that notebook 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.510
 that he must be in contact with mengs that arrives in italy a little bit 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.060
 time after goya to genova and also an artist from the environment of 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.229
 mes quise fe maría raquel genovés 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:35.509
 a very cultured artist also manages a work on the artistic history of 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:39.259
 genoa and with which goya would be to find in genoa 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:44.199
 and travel with them ap arms the florence and then arrive yesterday in Rome already in the 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.629
 year ends of 70 71 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.970
 in rating was the member of the parma academy 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.439
 for Mendez Parma was the ideal appointment because it had already been formed correctly 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.519
 and therefore they should have pushed b 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.279
 to which that contest will be presented 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:02.469
 therefore it is a picture 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.789
 is truly an icon of goya production 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:07.729
 where also 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.339
 the percent 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:12.740
 that success commented perfectly on what asks 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.670
 the parma measures the layout and horizontal composition the subject 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.599
 proposed 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.449
 This guy has not been documented very well 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.449
 i pelosi 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.680
 almost literally because it makes a remarkable change is to say screaming from the 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.870
 academy of parma 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.870
 covering the instructions to the artists what they have to do 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.909
 they say that the genius 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:36.480
 percent the genius of art 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.509
 victory 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:38.990
 takes the hand forward 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.129
 the rival front and takes him by the hand edu moya must have seemed 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.389
 excessive gives a role to the hero ie the genius is behind 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.949
 systemically he admires that he will be so brave to cross the Alps and should 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.710
 Conquer the Roman Empire 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.240
 but I did not say anything formal 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.430
 treated but that leaves cheerful freedom 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.700
 and in that freedom 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.690
 psychological analysis is very important because goyana presented yet 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.499
 hero as up to that moment 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:13.069
 without fear is to say the hero who carries out all that 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.060
 he does not even doubt his destiny but in aníbal it is interesting to see that from the 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.129
 attitude 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.169
 until its expression 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.789
 he is not absolutely convinced of what the result will be if he has 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.069
 fear looks with amazement 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:29.990
 conviction 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.240
 but also with fear and everyone in that forward and backward attitude is not a 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.960
 Total advance attitude 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.599
 and it's also very interesting to see how 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.599
 the army joins us triumphant gesture 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.249
 but it is a tired aspect 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:47.589
 they have just crossed the Alps 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:49.290
 that this was a failure 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.309
 immense at that time 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:52.920
 and they are like 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.920
 defeated in advance serve themselves tired 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.309
 they go because it moves them 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:01.090
 the hero the general 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.249
 but not because they feel 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:07.129
 the impetus to advance and to conquer the Roman Empire is to say that it is a work 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.070
 tremendously thought 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.360
 by goya and also 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.729
 very interesting in that sense 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.119
 that by analyzing it we are aware that your interest is 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.839
 in the current society 

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:20.819
 before the reactions 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.150
 of a concrete human being 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.900
 and those who accompany him 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.029
 before a determined fact what is your destiny 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.099
 and that's what he's going to do until the end of his days 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.919
 and the burgundy drawings also do not 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:35.169
 next to the animal 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.040
 the Italian quadern that is owned by the meadow museum is presented 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:44.360
 piqué is a very important work in which pp appears in this case 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.680
 also because the first sketches appear the first idea of ​​the painter 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.419
 1st 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:55.389
 ee note of the idea you have in your head for the presentation of this 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:56.199
 theme no 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.969
 with the variants what are we going to see do not militate looking at things and also from 

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:01.850
 much interest 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.499
 and there also other notes of the figure 

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:09.059
 of the forms in Rome more than the classic festivities 

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:12.730
 ps no doubt as it was said then studied 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.620
 of the reliefs of classical antiquity that were preserved in Rome
