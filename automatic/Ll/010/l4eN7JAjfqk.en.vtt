using this today and I like this color
because<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.360> feel<00:04:13.510> like<00:04:13.600> it's<00:04:13.810> not<00:04:14.110> too<00:04:14.650> orange

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
because I feel like it's not too orange

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.180 
because I feel like it's not too orange
but<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.359> definitely<00:04:16.600> does<00:04:17.290> give<00:04:17.590> that<00:04:17.799> coral

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
but it definitely does give that coral

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.140 
but it definitely does give that coral
 so<00:04:18.669> it<00:04:18.729> doesn't<00:04:18.910> look<00:04:19.000> like<00:04:19.060> you're

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
 so it doesn't look like you're

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.789 
 so it doesn't look like you're
wearing<00:04:19.389> red<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:19.780> I<00:04:20.079> hope<00:04:20.290> it's<00:04:20.500> going<00:04:20.709> to

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
wearing red and I hope it's going to

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.460 
wearing red and I hope it's going to
show<00:04:20.979> off<00:04:21.120> as<00:04:22.120> orange<00:04:22.540> as<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:22.960> is<00:04:23.139> in<00:04:23.350> the

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
show off as orange as it is in the

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.860 
show off as orange as it is in the
camera<00:04:23.950> so<00:04:24.190> go<00:04:24.880> ahead<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.360> just<00:04:25.479> apply<00:04:25.630> this

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
camera so go ahead and just apply this

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:36.920 
camera so go ahead and just apply this
as<00:04:26.260> you<00:04:26.440> would<00:04:26.620> any<00:04:26.800> normal<00:04:26.979> lipstick

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.950 

okay<00:04:37.930> so<00:04:37.990> as<00:04:38.410> you<00:04:38.620> can<00:04:38.740> see<00:04:38.919> this<00:04:39.130> color<00:04:39.370> is

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
okay so as you can see this color is

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.050 
okay so as you can see this color is
shockingly<00:04:40.960> bright<00:04:41.470> but<00:04:41.830> I<00:04:42.039> think<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.880> eyes

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
shockingly bright but I think the eyes

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.059 
shockingly bright but I think the eyes
help<00:04:43.600> kind<00:04:43.840> of<00:04:43.930> balance<00:04:44.319> it<00:04:44.440> off<00:04:44.590> a<00:04:44.620> little<00:04:44.889> bit

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
help kind of balance it off a little bit

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.830 
help kind of balance it off a little bit
because<00:04:45.220> there's<00:04:45.669> so<00:04:46.000> much<00:04:46.150> focus<00:04:46.389> on<00:04:46.720> the

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
because there's so much focus on the

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.300 
because there's so much focus on the
lips<00:04:47.050> that<00:04:47.620> you<00:04:47.710> really<00:04:47.949> have<00:04:47.979> to<00:04:48.190> do

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
lips that you really have to do

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.010 
lips that you really have to do
something<00:04:48.520> very<00:04:49.120> very<00:04:49.270> simple<00:04:49.569> with<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.870> eyes

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
something very very simple with the eyes

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.570 
something very very simple with the eyes
and<00:04:50.380> I<00:04:50.470> feel<00:04:50.620> like<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.889> blue<00:04:51.099> on<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.460> eyes

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
and I feel like the blue on the eyes

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.580 
and I feel like the blue on the eyes
kind<00:04:52.210> of<00:04:52.240> makes<00:04:52.389> your<00:04:52.569> eyes<00:04:52.750> have<00:04:53.110> a<00:04:53.139> nice<00:04:53.380> kind

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
kind of makes your eyes have a nice kind

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.529 
kind of makes your eyes have a nice kind
of<00:04:53.740> glow<00:04:54.039> to<00:04:54.099> them<00:04:54.370> almost<00:04:54.639> but<00:04:55.030> doesn't<00:04:55.389> look

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
of glow to them almost but doesn't look

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.180 
of glow to them almost but doesn't look
like<00:04:55.660> you're<00:04:55.810> wearing<00:04:55.900> a<00:04:56.080> ton<00:04:56.380> of<00:04:56.410> makeup<00:04:56.830> and

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
like you're wearing a ton of makeup and

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.070 
like you're wearing a ton of makeup and
doesn't<00:04:57.819> make<00:04:57.910> you<00:04:58.030> like<00:04:58.210> you're<00:04:58.449> a<00:04:58.660> clown<00:04:59.050> or

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
doesn't make you like you're a clown or

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.559 
doesn't make you like you're a clown or
anything<00:04:59.680> so<00:05:00.009> I<00:05:00.220> really<00:05:00.759> like<00:05:00.940> this<00:05:01.150> look<00:05:01.389> and

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
anything so I really like this look and

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.120 
anything so I really like this look and
I<00:05:01.660> wouldn't<00:05:01.960> do<00:05:02.080> any<00:05:02.229> blush<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:02.740> don't<00:05:02.949> think

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
I wouldn't do any blush I don't think

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.339 
I wouldn't do any blush I don't think
you<00:05:03.250> need<00:05:03.430> me<00:05:03.610> blush<00:05:03.849> so<00:05:04.569> overall<00:05:04.870> this<00:05:05.050> is<00:05:05.110> the

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
you need me blush so overall this is the

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:06.689 
you need me blush so overall this is the
look<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:05.650> I<00:05:05.770> think<00:05:05.800> it's<00:05:06.039> really<00:05:06.220> pretty<00:05:06.430> and
