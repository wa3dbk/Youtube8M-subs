00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.930
 row states the exercise of the week once 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.580
 in the week I will give you an exercise 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.929
 I think they are very 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.929
 interesting for the training at home 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.700
 or in the gym is partial 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.100
 become classical exercises resp 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.720
 However, variations of this form are presented 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.939
 also which ones one or the other 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.619
 I do not want to start yet 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.570
 with a super set of combo for the breast 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.279
 and the latinos namely the dumbbells 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.769
 Press and row on the rack 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.720
 the first part of the sentence is super combi 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.430
 the short hand back which the whole 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.260
 Muscles and part of the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.239
 the front shoulder is training the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.460
 training bank with this in a 45 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.809
 Grad angle set one lies with 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.640
 the back on the bench is on it 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.559
 Pay attention that the upper arms are bent 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.469
 become and become so in the AchselhÃ¶hle 1 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.969
 45 degrees angle forms in the lower back 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.100
 a rich of volcanoes can form 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.510
 so that the breast lifts up the legs 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.100
 should be for a stabilizing 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.230
 function firmly pressed to the ground 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.579
 be moved during the effort 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.710
 the poor should be paid attention 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.670
 these in the end position not too 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.050
 very to stretch out 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.910
 In addition, the dumbbells should 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.680
 be merged while pushing away 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.670
 treat is exhaled at more 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.350
 it is inhaled 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.939
 the second part of the super set of suits is 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.860
 the rowing and will be direct without a break 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.750
 after the dumbbell back run 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.340
 this is mainly the nati she 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.110
 must muscle but also the rear 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.970
 Shoulder and the delta muscle trained 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.500
 Here we lay with our breasts 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.460
 the rack and distribute ours 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.009
 Legs on the floor 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.060
 to take a safe position now 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.009
 Let's take the hand in one 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.290
 Crescent motion away from our body 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.970
 and pull back to us the poor ones 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.070
 should be as close to his possible 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.780
 to be guided along the body of the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.670
 Latinos and the poor should be steady 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.990
 under tension are crucial 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.329
 the execution of the exercise is the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.130
 Movement of the arms in the semi-boat beginner 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.869
 or inexperienced can this 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.790
 but also bypass the poor ones 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.509
 almost completely straight and vertical 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.509
 lead to the ground 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.380
 That was the exercise of the week 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.720
 or exercise combination that 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.130
 Push dumbbells and row on the 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.619
 Stretching Bank I can only recommend it to everyone 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.770
 a very interesting one as well 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.289
 effective exercise combination in the super 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.390
 What is extremely effective is there 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.280
 said the breast and the latinos and 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.600
 many other muscle areas that 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.000
 I have addressed as the shoulder 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.800
 and the poor are awarded and im 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.050
 Just start the complete upper body 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.239
 I can irritate the over possible 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.680
 recommend the people especially 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.260
 Breast naturally has to work out together 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.060

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.130

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.620
 also to execute swedish bank is 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.780

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.670
 12 repetition exercise 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.220

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.170
 choose accordingly or you 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.090
 Do five sets with eight repetitions 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.590
 and then it will be 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.480
 Everyone has to weight for themselves 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.519
 decide what he gets along with better 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.190
 with which the body simply reacts better 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.350
 with which he achieves better results if
