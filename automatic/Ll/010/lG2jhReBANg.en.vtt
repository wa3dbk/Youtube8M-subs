sounds<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.309> virtually<00:00:50.850> dead<00:00:51.210> no<00:00:51.570> we

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
sounds like it's virtually dead no we

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.290 
sounds like it's virtually dead no we
know<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> Frog<00:00:52.980> isn't<00:00:53.340> dead<00:00:53.550> but<00:00:54.210> he's

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
know that the Frog isn't dead but he's

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.939 
know that the Frog isn't dead but he's
probably<00:00:54.510> about<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:54.989> close<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.710> get

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
probably about as close as you can get

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.479 
probably about as close as you can get
to<00:00:56.250> being<00:00:56.910> dead<00:00:57.120> yes<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:58.530> from<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> outside

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to being dead yes so from the outside

to being dead yes so from the outside
this<00:00:59.850> little<00:01:00.090> frog<00:01:00.270> feels<00:01:00.690> like<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> rock

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
this little frog feels like a rock

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.030 
this little frog feels like a rock
except<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.390> froze<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.019> Frog<00:01:04.290> flooded

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
except that as it froze the Frog flooded

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.070 
except that as it froze the Frog flooded
itself<00:01:05.400> with<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.670> kind<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.210> sugar<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.840> frog's
