first off karnish isotonic goes on a 34
kill<00:00:48.150> streak<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.690> me<00:00:48.870> Goliath<00:00:49.260> he<00:00:49.530> does<00:00:49.770> get

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
kill streak in me Goliath he does get

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.220 
kill streak in me Goliath he does get
gun<00:00:50.280> kills<00:00:50.580> cuz<00:00:50.790> he<00:00:50.879> has<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.390> get<00:00:51.510> gun<00:00:51.720> kills<00:00:51.990> in

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
gun kills cuz he has to get gun kills in

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.170 
gun kills cuz he has to get gun kills in
order<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.620> achieve<00:00:52.740> the<00:00:53.250> Goliath<00:00:53.640> kill<00:00:53.880> streak

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
order to achieve the Goliath kill streak

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.300 
order to achieve the Goliath kill streak
so<00:00:54.420> there<00:00:54.540> are<00:00:54.570> gun<00:00:55.050> kills<00:00:55.320> as<00:00:55.530> well<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.920> believe

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
so there are gun kills as well I believe

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.360 
so there are gun kills as well I believe
he<00:00:56.400> goes<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.940> 45<00:00:57.450> or<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.320> overall<00:00:59.100> kill

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
he goes on like a 45 or so overall kill

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.300 
he goes on like a 45 or so overall kill
streak<00:00:59.700> but<00:00:59.880> he<00:01:00.060> does<00:01:00.329> get<00:01:00.720> 34<00:01:01.440> kills<00:01:01.740> in<00:01:02.040> the

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
streak but he does get 34 kills in the

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.790 
streak but he does get 34 kills in the
Goliath<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.150> that<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.420> more<00:01:04.020> than<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> vicious

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
Goliath so that is more than a vicious

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.530 
Goliath so that is more than a vicious
medal<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.700> said<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.390> earn

confused<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.380> whole<00:01:22.560> idea<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.250> is

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
confused on the whole idea of this is

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.120 
confused on the whole idea of this is
that<00:01:23.910> he<00:01:24.030> had<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.450> get<00:01:24.660> more<00:01:25.020> than<00:01:25.229> 30<00:01:25.530> kills<00:01:25.890> in

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
that he had to get more than 30 kills in

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.240 
that he had to get more than 30 kills in
the<00:01:26.490> Goliath<00:01:27.060> without<00:01:27.569> dying<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.470> overall<00:01:29.039> it

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the Goliath without dying so overall it

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.219 
the Goliath without dying so overall it
does<00:01:29.429> become<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.910> 46<00:01:30.539> or<00:01:30.660> so<00:01:30.810> gunstreak

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
does become like a 46 or so gunstreak

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.900 
does become like a 46 or so gunstreak
avi<00:01:31.619> yeah<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.069> clear<00:01:32.250> some<00:01:32.429> things<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:32.759> so

different and unique I had a lot of fun
watching<00:01:36.929> it<00:01:37.319> I<00:01:37.380> thought<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.740> very

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
watching it I thought it was very

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.680 
watching it I thought it was very
different<00:01:38.429> you'll<00:01:38.759> see<00:01:38.910> too<00:01:39.060> much<00:01:39.179> Goliath

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
different you'll see too much Goliath

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.600 
different you'll see too much Goliath
gameplay<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.410> to<00:01:40.500> see<00:01:40.649> 34<00:01:41.130> kills<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.550> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
gameplay and to see 34 kills and the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.490 
gameplay and to see 34 kills and the
Goliath<00:01:41.940> is<00:01:42.060> pretty<00:01:42.300> cool<00:01:42.569> honestly<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.110> think

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
Goliath is pretty cool honestly I think

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.260 
Goliath is pretty cool honestly I think
this<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.920> killstreak<00:01:44.429> sucks<00:01:44.759> cuz<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.149> so

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
this this killstreak sucks cuz it's so

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.330 
this this killstreak sucks cuz it's so
slow<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:45.959> it's<00:01:46.080> so<00:01:46.229> bulky<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.250> kind

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
slow and it's so bulky and you can kind

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.249 
slow and it's so bulky and you can kind
of<00:01:47.459> dive<00:01:47.670> pretty<00:01:47.970> easily<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.569> it<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.020> I've

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
of dive pretty easily in it so I've

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.719 
of dive pretty easily in it so I've

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
always thought it not to be a very good

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.820 
always thought it not to be a very good
kill<00:01:51.060> streak<00:01:51.330> but<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.810> 34<00:01:52.259> kills<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830
