 The team, I 'm just making this video. 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.840
 Here to show a little I'm going to jump. 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.240
 Do you want to know about lemon peel? 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.270
 Good, I did not find anything on the internet. 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.630
 about the brother's possession I decided to prune 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:29.220
 the branches that had no fruit 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.820
 Are you doing it wrong or do not I know ? 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.380

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.629

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.270
 It's a step up and you're going to do it. 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.969
 it 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:49.440
 so I decided to change some things 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:53.160
 some branches to be able to give a 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.449
 cleared on the other feet there because I 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.710
 I do not have to be the ball behind him and 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.379
 I have this victory here, oh, oh, yes. 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.000
 distance from one time to the next is 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.460
 2 meters 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.510

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:31.680
 leaving the sun where it has not 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.390
 had fruit is far and a problem that 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.009

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.110
 enjoying 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:51.900
 they end up leaving everything a market with 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.620
 a glutinous kitchen looking like glue 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.620
 look here 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.720

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.710

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.710
 with a tail with something of 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:23.550
 aluminum aluminum swap is just a little 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:28.830
 diluted aluminum hydroxide and 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:34.760
 I play think I call Bordeaux broth only 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.760

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.240

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:48.870

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:55.110

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:58.620
 meter and a half and two and a half meters of 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.320
 of the two other feet that have only two 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.209
 meters 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.260
 I think I made a crap 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:10.230
 But let's see if it works out, I'll ask. 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.670

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.420
 it will all be a big change and 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.840
 try to deploy to see if I'll do 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.840

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.360
