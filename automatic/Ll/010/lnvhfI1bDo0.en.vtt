about this DIY follow focus now it's a
pretty<00:00:11.940> cheap<00:00:12.300> build<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.990> think<00:00:13.530> probably

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
pretty cheap build I think probably

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.140 
pretty cheap build I think probably
about<00:00:14.460> 25<00:00:14.940> pounds<00:00:16.580> maybe<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.699> bit<00:00:17.850> less<00:00:17.970> or<00:00:18.119> a

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
about 25 pounds maybe a bit less or a

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.689 
about 25 pounds maybe a bit less or a
bit<00:00:18.270> more<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:19.740> pretty<00:00:19.920> simple<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.369> do<00:00:20.520> as

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
bit more and it's pretty simple to do as

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.929 
bit more and it's pretty simple to do as
well<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> mean<00:00:21.119> it's<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.020> Hugo<00:00:22.380> gearbox

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
well I mean it's a it's a Hugo gearbox

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.009 
well I mean it's a it's a Hugo gearbox
and<00:00:23.939> some<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.420> them<00:00:24.510> are<00:00:24.600> good<00:00:24.720> some<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.900> them

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
and some of them are good some of them

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.380 
and some of them are good some of them
are<00:00:25.109> not<00:00:25.260> as<00:00:25.890> far<00:00:26.099> as<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.220> understand<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.849> lot<00:00:27.330> of

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
are not as far as I understand a lot of

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.330 
are not as far as I understand a lot of
companies<00:00:27.779> actually<00:00:28.490> make<00:00:29.490> their<00:00:31.340> follow

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
companies actually make their follow

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.950 
companies actually make their follow
focuses<00:00:32.790> from<00:00:33.920> from<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> same<00:00:35.219> gear<00:00:35.399> box<00:00:35.960> but

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
focuses from from the same gear box but

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.389 
focuses from from the same gear box but
I<00:00:36.989> don't<00:00:37.350> know<00:00:37.440> some<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.829> them<00:00:37.980> better<00:00:38.129> this

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399

one<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.879> got<00:00:39.110> has<00:00:40.110> some<00:00:40.440> play<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.860> not

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
one that I got has some play in it not

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.889 
one that I got has some play in it not
too<00:00:41.460> much<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.290> little<00:00:43.290> bit<00:00:43.410> still<00:00:44.160> usable

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
too much but a little bit still usable

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.950 
too much but a little bit still usable
and<00:00:47.149> yeah<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> mean<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.480> build<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.780> pretty

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and yeah I mean the build is pretty

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.209 
and yeah I mean the build is pretty
simple<00:00:49.170> I've<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.469> used<00:00:49.680> some<00:00:49.800> old<00:00:49.920> Lego

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
it's pretty simple this was about I

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.899

think<00:01:04.619> 17<00:01:05.010> pounds<00:01:05.309> I've<00:01:05.400> no<00:01:05.549> idea<00:01:05.580> how<00:01:05.760> much<00:01:05.850> it

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
think 17 pounds I've no idea how much it

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.940 
think 17 pounds I've no idea how much it
cost<00:01:06.180> now<00:01:06.360> probably<00:01:07.080> found<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.470> for<00:01:07.619> quite

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
cost now probably found it for quite

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.060 
cost now probably found it for quite
cheap<00:01:09.979> this<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> two-pound

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
cheap this is just like a two-pound

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.929 
cheap this is just like a two-pound
bracket<00:01:14.070> from<00:01:14.490> eBay<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:16.369> right<00:01:17.369> here<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.700> see

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
bracket from eBay and right here you see

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.399 
bracket from eBay and right here you see
I've<00:01:18.030> got<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.450> set<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.990> way<00:01:19.020> where<00:01:19.110> it's

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
I've got this set up in a way where it's

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.890 
I've got this set up in a way where it's
got<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> Cu<00:01:20.100> joint<00:01:20.430> right<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.240> it's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
got the Cu joint right here and it's

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.999 
got the Cu joint right here and it's
simply<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.580> this

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
simply just so that I can I can get this

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.929 
simply just so that I can I can get this
the<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.400> sort<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:28.140> knob<00:01:28.579> because<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.820> is

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the the sort of the knob because this is

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.219 
the the sort of the knob because this is
actually<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.450> knob<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.869> then<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.049> is

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
actually just the knob and then this is

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.830 
actually just the knob and then this is
the<00:01:31.320> actual<00:01:31.530> wheel<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.009> goes<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.369> lens

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
the actual wheel that goes on the lens

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.480 
the actual wheel that goes on the lens
so<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.159> know<00:01:35.280> at<00:01:35.430> a

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
so just so I can have it you know at a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.679 
so just so I can have it you know at a
different<00:01:35.759> angle<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.090> thought<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.479> could<00:01:36.630> be

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
different angle I thought that could be

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.929 
different angle I thought that could be
useful<00:01:37.040> and<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.130> actually<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.579> know<00:01:38.610> kind<00:01:38.820> of

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
useful and it actually you know kind of

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.670 
useful and it actually you know kind of
works<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.659> kind<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.140> like<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
works so I kind of like it like that I

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.399 
works so I kind of like it like that I
didn't<00:01:41.280> really<00:01:41.400> use<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.720> much<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.170> I'm

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
didn't really use this that much and I'm

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.780 
didn't really use this that much and I'm
actually<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.710> putting<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.189> unit<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.579> eBay

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
actually just putting this unit on eBay

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.200 
actually just putting this unit on eBay
so<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.119> figured<00:01:45.479> I'd<00:01:46.140> show<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.380> guys<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:47.210> you

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
so I figured I'd show you guys that you

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.310 
so I figured I'd show you guys that you
know<00:01:48.299> how<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.420> build<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.810> these<00:01:48.899> before<00:01:49.290> I

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
know how to build one of these before I

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.929 
know how to build one of these before I
sold<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:51.590> some<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.770> things<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.310> could<00:01:53.759> be

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
sold it some of the things that could be

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.450 
sold it some of the things that could be

is<00:02:08.840> from<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> pound<00:02:10.170> shop<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.619> found<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.700> was

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
is from the pound shop I found this was

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.500 
is from the pound shop I found this was
like<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> jar<00:02:12.330> opener

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
like a jar opener

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.869 
like a jar opener
and<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.410> came<00:02:14.620> with<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.340> piece<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.640> this

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
and it came with this piece and this

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.220 
and it came with this piece and this
piece<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.209> took<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.510> whole<00:02:16.629> thing<00:02:16.660> apart<00:02:16.870> and

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
piece of took the whole thing apart and

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.520 
piece of took the whole thing apart and
took<00:02:17.860> these<00:02:18.069> out<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.230> went<00:02:20.410> bother

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
took these out and I went bother

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.990 
took these out and I went bother
explaining<00:02:20.650> how<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.160> opened<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.519> jars<00:02:21.730> but<00:02:21.910> it

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
explaining how it opened the jars but it

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.140 
explaining how it opened the jars but it
was<00:02:22.120> just<00:02:22.239> some<00:02:22.390> like<00:02:22.540> weird<00:02:22.750> mechanism<00:02:24.150> so

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
was just some like weird mechanism so

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.880 
was just some like weird mechanism so
that<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.840> can<00:02:26.019> use<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.349> wrap<00:02:26.650> this<00:02:26.800> around

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
that you can use you wrap this around

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.240 
that you can use you wrap this around
the<00:02:27.069> lens<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.610> then<00:02:28.000> put<00:02:28.660> this<00:02:29.010> here<00:02:30.010> instead

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
the lens and then put this here instead

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.530 
the lens and then put this here instead
of<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.459> wheel<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:32.879> yeah<00:02:33.879> and<00:02:34.030> then<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.180> you

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
of this wheel and yeah and then you you

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.270 
of this wheel and yeah and then you you
know<00:02:34.569> got<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.930> geared<00:02:35.230> follow<00:02:35.799> focus<00:02:36.069> of<00:02:36.160> course

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
know got a geared follow focus of course

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.039 
know got a geared follow focus of course
you<00:02:36.430> could<00:02:36.580> also<00:02:36.670> just<00:02:36.910> get<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.480> correct<00:02:37.750> gear

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
you could also just get the correct gear

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.770 
you could also just get the correct gear
I'll<00:02:38.769> see<00:02:38.860> if<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:38.980> can<00:02:39.099> find<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.310> link<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.549> that

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
I'll see if I can find a link to that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.000 
I'll see if I can find a link to that
but<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:40.870> can<00:02:40.989> actually<00:02:41.200> just<00:02:41.319> buy<00:02:41.560> the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
but you can actually just buy the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.569 
but you can actually just buy the
correct<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:44.379> correct<00:02:44.500> pitch<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:45.099> gear<00:02:45.340> so

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
correct the correct pitch of gear so

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.470 
correct the correct pitch of gear so
that<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.720> can<00:02:46.840> just<00:02:46.989> use<00:02:47.349> a<00:02:47.380> standard<00:02:47.650> one

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
that you can just use a standard one

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.400 
that you can just use a standard one
I'll<00:02:49.480> see<00:02:49.599> if<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.720> find<00:02:49.930> something<00:02:50.140> that<00:02:50.260> fits

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
I'll see if I find something that fits

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.309 
I'll see if I find something that fits
this<00:02:51.130> unit<00:02:51.459> but<00:02:51.579> I<00:02:51.880> think<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:53.140> should<00:02:53.290> be

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
this unit but I think it should be

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.740 
this unit but I think it should be
pretty<00:02:53.380> easy

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
pretty easy

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.370 
pretty easy
another<00:02:55.750> thing<00:02:55.870> I've<00:02:55.989> done<00:02:56.140> is<00:02:56.230> I've<00:02:56.349> taken

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
another thing I've done is I've taken

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.580 
another thing I've done is I've taken
one<00:02:56.769> of<00:02:56.829> these<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.370> put<00:02:57.790> some<00:02:57.970> foam<00:02:58.239> on<00:02:58.390> it

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
one of these and put some foam on it

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.979 
one of these and put some foam on it
made<00:02:59.590> like<00:02:59.739> a<00:02:59.769> big<00:03:00.010> foam<00:03:00.340> wheel<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.750> what<00:03:01.900> this

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
made like a big foam wheel and what this

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.920 
made like a big foam wheel and what this
actually<00:03:02.049> allowed<00:03:02.530> me<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.709> do<00:03:03.010> was<00:03:03.250> use<00:03:03.519> this

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
actually allowed me to do was use this

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.610 
actually allowed me to do was use this
on<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.379> tiny<00:03:05.890> tiny<00:03:06.310> focus<00:03:06.849> wheel<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:08.230> HOV

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
on the tiny tiny focus wheel of the HOV

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.400 
on the tiny tiny focus wheel of the HOV
30<00:03:08.980> camera<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.599> think<00:03:10.780> it's<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.989> same<00:03:11.260> on

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
30 camera and I think it's the same on

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.039 
30 camera and I think it's the same on
the<00:03:11.500> HP<00:03:11.620> 20<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.099> 40<00:03:12.519> so<00:03:13.420> if<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.900> have<00:03:14.019> a

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
the HP 20 and 40 so if you have a

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.780 
the HP 20 and 40 so if you have a
camcorder<00:03:14.440> like<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:14.829> with<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.069> tiny<00:03:15.519> little

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
camcorder like that with a tiny little

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.449 
camcorder like that with a tiny little
wheel<00:03:16.299> of<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.660> side<00:03:16.870> rillette<00:03:17.200> which<00:03:17.459> you

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
wheel of the side rillette which you

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.479 
wheel of the side rillette which you
have<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.670> use<00:03:18.700> for<00:03:18.819> for<00:03:19.299> manual<00:03:20.260> focus<00:03:20.590> then

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
have to use for for manual focus then

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.599 
have to use for for manual focus then
this<00:03:21.819> is<00:03:22.269> kind<00:03:23.079> of<00:03:23.170> a<00:03:23.260> good<00:03:23.380> solution<00:03:25.530> now<00:03:26.609> the

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
this is kind of a good solution now the

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.289 
this is kind of a good solution now the
bottom<00:03:28.180> here<00:03:29.190> I'm<00:03:30.190> sure<00:03:30.670> there<00:03:30.849> are<00:03:30.880> better

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
bottom here I'm sure there are better

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.000 
bottom here I'm sure there are better
solutions<00:03:31.690> than<00:03:32.109> this<00:03:33.000> but<00:03:34.799> what<00:03:35.799> I've<00:03:35.889> done

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
solutions than this but what I've done

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.080 
solutions than this but what I've done
is<00:03:36.130> I've<00:03:36.220> just<00:03:36.250> taken<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.639> small<00:03:36.730> piece<00:03:36.970> of

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
is I've just taken a small piece of

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.210 
is I've just taken a small piece of
aluminium<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:37.989> is<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.170> only<00:03:38.290> part<00:03:38.920> of<00:03:38.980> the

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
aluminium this is the only part of the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.550 
aluminium this is the only part of the
build<00:03:39.760> of<00:03:40.299> my<00:03:40.510> particular<00:03:40.810> build<00:03:41.139> which<00:03:41.349> might

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
build of my particular build which might

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.349 
build of my particular build which might
be<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.680> little<00:03:41.739> bit<00:03:42.220> more<00:03:42.760> difficult<00:03:43.150> is<00:03:43.209> just

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
be a little bit more difficult is just

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.720 
be a little bit more difficult is just
to<00:03:43.419> take<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:43.690> piece<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:43.870> aluminium<00:03:44.459> drill<00:03:45.459> three

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
to take a piece of aluminium drill three

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.330 
to take a piece of aluminium drill three
holes<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.329> then<00:03:46.569> tap<00:03:46.930> them<00:03:47.230> which<00:03:47.859> means<00:03:48.040> put

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
holes and then tap them which means put

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.229 
holes and then tap them which means put
the<00:03:48.459> threads<00:03:48.819> in<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:50.819> I'll<00:03:51.819> have<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.000> link<00:03:52.209> to

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
the threads in and I'll have a link to

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.370 
the threads in and I'll have a link to
the<00:03:52.389> things<00:03:52.569> you<00:03:52.720> need<00:03:52.870> your<00:03:53.019> basic<00:03:53.200> adjust

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
the things you need your basic adjust

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.569 
the things you need your basic adjust
need<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.500> drill<00:03:53.799> and<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:55.230> three-pound<00:03:56.430> or<00:03:57.430> about

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
need a drill and a three-pound or about

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.300 
need a drill and a three-pound or about
three<00:03:57.819> pound<00:03:58.000> 50<00:03:58.299> I<00:03:58.329> think<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:59.560> little<00:04:00.040> tool

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
three pound 50 I think a little tool

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.620 
three pound 50 I think a little tool
that<00:04:00.340> actually<00:04:00.940> adds<00:04:01.120> these<00:04:01.480> threads<00:04:02.069> so<00:04:03.630> not

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
that actually adds these threads so not

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.210 
that actually adds these threads so not
too<00:04:04.720> expensive<00:04:04.989> not<00:04:05.349> too<00:04:05.560> difficult<00:04:05.889> to<00:04:05.950> do<00:04:06.069> if

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
too expensive not too difficult to do if

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.740 
too expensive not too difficult to do if
you<00:04:06.310> can<00:04:06.459> use<00:04:06.579> a<00:04:06.609> hand<00:04:06.849> drill<00:04:07.060> if<00:04:07.299> you<00:04:07.599> can

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
you can use a hand drill if you can

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.089 
you can use a hand drill if you can
borrow<00:04:07.989> one<00:04:08.200> or<00:04:08.230> get<00:04:08.440> someone<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:08.829> do<00:04:08.950> that

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
borrow one or get someone to do that

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.580 
borrow one or get someone to do that
then<00:04:09.639> it's<00:04:09.790> pretty<00:04:09.940> easy<00:04:10.150> alternatively<00:04:10.840> you

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
then it's pretty easy alternatively you

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.670 
then it's pretty easy alternatively you
could<00:04:11.859> I<00:04:11.919> guess<00:04:12.280> simply<00:04:12.579> just<00:04:12.760> glue<00:04:13.030> this<00:04:13.680> I'll

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
could I guess simply just glue this I'll

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.710 
could I guess simply just glue this I'll
use<00:04:14.739> a<00:04:14.889> super<00:04:15.310> clamp<00:04:15.579> to<00:04:16.030> hold<00:04:16.209> it<00:04:16.389> so<00:04:16.539> if<00:04:16.630> you

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
use a super clamp to hold it so if you

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.729 
use a super clamp to hold it so if you
get<00:04:16.900> friction<00:04:17.859> arm<00:04:18.959> with<00:04:19.959> a<00:04:19.989> super<00:04:20.289> clamp<00:04:20.500> and

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
get friction arm with a super clamp and

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.940 
get friction arm with a super clamp and
just<00:04:21.099> clamp<00:04:21.789> onto<00:04:21.969> this<00:04:22.289> that<00:04:23.289> might<00:04:23.440> work

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
just clamp onto this that might work

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.300 
just clamp onto this that might work
I<00:04:23.979> don't<00:04:24.370> know<00:04:24.460> but<00:04:24.760> I<00:04:24.789> think<00:04:25.090> so

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
I don't know but I think so

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.400 
I don't know but I think so
and<00:04:27.310> it's<00:04:27.460> you<00:04:27.670> know<00:04:27.730> fairly<00:04:28.270> inexpensive<00:04:28.870> way

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
and it's you know fairly inexpensive way

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.980 
and it's you know fairly inexpensive way
to<00:04:29.440> do<00:04:29.650> it<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:30.460> yeah<00:04:31.150> any<00:04:31.390> questions<00:04:31.720> ask<00:04:31.930> me

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
to do it so yeah any questions ask me

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.890 
to do it so yeah any questions ask me
below<00:04:32.260> but<00:04:32.560> I<00:04:32.770> hope<00:04:32.920> this<00:04:33.010> was<00:04:33.160> useful<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:33.900> I

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
below but I hope this was useful and I

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.260 
below but I hope this was useful and I
hope<00:04:35.020> you<00:04:35.110> enjoyed<00:04:35.320> that<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:36.090> see<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.180> in
