00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
one on the left is sort of an ant proton

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.650 
one on the left is sort of an ant proton

that's<00:00:06.660> enough<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.049> that<00:00:07.109> post<00:00:07.950> contrast<00:00:08.490> and

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
that's enough of that post contrast and

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.020 
that's enough of that post contrast and
what's<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.620> most<00:00:10.769> likely<00:00:11.099> diagnosis<00:00:11.700> are<00:00:11.880> we

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
what's the most likely diagnosis are we

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.430 
what's the most likely diagnosis are we
dealing<00:00:12.330> with<00:00:12.420> an<00:00:12.509> astrocytoma<00:00:12.809> an

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
dealing with an astrocytoma an

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.609 
dealing with an astrocytoma an
ependymoma<00:00:14.269> metastatic<00:00:15.269> disease<00:00:15.450> MS<00:00:16.379> or

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
ependymoma metastatic disease MS or

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.630 
ependymoma metastatic disease MS or
abscess<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:18.300> let's<00:00:18.570> do<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.140> count<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.740> want<00:00:20.580> to

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
abscess so let's do the count I want to

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.840 
abscess so let's do the count I want to
hear<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> music<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.590> have<00:00:22.590> festered<00:00:22.980> justices

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
hear the music I have festered justices

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.700 
hear the music I have festered justices
fairline<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.660> maybe<00:00:24.840> that's<00:00:25.050> as<00:00:25.199> close<00:00:25.380> as<00:00:25.439> I

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
fairline so maybe that's as close as I

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.370 
fairline so maybe that's as close as I
could<00:00:27.349> and<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:29.130> answer<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:30.109> excellent<00:00:31.109> sort

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
could and the answer is excellent sort

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.160 
could and the answer is excellent sort
of<00:00:31.470> across<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.890> board<00:00:32.600> you<00:00:33.600> know<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
of across the board you know this is a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.069 
of across the board you know this is a
little<00:00:34.530> bit<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.950> an<00:00:35.460> eye<00:00:35.969> shot<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.510> mean<00:00:36.660> you're

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
little bit of an eye shot I mean you're

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.740 
little bit of an eye shot I mean you're
for<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> lesion<00:00:38.309> within<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> cord<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.660> are

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
for the lesion within the cord you are

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.330 
for the lesion within the cord you are
correct<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.469> pretty<00:00:40.860> much<00:00:41.010> could<00:00:41.219> be

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
correct that pretty much could be

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.030 
correct that pretty much could be
anything<00:00:41.809> but<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.930> course<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> eye<00:00:43.350> shot<00:00:43.770> is

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
anything but of course the eye shot is

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.880 
anything but of course the eye shot is
the<00:00:44.399> stuff<00:00:44.640> thats<00:00:44.879> hanging<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> lungs

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
the stuff thats hanging out in the lungs

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.979 
the stuff thats hanging out in the lungs
so<00:00:46.890> those<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.610> who<00:00:47.969> did<00:00:48.510> metastatic

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
so those of you who did metastatic

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.470 
so those of you who did metastatic
disease<00:00:49.170> number<00:00:49.860> three<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.550> were<00:00:50.700> correct<00:00:51.059> so

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
disease number three you were correct so

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.850 
disease number three you were correct so
that's<00:00:51.660> my<00:00:51.750> place<00:00:51.989> holder<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.469> case<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.800> get

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
that's my place holder in case I get

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.639 
that's my place holder in case I get
fidgety<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:54.059> mouse<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.500> want

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
fidgety on the mouse so just that I want

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.290 
fidgety on the mouse so just that I want
to<00:00:55.680> give<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.890> away<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.129> metastatic<00:00:56.640> disease<00:00:56.789> is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
to give it away so metastatic disease is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.400 
to give it away so metastatic disease is
the<00:00:58.020> answer<00:00:58.440> remember<00:00:59.219> cord<00:00:59.699> metastases<00:01:00.410> not

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the answer remember cord metastases not

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.529 
the answer remember cord metastases not
hugely<00:01:02.039> common<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:02.910> need<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.359> about

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
hugely common but we need to think about

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.140 
hugely common but we need to think about
those<00:01:04.280> fortunately<00:01:05.280> patients<00:01:05.610> living<00:01:05.850> longer

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
those fortunately patients living longer

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.750 
those fortunately patients living longer
and<00:01:06.299> longer<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.930> combined<00:01:07.439> therapies<00:01:08.040> so

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and longer with combined therapies so

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.359 
and longer with combined therapies so
we're<00:01:08.939> seeing<00:01:09.210> these<00:01:09.450> type<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.720> metastatic

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
we're seeing these type of metastatic

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.370 
we're seeing these type of metastatic
lesions<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.780> relative<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.049> metastatic

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
lesions and relative to metastatic

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.719 
lesions and relative to metastatic
lesions<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> following<00:01:14.400> are<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.640> be

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
lesions the following are going to be

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.310 

very<00:01:43.890> good<00:01:44.159> prostate<00:01:44.789> the<00:01:44.939> most<00:01:45.320> infrequent

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
very good prostate the most infrequent

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.109 
very good prostate the most infrequent
of<00:01:46.500> these<00:01:46.770> metastatic<00:01:47.250> diseases<00:01:47.880> that's

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
of these metastatic diseases that's

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.300 
of these metastatic diseases that's
excellent<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:49.110> those<00:01:49.320> melanoma<00:01:50.039> pretty

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
excellent so all those melanoma pretty

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.740 
excellent so all those melanoma pretty
pretty<00:01:50.729> good<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.060> know<00:01:51.119> long<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.479> breast

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
pretty good you know long and breast

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.169 
pretty good you know long and breast
just<00:01:51.990> because<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.250> most<00:01:53.429> common<00:01:53.939> and
