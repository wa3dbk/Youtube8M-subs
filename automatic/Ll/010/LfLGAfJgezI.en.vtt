how about like a 20-second rundown of
backyard<00:00:17.420> brains<00:00:17.570> so<00:00:18.259> Becky<00:00:18.680> brains<00:00:18.920> we

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
backyard brains so Becky brains we

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.429 
backyard brains so Becky brains we
create<00:00:19.430> got<00:00:19.970> a<00:00:20.000> graduate<00:00:20.540> level<00:00:20.570> neuroscience

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
create got a graduate level neuroscience

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.890 
create got a graduate level neuroscience
equipment<00:00:21.859> that<00:00:22.490> is<00:00:22.730> found<00:00:23.210> in<00:00:23.330> universities

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
equipment that is found in universities

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.259 
equipment that is found in universities
and<00:00:24.170> we<00:00:24.680> do<00:00:25.160> that<00:00:25.369> for<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:25.670> general<00:00:25.789> public

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
and we do that for the general public

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.970 
and we do that for the general public
and<00:00:26.449> for<00:00:26.570> amateurs<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:27.289> makers<00:00:27.619> to<00:00:27.830> be<00:00:27.920> able

to explore and make discoveries about

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.310 
to explore and make discoveries about
the<00:00:29.930> brain<00:00:30.550> so<00:00:31.550> how<00:00:31.939> does<00:00:32.000> that<00:00:32.449> tie<00:00:32.870> in<00:00:33.110> when

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
the brain so how does that tie in when

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.509 
the brain so how does that tie in when
I'm<00:00:33.410> dying<00:00:33.590> to<00:00:33.710> know<00:00:33.800> how<00:00:33.949> does<00:00:34.010> that<00:00:34.250> tie<00:00:34.460> in

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519 
I'm dying to know how does that tie in

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.660 
I'm dying to know how does that tie in
to<00:00:35.000> roboroach<00:00:35.660> so<00:00:36.339> that's<00:00:37.339> a<00:00:37.400> really<00:00:37.580> good

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
to roboroach so that's a really good

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.820 
to roboroach so that's a really good
question<00:00:37.729> so<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.150> the<00:00:38.420> cyborg<00:00:39.199> cockroach<00:00:39.650> the

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
question so the the cyborg cockroach the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.020 
question so the the cyborg cockroach the
roboroach<00:00:40.269> is<00:00:41.269> actually<00:00:41.809> a<00:00:42.100> it's<00:00:43.100> a<00:00:43.280> model<00:00:43.790> of

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
roboroach is actually a it's a model of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.810 
roboroach is actually a it's a model of
the<00:00:44.600> latest<00:00:45.379> and<00:00:45.559> greatest<00:00:45.769> in<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.519> I<00:00:46.580> say

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
the latest and greatest in and I say

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.450 
the latest and greatest in and I say
that<00:00:47.030> in<00:00:47.180> a<00:00:47.299> very<00:00:47.510> discouraging<00:00:48.049> way<00:00:48.460> the

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
that in a very discouraging way the

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.320 
that in a very discouraging way the
latest<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:49.879> greatest<00:00:50.030> in<00:00:50.180> neuro

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
latest and greatest in neuro

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.960 
latest and greatest in neuro

cochlear implant or deep brain

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.109 
cochlear implant or deep brain
stimulation<00:00:57.199> so<00:00:57.500> both<00:00:57.710> those<00:00:58.010> our<00:00:58.699> techniques

00:00:59.109 --> 00:00:59.119 
stimulation so both those our techniques

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:01.149 
stimulation so both those our techniques
we<00:00:59.239> take<00:00:59.390> a<00:00:59.420> little<00:00:59.659> smaller<00:00:59.930> in<00:01:00.769> and<00:01:00.920> you<00:01:00.979> put

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
we take a little smaller in and you put

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:02.259 
we take a little smaller in and you put
it<00:01:01.250> inside<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:01.610> brain<00:01:01.820> you<00:01:01.970> make<00:01:02.089> neurons

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
it inside the brain you make neurons

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.929 
it inside the brain you make neurons
fire<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:03.680> roboroach<00:01:04.100> is<00:01:04.339> actually<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.699> exact

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
fire the roboroach is actually the exact

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.130 
fire the roboroach is actually the exact
same<00:01:05.119> thing<00:01:05.360> we're<00:01:05.510> putting<00:01:05.600> a<00:01:05.750> little<00:01:05.840> bit<00:01:05.990> of

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
same thing we're putting a little bit of

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.570 
same thing we're putting a little bit of
current<00:01:06.409> inside<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.740> neurons<00:01:07.100> inside<00:01:07.340> the

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
current inside the neurons inside the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.010 
current inside the neurons inside the
antennas<00:01:07.970> which<00:01:08.180> got<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.479> cockroach<00:01:08.900> to

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
antennas which got the cockroach to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.390 
antennas which got the cockroach to
think<00:01:09.290> it's<00:01:09.440> touching<00:01:09.680> something<00:01:10.070> that<00:01:10.190> moves

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
think it's touching something that moves

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.520 
think it's touching something that moves
in<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.610> cocktail-hour<00:01:11.030> direction<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:11.840> in<00:01:12.410> a

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
in the cocktail-hour direction so in a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.980 
in the cocktail-hour direction so in a
very<00:01:12.680> in<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.130> very<00:01:13.210> real<00:01:14.210> sense<00:01:14.510> when<00:01:14.870> you're

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
very in a very real sense when you're

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.810 
very in a very real sense when you're
learning<00:01:15.680> about<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.950> robot<00:01:16.220> you're<00:01:16.550> actually

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
learning about the robot you're actually

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.970 
learning about the robot you're actually
learning<00:01:16.970> about<00:01:17.120> the<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:17.990> most<00:01:18.590> advanced

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
learning about the the most advanced

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.730 
learning about the the most advanced
treatments<00:01:19.820> that<00:01:20.180> we<00:01:20.300> have<00:01:20.330> for<00:01:20.930> neurological

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
treatments that we have for neurological

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.650 
treatments that we have for neurological
disorders<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:22.850> this<00:01:23.180> is<00:01:23.330> something<00:01:23.630> that

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
disorders so this is something that

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.350 
disorders so this is something that
works<00:01:23.840> in<00:01:24.020> people<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.910> that's<00:01:26.090> exactly

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
works in people to it so that's exactly

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.440 
works in people to it so that's exactly
it<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.930> if<00:01:27.200> you<00:01:27.380> were<00:01:27.620> to<00:01:28.000> look<00:01:29.000> at<00:01:29.180> someone

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
it so the if you were to look at someone

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.510 
it so the if you were to look at someone
when<00:01:29.540> they<00:01:29.710> have<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.740> cochlear<00:01:31.190> implant<00:01:31.250> and

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
when they have a cochlear implant and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.160 
when they have a cochlear implant and
they<00:01:31.640> go<00:01:31.760> into<00:01:31.910> the<00:01:32.000> doctor's<00:01:32.390> office<00:01:32.510> they're

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
they go into the doctor's office they're

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.450 
they go into the doctor's office they're
gonna<00:01:33.290> be<00:01:33.440> adjusting<00:01:33.860> these<00:01:33.950> dials<00:01:34.310> and

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
gonna be adjusting these dials and

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.940 
gonna be adjusting these dials and
settings<00:01:34.900> for<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:35.960> stimulator<00:01:36.409> inside<00:01:36.770> the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
settings for the stimulator inside the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.980 
settings for the stimulator inside the
brain<00:01:37.190> inside<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:37.700> cochlear<00:01:38.330> inside<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.780> ear

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
brain inside the cochlear inside the ear

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.680 
brain inside the cochlear inside the ear
that's<00:01:39.860> sending<00:01:40.010> the<00:01:40.130> signals<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.640> brain

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
that's sending the signals to the brain

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.090 
that's sending the signals to the brain
when<00:01:41.690> a<00:01:41.720> student<00:01:42.290> works<00:01:42.470> with<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.680> roboroach

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
when a student works with the roboroach

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.370 
when a student works with the roboroach
they<00:01:43.580> have<00:01:43.790> a<00:01:43.820> very<00:01:44.270> similar<00:01:44.510> app<00:01:44.780> settings

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
they have a very similar app settings

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.620 
they have a very similar app settings
and<00:01:45.650> they<00:01:45.740> tweak<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.880> current<00:01:47.420> in<00:01:47.540> the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
and they tweak the the current in the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.030 
and they tweak the the current in the
exact<00:01:47.900> same<00:01:48.080> way<00:01:48.260> that's<00:01:48.470> being<00:01:48.620> done<00:01:48.800> in<00:01:48.950> the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
exact same way that's being done in the

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.310 
exact same way that's being done in the
medical<00:01:49.370> society<00:01:49.940> so<00:01:50.090> they<00:01:50.240> there's<00:01:51.229> a

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
medical society so they there's a

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.020 
medical society so they there's a
there's<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.620> lot<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.920> analogies<00:01:52.400> between<00:01:52.640> their

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
there's a lot of analogies between their

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.030 
there's a lot of analogies between their
the<00:01:53.270> cyborg<00:01:54.170> cockroach<00:01:54.650> and<00:01:54.890> what's

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
the cyborg cockroach and what's

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.320 
the cyborg cockroach and what's
happening<00:01:55.370> in<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.550> medical<00:01:55.850> field<00:01:56.060> so

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
happening in the medical field so

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.180 
happening in the medical field so
there's<00:01:57.050> some<00:01:57.229> other<00:01:57.350> fun<00:01:57.590> ways<00:01:57.620> that<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.040> can

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
there's some other fun ways that you can

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.730 
there's some other fun ways that you can
use<00:01:58.370> this<00:01:59.050> electro-stimulation<00:02:00.050> in<00:02:00.440> people

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
use this electro-stimulation in people

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.460 
use this electro-stimulation in people
yeah<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:01.460> actually<00:02:01.760> so<00:02:02.360> with<00:02:02.510> with<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.140> human

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
yeah so actually so with with the human

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.700 
yeah so actually so with with the human
brain<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:05.270> way<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.900> brain<00:02:06.140> communicates

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
brain the the way the brain communicates

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.430 
brain the the way the brain communicates
to<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:06.950> outside<00:02:07.340> world<00:02:07.640> is<00:02:07.970> through<00:02:08.810> muscles

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
to the outside world is through muscles

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.009 
to the outside world is through muscles
and<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:09.860> basically<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:11.090> way<00:02:11.120> I'm<00:02:11.450> talking<00:02:11.659> to

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
and so basically the way I'm talking to

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.949 
and so basically the way I'm talking to
you<00:02:12.200> I'm<00:02:12.379> just<00:02:12.890> eating<00:02:13.040> with<00:02:13.310> my<00:02:13.430> hands<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:14.270> can

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
you I'm just eating with my hands I can

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.130 
you I'm just eating with my hands I can
slap<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.440> but<00:02:15.650> everything<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.250> do<00:02:16.310> that

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
slap you but everything I do that

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.900 
slap you but everything I do that
that<00:02:17.350> output<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.860> my<00:02:17.980> brain<00:02:18.220> has<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.760> come

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
that output of my brain has to come

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.059 
that output of my brain has to come
through<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.270> muscles<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:19.990> we<00:02:20.920> have

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
through the muscles and so we have

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.280 
through the muscles and so we have
muscle<00:02:21.819> Spiker<00:02:22.120> boxes<00:02:22.569> which<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.870> able<00:02:23.200> to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
muscle Spiker boxes which is able to

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.230 
muscle Spiker boxes which is able to
record<00:02:23.650> from<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:23.980> output<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.490> brain<00:02:24.730> by

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
record from that output of the brain by

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.300 
record from that output of the brain by
recording<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.959> electrode<00:02:26.620> mile<00:02:26.830> grammars

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
recording the electrode mile grammars

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.190 
recording the electrode mile grammars
the<00:02:27.430> EMG<00:02:28.030> signals<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.600> are<00:02:28.720> coming<00:02:28.750> from<00:02:29.080> the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
the EMG signals that are coming from the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.199 
the EMG signals that are coming from the
brain<00:02:29.350> out<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.550> muscles<00:02:30.880> so<00:02:30.940> they

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
brain out to the to the muscles so they

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.300 
brain out to the to the muscles so they
actually<00:02:31.390> hit<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.319> muscles<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.069> brain

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
actually hit the muscles the brain

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.460 
actually hit the muscles the brain
signal<00:02:33.640> comes<00:02:33.820> down<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.810> spike<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.380> it

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
signal comes down it's a spike and it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.720 
signal comes down it's a spike and it
hits<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.770> neural<00:02:35.980> Junction<00:02:36.310> muscle<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.670> it

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
hits the neural Junction muscle and it

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.280 
hits the neural Junction muscle and it
turns<00:02:36.910> into<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.330> motor<00:02:37.690> action<00:02:37.990> potential

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
turns into this motor action potential

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.990 
turns into this motor action potential
we<00:02:38.350> can<00:02:38.440> actually<00:02:38.620> amplify<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.760> record

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
we can actually amplify that and record

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.210 
we can actually amplify that and record
that<00:02:40.270> and<00:02:41.020> then<00:02:41.530> what<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.740> can<00:02:41.830> do<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.160> that

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
that and then what you can do is that

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.130 
that and then what you can do is that
once<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.520> record<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:43.209> we<00:02:43.750> can<00:02:43.870> put<00:02:44.050> that

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
once you record that we can put that

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.449 
once you record that we can put that
into<00:02:44.320> an<00:02:44.440> Arduino<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:44.980> then<00:02:45.100> we<00:02:45.190> can<00:02:45.310> actually

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
into an Arduino and then we can actually

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.490 
into an Arduino and then we can actually
send<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.090> signal<00:02:46.330> into<00:02:46.840> another<00:02:47.080> person's

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
send that signal into another person's

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.220 
send that signal into another person's
arm<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:48.730> hysterical<00:02:49.180> results<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.810> hysterical

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
arm to hysterical results to hysterical

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.770 
arm to hysterical results to hysterical
results<00:02:50.739> exactly<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.660> this

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
results exactly and and is this

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.880 
results exactly and and is this
something<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.410> are<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.800> you're

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
something that you are that you're

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.430 
something that you are that you're
sharing<00:02:54.280> that<00:02:54.400> you're<00:02:54.640> making<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.209> available

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
sharing that you're making it available

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.410 
sharing that you're making it available
yeah<00:02:56.440> so<00:02:56.590> we<00:02:56.680> actually<00:02:56.860> have<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.160> we<00:02:58.090> call<00:02:58.330> it

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
yeah so we actually have a we call it

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.150 
yeah so we actually have a we call it
the<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.810> human<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.200> human<00:02:59.320> interface<00:02:59.830> and

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
the the human to human interface and

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.509 
the the human to human interface and
it's<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:01.350> open<00:03:02.350> source<00:03:02.530> device<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:03.070> you<00:03:03.220> can

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
it's a open source device that you can

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.280 
it's a open source device that you can
hook<00:03:03.670> up<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:04.000> one<00:03:04.150> person<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.720> then<00:03:04.900> control

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
hook up to one person and then control

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.229 
hook up to one person and then control
another<00:03:05.650> one<00:03:05.860> so<00:03:06.070> if<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.220> ever<00:03:06.850> had<00:03:07.060> issues

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
another one so if you ever had issues

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.940 
another one so if you ever had issues
we're<00:03:07.690> pelvises<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:08.110> don't<00:03:08.260> just<00:03:08.410> understand

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
we're pelvises you don't just understand

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.949 
we're pelvises you don't just understand
me<00:03:09.100> anymore<00:03:09.310> now<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.180> now<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.570> have<00:03:10.870> an

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
me anymore now you now you have an

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.780 
me anymore now you now you have an
invention<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.440> allows<00:03:11.800> you<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.370> feel<00:03:12.610> what

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
invention that allows you to feel what

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.330 
invention that allows you to feel what
someone<00:03:13.060> else<00:03:13.150> feels<00:03:13.830> have<00:03:14.830> you<00:03:14.950> seen<00:03:15.130> anybody

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
someone else feels have you seen anybody

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.180 
someone else feels have you seen anybody
adapt<00:03:16.090> or<00:03:16.360> modify<00:03:16.959> it<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.320> do<00:03:17.950> something

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
adapt or modify it to do something

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.100 
adapt or modify it to do something
different<00:03:18.430> so<00:03:18.550> I<00:03:18.580> mean<00:03:18.820> like<00:03:18.970> all<00:03:19.330> of<00:03:20.019> our

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
different so I mean like all of our

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.780 
different so I mean like all of our
experiments<00:03:20.650> are<00:03:20.739> kind<00:03:20.860> of<00:03:20.890> open<00:03:21.220> open-ended

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
experiments are kind of open open-ended

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.340 
experiments are kind of open open-ended
so<00:03:21.970> will<00:03:22.180> will<00:03:22.480> come<00:03:22.630> up<00:03:22.720> work<00:03:22.870> for<00:03:22.900> the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
so will will come up work for the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.289 
so will will come up work for the
roboroach<00:03:23.680> for<00:03:23.890> example<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.730> roboroach<00:03:25.030> was

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
roboroach for example the roboroach was

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.150 
roboroach for example the roboroach was
there<00:03:25.540> just<00:03:26.049> as<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.230> way<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.530> sort<00:03:26.769> of<00:03:26.799> teach<00:03:27.010> you

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
there just as a way to sort of teach you

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.380 
there just as a way to sort of teach you
what<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.340> just<00:03:27.370> told<00:03:27.549> you<00:03:27.820> about<00:03:27.850> cochlear

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
what I just told you about cochlear

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.330 
what I just told you about cochlear
implants<00:03:28.780> well<00:03:28.959> there<00:03:29.799> are<00:03:29.890> some<00:03:30.010> high<00:03:30.100> school

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
implants well there are some high school

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.160 
implants well there are some high school
students<00:03:30.670> in<00:03:30.760> New<00:03:30.850> York<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:31.329> saw<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:31.780> the

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
students in New York that saw that the

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.319 
students in New York that saw that the
cockroach<00:03:32.560> adapts<00:03:33.070> over<00:03:33.340> about<00:03:33.489> 20<00:03:33.850> you<00:03:34.180> know

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
cockroach adapts over about 20 you know

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.720 
cockroach adapts over about 20 you know
tries<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.620> cockroach<00:03:36.010> will<00:03:36.190> stop<00:03:36.400> turning

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
tries the cockroach will stop turning

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.729 
tries the cockroach will stop turning
and<00:03:37.150> so<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.959> students<00:03:38.260> were<00:03:38.320> wondering<00:03:38.620> why

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
and so the students were wondering why

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.920 
and so the students were wondering why
why<00:03:39.070> do<00:03:39.130> they<00:03:39.310> stop<00:03:39.459> turning<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:40.060> they<00:03:40.780> did

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
why do they stop turning and so they did

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.210 
why do they stop turning and so they did
their<00:03:41.049> own<00:03:41.079> experiment<00:03:41.620> they<00:03:41.680> actually<00:03:41.980> put

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
their own experiment they actually put

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.470 
their own experiment they actually put
little<00:03:42.430> blockers<00:03:42.910> on<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.209> on<00:03:43.360> the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
little blockers on the on the

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.569 
little blockers on the on the
cockroaches<00:03:43.959> eyes<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.590> then<00:03:44.890> they<00:03:45.010> did<00:03:45.400> they

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
cockroaches eyes and then they did they

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.039 
cockroaches eyes and then they did they
redid<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.000> experiment<00:03:46.480> with<00:03:46.570> new<00:03:46.720> new

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
redid the experiment with new new

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.690 
redid the experiment with new new
cockroaches<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:47.950> they<00:03:48.220> noticed<00:03:48.519> that<00:03:48.549> they

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
cockroaches and they noticed that they

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.100 
cockroaches and they noticed that they
didn't<00:03:48.910> adapt<00:03:49.180> as<00:03:49.329> quickly<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.810> actually<00:03:50.049> took

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
didn't adapt as quickly it actually took

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.420 
didn't adapt as quickly it actually took
them<00:03:50.260> about<00:03:50.500> three<00:03:50.709> or<00:03:50.799> four<00:03:50.980> times<00:03:51.160> longer

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
them about three or four times longer

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.819 
them about three or four times longer
and<00:03:51.850> so<00:03:52.120> what<00:03:52.600> they<00:03:52.720> found<00:03:52.750> was<00:03:53.380> that<00:03:53.560> it's

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
and so what they found was that it's

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.440 
and so what they found was that it's
actually<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.190> sensory<00:03:54.549> perception<00:03:55.209> from<00:03:55.299> the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
actually the sensory perception from the

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.270 
actually the sensory perception from the
antennas<00:03:56.049> with<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.410> eyes<00:03:56.560> that<00:03:57.040> cause

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
antennas with the eyes that cause

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.710 
antennas with the eyes that cause
there's<00:03:57.610> a<00:03:57.700> there's<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:58.000> disconnect<00:03:58.480> there

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
there's a there's a disconnect there

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.420 
there's a there's a disconnect there
which<00:03:59.260> actually<00:03:59.440> allows<00:03:59.769> the<00:04:00.010> cockroach<00:04:00.310> to

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
which actually allows the cockroach to

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.560 
which actually allows the cockroach to
adapt<00:04:00.670> but<00:04:00.850> if<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:00.970> take<00:04:01.120> away<00:04:01.150> that

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
adapt but if you take away that

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.729 
adapt but if you take away that
disconnection<00:04:02.019> then<00:04:02.320> actually<00:04:02.650> the

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
disconnection then actually the

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.830 
disconnection then actually the
cockroach<00:04:03.190> don't<00:04:03.370> adapt<00:04:03.610> as<00:04:03.700> quickly<00:04:03.910> so<00:04:04.030> yeah

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
cockroach don't adapt as quickly so yeah

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.330 
cockroach don't adapt as quickly so yeah
so<00:04:05.019> people<00:04:05.110> are<00:04:05.350> hacking<00:04:05.739> our<00:04:05.860> experiments

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
so people are hacking our experiments

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.380 
so people are hacking our experiments
all<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.489> time<00:04:06.670> and<00:04:06.820> actually<00:04:06.880> making<00:04:07.180> them

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
all the time and actually making them

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.750 
all the time and actually making them
better<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:08.440> got<00:04:08.590> asked<00:04:08.799> I<00:04:08.950> heard<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.519> heard

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
better and I got asked I heard I heard

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.949 
better and I got asked I heard I heard
PETA<00:04:10.150> had<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.739> PETA<00:04:11.739> was<00:04:12.730> very<00:04:13.329> upset<00:04:13.660> that<00:04:13.870> we

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
PETA had a PETA was very upset that we

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.469 
PETA had a PETA was very upset that we
were<00:04:14.140> that<00:04:15.070> we<00:04:15.220> were<00:04:15.400> sort<00:04:15.730> of<00:04:15.850> working<00:04:16.329> with

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
were that we were sort of working with

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.159 
were that we were sort of working with
cockroaches<00:04:17.079> in<00:04:17.109> such<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.620> cruel<00:04:17.890> way<00:04:18.100> but<00:04:18.400> the

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
cockroaches in such a cruel way but the

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.509 
cockroaches in such a cruel way but the
with<00:04:20.169> every<00:04:20.470> experiment<00:04:20.919> it's<00:04:21.100> important

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
with every experiment it's important

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.500 
with every experiment it's important
that<00:04:21.549> we

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
that we

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.240 
that we
look<00:04:22.780> at<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.230> sort<00:04:23.440> of<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.530> cost-benefit

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
look at the sort of the cost-benefit

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.920 
look at the sort of the cost-benefit
ratio<00:04:24.280> right<00:04:24.790> and<00:04:24.970> so<00:04:25.060> what<00:04:25.240> is<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.450> cost<00:04:25.660> to

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
ratio right and so what is the cost to

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.910 
ratio right and so what is the cost to
the<00:04:26.020> cockroach<00:04:26.380> you<00:04:26.470> can<00:04:26.590> ask<00:04:26.740> that<00:04:26.860> question

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
the cockroach you can ask that question

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.090 
the cockroach you can ask that question
so<00:04:27.660> we<00:04:28.660> do<00:04:28.810> do<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:28.960> surgery<00:04:29.410> on<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.740> cockroach

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
so we do do a surgery on the cockroach

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.190 
so we do do a surgery on the cockroach
and<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.790> in<00:04:31.000> that<00:04:31.180> surgery<00:04:31.420> we<00:04:31.750> do<00:04:31.870> cut

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
and and and in that surgery we do cut

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.230 
and and and in that surgery we do cut
the<00:04:32.350> antennas<00:04:32.770> but<00:04:33.640> if<00:04:33.700> you<00:04:33.760> actually<00:04:33.850> look<00:04:34.030> in

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
the antennas but if you actually look in

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.840 
the antennas but if you actually look in
nature<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:35.230> cockroaches<00:04:36.130> have<00:04:36.250> antennas<00:04:36.670> cut

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
nature the cockroaches have antennas cut

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.820 
nature the cockroaches have antennas cut
by<00:04:37.540> nature<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.140> so<00:04:38.260> therefore<00:04:38.440> they<00:04:38.680> can

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
by nature and so therefore they can

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.790 
by nature and so therefore they can
regrow<00:04:39.190> them<00:04:39.420> and<00:04:40.420> so<00:04:40.660> but<00:04:41.410> if<00:04:41.470> you<00:04:41.560> look<00:04:41.710> at

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
regrow them and so but if you look at

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.260 
regrow them and so but if you look at
the<00:04:41.890> benefit<00:04:42.340> that's<00:04:42.580> coming<00:04:42.910> back<00:04:43.060> and<00:04:43.180> so

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
the benefit that's coming back and so

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.220 
the benefit that's coming back and so
you<00:04:43.360> can<00:04:43.480> also<00:04:43.570> check<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.840> see<00:04:43.990> just<00:04:44.200> a

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
you can also check to see just a

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.050 
you can also check to see just a
cockroach<00:04:44.530> live<00:04:44.740> as<00:04:44.830> long<00:04:45.010> it<00:04:45.280> does<00:04:45.490> you

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
cockroach live as long it does you

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.760 
cockroach live as long it does you
connect<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.720> cockroach<00:04:47.020> find<00:04:47.200> food<00:04:47.470> after

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
connect to the cockroach find food after

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.680 
connect to the cockroach find food after
this<00:04:47.860> is<00:04:48.010> surgery<00:04:48.250> they<00:04:48.430> do<00:04:48.490> so<00:04:48.790> theirs<00:04:48.970> so<00:04:49.600> you

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
this is surgery they do so theirs so you

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.180 
this is surgery they do so theirs so you
can<00:04:49.780> do<00:04:49.870> all<00:04:49.990> these<00:04:50.110> checks<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.770> balances<00:04:51.070> to

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
can do all these checks and balances to

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.170 
can do all these checks and balances to
make<00:04:51.250> sure<00:04:51.460> that<00:04:51.580> what<00:04:51.700> you're<00:04:51.790> doing<00:04:51.850> is<00:04:52.150> not

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
make sure that what you're doing is not

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.180 
make sure that what you're doing is not
too<00:04:52.480> costly<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.020> cockroach<00:04:53.380> but<00:04:53.980> then<00:04:54.130> you

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
too costly to the cockroach but then you

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.800 
too costly to the cockroach but then you
look<00:04:54.280> at<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:54.490> benefit<00:04:54.850> society<00:04:54.970> alright<00:04:55.660> and

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
look at the benefit society alright and

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.870 
look at the benefit society alright and
so<00:04:55.930> you<00:04:56.020> got<00:04:56.220> 20%<00:04:57.220> of<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.340> world<00:04:57.520> that<00:04:57.760> has<00:04:57.850> a

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
so you got 20% of the world that has a

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.400 
so you got 20% of the world that has a
neurologic<00:04:58.360> disorder<00:04:58.600> there<00:04:58.840> are<00:04:58.930> no<00:04:59.050> cures

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
neurologic disorder there are no cures

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.960 
neurologic disorder there are no cures
for<00:04:59.620> these<00:04:59.680> diseases<00:04:59.770> we're<00:05:00.400> not<00:05:00.490> training

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
for these diseases we're not training

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.120 
for these diseases we're not training
anyone<00:05:01.360> on<00:05:01.630> neuro<00:05:02.290> technologies<00:05:02.920> or

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
anyone on neuro technologies or

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.340 
anyone on neuro technologies or
neuroscience<00:05:03.820> in<00:05:04.000> k-12<00:05:04.630> and<00:05:04.960> we<00:05:05.050> should<00:05:05.230> be

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
neuroscience in k-12 and we should be

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.530 
neuroscience in k-12 and we should be
doing<00:05:05.590> that<00:05:05.740> as<00:05:05.950> a<00:05:05.980> society<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:06.640> so<00:05:06.820> when<00:05:07.450> you

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
doing that as a society and so when you

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.670 
doing that as a society and so when you
actually<00:05:07.690> take<00:05:07.960> those<00:05:08.110> two<00:05:08.170> and<00:05:08.380> weigh<00:05:08.500> them

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
actually take those two and weigh them

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.050 
actually take those two and weigh them
against<00:05:08.980> each<00:05:09.040> other<00:05:09.190> it<00:05:09.370> seems<00:05:09.400> to<00:05:09.730> make<00:05:09.880> it

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
against each other it seems to make it

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.310 
against each other it seems to make it
makes<00:05:10.300> perfect<00:05:10.660> sense<00:05:10.810> that<00:05:10.960> we<00:05:11.110> should<00:05:11.140> be

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
makes perfect sense that we should be

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.200 
makes perfect sense that we should be
using<00:05:11.400> cockroaches<00:05:12.400> in<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.580> way<00:05:12.700> that<00:05:12.880> science

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
using cockroaches in a way that science

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.930 
using cockroaches in a way that science
is<00:05:13.620> advanced<00:05:14.620> as<00:05:15.010> far<00:05:15.040> as<00:05:15.250> the<00:05:15.460> neuroscience

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
is advanced as far as the neuroscience

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.320 
is advanced as far as the neuroscience
and<00:05:16.030> brain<00:05:16.240> is<00:05:16.420> concerned<00:05:16.890> great<00:05:18.090> how<00:05:19.090> should

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
and brain is concerned great how should

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.420 
and brain is concerned great how should
people<00:05:19.450> look<00:05:19.600> this<00:05:19.780> up<00:05:19.860> so<00:05:20.860> you<00:05:20.890> can<00:05:21.250> go<00:05:21.370> to

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
people look this up so you can go to

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.690 
people look this up so you can go to
