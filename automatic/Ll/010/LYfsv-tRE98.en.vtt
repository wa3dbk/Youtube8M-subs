anything else for that matter but the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.670 
anything else for that matter but the
fill<00:01:05.309> would<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.330> least<00:01:06.570> likely<00:01:06.720> source<00:01:07.440> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680

little<00:01:47.430> bit<00:01:47.580> when<00:01:47.760> you're<00:01:47.910> tuning<00:01:48.150> but<00:01:48.930> you

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
little bit when you're tuning but you

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.010 
little bit when you're tuning but you
