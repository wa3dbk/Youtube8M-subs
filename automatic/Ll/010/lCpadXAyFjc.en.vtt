we'll move to a next window which is a
finder<00:02:32.430> window<00:02:32.459> here<00:02:33.030> we<00:02:33.420> do<00:02:33.540> ctrl<00:02:33.870> f5<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.800> we

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
finder window here we do ctrl f5 and we

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.309 
finder window here we do ctrl f5 and we
can<00:02:35.160> see<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.550> now<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.760> back<00:02:36.630> button<00:02:36.959> at<00:02:37.290> the

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
top there has a highlight and I can

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.410 
top there has a highlight and I can
actually<00:02:41.160> activate<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.090> by<00:02:42.150> hitting<00:02:42.269> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
actually activate it by hitting the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.479 
actually activate it by hitting the
spacebar<00:02:42.690> or<00:02:43.140> i<00:02:43.410> can<00:02:43.650> do<00:02:43.800> down<00:02:44.010> an<00:02:44.160> hour<00:02:44.250> to

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
spacebar or i can do down an hour to

actually activate what's on that menu

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.729 
actually activate what's on that menu
now<00:02:48.209> this<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.540> less<00:02:48.900> than<00:02:49.019> perfect<00:02:49.200> because<00:02:49.590> if

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
now this is less than perfect because if

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.780 
now this is less than perfect because if
I<00:02:49.800> go<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.370> right<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:51.200> can't<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.670> because<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
I go to the right I can't I because the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.940 
I go to the right I can't I because the
next<00:02:53.970> item<00:02:54.660> there<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.230> forward<00:02:55.590> button<00:02:55.709> is

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
next item there the forward button is

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.259 
next item there the forward button is
inactive<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.519> for<00:02:56.640> some<00:02:56.760> reason<00:02:56.790> doesn't<00:02:57.060> let

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
inactive and for some reason doesn't let

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.830 
inactive and for some reason doesn't let
you<00:02:57.360> go<00:02:57.540> for<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.049> anymore<00:02:58.290> if<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:59.090> go<00:03:00.090> back<00:03:00.120> there

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
you go for it anymore if I go back there

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.690 
you go for it anymore if I go back there
now<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.260> have<00:03:01.500> both<00:03:01.709> forward<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.310> back<00:03:02.670> buttons

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
now I have both forward and back buttons

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.110 
now I have both forward and back buttons
so<00:03:03.660> i<00:03:03.720> can<00:03:03.840> do<00:03:03.930> ctrl<00:03:04.290> f5<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.010> i<00:03:05.790> move<00:03:06.000> between

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
so i can do ctrl f5 and i move between

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.720 
so i can do ctrl f5 and i move between
those<00:03:06.680> back<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.890> forth<00:03:08.100> so<00:03:08.370> it's<00:03:08.519> just<00:03:08.580> going

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730
