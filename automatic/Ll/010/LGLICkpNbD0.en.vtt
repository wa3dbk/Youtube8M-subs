00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 here 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.309
 perfect the house of the warriors 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.349
 Orphan Demons the Trap Museum 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.140
 explosives and the hack hut full of 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.570
 logos will be destroyed while the clock 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.000
 keeps popping up there's just one more thing 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.440
 what do I need to do according to my disgusting 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.900
 plan 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.550
 again this no no I do not mean 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.039
 to the president 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.039
 It takes a little there right now 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.010
 on your court because you do not respect the 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.010
 authority 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.070
 I would like to know what you are doing but 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.050
 I have my suspicion I would like to know 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.409
 what magic has the president suspended 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.269
 in the air a fair question 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:50.309
 welcome to my evil plan these three 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.710
 buildings will be demolished to build 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.079
 a useless mall a plan 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.969
 evil in itself I do not like the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.489
 urban development but it is the center 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.739
 commercial to feel knows the matter is 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.280
 conditioned marshmallow president 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.650
 inside one of the buildings 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.470
 will die unless they make the choice 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.290
 final in correct form in what building 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.119
 Today is what this is like up to 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.090
 here I am told reindeer this count expires 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.360
 it's terrible even when we do not do what 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.360
 will 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.700
 but the reaction 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.770
 because you're asking me 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.420
 totally useless now yang 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.429
 so you 'll let a couple of decisions 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.000
 avoid saving someone who neither 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:36.220
 we even love a certain death 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.680
 as if it will be fine according 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.680
 will decide for the two look at me 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.850
 go back from demon warriors 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.420
 exclusive trap museums the cottage 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.420
 full of mud 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.280
 that was the worst choice of your life 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.259
 the victory will be my love without your time 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.050
 it's almost over 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.470
 for the president nothing more 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.690
 and this I still do not like the seeds 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.110
 of doubt all worse decisions than you 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.410
 restless you're always wrong now just 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.700
 for the sake of the physiology discussion 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.610
 easy said the museum 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.330
 what would be easy for you your comment 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.330
 now 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.060
 by background of the warrior demons 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.900
 do not 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:02.030
 42 41 40 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.030
 But nothing more 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.180
 you chose well 9 sister 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.700
 with that that the elections of yanga 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.439
 they would be bad or the magic seeds of 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.269
 the doubts are opponents for the 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:26.890
 power of a rate source like my 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.870
 brother, if I already have it, he will fight me 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.430
 month 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.310

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.299
