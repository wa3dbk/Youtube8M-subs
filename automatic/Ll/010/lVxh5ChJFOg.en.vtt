00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
some of the same stampings so we're

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.950 
some of the same stampings so we're
talking<00:01:57.670> about<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:58.000> car<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:58.420> actually<00:01:58.570> has<00:01:58.930> a

little bit of a dual personality and

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:12.360 
little bit of a dual personality and
it's<00:02:00.940> past<00:02:01.180> it's<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:01.900> good<00:02:02.050> car<00:02:02.229> it<00:02:02.440> really<00:02:02.650> is

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.800 

do<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.459> think<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.970> it's<00:02:14.270> built<00:02:14.569> for<00:02:14.630> these

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
do you think that it's built for these

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.920 
do you think that it's built for these
kind<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.280> switchback<00:02:16.280> roads<00:02:16.580> in<00:02:16.730> Colorado<00:02:17.090> the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
kind of switchback roads in Colorado the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.270 
kind of switchback roads in Colorado the
only<00:02:18.080> problem<00:02:18.290> with<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.500> switchback<00:02:18.950> roads

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
only problem with the switchback roads

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.370 
only problem with the switchback roads
here<00:02:19.610> is<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.880> we're<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.090> nearly<00:02:20.450> 7,000<00:02:21.200> feet

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
here is that we're up nearly 7,000 feet

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.170 
here is that we're up nearly 7,000 feet
which<00:02:21.950> means<00:02:22.220> we've<00:02:22.610> tapered<00:02:23.090> off

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
which means we've tapered off

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.390 
which means we've tapered off
significantly<00:02:23.510> on<00:02:24.140> our<00:02:24.260> horsepower<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:25.010> would

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
significantly on our horsepower I would

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.790 
significantly on our horsepower I would
imagine<00:02:25.550> we're<00:02:25.880> getting<00:02:26.090> around<00:02:26.300> 350<00:02:27.020> or<00:02:27.140> 360

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
imagine we're getting around 350 or 360

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.710 
imagine we're getting around 350 or 360
horsepower<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:29.030> car<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.240> weighs<00:02:29.480> two<00:02:29.690> tons

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
horsepower in a car that weighs two tons

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.390 
horsepower in a car that weighs two tons
over<00:02:30.380> two<00:02:30.530> tons<00:02:32.530> higher<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.709> go<00:02:33.920> up<00:02:34.040> these<00:02:34.160> hills

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
over two tons higher I go up these hills

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.750

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
for the amount of power loss so it's it
