we're<00:00:20.789> very<00:00:21.119> big<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.689> technology<00:00:22.349> I<00:00:22.529> think

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
we're very big on technology I think

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.999 
we're very big on technology I think
that's<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.599> future<00:00:24.599> of<00:00:24.689> law<00:00:24.840> enforcement<00:00:25.009> as

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
that's the future of law enforcement as

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.880 
that's the future of law enforcement as
far<00:00:26.279> as<00:00:26.429> our<00:00:26.669> effectiveness<00:00:27.470> depends<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.680> our

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
far as our effectiveness depends on our

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.880 
far as our effectiveness depends on our
ability<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.430> communicate<00:00:30.680> so<00:00:31.680> we<00:00:31.769> were

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
ability to communicate so we were

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.189 
ability to communicate so we were
searching<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.550> ruggedized<00:00:33.480> computer<00:00:33.960> that

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
searching for a ruggedized computer that

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:36.020 
searching for a ruggedized computer that
would<00:00:34.350> allow<00:00:34.590> us<00:00:34.829> with<00:00:35.070> its<00:00:35.220> processor<00:00:35.850> and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
would allow us with its processor and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.630 
would allow us with its processor and
its<00:00:36.540> ability<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.470> move<00:00:37.890> us<00:00:38.040> into<00:00:38.220> wireless

its ability to move us into wireless
technology<00:00:40.460> one<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.610> first<00:00:41.730> things<00:00:42.000> we

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
technology one of the first things we

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.549 
technology one of the first things we
did<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.480> throw<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.750> down<00:00:42.900> two<00:00:43.170> flights<00:00:43.379> of

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
did is throw it down two flights of

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.420 
did is throw it down two flights of
stairs<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:44.159> test<00:00:44.970> it<00:00:45.150> and<00:00:45.559> I'm<00:00:46.559> happy<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.280> say

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
stairs to test it and I'm happy to say

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.040 
stairs to test it and I'm happy to say
that<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.699> held<00:00:47.879> up<00:00:48.089> but<00:00:48.269> we<00:00:48.390> tested<00:00:48.839> several

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
that it held up but we tested several

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.780 
that it held up but we tested several
competitors<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.890> we're<00:00:50.640> completely

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
competitors and we're completely

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.110
