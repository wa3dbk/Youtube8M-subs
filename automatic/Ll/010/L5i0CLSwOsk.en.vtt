Turner G model be found little gadget
the<00:00:06.390> idea<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.930> if<00:00:07.820> the<00:00:08.820> voltage<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.809> your

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
the idea is if the voltage of your

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.209 
the idea is if the voltage of your
battery<00:00:10.380> pack<00:00:10.759> drops<00:00:11.759> below<00:00:12.150> 4<00:00:12.690> volts<00:00:13.110> or<00:00:13.769> if

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
battery pack drops below 4 volts or if

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.370 
battery pack drops below 4 volts or if
you<00:00:14.370> lose<00:00:14.610> signal<00:00:15.289> from<00:00:16.289> your<00:00:16.440> receiver<00:00:17.359> its

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
you lose signal from your receiver its

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.099 
you lose signal from your receiver its
vs.<00:00:19.380> start<00:00:19.980> emitting<00:00:20.189> name<00:00:20.520> without<00:00:21.449> beeping

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
vs. start emitting name without beeping

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.200 
vs. start emitting name without beeping
noise<00:00:23.390> and<00:00:25.580> that's<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.760> theory<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.660> practice

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
noise and that's the theory in practice

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.620 
noise and that's the theory in practice
when<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.240> found<00:00:30.840> will<00:00:31.410> turn<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.570> you<00:00:33.570> know

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
when I found will turn it on you know

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.229 
when I found will turn it on you know
he's<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.200> beeping<00:00:34.559> noise<00:00:38.059> ten<00:00:39.059> more<00:00:39.329> narrow

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
he's the beeping noise ten more narrow

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:50.930 
he's the beeping noise ten more narrow
and<00:00:43.280> if<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.430> know<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.730> stops

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.229 

and<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.690> hooked<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.790> the<00:00:53.790> other<00:00:54.090> on

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and it's hooked up to the other on

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:03.229 
and it's hooked up to the other on
channel<00:00:59.450> and<00:01:00.450> that's<00:01:00.690> all<00:01:00.900> fine<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.239> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
channel and that's all fine but so the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.320 
channel and that's all fine but so the
idea<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.989> lose<00:01:04.140> radio<00:01:04.440> contact<00:01:05.090> line<00:01:06.090> goes

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
idea is you lose radio contact line goes

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.370 
idea is you lose radio contact line goes
down<00:01:06.660> gets<00:01:07.110> lost<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.119> radio<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.020> goes<00:01:10.170> that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
down gets lost and so radio it goes that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.170 
down gets lost and so radio it goes that
you<00:01:10.530> will<00:01:10.830> see<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.160> loses<00:01:11.280> contact<00:01:11.760> with

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.400 

the<00:01:15.180> transmitter<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:19.050> supposed<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
the transmitter and it's supposed to

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:27.830 
the transmitter and it's supposed to
start<00:01:19.650> beeping<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.170> hasn't<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:27.570> from

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
start beeping and it hasn't and from

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.249 
start beeping and it hasn't and from
what<00:01:27.990> I've<00:01:28.140> seen<00:01:29.119> it<00:01:30.119> seems<00:01:30.180> only<00:01:30.660> will<00:01:30.960> start

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
what I've seen it seems only will start

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.560 
what I've seen it seems only will start
beeping

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
beeping

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.550 
beeping
after<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.690> voltage<00:01:34.110> drops<00:01:34.440> below<00:01:34.770> four<00:01:35.250> volts

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
after the voltage drops below four volts

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.060 
after the voltage drops below four volts
which<00:01:37.560> could<00:01:37.800> be<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> while<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.770> other<00:01:40.860> odd

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
which could be a while the other odd

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.520 
which could be a while the other odd
thing<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.479> if<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.630> doing<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> signal

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
thing is if it's doing the signal

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.430 
thing is if it's doing the signal
actually<00:01:47.450> hooked<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.520> holy<00:01:50.520> king<00:01:50.850> fast

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
actually hooked up to a holy king fast

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.820 
actually hooked up to a holy king fast
receiver<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.660> terms<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.050> compatibility<00:01:55.590> I

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
receiver so in terms of compatibility I

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.740 
receiver so in terms of compatibility I
thought<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:59.250> likely<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.640> work<00:01:59.880> there<00:02:00.569> just

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
thought to be likely to work there just

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.870 
thought to be likely to work there just
to<00:02:00.869> prove<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.740> losing<00:02:02.340> signal<00:02:02.640> from

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
to prove that it's losing signal from

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.320 
to prove that it's losing signal from
right<00:02:03.119> now<00:02:03.349> turn<00:02:04.349> the<00:02:04.470> radio<00:02:04.830> on<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:09.090> see

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
right now turn the radio on and you see

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.920 
right now turn the radio on and you see
the<00:02:09.509> link<00:02:10.170> light<00:02:11.090> well<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.330> stops<00:02:12.599> flashing

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the link light well it stops flashing

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:25.550 
the link light well it stops flashing
let's<00:02:13.410> go<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.880> radio<00:02:21.209> off<00:02:21.739> and<00:02:24.560> pink

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
let's go and the radio off and pink

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.420 
let's go and the radio off and pink
light<00:02:25.800> stops<00:02:26.160> flashing<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:28.010> this<00:02:29.010> one's<00:02:29.250> left

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
light stops flashing and this one's left

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.250 
light stops flashing and this one's left
to<00:02:29.550> announcement<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.670> for<00:02:33.120> my<00:02:33.270> money<00:02:33.599> it<00:02:33.959> only

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
to announcement and for my money it only

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.750 
to announcement and for my money it only
really<00:02:35.780> introduces<00:02:36.780> another<00:02:37.520> link<00:02:38.520> in<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
really introduces another link in the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.699 
really introduces another link in the
chain<00:02:39.030> that's<00:02:39.330> their<00:02:40.220> little<00:02:41.220> connector<00:02:42.709> that

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
chain that's their little connector that

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.890 
chain that's their little connector that
first<00:02:44.370> couple<00:02:44.640> times<00:02:44.760> plugged<00:02:45.150> into<00:02:45.390> plastic

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
first couple times plugged into plastic

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.309 
first couple times plugged into plastic
got<00:02:46.080> in<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.290> way<00:02:46.970> um<00:02:50.209> so<00:02:51.209> yeah<00:02:52.080> it's<00:02:52.230> just

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
got in the way um so yeah it's just

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:59.630 
got in the way um so yeah it's just
another<00:02:52.709> weakness<00:02:54.140> weak<00:02:55.140> link<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.190> chain

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.780 

the<00:03:00.640> morale<00:03:01.000> be<00:03:01.180> found<00:03:02.310> probably<00:03:03.310> isn't<00:03:03.640> worth

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
the morale be found probably isn't worth

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.290 
the morale be found probably isn't worth
it<00:03:04.120> even<00:03:05.430> though<00:03:06.430> there<00:03:06.850> was<00:03:07.030> only<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.270> couple

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
it even though there was only a couple

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.720 
it even though there was only a couple
of<00:03:07.570> dollars
