right<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.770> vacuum<00:00:02.389> shutoff<00:00:03.389> actuator<00:00:04.049> is

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:04.640 
right a vacuum shutoff actuator is

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.379 
right a vacuum shutoff actuator is
located<00:00:06.680> below<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.890> vacuum<00:00:08.730> control<00:00:09.030> valve

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
located below the vacuum control valve

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.919 
located below the vacuum control valve
which<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:09.990> what<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:11.660> mine<00:00:12.660> is

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
which is what this is a mine is

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.900 
which is what this is a mine is
connected<00:00:13.500> here<00:00:14.070> as<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.400> may<00:00:14.580> be<00:00:14.610> able<00:00:14.759> to

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
connected here as you may be able to

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.529 
connected here as you may be able to
tell<00:00:15.210> about<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.570> brown<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.170> violet<00:00:16.590> line

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
tell about the brown and violet line

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:24.700 
tell about the brown and violet line
that<00:00:18.539> goes<00:00:18.900> down<00:00:21.980> real<00:00:22.980> difficult<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.640> see

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
that goes down real difficult to see

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:33.440 
that goes down real difficult to see
that<00:00:25.710> goes<00:00:26.070> down<00:00:29.179> and<00:00:31.489> you<00:00:32.489> see<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.880> line<00:00:33.180> is

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that goes down and you see this line is

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.270 
that goes down and you see this line is
connected<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.760> there's<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.880> nipple<00:00:37.129> that<00:00:38.129> it

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
connected to it there's a nipple that it

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.270 
connected to it there's a nipple that it
fits<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.760> too<00:00:39.320> similar<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.500> where<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.070> have

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
fits on too similar to where you have

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.610 
fits on too similar to where you have
yours<00:00:41.879> charlie<00:00:44.300> trying<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.539> as<00:00:45.660> many

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:58.459 

shots<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.250> here<00:00:56.930> there's<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.020> nipple

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
shots as I can here there's a nipple

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.069 
shots as I can here there's a nipple
that<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.460> rumor<00:00:59.699> line<00:01:00.000> fits<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:00.840> there

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that the rumor line fits on right there

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.689 
that the rumor line fits on right there
so<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.320> need<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.649> connect<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.160> rubber<00:01:02.520> line

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
so you need to connect that rubber line

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.000 
so you need to connect that rubber line
that<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.329> connected<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.170> nipple

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
that you have connected to the nipple

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.460 
that you have connected to the nipple
now<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.640> supposed<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.119> open<00:01:06.299> see<00:01:07.290> that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
now is supposed to be open see that

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.350 
now is supposed to be open see that
right<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.159> hard<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.610> see<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.180> that's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
right there it's hard to see so that's

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.190 
right there it's hard to see so that's
the<00:01:09.659> shuttle<00:01:10.020> actuator<00:01:10.880> now<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:13.020> is

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the shuttle actuator now going this is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.109 
the shuttle actuator now going this is
this<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> different<00:01:13.680> model<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> 126

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
this is a different model this as a 126

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.450 
this is a different model this as a 126
however<00:01:16.700> up<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:18.560> this<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.740> my<00:01:19.890> main<00:01:20.159> vacuum

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
however up here this is my main vacuum

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.760 
however up here this is my main vacuum
line

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.030 

going<00:01:26.880> through<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.030> fake<00:01:28.270> firewall<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:29.110> then

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
going through the fake firewall and then

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.270 
going through the fake firewall and then
I<00:01:30.160> have<00:01:30.370> some<00:01:30.670> branches<00:01:31.390> coming<00:01:31.690> off<00:01:31.930> here<00:01:32.500> and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
I have some branches coming off here and

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.610 
I have some branches coming off here and
you'll<00:01:33.550> see<00:01:33.760> one<00:01:34.000> of<00:01:34.180> them<00:01:34.710> has<00:01:35.710> a<00:01:36.040> solid<00:01:36.520> brown

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
you'll see one of them has a solid brown

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.330 
you'll see one of them has a solid brown
line<00:01:39.090> now<00:01:40.090> that's<00:01:40.330> connected<00:01:40.900> I<00:01:41.250> don't<00:01:42.250> have

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
line now that's connected I don't have

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.770 
line now that's connected I don't have
three<00:01:42.520> hands<00:01:42.790> that's<00:01:42.970> connected<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.600> this

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
three hands that's connected to this

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.280 
three hands that's connected to this
3-way<00:01:44.740> connector<00:01:45.310> here<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:45.940> it<00:01:46.810> runs<00:01:47.050> into

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
3-way connector here and it runs into

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.750 
3-way connector here and it runs into
the<00:01:47.590> ignition<00:01:47.890> switch<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:48.990> then<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.200> brown

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
the ignition switch and then the brown

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.219 
the ignition switch and then the brown
violet<00:01:51.760> line<00:01:52.260> goes<00:01:53.260> to<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.619> shutoff<00:01:53.890> actuator

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
violet line goes to the shutoff actuator

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.070 
violet line goes to the shutoff actuator
now<00:01:56.229> you'll<00:01:56.440> see<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:58.180> you<00:01:58.450> can<00:01:58.479> see<00:01:58.840> may<00:01:59.020> be

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
now you'll see that you can see may be

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.620 
now you'll see that you can see may be
able<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.320> tell<00:01:59.640> that<00:02:00.640> both<00:02:00.820> you<00:02:01.060> can<00:02:01.210> see<00:02:01.390> both

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
able to tell that both you can see both

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.859 
able to tell that both you can see both
lines<00:02:01.899> from<00:02:02.140> here<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:04.240> again<00:02:04.390> I<00:02:04.450> have<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.660> hold

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
lines from here and again I have to hold

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.200 
lines from here and again I have to hold
the<00:02:04.930> light<00:02:05.080> with<00:02:05.259> one<00:02:05.920> hand<00:02:06.160> so<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.399> can<00:02:06.880> only<00:02:07.000> do

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
the light with one hand so I can only do

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.330 
the light with one hand so I can only do
so<00:02:07.479> much<00:02:07.630> but<00:02:08.350> it's<00:02:08.530> hard<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:08.770> see<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.220> it's

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
so much but it's hard to see and it's

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.450 
so much but it's hard to see and it's
located<00:02:09.729> up<00:02:09.970> under<00:02:10.270> there
