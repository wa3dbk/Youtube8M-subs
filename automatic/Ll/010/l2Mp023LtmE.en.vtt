00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.960
 added sour cream and mayonnaise 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.460
 stirred and he looks like this 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.950
 that's the way it is so let's say did not know 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.900
 Kuban some variation of something 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.900
 I think every family will 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.690
 cook differently so here I am 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.980
 I mixed like this very very much 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.379
 rich and not fat 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.190
 the amount of red matter so that it 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:53.420
 it was direct dyeing and it is very somehow 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.640
 say somebody's pigmented 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.920
 Generally if you wonder how I cook 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.629
 your pigmented longer stay 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:06.110
 with me so we will need about 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:09.110
 kilogram of meat on the bone in this 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.330
 case of me this chicken drumstick can 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.300
 take a beef bone 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.240
 put brewed also we need 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.160
 carrot here I have these three things 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.080
 large carrots I love more 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:26.870
 vegetables potatoes cabbage prove to me 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.840
 very big depends on how you are 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.150
 take it to the saucepan it burak me 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.100
 like beetroot salad on because 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.470
 she is very very red and more 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.910
 it turns out very red I love all 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.230
 Here's a red and onion onions, too 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.960
 purple is not very bitter but onions 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.940
 may be any other than that 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.720
 need tomato paste 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.720
 i love a lot of tomato paste and if she 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.580
 not acid turns out very saturated 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.600
 cool broth so i'm whole here 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.840
 There are three such bags I take in each 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:07.250
 140 grams here it is written 140 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.490
 grams such a blanket can take any 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.520
 another something to your taste world 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.510
 and more so the first thing we put 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.960
 stew 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.690
 chicken is my chicken legs we don't 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.270
 love white meat so much 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.660
 legs are not as fat as we suppose 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.090
 honey and here about 1 pack that is 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.630
 Kilogram must not forget on time 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.690
 take off the foam 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.410
 neatly shoot otherwise the broth will 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.260
 muddy and here I fold it and 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.950
 so here neatly cook so much 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.710
 how many will need to cover the lid so 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.420
 more vitamins are stored 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.370
 only inspect not to knock down 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.940
 broth that is, here I have it 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.930
 hole where steam goes in general then i 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.400
 I can move the brushes so as not to 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.400
 too many bubbles formed 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.490
 that flow out and so now i'm 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.470
 do zazharku fried applicant rubbed on 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:14.470
 grater beets and carrots and actually on 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.620
 I fry them in oil I got 100k full 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.560
 pan but about roasting also a little 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.440
 a little later I'll add on chopped onions 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.140
 there that onions are fried less it is more so 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.510
 let's say gentle he's fast enough 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.810
 do not burn something burned 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.500
 first we 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.580
 here are these vegetables and also gave the seeds 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.190
 freed up 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.160
 chicken legs pieces can be given to some 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.989
 be a grandma doggy and either doggies x 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:48.319
 meat and at the end add to soup and so I 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:51.230
 added a bow here and see squeezed one 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.069
 I like a bag of tomato paste 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.890
 tomato paste also fry at the end 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:02.090
 zazharka peel he so red here 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:05.959
 added here and actually starting 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.280
 stir so that she along with 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.280
 lie like fry 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.410
 roasted a total of about 15 minutes on 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.760
 mean fire about trying so hard 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.030
 nothing burned 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.570
 and how frying turns into such 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.930
 see the golden gruel 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.660
 that is, she acquires so well 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.940
 homogeneity of some kind it means that all 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:36.229
 already so well cooked 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.620
 and the excess water has evaporated we add it 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.900
 together with the potatoes in the saucepan potatoes 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:47.150
 I'm here already chopped and added and 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:50.680
 Now the water boils and so we added 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.810
 fry in a pot of potatoes and 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.270
 I squeezed out the remaining two bundles 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.460
 tomato and tomato paste 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.280
 in all that you must be sure 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.710
 then 1 post there was no ki Chuvash by chance 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.220
 will oxidize some other place 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.260
 borscht and when enough tomato 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.840
 pasta broth turns out very thick 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.750
 the answer is, the spoon goes away and everything is not visible 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.690
 Immediately I mean there is broth olya 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.400
 Tomato juice did not know I really like 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.710
 I have all any such broth 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.139
 the only thing that of course is if tomato 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.360
 sour paste is a lot of vinegar then this 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.610
 affect the final product therefore 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.770
 try to taste add on them but 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.689
 schools well, like a gram of a hundred maybe 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.479
 parallel to you so that you 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:40.289
 let's say there was some kind of sour but 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.229
 turn 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:46.340
 vegetables too carrot there cabbage not 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:49.020
 will give sweetness therefore compensated 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.360
 some of the presence of tomato vinegar 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.789
 pasta and generally get enough 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.259
 interesting is a little bit sweet 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:06:00.469
 Well, in general, you see, I already have potatoes 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:02.909
 almost ready she became so 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:05.330
 rounded on the tips this means that 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:08.729
 she cooked and already began to fall apart 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:12.300
 so I add cabbage 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:15.449
 that I cut her see she was a mother 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:19.189
 I try to cut ice cream like this 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:21.779
 Here on such small tonics enough 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:22.560
 pieces that is not some square for 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:25.650
 cabbage rolls 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.729
 namely that and straws and in general in the very 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:33.839
 late add cabbage and add meat 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:36.810
 and a little bit later cabbage and and I 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:39.870
 already added here all the products that have 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:42.180
 we were added a little universal 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.419
 seasoning just a little caprica for 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:49.500
 tint flavor and add such 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:53.900
 dried dill just to such 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.900
 light aromatic was a little bit quite 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:01.409
 after adding cabbage boils 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:04.319
 She 10 minutes after boiling but this 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:07.080
 very so thick cabbage can even 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:09.900
 smaller 5 she still in hot water 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:13.319
 will come and just get not digested 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.020
 but here is such a barrel you see 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:19.229
 I added here 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:21.110
 mayonnaise and sour cream mayonnaise ordinary 

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:22.970
 teaspoon literally teaspoon 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.210
 And here is such a cow from Karina Fkisa 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:28.210
 mentally so all nice 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.210
 appetite
