going on we were more focused with how
the<00:00:11.990> the<00:00:12.990> devices<00:00:13.559> themselves<00:00:13.710> switched<00:00:14.429> over

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
the the devices themselves switched over

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.240 
the the devices themselves switched over
the<00:00:15.150> explanation<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.260> solid<00:00:16.710> line<00:00:16.890> versus

the you can it's actually kind of cool
you<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.769> zoom<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.490> app<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.939> gets

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
you can zoom with the app and it gets

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.630 
you can zoom with the app and it gets
small<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> lot<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.109> devices

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
small so if you have a lot of devices
