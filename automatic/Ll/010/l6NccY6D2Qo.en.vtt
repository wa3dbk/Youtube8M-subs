why there's only five spawns so without

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.700 
why there's only five spawns so without
for<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.330> let's<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.689> into<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.080> game<00:01:37.350> play

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.170 

okay<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:40.770> what<00:01:41.159> do<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.280> start<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:41.970> with

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
okay so what do we start out here with

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.260 
okay so what do we start out here with
we<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.840> starting<00:01:43.170> out<00:01:43.439> with<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.240> psg-1<00:01:45.240> i

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
we are starting out with the psg-1 i

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.580 
we are starting out with the psg-1 i
believe<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.280> this<00:01:47.280> gun<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:48.140> relatively<00:01:49.140> hard

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
believe and this gun is relatively hard

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.980 
believe and this gun is relatively hard
to<00:01:49.770> use<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.759> rarely<00:01:51.299> ever<00:01:51.570> gets<00:01:51.810> one

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
to use because it rarely ever gets one

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.070 
to use because it rarely ever gets one
shot<00:01:52.020> kills<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.240> i<00:01:54.240> only<00:01:54.420> got<00:01:54.540> one<00:01:54.750> shot<00:01:54.780> kill

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
shot kills and i only got one shot kill

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.469 
shot kills and i only got one shot kill
there<00:01:55.229> because<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:56.009> guy<00:01:56.909> got<00:01:57.119> already<00:01:57.360> got

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479

there because the guy got already got
hit<00:01:59.000> and<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.420> with<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.600> psg-1<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:02.280> gonna

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
used to actually snipe on a sensitivity

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.540 
used to actually snipe on a sensitivity
but<00:05:47.750> I<00:05:47.810> never<00:05:48.050> really<00:05:48.320> got<00:05:48.440> into<00:05:48.620> like<00:05:48.920> the<00:05:49.160> the

but I never really got into like the the
small<00:05:49.910> gun<00:05:50.450> portion<00:05:50.900> of<00:05:51.020> it<00:05:51.140> the<00:05:51.980> smaller<00:05:52.250> on

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
small gun portion of it the smaller on

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.610 
small gun portion of it the smaller on
with<00:05:52.610> Anwar<00:05:52.970> and<00:05:53.030> I<00:05:53.840> tried<00:05:54.170> it<00:05:54.320> and<00:05:54.500> it<00:05:54.560> worked

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
in for a while but I'm trying to

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.550 
in for a while but I'm trying to
experiment<00:06:25.040> someone<00:06:26.140> and<00:06:27.140> I<00:06:27.200> found<00:06:27.350> that<00:06:27.470> on

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
experiment someone and I found that on

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.440 
experiment someone and I found that on
the<00:06:27.590> Sharpshooter<00:06:28.070> like<00:06:28.220> it's<00:06:28.700> you<00:06:29.150> can't

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
the Sharpshooter like it's you can't

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.780 
the Sharpshooter like it's you can't
like<00:06:29.690> double<00:06:30.230> triangle<00:06:30.740> you<00:06:31.190> know<00:06:31.310> cancel

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:31.790 
like double triangle you know cancel

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.340

reload<00:06:32.210> because<00:06:32.660> I<00:06:32.690> totally<00:06:33.170> thought<00:06:33.290> that

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
reload because I totally thought that

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.680 
reload because I totally thought that

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
into them but apparently gain hates me

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.070
