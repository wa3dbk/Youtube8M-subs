00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
a green is a very good business decision

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.150 
a green is a very good business decision
to<00:00:15.509> do<00:00:15.630> because<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.960> helps<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.289> save<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> lot<00:00:17.100> of

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
to do because it helps you save a lot of

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.099 
to do because it helps you save a lot of
money<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:18.000> your<00:00:18.180> facilities<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.869> there's<00:00:19.050> a

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
money in your facilities so there's a

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.870 
money in your facilities so there's a
lot<00:00:19.289> more<00:00:19.410> conversation<00:00:19.680> around<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.609> than

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
lot more conversation around that than

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.820 
lot more conversation around that than
we've<00:00:21.300> ever<00:00:21.420> seen<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.930> past<00:00:22.170> from<00:00:22.769> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
we've ever seen in the past from a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.040 
we've ever seen in the past from a
purely<00:00:23.189> financial<00:00:23.519> perspective<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.689> it's

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
purely financial perspective it's it's

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.230 
purely financial perspective it's it's
important<00:00:25.710> because<00:00:26.070> money<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.730> tight<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
important because money is tight and

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.599 
important because money is tight and
people<00:00:27.750> need<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.170> cut<00:00:28.439> budgets<00:00:28.890> all<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.400> time

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
people need to cut budgets all the time

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.429 
people need to cut budgets all the time
and<00:00:29.880> one<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> major<00:00:30.510> expenses<00:00:31.140> with<00:00:31.289> any

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
and one of the major expenses with any

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.500 
and one of the major expenses with any
facility<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.130> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.399> be<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> energy<00:00:32.820> costs

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
facility is going to be the energy costs

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.590 
facility is going to be the energy costs
and<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.559> anything<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.219> do<00:00:35.370> there<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
and so anything you can do there to to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.750 
and so anything you can do there to to
help<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.160> very<00:00:38.520> positive

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
help with that is is a very positive

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.450 
help with that is is a very positive
thing<00:00:39.059> energy<00:00:39.899> efficiency<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> very

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
thing energy efficiency is is a very

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
thing energy efficiency is is a very
good<00:00:41.670> investment<00:00:42.149> when<00:00:42.180> times<00:00:42.510> are<00:00:42.719> tight<00:00:42.899> one

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
good investment when times are tight one

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.900 
good investment when times are tight one
of<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> things<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.190> happening<00:00:44.430> is

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
of the things that we see happening is

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.110 
of the things that we see happening is
some<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.719> payback<00:00:46.260> periods<00:00:46.739> are

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
some of the payback periods are

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.970 
some of the payback periods are
shortening<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.629> misnomer<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.590> our

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
shortening the one misnomer that our

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.979 
shortening the one misnomer that our
customers<00:00:50.610> are<00:00:50.910> stuck<00:00:51.300> with<00:00:51.449> out<00:00:51.629> there<00:00:51.809> today

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
customers are stuck with out there today

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.020 
customers are stuck with out there today
is<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.590> costs<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:53.190> lot<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.760> green

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
is that it costs a lot to be green

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.700 
is that it costs a lot to be green
and/or<00:00:54.390> energy<00:00:54.780> efficient<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.649> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and/or energy efficient in it and it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.380 
and/or energy efficient in it and it
really<00:00:55.949> doesn't<00:00:56.280> there's<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> lot<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.210> things

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
really doesn't there's a lot of things

that you can do that don't cost a lot of

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.099 
that you can do that don't cost a lot of
money<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:00.059> can<00:01:00.300> save<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.690> lot<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.870> energy

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
money and can save you a lot of energy

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.009 
money and can save you a lot of energy
changing<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.039> control<00:01:02.460> strategy<00:01:03.090> doesn't<00:01:03.660> cost

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
changing a control strategy doesn't cost

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.660 
changing a control strategy doesn't cost
a<00:01:04.199> lot<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.379> money<00:01:04.470> generally<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.430> might

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
a lot of money generally it might

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.730 
a lot of money generally it might
already<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> very<00:01:06.659> good<00:01:06.869> control<00:01:07.080> system

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
already have a very good control system

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.679 
already have a very good control system
installed<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.700> they<00:01:08.790> haven't<00:01:09.030> set<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.240> up<00:01:09.450> for

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
installed but they haven't set it up for

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.780 
installed but they haven't set it up for
you<00:01:09.810> well<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.710> know<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:11.010> takes<00:01:11.220> us<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.520> modify

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
you well you know it takes us to modify

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.090 
you well you know it takes us to modify
the<00:01:11.970> schedules<00:01:12.780> actual<00:01:13.140> programming<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
the schedules actual programming in the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.710 
the schedules actual programming in the
system<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> right<00:01:15.150> things<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
system to do the right things for the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.380 
system to do the right things for the
building<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.860> we're<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.610> some<00:01:17.880> cases<00:01:18.090> it's

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
building so we're not in some cases it's

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.230 
building so we're not in some cases it's
not<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.659> huge<00:01:19.110> expense<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.890> do<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
not a huge expense to do that but the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.899 
not a huge expense to do that but the
benefit<00:01:21.689> from<00:01:21.810> doing<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:23.700> be

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
benefit from doing that can can be

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.210 
benefit from doing that can can be
tremendous<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.380> best<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.710> look<00:01:25.830> at<00:01:25.979> some<00:01:26.130> of

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
tremendous it's best to look at some of

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.530 
tremendous it's best to look at some of
the<00:01:26.280> major<00:01:26.460> systems<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.090> building<00:01:27.390> like

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the major systems in the building like

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.660 
the major systems in the building like
lighting<00:01:28.290> air<00:01:29.220> conditioning<00:01:29.850> heating<00:01:30.619> water

lighting air conditioning heating water

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.490 
lighting air conditioning heating water
we<00:01:32.670> want<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.060> make<00:01:33.570> sure<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.140> when<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
we want to make sure that when a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.190 
we want to make sure that when a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
building is not occupied for example we

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.870 
building is not occupied for example we
don't<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.680> maintain<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.280> same<00:01:38.430> comfort

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
don't have to maintain the same comfort
