did you first get into building guitars

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.030 
did you first get into building guitars
I'm<00:00:38.880> very<00:00:39.060> inspired<00:00:39.510> by<00:00:39.720> guitar<00:00:40.410> shapes<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
I'm very inspired by guitar shapes and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040 
I'm very inspired by guitar shapes and
designs<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.670> tones<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.360> can't<00:00:42.630> afford<00:00:42.720> to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
designs and tones and I can't afford to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.740 
designs and tones and I can't afford to
own<00:00:43.170> 20<00:00:43.590> or<00:00:43.710> 25<00:00:44.130> guitars<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.970> I<00:00:45.239> thought<00:00:45.690> maybe

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
own 20 or 25 guitars so I thought maybe

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.479 
own 20 or 25 guitars so I thought maybe
I<00:00:46.080> could<00:00:46.140> give<00:00:46.380> it<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:46.650> building<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.340> guitar

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
I could give it a go building a guitar

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.479 
I could give it a go building a guitar
so<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.330> used<00:00:48.809> my<00:00:48.930> cabinetmaking<00:00:49.710> skills<00:00:49.890> which

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.330 

I<00:02:06.939> guess<00:02:07.299> I<00:02:07.420> see<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.659> piece<00:02:07.960> of<00:02:07.990> wood<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.890> then

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.400 
I guess I see a piece of wood and then
let's<00:02:09.819> see<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.060> guitar<00:02:10.509> in<00:02:10.539> that<00:02:10.869> piece<00:02:11.080> of<00:02:11.260> wood

let's see a guitar in that piece of wood
and<00:02:11.830> I'm<00:02:11.980> inspired<00:02:12.459> by<00:02:12.580> something<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.540> comes

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
and I'm inspired by something that comes

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.100 
and I'm inspired by something that comes
in<00:02:14.020> i<00:02:14.140> might<00:02:14.380> get<00:02:14.700> 40<00:02:15.700> or<00:02:15.790> 50<00:02:16.090> maple<00:02:16.540> tops<00:02:16.810> in

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
example of that and start here I saw

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.390 
example of that and start here I saw
this<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.569> saw<00:02:31.959> this<00:02:32.140> piece<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:32.620> wood<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:33.190> just

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
this I saw this piece of wood and I just

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.979 
this I saw this piece of wood and I just
knew<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.640> with<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.090> right<00:02:34.269> saying<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.840> might

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
knew that with the right saying it might

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.979 
knew that with the right saying it might
look<00:02:35.170> like<00:02:35.230> water<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.489> shark<00:02:37.269> inlays<00:02:37.690> a

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
look like water so shark inlays a

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.190 
look like water so shark inlays a
hammerhead<00:02:38.560> asshole<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:40.239> could<00:02:40.780> just<00:02:40.930> see

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
hammerhead asshole and I could just see

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.759 
hammerhead asshole and I could just see
the<00:02:41.470> guitar<00:02:41.890> in<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.730> wood<00:02:43.019> as<00:02:44.019> soon<00:02:44.319> as<00:02:44.349> i<00:02:44.590> got

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
the guitar in the wood as soon as i got

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.229 
the guitar in the wood as soon as i got
that<00:02:44.950> piece<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.160> wood<00:02:45.459> in<00:02:45.580> its<00:02:45.730> rough<00:02:45.940> form

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
that piece of wood in its rough form

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.900 
that piece of wood in its rough form
into<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.569> factory<00:02:46.930> and

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
into the factory and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.840 
into the factory and
I<00:02:47.970> guess<00:02:48.660> that's<00:02:48.870> how<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.050> came<00:02:49.110> out<00:02:49.730> most<00:02:50.730> of

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
I guess that's how it came out most of

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.640 
I guess that's how it came out most of
the<00:02:50.910> time<00:02:51.120> my<00:02:51.330> clients<00:02:51.810> come<00:02:51.990> in<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.290> they<00:02:52.410> see

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
the time my clients come in and they see

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.890 
the time my clients come in and they see
something<00:02:52.920> in<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.160> wood<00:02:53.370> or<00:02:53.970> they've<00:02:54.570> got<00:02:54.780> an

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
something in the wood or they've got an

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.560 
something in the wood or they've got an
idea<00:02:55.320> in<00:02:55.500> there<00:02:55.650> in<00:02:55.830> their<00:02:56.010> mind<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:57.150> they've

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
idea in there in their mind that they've

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.480 
idea in there in their mind that they've
been<00:02:57.750> wanting<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.080> work<00:02:58.230> one<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:58.680> if<00:02:59.250> it's

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.250 
been wanting to work one but if it's
broke<00:02:59.790> if<00:03:00.030> I'm<00:03:00.480> building<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.900> guitar<00:03:01.050> for

how<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.680> build<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.100> guitar<00:03:32.460> and<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:32.670> think<00:03:32.880> it

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
how to build a guitar and I think it

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.720 
how to build a guitar and I think it
needs<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.390> be<00:03:33.510> done<00:03:33.720> there's<00:03:34.680> no<00:03:34.860> real<00:03:35.160> secrets

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
needs to be done there's no real secrets

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.510 
needs to be done there's no real secrets
for<00:03:36.720> some<00:03:36.960> reason<00:03:37.350> all<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.860> guitar<00:03:38.220> makers

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
for some reason all the guitar makers

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.580 
for some reason all the guitar makers
want<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.790> have<00:03:38.910> their<00:03:39.090> secrets<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:40.050> think

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
want to have their secrets and I think

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.290 
want to have their secrets and I think
sharing<00:03:41.280> information<00:03:41.520> is<00:03:41.940> more<00:03:42.120> beneficial

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
sharing information is more beneficial

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.460 
sharing information is more beneficial
than<00:03:42.750> hiding<00:03:43.200> back

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
than hiding back

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.610 
than hiding back
let's<00:03:46.310> all<00:03:46.460> open<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:47.060> all<00:03:47.210> up<00:03:47.240> and<00:03:47.600> tell<00:03:48.500> the

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
guys how they're made and maybe it might

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.900 
guys how they're made and maybe it might
inspire<00:03:51.410> someone<00:03:52.010> else<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.430> get<00:03:52.550> out<00:03:52.730> there

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910
