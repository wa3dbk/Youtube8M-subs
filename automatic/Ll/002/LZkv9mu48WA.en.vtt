00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 in this rough game broadcast 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.450
 pointed tv we have reviews of zombies 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.450
 from domique raid and from kate we started 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.639
 welcome to the city of london good 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.930
 what is left of it are be you 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.849
 put in the shoes of some 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.650
 survivor who is guided to the 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.599
 subway tunnels by the voice of a 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.910
 subject that monitors the city through 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.950
 security cameras there are two ways 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.019
 of playing with only one survivor or with 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.519
 several is to say that when one succumbs 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.619
 before the bites of the dead 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.330
 living 'the game can start from 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.739
 where he stayed with another created character 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.390
 randomly 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.890
 the funny thing is that when they return to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.110
 where they died will have to fight 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.940
 against his previous character meaning 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.190
 and give it down with the backpack and the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.110
 objects that brought things in first 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.330
 person and the gamepad screen is 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.580
 used to see the map administer 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.500
 inventories and change weapons as well 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.540
 to analyze environments and shoot with 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.280
 certain weapons maybe the story is not 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.869
 very complex but the catastrophe is 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.000
 ideal pretext for moving under 

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:01.530
 land at different times looking for 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.210
 supplies and fulfilling missions 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.920
 diverse how to hack cameras for 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.290
 observe other points of the city the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.570
 game retakes key elements of others and 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.830
 combines them for example if they sound 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.659
 an alarm the zombies will arrive 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.520
 running to devour the ones like let for 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.860
 dead or there are times in a space 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.450
 quiet suddenly jump to a body 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.430
 taking it out is a scare comparable with 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.290
 those of the first old racing 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.300
 what is not so nice about the game is that 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.430
 It is repetitive and many things 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.960
 they come back from trial and error as well as 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.820
 it has graphics that do not look so good 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.890
 mixed with others who do take advantage of 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.720
 high definition additionally there is mode 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.550
 for two people facing the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.320
 player with the gamepad puts zombies like 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.300
 the strategy title and the other 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.370
 survives aiming with a wing rides the 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.740
 screen is two soups with this title 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.260
 of launch for wii or do they love it or what 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.840
 they hate the score of point tv 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.840
 for zombie you is 7.3 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.890
 in front he returns but in his early years 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.300
 when he still does not know his inheritance 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.580
 demoniac is a teenager 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.410
 rampant with attitude problems and 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.330
 vices so many feared that their 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.100
 appearance to some extent we have given 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.140
 to know in the advances will affect the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.300
 game those fears are left behind when 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.640
 one puts the hands to the control well 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.290
 continued weak macray is all that one 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.750
 can expect from a game of the series and 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.120
 more be completely respect the style 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.190
 apart from that it feels cool both in 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.110
 art as in combat there are new types of 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.030
 abominations to overcome as well as new 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.740
 weapons that get better as they go and 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.780
 that are at the level of his classic sword 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.910
 and his ebony and ivory pistols the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.530
 gameplay from the game mode the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.540
 fight against demons by pressing buttons 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.980
 and making spectacular flakes 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.500
 also having surrealist scenarios 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.060
 that represent riddles by themselves 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.340
 in which you will have to use different 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.320
 types of hook in case it was not enough 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.480
 story is from alex garland novelist and 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.760
 screenwriter of movies like 28 days 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.130
 then the beach and sun chain so 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.080
 has all the vibe in limbo city a 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.180
 guy called call riders who controls 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.950
 the world from its tower even threatens 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.780
 the president with tearing down the economy 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.710
 only someone as evil as the devil 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.470
 could have 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.630
 of power and now goes back before throwing 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.970
 attacks in limbo a parallel environment 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.230
 but dante is not alone is adopted by 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.510
 a resistance and protest group 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.580
 commanded by version and its ally cat 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.680
 who reveal their origin to you 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.900
 Uncle line developers made him 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.680
 a great job the qualification of 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.680
 play point tv for tve cry is 9.5 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.760
 the creator of games like monkey island 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.980
 and mansion presents a formidable 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.690
 downloadable adventure called the cave in 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.910
 which they can choose to participate as 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.710
 seven different characters the traveler in 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.600
 time the twins the gentleman the 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.250
 scientist the farmer the adventuress and 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.350
 the monk each one of them with 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.030
 characteristic skills for example 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.950
 the knight can use his armor to 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.660
 protect yourself from fire and other hazards 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.460
 while the traveler in time 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.500
 can move across certain 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.210
 obstacles the mythical cave has seen the 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.100
 over the years since the appearance of 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.140
 humanity and for each one encloses 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.700
 what you most want in life but in that 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.770
 search maybe discover horrible 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.990
 secrets like the ones we all have the 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.970
 Knight wants a legendary sword and 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.220
 the monk spiritual peace although that 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.020
 means to eliminate your mentor the script 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.120
 It's fabulous with a sense of humor 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.740
 unique while designing levels 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.480
 varies according to the characters that 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.730
 select there are sections that appear 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.380
 for all and others customized for 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.239
 Each tour can go with three 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.220
 characters so there are reasons to 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.440
 play several times and participation 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.090
 it's pretty balanced, it's not like those 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.130
 titles that can end up using almost 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.810
 all the time in the same way the adventure 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.670
 remember those of looking for objects 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.410
 to solve riddles of yesteryear 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.810
 but without dialogue menus but more 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.520
 focused exploration and maybe think the 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.250
 horizontal advance graphics do not 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.290
 seem novel but believe in cave 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.510
 is the most original that you will see in years 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.640
 the rating of plays point tv for 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.640
 the cave is 9.2
