 we are with the second rhythm 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:05.439

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.689
 wonderful claudio cosano of things and 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:11.049

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.440
 the peinadito of verónica bevacqua and the 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.479

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.990
 told his talk with marcelo 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.850
 she raised her prejudices 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.710
 you had some prejudice at the time of 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.929
 to be like participating for one thing is 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.039
 your work is as an announcer and others are 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.840
 in pencil is that I can not have 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.009
 prejudice angel because he flew and that at 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.009
 I am a panelist for the program 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.259
 against the program I say for yourself 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.299
 as I will expose my clothes not 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.380
 you know what is and what happens that good 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.179
 there is part of my body that I do not want 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.590
 show and I'm not going to show it equal 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.229
 every way I already made a front one 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.940
 first entry showing my breasts 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.280
 essence to begin with to begin with 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.810
 to start but no no no no I did not put 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.380
 the parameters do not even see it a 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.369
 little bit 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.360
 that is all we have talked with 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.310
 marcelo I have not spoken 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.900
 of text messages in very little and 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.340
 nothing to do a second instance 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.380
 complicated also that is your job 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.660
 as a panelist of everything that exists in 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.910
 obviously infamous as a mine that 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.950
 have a weight opinion and you are hard sometimes 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.170
 and surely with some you're going to 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.340
 grab everything that is here in 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.920
 chest to the bullets looks and as you 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.180
 it matters nothing so fat is perhaps that 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.620
 happens is that when one talks about life 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.210
 the other has to endure that they get 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.790
 in one's life 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:31.250
 nothing while it is not a thing that is 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.480
 as one would say a misplaced if a 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.550
 word nothing that we said and 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.650
 to feel tax-free that is not 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.420
 misplaced good one will try to locate it 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.400
 but I'm not going to the fight I'm not going to the 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.980

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.780

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.900

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.300
 the participants of the 20 plus 5 plus 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.130
