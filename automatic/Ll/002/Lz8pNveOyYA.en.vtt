00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello all alexis says hello my golf 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.690
 is the white dot came out like 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.760
 I can try to treat the white point 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.950
 to the blows you should put in first 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.599
 place the temperature to no less than 23 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.179
 degrees and if you're not going to remove the filter 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.310
 apply sea salt or natural salt without me 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.130
 give where the small spoon every 4 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.289
 liters every 12 hours until completing the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.060
 three doses then we will leave the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.890
 aquarium for a week or so 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.779
 on the first day there will surely be a 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.699
 white dot expression but starting 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.320
 of the second day of treatment will begin 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.640
 to disappear once the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.559
 treatment makes a good change of 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.149
 water that does not affect the temperature and 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.530
 you also have to say that if you would be 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.360
 willing to remove the filter from 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.980
 more potent medicines that contain 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.690
 malachite green meanwhile the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.730
 filter should be working outside 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.920
 of the aquarium in a bucket or in another aquarium 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.719
 Elena says hello friend sorry no 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.760
 know your name but I just started to see 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.770
 your videos on youtube because I'm interested 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.379
 start my aquarium so I start 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.570
 introducing me I am elena and I live in the month 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.859
 from mexico and I would like to know what kind 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.809
 of fish to have in my aquarium and 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.370
 mainly that they do not grow much and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.290
 Also what literal do you recommend 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.119
 because I want to put my work for 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.780
 relax but I do not have much 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.240
 space 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.290
 ante sent a thousand thanks for your answer 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.479
 value in the advice you give me 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.400
 Greetings and until very soon friend for 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.259
 the characteristics that you ask for support 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.940
 of 60 liters would be as comfortable as 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.350
 can have several types of times the 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.450
 Weekly water changes are easy 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.070
 between 20 and 30 liters and the cleaning is 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.930
 very simple of both the aquarium and the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.880
 filter in smaller aquariums that is 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.950
 with adults , everything would become complicated 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.810
 little more times to start in this type 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.000
 of aquariums are the good and the children 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.430
 pose and runners that are the most 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.200
 simple always without exceeding 7 or 8 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.060
 maximum fish make sure you do not 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.679
 they have white point always before 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.570
 put them in the aquarium and such is always 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.160
 something more than flake food to be 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.649
 possible by adding live food or 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.690
 frozen and other varieties for fish 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.970
 do it says hello jose to my aquarium I'm going 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.770
 to buy a lid with lamps and the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.050
 lamps are lit in the day or in the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.149
 night and how many hours thanks 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.679
 beforehand and I wait for your answer the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.479
 lighting in aquariums of course 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.399
 it must be from day to night never and at 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.619
 principle of putting it on you should turn on 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.020
 maximum about 5 hours and then every two 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.819
 days or so go up half an hour or something 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.829
 more until it is completed in 8 hours 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.049
 especially if you have plants 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.520
 jorge martÃ­nez says hello jose started to 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.710
 watch 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.320
 and I have a doubt because some plants 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.240
 of aquarium burn at the edges is the 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.220
 plant that is on the right many 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.550
 thank you and I have served the rest of your 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.350
 videos greetings from colombia how to download 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.030
 the ph naturally as well as 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.100
 You explained the hardness with the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.260
 egg shells thousand thanks from 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.820
 Colombia I have purchased an exterior filter 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.760
 but I do not know how to install it in my aquarium 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.800
 of 213 liters could you help me and many 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.660
 thanks for your videos for the plants 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.690
 you need to tell me the names 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.740
 to know your needs 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.720
 surely they are more delicate and 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.030
 demanding ones that are getting ugly 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.040
 that they would need a good lawyer changes 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.080
 of water more frequent and perhaps if they are 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.910
 very demanding co2 I would start by 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.380
 pay a little bit with some option that 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.150
 they have in stores but they also 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.910
 I say that I do not know the plant and in case 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.190
 from outside or from lie and 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.900
 the rest of plants follow perfect I do not 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.150
 I would take nothing else to download 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.130
 the ph there are three forms the first the most 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.200
 face and the best is using filters 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.480
 osmosis the second cheapest but not 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.070
 So effective is putting peat in the center 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.350
 also indian almond leaves in the 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.640
 aquarium many trunks and plants and the 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.890
 third way less 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.660
 it would be with chemicals about the installation 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.910
 of the filter is quite simple simply 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.069
 clean it well beforehand and then 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.380
 fill it with the three main loads 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.630
 canutillos the sponge and hair 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.069
 water filled are placed safely 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.020
 the tubes through which the water enters 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.240
 filter and the tube where it comes out but 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.920
 always get air at the beginning and to 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.900
 avoiding it is the least possible 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.700
 it is best to fill the filter completely 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.530
 Water is important that never 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.150
 empty plug because they spoil like 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.260
 we do not know what filter is it either 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.780
 I could say much more 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.910
 Carlos says that my friend already with the 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.070
 new cycle in progress I came up a 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.020
 little problem with plants puts a 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.090
 little the roots and I planted them again 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.650
 but they have taken a not very good look 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.600
 the leaves have been put almost 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.730
 transparent and I do not know what to do to make 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.350
 improve I have fertilized with pills and 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.920
 I hope they get better thanks for your 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.350
 tips 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.540
 I almost finished the cycle and I'm already 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.610
 thinking about buying the fish which ones 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.620
 you recommend to start the water here 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.390
 I think it's normal I have a 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.250
 water heater and I want to buy more 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.870
 of a variety of times also 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.730
 I would like some of those who clean the 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.680
 aquarium background that I do not remember now 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.450
 how are they called good thanks for your 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.580
 Tips that are always welcome 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.260
 first your plants denote 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.270
 lack of various types of nutrients 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.910
 like potassium iron in nitrogen 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.650
 co2 and others but let's definitely 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.600
 it exists well in paying they will also be 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.450
 necessary abundant water changes 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.580
 50% weekly or 25 percent two 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.710
 times in a week in fact you could even 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.420
 make 25 percent every three or 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.770
 four days and I'm sure that shortly 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.720
 will start to know buds though 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.670
 clearly some of the plants already 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.560
 they are unrecoverable I would also tell you 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.360
 add more gravel and if you can in 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.250
 its place a nutritious substrate of the 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.990
 that do not need to be covered up if you have not 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.700
 still got a stability in the 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.530
 aquarium with plants is better not 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.690
 put fish still to have the aquarium 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.430
 controlled one hundred percent however 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.230
 I do not know how many liters it has and it does not 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.210
 I could say how many fish you put 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.860
 if the water is of average type as you say 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.930
 You could put a variety of fish 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.430
 but if you're going to put them 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.020
 hours while you do not have the aquarium 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.970
 controlled one hundred percent could you 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.310
 start with the easiest fish like 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.320
 the whoopi or the zebras the children the 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.180
 plantes and brokers if you like 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.250
 for the fund we have already finished with the 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.840
 questions but before we go I'm going to 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.950
 show you how I have the 60-year-old aquarium 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.990
 liters that is 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.490
 and you have not forgotten I had started 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.350
 have some seaweed and then it 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.090
 apply a recess to the hours of light 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.190
 daily how it worked so well 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.350
 would like to teach oslo so if any 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.050
 day you need it apply to your 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.360
 aquarium if you do not remember many leaves 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.820
 of those that you are seeing were full 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.480
 of seaweed 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.480
 but now 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.740
 they have lost all the algae less 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:06:00.530
 some leaves that have fallen to them the 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.760
 more reticent algae but good that already 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:06.930
 It is normal 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.850
 that is what one of the worst 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.849
 the green half and the half have been left 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.589
 with seaweed 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.779
 for the moment one stuck in no snail 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:17.360
 zebra as I said earlier and good 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:18.919
 it seems that everything is perfectly 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.379
 fox's tail is also doing its 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:24.259
 you should know by now that this 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:26.509
 plant and nor of the algae that although not 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.929
 it is so clear why it is true that 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.929
 works 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.590
 finally we have finished but you 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.449
 I remember that you have me work in the 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.190
 description on twitter and on facebook in 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.770
 my other channels in the video game 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.229
 the underworld of guitars scream 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.539
 Alone hd as you are very cherubs 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:46.669
 we are already very close to 4,000 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.320
 every day you are faster but I do not come to 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.340
 tell you about numbers I just wanted to 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.740
 tell people that the time has come
