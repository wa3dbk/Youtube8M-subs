one of our carpets to protect it a

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.190 
one of our carpets to protect it a

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
some scrap pieces of wood so I can use

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.250 
some scrap pieces of wood so I can use
to<00:03:18.409> put<00:03:18.590> those<00:03:18.709> on<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.549> edges<00:03:20.109> so<00:03:21.109> that<00:03:21.139> the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
to put those on the edges so that the

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.250 
to put those on the edges so that the
clamps<00:03:21.590> don't<00:03:21.950> damage<00:03:22.389> the<00:03:23.389> table<00:03:23.599> at<00:03:23.870> all<00:03:23.989> and

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
clamps don't damage the table at all and

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.280 
clamps don't damage the table at all and
better<00:03:24.769> hold<00:03:25.609> the<00:03:26.510> splinter<00:03:27.019> in<00:03:27.260> place<00:03:28.930> so<00:03:29.930> my

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
better hold the splinter in place so my

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.460 
better hold the splinter in place so my
plan<00:03:30.590> is<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:31.040> try<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.340> get<00:03:31.549> this<00:03:31.730> splinter<00:03:32.470> to

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
plan is to try to get this splinter to

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.300 
plan is to try to get this splinter to
lay<00:03:33.739> flat<00:03:34.489> so<00:03:35.209> they<00:03:35.329> can<00:03:35.540> then<00:03:35.799> sand<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:37.280> top

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
lay flat so they can then sand the top

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.319 
lay flat so they can then sand the top
of<00:03:37.730> this<00:03:38.139> Andry<00:03:39.139> varnish<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:39.829> this<00:03:40.790> underneath

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
of this Andry varnish it this underneath

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.399 
of this Andry varnish it this underneath
here<00:03:42.970> leads<00:03:43.970> me<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.209> believe<00:03:44.389> that<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.989> table

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
here leads me to believe that the table

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.319 
here leads me to believe that the table
was<00:03:45.530> actually<00:03:45.970> shut<00:03:46.970> on<00:03:47.209> something<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.019> so<00:03:48.799> it

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
was actually shut on something and so it

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.879 
was actually shut on something and so it
drove<00:03:50.329> up<00:03:50.569> into<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.930> table<00:03:51.349> and<00:03:51.500> then<00:03:51.620> caused

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
drove up into the table and then caused

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.240 
drove up into the table and then caused
a<00:03:52.069> splinter<00:03:52.489> to<00:03:52.879> come<00:03:53.120> out<00:03:53.950> this<00:03:54.950> is<00:03:55.159> the

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
a splinter to come out this is the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.619 
a splinter to come out this is the
underside<00:03:55.609> of<00:03:55.639> the<00:03:55.760> table<00:03:56.209> and<00:03:56.359> it's<00:03:56.450> never

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
underside of the table and it's never

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.809 
underside of the table and it's never
seen<00:03:57.019> so<00:03:57.680> I<00:03:57.709> don't<00:03:57.889> really<00:03:57.980> care<00:03:58.129> what<00:03:58.609> this

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
seen so I don't really care what this

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.939 
seen so I don't really care what this
looks<00:03:59.060> like<00:03:59.150> but<00:03:59.540> this<00:03:59.690> top<00:03:59.959> edge<00:04:00.229> is<00:04:00.560> what<00:04:00.859> is

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:00.949 
looks like but this top edge is what is

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.250 
looks like but this top edge is what is
seen<00:04:01.159> all<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.400> time<00:04:01.639> when<00:04:02.629> the<00:04:02.720> table<00:04:03.019> is<00:04:03.139> in

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
seen all the time when the table is in

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.170 
seen all the time when the table is in
the<00:04:03.379> down<00:04:03.560> position<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:04.400> I<00:04:04.430> want<00:04:04.760> to<00:04:04.819> make<00:04:04.970> sure

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
the down position so I want to make sure

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.210 
the down position so I want to make sure
that<00:04:05.419> we<00:04:05.540> can<00:04:05.690> make<00:04:05.840> this<00:04:06.019> look<00:04:06.229> as<00:04:06.680> best<00:04:07.040> as

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
that we can make this look as best as

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.809 
that we can make this look as best as
possible<00:04:07.810> worst-case<00:04:08.810> scenario<00:04:09.319> I<00:04:09.639> guess<00:04:10.639> we

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
possible worst-case scenario I guess we

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.020 
possible worst-case scenario I guess we
could

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
could

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.620 
could
sanded<00:04:12.810> this<00:04:12.900> down<00:04:13.760> you<00:04:14.760> know<00:04:14.940> so<00:04:15.150> it's<00:04:15.330> a<00:04:15.420> lot

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
sanded this down you know so it's a lot

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.130 
sanded this down you know so it's a lot
thinner<00:04:15.930> maybe<00:04:16.350> take<00:04:16.590> off<00:04:16.769> about<00:04:16.980> I<00:04:18.140> don't

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
thinner maybe take off about I don't

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.650 
thinner maybe take off about I don't
know<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.560> little<00:04:20.190> less<00:04:20.340> than<00:04:20.609> 1/4<00:04:20.880> inch<00:04:21.209> or<00:04:21.420> so

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
know a little less than 1/4 inch or so

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.980 
know a little less than 1/4 inch or so
and<00:04:22.530> then<00:04:23.370> revarnished<00:04:23.850> it<00:04:24.150> but<00:04:24.780> I'm<00:04:24.870> gonna

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
and then revarnished it but I'm gonna

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.990 
and then revarnished it but I'm gonna
try<00:04:25.230> to<00:04:25.320> avoid<00:04:25.620> doing<00:04:25.890> that<00:04:26.130> make<00:04:26.640> it<00:04:26.760> look<00:04:26.880> as

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
try to avoid doing that make it look as

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.480 
try to avoid doing that make it look as
best<00:04:27.180> as<00:04:27.330> we<00:04:27.360> can
