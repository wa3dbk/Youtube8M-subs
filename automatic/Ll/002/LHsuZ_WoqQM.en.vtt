that's bad news for you if you join a

with hard thing you know 100 isn't

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.060 
with hard thing you know 100 isn't
always<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.880> ping<00:01:27.600> I'm<00:01:27.720> getting<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.110> game<00:01:28.320> so

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
always the ping I'm getting in game so

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.310 
always the ping I'm getting in game so
why<00:01:29.220> why<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.479> get<00:01:30.810> stuck<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
why why you know get stuck on that

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.380 
why why you know get stuck on that
should<00:01:31.590> change<00:01:31.770> around<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.939> they<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.180> two

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
should change around so they have two

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.179 
should change around so they have two
lines<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.750> code<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.200> put<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.530> your<00:01:34.829> game

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
just go with it and you should just put

you don't have ping you have latency

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.639 
you don't have ping you have latency
layin<00:01:54.240> see<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.630> how<00:01:54.780> long<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.320> takes

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
layin see is how long it takes

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.590 
layin see is how long it takes

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.330

just<00:02:00.420> how<00:02:00.570> much<00:02:00.780> time<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.259> takes<00:02:01.409> for

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
just how much time it takes for

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.280 
just how much time it takes for
information<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.969> go<00:02:03.090> from<00:02:03.390> your<00:02:03.750> computer<00:02:04.170> to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360

at<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.540> server<00:02:06.780> browser

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
at the server browser

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.830 
at the server browser
and<00:02:08.640> put<00:02:09.640> in<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.850> average<00:02:10.000> ping<00:02:10.450> of<00:02:10.660> the

and put in the average ping of the
server<00:02:11.110> you're<00:02:11.230> joining<00:02:11.560> for<00:02:11.950> me<00:02:12.070> it's<00:02:12.250> about

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
server you're joining for me it's about

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.500 
server you're joining for me it's about
30<00:02:12.820> so<00:02:13.270> i<00:02:13.770> put<00:02:14.770> in<00:02:14.860> 34<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.400> there's<00:02:16.210> a<00:02:16.300> little

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
30 so i put in 34 that there's a little

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.530 
30 so i put in 34 that there's a little
bit<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:16.720> decimal<00:02:17.170> involved<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:18.510> 0.03<00:02:19.510> i

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
bit of decimal involved so 0.03 i

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.590 
bit of decimal involved so 0.03 i
believe<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:21.040> just<00:02:21.250> try<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.520> out<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:22.300> can<00:02:22.330> see

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
believe you just try it out you can see

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.510 
believe you just try it out you can see

that fix and I feel like my shots are

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.940 
that fix and I feel like my shots are
connecting<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.360> hell<00:02:28.570> of<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.720> lot<00:02:28.870> more<00:02:28.950> it's

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
connecting a hell of a lot more it's

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.040 
connecting a hell of a lot more it's

difference for them some people say it

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.590 
difference for them some people say it
hasn't<00:02:50.920> who<00:02:51.670> knows<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:52.060> could<00:02:52.090> just<00:02:52.300> be<00:02:52.420> the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
hasn't who knows it could just be the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.440 
hasn't who knows it could just be the
placebo<00:02:53.110> bag<00:02:53.410> yeah<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.709> have<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.070> gain<00:02:54.250> more<00:02:54.520> to

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
placebo bag yeah I have to gain more to

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.850 
placebo bag yeah I have to gain more to
see<00:02:55.600> if<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.750> makes<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:56.020> difference<00:02:56.050> but<00:02:56.650> I

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
see if it makes a difference but I

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.500 
see if it makes a difference but I
thought<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.459> was<00:02:57.520> good<00:02:57.760> since<00:02:58.030> I'm<00:02:58.209> just<00:02:58.360> going

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
thought it was good since I'm just going

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.540 
thought it was good since I'm just going
to<00:02:58.540> talk<00:02:58.720> about<00:02:58.870> hit<00:02:59.080> boxes<00:02:59.440> in<00:02:59.620> general<00:03:00.010> it's

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
to talk about hit boxes in general it's

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.910 
to talk about hit boxes in general it's
been<00:03:00.730> an<00:03:00.850> improvement<00:03:01.120> but<00:03:01.600> not<00:03:02.380> enough<00:03:02.709> you

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
been an improvement but not enough you

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.190 
been an improvement but not enough you
know<00:03:03.010> but<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:03.940> have<00:03:04.090> faith<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.360> ice<00:03:04.690> they're

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
know but I have faith and ice they're

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.290 
know but I have faith and ice they're
working<00:03:05.590> pretty<00:03:05.800> hard<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:07.000> know<00:03:07.090> they've

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
working pretty hard you know they've

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.650 
working pretty hard you know they've
they've<00:03:08.050> had<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.520> r9<00:03:09.520> servers<00:03:09.970> coming<00:03:10.300> out<00:03:10.450> and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
they've had a r9 servers coming out and

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.750 
they've had a r9 servers coming out and
I<00:03:11.110> think<00:03:11.410> I'd<00:03:11.530> release<00:03:11.830> we<00:03:12.010> only<00:03:12.160> had<00:03:12.340> our<00:03:12.489> five

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
I think I'd release we only had our five

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.729

it<00:04:52.090> would<00:04:52.240> be<00:04:52.390> good<00:04:52.570> if<00:04:52.630> guys<00:04:52.960> just<00:04:53.290> made<00:04:53.470> it

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
it would be good if guys just made it

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.180 
it would be good if guys just made it
kind<00:04:53.740> of<00:04:53.830> fair<00:04:54.100> and<00:04:54.360> on<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.600> other<00:04:55.720> hand<00:04:56.190> the

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
kind of fair and on the other hand the

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.990 
kind of fair and on the other hand the
u.s.<00:04:57.550> space<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:58.240> has<00:04:58.480> a<00:04:58.720> son<00:04:59.110> right<00:04:59.320> behind<00:04:59.650> it

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
u.s. space it has a son right behind it

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.790 
u.s. space it has a son right behind it
so<00:05:01.000> when<00:05:01.210> you're<00:05:01.330> flying<00:05:01.570> a<00:05:01.780> chopper<00:05:02.230> towards

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
so when you're flying a chopper towards

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.680 
so when you're flying a chopper towards
the<00:05:02.860> US<00:05:03.130> base<00:05:03.310> you're<00:05:03.550> blinded<00:05:04.120> not<00:05:04.360> just<00:05:04.570> by

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
the US base you're blinded not just by

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.520 
the US base you're blinded not just by
the<00:05:04.720> vehicles<00:05:05.560> view<00:05:05.770> but<00:05:06.010> also<00:05:06.090> also<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.210> Sun

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
the vehicles view but also also the Sun

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.230 
the vehicles view but also also the Sun
the<00:05:08.530> American<00:05:09.520> forces<00:05:09.820> don't<00:05:10.000> have<00:05:10.090> that

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
the American forces don't have that

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.300 
the American forces don't have that
problem<00:05:10.360> is<00:05:11.260> it's<00:05:11.620> not<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:11.770> big<00:05:11.950> deal<00:05:11.980> you<00:05:12.280> know

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
problem is it's not a big deal you know

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.770 
problem is it's not a big deal you know
you<00:05:12.460> switch<00:05:12.820> around<00:05:12.970> you<00:05:13.330> play<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.660> other

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
you switch around you play the other

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.990 
you switch around you play the other
side<00:05:14.110> but<00:05:14.350> still<00:05:14.650> I<00:05:14.890> mean<00:05:15.130> every<00:05:15.700> time<00:05:15.880> you

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
side but still I mean every time you

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.520 
side but still I mean every time you
play<00:05:16.150> that<00:05:16.360> map<00:05:16.570> it<00:05:16.780> should<00:05:16.900> be<00:05:16.960> fair<00:05:17.320> for<00:05:17.350> both

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
play that map it should be fair for both

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.310 
play that map it should be fair for both
sides<00:05:17.920> so<00:05:18.760> it's<00:05:18.940> just<00:05:19.090> a<00:05:19.180> thought<00:05:19.360> it's<00:05:20.080> not<00:05:20.290> a

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
sides so it's just a thought it's not a

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.980 
sides so it's just a thought it's not a
big<00:05:20.890> problem<00:05:20.920> they<00:05:21.430> can<00:05:21.610> fix<00:05:21.790> it<00:05:22.000> I<00:05:22.180> hope

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
big problem they can fix it I hope

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.320
