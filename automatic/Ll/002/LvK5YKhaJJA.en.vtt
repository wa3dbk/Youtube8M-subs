00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.030
 so welcome on my desktop today for a change 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.940
 I'm here to help with a small excerpt of it 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.529
 I am already a great new intake Zoffel 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.190
 I'm glad that I got that soft 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.929
 because today the network becomes drives 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.519
 and about the little one 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.349
 our casual safety warnings as of May was the role of a blender 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.509
 which uses the often brings always if you as a user system Giggs 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.490
 Playoffs Service Pack 2 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.340
 or 3's 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.930
 for the 3rd 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.690
 if we're not so sure about it, the lower right also affects the clock 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.710
 that had all the small fields post 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.610
 This is going to be a lot but she saw through Windows XP Service Pack 3 with but 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.179
 with Vista and 7 as well as sea areas small security alerts though 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.750
 you had wanted to run their executable files on your network drive 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.929
 his last path is then usually a calculator 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.589
 he knows very well himself most of the time not far away 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.140
 removed Â»puts 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.970
 Classroom own booth 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.120
 where you just is the village is located so the security warning was there 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.150
 actually do not see at all and that bothers in the long run if he has much 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.260
 Percent of things crash high at charging breaks net 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.000
 Sharing the central power keeps on wanting to perform 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.260
 These vapors want a small safety alert though he is exactly crap what he does 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.280
 EFI with the User Account Control of Windows Vista 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.150
 and percent -7 well meant but in the end 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.920
 but a bit annoying if you know what you are doing and I hope that is 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.960
 becomes 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.710
 temporal example again very briefly what I mean layer normal camera with 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.109
 City of Monastir forgives open and has never prepared a folder 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:40.420
 with different executable file types "The whole does not just apply 

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:41.600
 on the exe file 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.820
 that also applies 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.540
 Percent one has the system here 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.810
 Percent that the distribution MSI called windows installer packages 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.490
 Per cent these are executable files as well, exactly the same thing happens 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.580
 as to a potential one 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.720
 Percent pest risk - the classic case is me more often 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.920
 Get an exe file and get it for the Security Council 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.960
 Claws has shown the targeted squint execution here we will 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.229
 warned because the publisher percent betrays nothing can be fixed because 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.290
 you have no certificate what Windows Percent recognize 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.589
 Process has but in the end all this message I had something with the 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:19.489
 The publisher will generally test something 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.280
 with the risk to do so before the Monster Windows was here 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.970
 around July to the beautiful me the file which is more often from Google - from the 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.330
 Obviously, anyway, warns us 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.099
 Windows 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.099
 possible risk of files from the internet 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:40.619
 It can be said to be "useful" - but we know it does 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.379
 this little tick percent 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.800
 does not kill us much further 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.380
 because that only applies to this current specific file from Google 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:53.939
 here we deactivate this tick percent then click on execute 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.499
 you still have to do more then percent of teachers afterwards 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:00.350
 Speed â€‹â€‹fur or whatever we have to do over and over again 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.770
 Percent of these Kleinert messages passed through us 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:06.379
 that's why it was completely shut down 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.489
 the way I found in the net was following against the internet 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.419
 Explorer setting 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.260
 Percent go to the DG Internet Explorer security settings 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.870
 Percent and percent are actively packing on their from the machine the knife way 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.749
 provides 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:26.430
 Indian the trusted zone or trusted sites like that 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:26.880
 called 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.819
 that has led to absolutely nothing at all for me 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.109
 Percentage of space in a variety of variations on different time levels 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.939
 R operating system tried to light led this message did not run 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:38.550
 prevent 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.139
 maybe you can avoid that 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:45.029
 percent in Internet Explorer percent on FTP level percent on the Internet 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.029
 My last day surfing I do not know for sure 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:51.529
 Marquez has nothing to do with a normal Windows competition 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.020
 brought and the solution did not advance 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.790
 the Volvo presented the deep by the media 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.639
 That's why I want you 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.299
 here percent 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.150
 demonstrate 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.000
 and he hopes that one or the other will find it faster 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.080
 while not 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.109
 Internet just visits the wolf 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.099
 Percent follow instead of not 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.789
 brought to the solution I'll do that very quickly you click on Start us 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:17.979
 choose from PÃ¶hren I write that all were synonymous with the description 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.270
 if you wanted to understand that again you click on 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.860
 Start value z result is the GPPT low point MSC 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.909
 more potent or clicks okay 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:34.430
 then happens the following of the 51 lines is the gates opens 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.900
 Percent the comma still somewhere on Start menu does not ask me now 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.830
 was represented running DP edh etc point in the fcn-tor 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.520
 WTG the two main acts percent categories computer users to 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.670
 Confirmation select from user 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.050
 Configuration followed by administrative templates 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.680
 if only components 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.680
 and finally the equipment manager 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.059
 Now I see that here 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:05.059
 on my video most bit 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.569
 letter or see below three different recordings lists for 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.750
 File types with different risk levels per Nadal let it 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.899
 medium risk in anything not configured is nothing at all 

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:19.900
 configured in this attachments manager category what interests us is the 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:20.960
 Recording list 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.319
 for file type with low MRI Seco 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.289
 to double-click this setting 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.680
 the following dialogue opens up 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.330
 under Windows 7 finds the whole city 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.180
 but we see it also supports windows 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.350
 Percent Six PPHN agrees with Sonsbeck's City that the 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.890
 Approach per cent see themselves take over but no guarantee for it 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.450
 I'm not sure about the time I just said that 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.330
 click here 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.249
 to activate 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:52.010
 to activate the whole setting of this recording list and percent 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.139
 this beautiful text down here percent 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.120
 Then you and you can each as described above give them 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.879
 Extensions with low risk 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:04.910
 with consequences from the point course, for example, points Empa 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:05.839
 promptly ran 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:08.180
 separate dune colon 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.460
 These divisions are basically two of those of Windows 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.860
 Anyway, the head of the house can be true if in the head 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.699
 of network drives opens 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.030
 it's only about this year 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.089
 and use on network drives therefore 

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:25.619
 Clearly we want AXA files 

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:28.220
 with exe files no security warning times see 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.919
 with Wenders' middle semicolon from point MSI files 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.699
 and I think I'm not sure 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:38.599
 I do not think about this at archives 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.599
 But make sure to play it safe 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.150
 also a rare 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.550
 and just a hint 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.779
 if our field 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:53.259
 as I said the files and trendy just with semicolon writes the point 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:55.149
 out 

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:58.399
 Rehfeld since Krieter take over glued on 

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:01.369
 closes the Group Policy Editor 

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:06.009
 I put my camera back up to my executables 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:09.180
 Drives w that can only be network there work 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.089
 around 

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:14.399
 under Google the whole again, for example, close to the people 

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:19.759
 he sees the installation starts here and immediately this is not an error message 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.820
 now this is only the 3 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.159
 Excuse me 

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:25.059
 that you are looking forward to Hannes Pilatus 

00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:28.389
 and that I should still prove that because I do not now of course 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:28.980
 do 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.620
 I want to show you that even if he interprets now differently 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.210
 starts with the file extension MSI 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.060
 this is actually program here the repair and installation of 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.889
 Thilo start immediately without and with any Denny Chin 

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:43.509

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:45.659
 to throw 

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:48.789
 and therefore 

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:52.879
 I hope that the whole thing will bring further something that has helped 

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:56.839
 in the process about a task Fellbach the thumb up highly commented 

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:58.779
 do whatever you want 

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:03.229
 Percent I'm out of a lot of fun Madonna network drives and hope with less 

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:05.169
