stuff like that so I have a list here of

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.920 
stuff like that so I have a list here of
all<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.200> infected<00:00:37.500> servers<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:39.000> see<00:00:39.719> here

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
all the infected servers you see here

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.580 
all the infected servers you see here
there's<00:00:40.170> 12<00:00:41.090> pages<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.480> infected<00:00:43.079> servers<00:00:43.410> now

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
there's 12 pages of infected servers now

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.979 
there's 12 pages of infected servers now
there's<00:00:44.010> lemon<00:00:44.430> right<00:00:44.730> before<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> started<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
there's lemon right before I started the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.709 
there's lemon right before I started the
video<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:47.340> list<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.940> growing<00:00:48.180> really

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
video and this list is growing really

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.260 
video and this list is growing really
fast<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.160> definitely<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:50.879> want<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
fast so you definitely don't want to

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.560 
fast so you definitely don't want to
join<00:00:51.449> any<00:00:51.690> servers<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:52.379> three<00:00:53.570> exclamation

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
join any servers but three exclamation

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.490 
join any servers but three exclamation
marks<00:00:55.020> at<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.680> front<00:00:56.539> and<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.870> hashtag<00:00:58.199> at<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
marks at the front and a hashtag at the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.979 
marks at the front and a hashtag at the
end<00:00:58.710> because<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.340> will<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.730> or<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.840> will

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
end because that will get or that will

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.299 
end because that will get or that will
do<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.770> infected<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:03.949> virus<00:01:04.949> is

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
do so you get infected so this virus is

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.450 
do so you get infected so this virus is
spread<00:01:05.610> by<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.409> don't<00:01:07.409> know<00:01:07.619> how<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:07.950> working

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
spread by I don't know how it working

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.870 
spread by I don't know how it working
yet<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.150> they<00:01:09.689> get<00:01:09.900> access<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.189> Archon<00:01:11.580> in

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
yet but they get access to the Archon in

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.560 
yet but they get access to the Archon in
some<00:01:12.210> way<00:01:12.659> I'm<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.710> home<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.070> ensure<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.729> then

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
some way I'm not home to ensure and then

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
some way I'm not home to ensure and then
they<00:01:15.869> upload<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.409> file<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> server<00:01:17.189> and

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
they upload a file to the server and

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.380 
they upload a file to the server and
then<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.479> will<00:01:18.750> infect<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.759> and<00:01:20.759> it'll<00:01:21.150> just

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
then that will infect you and it'll just

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.249 
then that will infect you and it'll just
go<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:24.210> watch<00:01:24.450> out<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
go on and go on so watch out for the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.710 
go on and go on so watch out for the
servers<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.189> summation<00:01:26.880> marks<00:01:27.299> at<00:01:27.479> the

servers with the summation marks at the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.080

front<00:01:28.189> this<00:01:29.900> Bach<00:01:30.900> or<00:01:31.520> exploit<00:01:32.520> will

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
front this Bach or exploit will

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.719 
front this Bach or exploit will
hopefully<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.810> fixed<00:01:34.200> soon<00:01:34.409> I'm<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:34.799> sure<00:01:35.159> but

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
hopefully be fixed soon I'm not sure but

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.569 
hopefully be fixed soon I'm not sure but
in<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.150> meantime<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.770> probably<00:01:38.280> want<00:01:38.520> to
