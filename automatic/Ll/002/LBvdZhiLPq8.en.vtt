00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
be able to manage it

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.980 
be able to manage it
and<00:02:59.860> these<00:03:00.520> stocks<00:03:01.060> push<00:03:01.990> up<00:03:02.170> very<00:03:02.560> fast<00:03:02.920> and

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
and these stocks push up very fast and

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.160 
and these stocks push up very fast and
carry<00:03:04.990> a<00:03:05.110> lot<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.500> weight<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.930> sometimes<00:03:07.930> they

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
carry a lot of weight and sometimes they

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.920 
carry a lot of weight and sometimes they
grow<00:03:08.380> so<00:03:08.590> fast<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:09.100> they<00:03:09.220> just<00:03:09.490> collapse

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
grow so fast that they just collapse

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.260 
grow so fast that they just collapse
just<00:03:10.930> breaks<00:03:11.230> off<00:03:12.390> too<00:03:13.390> heavy<00:03:14.850> but<00:03:15.850> it<00:03:16.000> doesn't

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
just breaks off too heavy but it doesn't

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.560 
just breaks off too heavy but it doesn't
die<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:17.080> just<00:03:17.110> curves<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:19.020> shoots<00:03:20.020> up<00:03:20.320> another
