00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello like it here from markus fotos.de 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.049
 This time stood on chains and here is me 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.849
 the 6 cd fell into the hands 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.639
 Having just been to the colleagues of 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.780
 nikon we have since looked at the 600d that 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.130
 of course very interesting the two 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.480
 sometimes came to compare because in the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.970
 basic games so a bit in 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.930
 The same league is looking at us in the chamber 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.699
 first time 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.320
 for me as a real nikon user 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.180
 he is all a bit unfamiliar 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.560
 but that's just because of that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.320
 I'm used to other things 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.059
 Thanks for the picture we are running 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.530
 times relatively no problem relatively know 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.600
 usual as I think up here the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.910
 Button row on the one short 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.780
 must press for another setting 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.879
 to choose 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.430
 the users of you will know that 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.829
 Otherwise , be familiar from the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.520
 quality the camera feels right 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.260
 good at 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.469
 this is not official yet 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.090
 sale copy but one more 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.800
 I just got a production copy 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.309
 that's not why it is 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.289
 possible 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.270
 but it is possible the card slot too 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.809
 open but allowed to take pictures 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.369
 I unfortunately no one let's see what 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.070
 first of all falls on the difference 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.650
 to the 600 the wm saw there are 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.470
 no flashes here and that has the reason 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.450
 that up here in this probably the otherwise 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.090
 also mostly flattened there is 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.439
 here a gps module and a wlan module 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.330
 that means these two functions 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.610
 are in the case in the camera 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.689
 integrated need not be considered a module 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.580
 be purchased 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.799
 only disadvantage is a flash you have to 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.210
 but you still buy it but that will be 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.159
 most of you are one 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.170
 want to buy such camera anyway 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.570
 So that's not in my view 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.030
 real disadvantage positive 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.460
 I also think of this one up here 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.710
 lock for the election council 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.670
 I think that's very nice too 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.610
 the form of the overall impression 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.780
 as a small disadvantage just because of 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.820
 bad experience with it is the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.979
 fact that there is only one here 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.560
 single bay for a sd card there 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.420
 So not the possibility as with nikon 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.790
 models two cards to work it 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.430
 the possibility to give up at the same time 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.630
 to save both cards 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.429
 I find it very interesting here too 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.929
 high photosensitivity was said 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.190
 or I can not try it out 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.680
 look at us a bit later 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.830
 on and in particular to call the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.150
 mean autofocus point of the as well 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.220
 with very little light still in the 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.660
 Location is to focus money connect here 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.480
 at the side perhaps still quite 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.430
 interesting, there is one 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.410
 microphone connection once here and it 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.269
 gives the possibility to all remote release 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.739
 further we have 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:38.080
 a hdmi output and we have one 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.480
 digital output probably also 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.860
 can serve as usb connection et cetera 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.690
 What we do not have here, which I do not 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.450
 I've seen a headphone jack 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.450
 which is a pity
