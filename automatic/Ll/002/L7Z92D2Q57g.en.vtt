00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.940
 today we are going to analyze the subject brazil 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:06.940
 tell me what it feels like 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.389
 and more 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.080
 the mortality 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.670
 one 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:46.339
 brazil tell me what it feels like 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.920
 what is meant here is the desire 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.829
 to know who serves what other 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.050
 what the other feels that has something that 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.610
 I have not 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.700
 brazil tell me what it feels like to be 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.019
 five-time champion and have five cups 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.570
 have your dad at home 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.860
 here they would explain that 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.470
 is the desire to change the son who is 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.990
 in the father's place to later be 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.640
 next to the most well-known mother with 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.979
 complex of dedicated that is to say that all 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.370
 Argentines who sing that actually 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:31.690
 they want to change places with their dad 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:34.210
 that explains why Argentina has the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.730
 greater number of psychologists throughout the 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.000
 world 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.090
 I swear that even if the years go by, never 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.369
 we will forget 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.340
 Brazil and Argentina clashed and 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.570
 world four times where Argentina 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.630
 only one won 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.630
 that's why from now on the music 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.780
 start to describe that unique moment 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.990
 that the Argentine people had 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.229
 and that is rooted in that as unique 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.990
 moment of happiness that they had to the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.810
 Brazil and not global 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:13.230
 maradona is bigger than pepe 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.230
 Decide is easy now let's go to the facts 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.430
 both played 21 years 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.900
 PelÃ© of the three World Cups Maradona won 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:31.950
 one 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:38.640
 pelÃ© scored 1,281 goals in 1363 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:40.450
 Maradona matches 352 goals in 692 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.110
 matches 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.920
 for the Brazilian national team he played 92 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.620
 matches with 97 goals 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.020
 maradona for the Argentine team played 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.820
 90 games with 33 goals 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.980
 so from now on when 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.040
 listen to an argentinian singing that 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.870
 song knows very well what it is that 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.870
 means in the interline 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.319
 up to date
