00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
so it has 4g LTE on it in addition to

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
Cortex a9 chip on the inside and I tell

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.760 
Cortex a9 chip on the inside and I tell
you<00:04:44.009> it's<00:04:44.219> a<00:04:44.340> thin<00:04:44.699> phone<00:04:45.169> lightweight<00:04:46.169> you

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
you it's a thin phone lightweight you

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.890 
you it's a thin phone lightweight you
know<00:04:46.860> helps<00:04:47.129> offset<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.669> that<00:04:48.150> giant<00:04:48.599> size

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
know helps offset that that giant size

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.929 
know helps offset that that giant size
in<00:04:49.199> terms<00:04:49.319> of<00:04:49.439> the<00:04:49.529> form<00:04:49.710> factor<00:04:49.860> and<00:04:50.189> that's

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:50.939 
in terms of the form factor and that's

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:52.519 
in terms of the form factor and that's
probably<00:04:51.180> why<00:04:51.419> they've<00:04:51.569> sold<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:52.020> many<00:04:52.139> of

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:52.529 
probably why they've sold so many of

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:55.399 
probably why they've sold so many of
them<00:04:52.800> you<00:04:53.159> know<00:04:53.279> because<00:04:53.610> as<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.599> ads<00:04:55.020> will
