00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
a show and trailer I'm hoping I might be

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.540 
a show and trailer I'm hoping I might be
able<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.840> I'm<00:00:25.140> not<00:00:25.320> sure<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.920> been<00:00:26.130> down<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
able to I'm not sure it's been down the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.000 
able to I'm not sure it's been down the
line<00:00:26.760> with<00:00:26.939> preparation<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.840> another<00:00:28.769> reason

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
line with preparation and another reason

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.659 
line with preparation and another reason
is<00:00:29.279> I've<00:00:29.580> actually<00:00:29.880> got<00:00:31.579> something<00:00:32.579> I'm

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
is I've actually got something I'm

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.299 
is I've actually got something I'm
really<00:00:32.700> excited<00:00:33.090> about<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> mail

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
really excited about is in the mail

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.740 
really excited about is in the mail
lavalier<00:00:35.309> microphones<00:00:35.910> which<00:00:36.149> are<00:00:36.329> set<00:00:36.600> to

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
lavalier microphones which are set to

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.139 
lavalier microphones which are set to
arrive<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:37.050> about<00:00:37.260> an<00:00:37.469> hour<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.579> think<00:00:38.640> I'd

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
arrive in about an hour and I think I'd

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.549 
arrive in about an hour and I think I'd
like<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.390> test<00:00:39.719> those<00:00:39.899> out<00:00:40.079> tonight<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
like to test those out tonight on a

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.770 
like to test those out tonight on a
non-critical<00:00:41.190> episode<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.510> was<00:00:42.629> thinking

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
non-critical episode so I was thinking

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.069 
non-critical episode so I was thinking
possibly<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.770> don't<00:00:43.920> know<00:00:44.010> jack<00:00:44.250> again<00:00:44.460> and

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
possibly you don't know jack again and

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.209 
possibly you don't know jack again and
because<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.230> doesn't<00:00:46.469> matter<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> audio

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
because it doesn't matter if the audio

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.520 
because it doesn't matter if the audio
messes<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.870> good<00:00:49.020> episode<00:00:49.200> to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
messes up on that it's a good episode to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.010 
messes up on that it's a good episode to
test<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:49.950> plus<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> reason<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.809> got

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
test on plus so the reason that I got

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020 
test on plus so the reason that I got
livelier<00:00:52.710> microphones<00:00:53.190> why<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.550> big<00:00:53.760> deals

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
livelier microphones why it's big deals

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.330 
livelier microphones why it's big deals
because<00:00:54.620> they're<00:00:55.620> really<00:00:55.860> close<00:00:56.039> what<00:00:56.250> I've

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
because they're really close what I've

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.490 
because they're really close what I've
been<00:00:56.460> using<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.760> shotgun<00:00:57.120> before<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.320> one

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
been using a shotgun before and it's one

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.990 
been using a shotgun before and it's one
microphone<00:00:58.859> trying<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> pick<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.550> all<00:00:59.699> four<00:00:59.940> of

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
microphone trying to pick up all four of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.660 
microphone trying to pick up all four of
us<00:01:00.149> which<00:01:00.359> means<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.859> it<00:01:01.859> has<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.250> sit<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.489> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
us which means that it has to sit like a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.789 
us which means that it has to sit like a
good<00:01:03.000> distance<00:01:03.239> away<00:01:03.510> from<00:01:03.719> all<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.110> us<00:01:04.290> which

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
good distance away from all of us which

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.609 
good distance away from all of us which
means<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:06.270> pick<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.780> echo<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.560> it

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
means that it can pick up echo and it

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.280 
means that it can pick up echo and it
can<00:01:07.770> pick<00:01:07.979> up<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.510> audio<00:01:10.049> from<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
can pick up the the audio from the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.240 
can pick up the the audio from the
actual<00:01:10.560> game<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.159> we're<00:01:11.310> hearing<00:01:11.580> too<00:01:11.850> so
