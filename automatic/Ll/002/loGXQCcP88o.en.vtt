00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.459
 [Music] 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.510

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.660
 the powerful 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.760
 Similary 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.280
 [Music] 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.950
 destruction that you do not love me anymore and that 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.680

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.989

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.129
 today I continue where the same where days 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:05.640
 left and in an empty corner where no 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:09.120
 the light comes and I do not understand your words 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.989
 I thought you loved me to say that 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.590
 we have and you only played and I gave you 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:21.000
 my nights I gave you songs so that 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:24.599
 pretend love and so much reproach we improve 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.750
 and you would say to yourself until getting older where 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.970
 there are those promises and the plastic ones of 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.129
 Yesterday 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.129
 [Music] 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.930
 is your look you have gone with someone 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.579
 more and I think so important so not 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.680
 I was what you expected or badly given 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.019
 neither the love that you so much wanted 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.480
 excuse the time you say lose baby 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.959
 I loved you with all my being I'm dumb 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.959
 remains 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.870
 everything I had without conditions from 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.899
 what 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.899
 [Music] 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:41.630
 the clock advances slow she hides 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:45.710
 I'm sorry to wait for your decision put me in 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:49.310
 against time despair for a 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:53.450
 decision that my joy this life I 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:57.650
 lack the heart I only depend on you and I 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:01.240
 It makes you think that it could be the end and that 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:05.510
 you will not come back though it's both 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.620
 this relationship I will not keep fighting 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.620
 for our 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.830
 all right 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.650
 she does not have you 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:05.130
 listen what I have to confess 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.130
 [Music] 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:16.189
 he just feels that the words that you 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:18.049
 I say they avoid delicate and so seductive you 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:20.449
 I stared at your charisma I fell in love 

00:06:18.049 --> 00:06:22.219
 I observed your sweet and soft lips 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.559
 I do not know how you make my pulse go up 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:26.839
 straight to the sky folding imposing the 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:29.509
 only sin would not want you this 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:32.209
 heart is only for you we go so alone 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:34.249
 Say that if today I saw you elegant and so 

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:36.469
 humble my voice sings my heart to you 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:40.449
 write I feel sad if you say goodbye 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:40.449
 let's escape together and be free 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:06.280
 you won me I lost your love and you triumphed 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.830
 you did not care I never wore it and it was 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.169
 so much what I care about you my life without 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.300
 ask me you took my heart away 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.400
 take this take you seriously and I just 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.470
 you played and I only stay since 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.080
 You left everything came out just like 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:22.349
 you plan to get up and you lie me down or 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.349
 you will go 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.479
 and nothing is as you thought
