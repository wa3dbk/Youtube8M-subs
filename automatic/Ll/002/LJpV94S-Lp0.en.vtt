00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
that we as Cervelo were looking for was

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.580 
that we as Cervelo were looking for was
to<00:01:24.430> partner<00:01:24.790> with<00:01:25.140> people<00:01:26.140> that<00:01:26.290> were<00:01:26.380> the

to partner with people that were the

to partner with people that were the
best<00:01:26.860> in<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.130> industry<00:01:27.160> as<00:01:28.150> far<00:01:28.210> as<00:01:28.510> their

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
best in the industry as far as their

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.570 
best in the industry as far as their
particular<00:01:29.080> area<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.560> specialization<00:01:30.040> so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
particular area of specialization so

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.310 
particular area of specialization so
rather<00:01:30.970> than<00:01:31.119> becoming<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.600> break<00:01:31.840> developer

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
rather than becoming a break developer

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.350 
rather than becoming a break developer
on<00:01:32.470> her<00:01:32.590> own<00:01:32.740> we<00:01:32.890> said<00:01:33.100> we<00:01:33.610> should<00:01:33.790> find<00:01:34.030> people

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
on her own we said we should find people

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.090 
on her own we said we should find people
to<00:01:34.450> make<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.720> best<00:01:34.960> breaks<00:01:35.290> right<00:01:35.530> now<00:01:35.800> and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
to make the best breaks right now and

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.640 
to make the best breaks right now and
partner<00:01:36.790> them<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.390> what's<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.229> solution<00:01:38.619> to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
partner them and what's the solution to

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.469 
partner them and what's the solution to
that<00:01:38.740> it's<00:01:39.010> obviously<00:01:39.340> hydraulics<00:01:39.940> when<00:01:40.420> you

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
that it's obviously hydraulics when you

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.480 
that it's obviously hydraulics when you
make<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.810> decision<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.770> next<00:01:42.040> thing<00:01:42.190> is<00:01:42.340> who

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
make that decision the next thing is who

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.680 
make that decision the next thing is who
do<00:01:42.550> you<00:01:42.610> partner<00:01:42.880> with<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:43.330> there's<00:01:43.600> only

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
do you partner with and there's only

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.060 
do you partner with and there's only
really<00:01:43.960> one<00:01:44.110> solution<00:01:44.619> to<00:01:44.710> that<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:44.890> that's

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
really one solution to that and that's

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.430 
really one solution to that and that's
mogera<00:01:45.490> they're<00:01:46.060> by<00:01:46.270> far<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.930> world<00:01:47.260> leader

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
mogera they're by far the world leader

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.960 
mogera they're by far the world leader
in<00:01:47.650> that<00:01:47.770> area

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
in that area

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.600 
in that area
super<00:01:49.630> well-established<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:50.619> mountain<00:01:51.430> bikes

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
super well-established in mountain bikes

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.340 
super well-established in mountain bikes
but<00:01:52.240> also<00:01:52.420> they've<00:01:52.869> been<00:01:52.900> doing<00:01:53.110> this

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
but also they've been doing this

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.490 
but also they've been doing this
hydraulic<00:01:54.310> room<00:01:54.610> breaks<00:01:54.880> for<00:01:55.600> 30<00:01:56.080> years<00:01:56.320> as

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
hydraulic room breaks for 30 years as

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.440 
hydraulic room breaks for 30 years as
well<00:01:56.650> so<00:01:57.010> they<00:01:57.130> had<00:01:57.310> that<00:01:57.460> capability<00:01:57.820> that

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
well so they had that capability that

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.690 
well so they had that capability that
proven<00:01:58.840> capability<00:01:59.440> to<00:02:00.070> make<00:02:00.250> an<00:02:00.400> excellent

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
proven capability to make an excellent

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.250 
proven capability to make an excellent
product<00:02:01.060> it<00:02:01.420> would<00:02:01.510> work<00:02:01.660> really<00:02:01.930> really<00:02:02.020> well

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
product it would work really really well

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.380 
product it would work really really well
to<00:02:03.190> companies<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:03.790> understand<00:02:04.270> what
