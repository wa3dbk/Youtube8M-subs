 energy of the sun so in Arabic dance

 today also released by boys is this 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.369
 even then we'll know a little more about 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.369
 art through artist rafael marques 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.890
 Rafael is already starting to find something 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.780
 A story here for me. 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.390
 belly is just a woman who dances 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.150
 a man thrown in then the dance of the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.030
 belly is a dance that is feminist 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.759
 formerly only women danced to 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.500
 your men who is a lebanese dance it 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.650
 with some time to come here men 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.470
 taking care of it a little because they 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.780
 have seen that in this male body 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.580
 much more definition much more power and 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.900
 men were becoming interested in the 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.630
 belly dance 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.240
 then it happened the man comes 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.250
 dance in this belly dance and today in 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.110
 There's a lot more man dancing in the daytime. 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.360
 to be a very new thing 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.520
 but there is much increase and dance 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.369
 belly dance but in the culture itself 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.110
 it is an issue that this can 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.229
 something more ours than Brazil's 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.780
 go dancing man actually came 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.720
 accompanying contemporaneity 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.660
 evolution to them in the matter of tradition 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.330
 The woman has this dance because they are 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.490
 even for being a sensual dance for being 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.380
 a dance here for them is the dance of 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.990
 fertility let's say so 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.989
 but with this evolution of today with 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.340
 dance and all man dance then it's a 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.860
 newest thing 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.730
 there for them in the tradition is not a 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.400
 Such a traditional thing is man dancing 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.750
 now what changes so nothing only to 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.549
 man to woman movements are the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.840
 same ones that said that the body is different 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.700
 the anatomy itself already gives another 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.100
 aesthetics of dance, right? 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.260
 but in the matter of fashion the movement 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.840
 be surprised at the same point but the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.180
 drive is the same to you because 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.890
 will work on the question of your body and 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.739
 resourcefulness then the drive is the 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.930
 the same that modifies the man he has 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.480
 much more muscle strength 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.640
 so the woman is much more fragile 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.200
 the more sensitive man already has those 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.140
 more defined movements that 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.209
 much stronger contraction then what 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.790
 difference is that this matter of force 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.030
 definition of the structure for both the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.060
 traditional belly dance for this 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.459
 launched by Raphael is the same as 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.020
 dancers may or may not use 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.910
 accessories such as tambourines tambourines etc. 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.120
 as well as going through the various techniques 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.430
 such as percussion the dances 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.980
 and the dances of couples by 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.290
 example the history of the artist also 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.569
 influence on your performance 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.290
 I actually started dancing since 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.330
 when I was born and I 'm dancing eight years 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.269
 studied contemporary jazz ballet 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.390
 Modern tap dancing has already done a bit of 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.250
 everything and until then I had moved to 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.250
 Sao Paulo at the beginning of the year for me 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.010
 To be able to dance in the race to take classes of everything 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.380
 know this universe of dance a lot 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.280
 more professional than here in 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.110
 uberlandia 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.959
 arriving in SÃ£o Paulo I had contact 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.060
 with belly dancing and I was enchanted 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.430
 only as soon as I passed on the 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.580
 dance course here from uff 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.739
 I went back to my city and here I 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.220
 I had contact with Carla Cecilio that the 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.560
 owner of the gym and she asked me to do 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.959
 this mixture of what I already had 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.540
 technique with this dance of the 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.180
 belly and me for always dancing in 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.220
 festivals gyms always with women 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.200
 living with a lot of belly dancing 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.959
 just looking the learned then dance 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.479
 when I came to practice practically the class 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.910
 so I already knew the practice all I just went 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.850
 learn the theoretical steps of where 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.229
 share the drive learn to split 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.900
 a little more the body that dances 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.850
 belly has this and think of this body 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.800
 like belly dancing or imagine that in 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.200
 some time these techniques should 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.720
 unite in this in less the same tapping 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.669
 ballet is not to increase its trajectory a 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.310
 thing is helping the other to form 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.320
 a spectacle , but when you 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.930
 terrible each one has his conscience 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.610
 body that you each mode you 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.800
 think a different body are 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.590
 moves from locations 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.270
 different intentions 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.610
 so when I came to dance to 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.300
 belly dancing was very difficult this way 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.190
 not difficult to practice the most 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.740
 hard to think it color different than 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.300
 already thought like ballet like jazz and think 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.940
 how belly dancing is very different 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.550
 much more chance, but another body bell 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.620
 but just as you said the dances if 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.490
 they connect with each other then logically 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.200
 The technique of ballet is all influenced 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.810
 much in belly dancing and just as the 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.100
 belly dancing today influence in all 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.100
 the other areas that I dance 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.850
 now if it 's a man dancing the 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.520
 belly and just told us 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.390
 also that this body grandson is more 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.430
 but strong right but heavier and also 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.590
 should require quite a technical question of 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:16.100
 You and a physical question even requires 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:19.700
 Rather, it does require a physical question 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:22.160
 of endurance and belly dancing is also 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.830
 let's say yes a physical activity 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.440
 that even I did not think it would be so good 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.110
 you work the body do you work 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.970
 with traction you work very abdominal 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.710
 different from what people imagine and 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.200
 talking about our belly dancing gives us 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.910
 tummy on the other hand you do 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.130
 too much abdominal strength 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.830
 Only you work hard on the issue of 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:48.280
 motor coordination and so I'll tell you 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.280
 I'm sou and it spends a lot of calorie
