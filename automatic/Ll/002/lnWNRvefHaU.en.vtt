00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.050
 you already have to share with you and 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.820
 sony said that I 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.130
 or logic with strangers today I read and I 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.080
 they call steak sharing with you many 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.240
 thanks everyone for behring 1 christmas 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.490
 they are almost here 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.980
 these are my favorite dates 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.110
 definitely the illuminations the 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.509
 Christmas trees the Christmas atmosphere 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.300
 always has a special effect and very 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.520
 warm in the surroundings for me is the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.960
 third Christmas that happened in this country and 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.930
 when I arrive in Japan at this time 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.660
 it was in 2011 I found very few 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.820
 illuminations still by the effects 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.920
 of the tsunami and last year there was a 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.649
 little more of illuminations and events 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.140
 Christmas but this year I can see that 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.929
 there is still more you can see in the 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.300
 streets here in tokyo in stores in 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.850
 the trains on television you see a lot 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.950
 the theme of vanity and one that the 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.560
 Christmas do not have him 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.000
 the same meaning or the same 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.700
 intention that you have in many other 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.770
 countries christmas exists here in japan 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.370
 and some of you have asked me 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.190
 if Christmas is celebrated in Japanese and if 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.250
 it is celebrated although they small in 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.330
 more rural places you do not see so much the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.780
 effect of reality 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.520
 It is not common to see houses or places with 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.030
 lighting is to the means of 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.790
 media like television magazines 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.400
 anime dramas have been responsible for silence 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.950
 the interest and desire to celebrate the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.870
 christmas here in japan these big here 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.600
 in Japanese you can find many 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.700
 Christmas decorations in houses in 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.340
 establishment is more than anything when 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.680
 I go to places outside of Tokyo I've noticed 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.160
 that the decorations and the illuminations 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.800
 are more moderate are less and I see that the 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:54.570
 people celebrate Christmas less but 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.550
 good that they are going to help I have seen and I 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.890
 have said my Japanese colleagues is more 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.820
 that nothing a date to leave with the 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.090
 boyfriend the girlfriend is like the romantic day 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.340
 for couples going out to dinner at the cinema or 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.649
 go to see the completions and 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.300
 exchange gifts and that's 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.150
 practically the meaning of Christmas 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.450
 in this country it's like a date for 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.610
 dating with the couple in japan the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.070
 most important date is the new year is 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.260
 the family date when the 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.760
 relatives I have videos about the year 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.950
 new that passes from here in japan if 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.959
 I like to check it, I'll leave the link below 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.630
 in the description if they have not seen it and 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.610
 they want to see it so if the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.040
 Christmas in Japan but it's different 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.050
 way and Christmas still does not have that 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.019
 boom in the whole country that you have in 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.660
 other countries to 12 with the little tree 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.120
 Christmas 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.650
 and decorate the place with decorations 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.720
 Christmas 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.060
 the people do it to be great but 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.549
 taking into account the entire country in its 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.860
 totality is not the majority but the 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.530
 minority that does what I could 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.659
 observe but the theme of Christmas is 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.209
 projects a lot with television and 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.540
 us commercials it does not matter in what 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.129
 part of japan is derived 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.810
 I want to take advantage of in this video 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.280
 wish everyone happy holidays 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.689
 have a great time in company with 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.980
 people that you want and are 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.170
 important in their lives 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.299

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.189
