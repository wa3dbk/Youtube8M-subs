00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.330
 Memories of Gunpla Kit Review Collection Mobile Suit Data Gundam 1/144 Gym 2 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:13.930
 Jim ii and appeared in the anime Mobile Suit Data Gundam 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:19.420
 It was used in the Earth Federation Army Titans English camp 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:23.140
 It is a mass production type mobile suit and it is mass-produced by the Earth Commonwealth Army at the time of the one-year war, as you can see in the package. 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.539
 It is a minor change version of rgm 79 gym 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.800
 Grips Sensoji Temple was already obsoleted 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:35.210
 Many from the ease of use of the operational aspects to each camp had been deployed 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.410
 As for the body color, the English Green Earth Commonwealth Army and Titans painted in red 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.210
 I'm using 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.690
 It was originally serialized in Comic Bonbon a little while before Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam started 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.530
 The 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:51.180
 It is deployment of Kazuhisa Kondo who appeared in Mobile Suit Gundam ms Senki is not deployed 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.160
 While Jim was the original design is so was also as it is expected to put out as office work, but too 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.329
 It is also a day, but it has changed 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.430
 Anyway if High Detail Kondo version seems to have put out as a minor version 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.170
 I wanted Zaku to be served but my name 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.550
 Mobile Suit Gundam ms Senki is the first comic release for Gundam at that time 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.010
 I was proud of the popular cult around the modeler 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.480
 The 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.290
 The high detail mobile suit, called the Kondo version, is often three-dimensional by modelers. 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.780
 Become 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.070
 I decorated the magazine of model magazine but 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:23.920
 Comic bonbon series daytime broadcast of the same military history Zeta Gundam has been determined 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:28.340
 As Prof. Kondo is going to serialize Data Gundam's comicalization in the bonbon market 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:33.800
 It ended in the form to be discontinued in the February issue of 1985 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.770
 Currently , the name changes to MS Battle Report Gundam 007 t 9 Gaiden 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.929
 Mediaworks 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.100
 I'm sure I 'm pretty much like those back then, I love gyms 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.210
 No it was surely 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.360
 At the time of the modelers because it was cheap and 400 yen was bought in large quantities 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.500
 As interpretation of elbow is completely different as repair point 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.760
 Now if'll change to an empty joint after a wider range of movement 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.790
 The shield is a favorite and a modern shield fg 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:02.620
 I wonder if it should be diverted from around Gundam 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:06.820
 Although the movable range is generally small, it is said that it does not move so much in animation 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.600
 It's not a problem as it is just shooting a rifle with a single picture 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.290
 Is not it 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.880
 Recently, the Gundam Unicorn version has been released . 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.960
 It is not at all bad brackets 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:21.310
 Once upon a time the rifle also have changed the entire image to too Deca 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:25.720
 When 1/100 of cancer orphans has been kit in the compatibility of the gun blaster 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:29.520
 I was able to do the setting as a gun blaster, and the result as a single gun was considerably bad 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.520
 I remembered that it was muka
