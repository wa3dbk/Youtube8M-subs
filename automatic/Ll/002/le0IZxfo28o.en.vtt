00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.450 
oh look you got the yellow and red it's
just<00:03:56.320> really<00:03:57.100> creative<00:03:57.610> I<00:03:57.970> like<00:03:58.420> this<00:03:58.600> idea

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
just really creative I like this idea

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.030 
just really creative I like this idea
because<00:04:00.460> it<00:04:00.970> sort<00:04:01.300> of<00:04:01.420> allows<00:04:01.960> the<00:04:02.470> Builder<00:04:02.860> to

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
because it sort of allows the Builder to

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.190 
because it sort of allows the Builder to
be<00:04:03.190> completely<00:04:03.760> creative<00:04:04.150> have<00:04:04.330> this<00:04:04.480> sort<00:04:05.110> of

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
be completely creative have this sort of

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.580 
be completely creative have this sort of
really<00:04:05.950> widespread<00:04:07.020> creativity<00:04:08.020> or<00:04:08.260> create

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
really widespread creativity or create

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.740 
really widespread creativity or create
creative<00:04:09.040> freedom<00:04:09.640> yet<00:04:10.120> at<00:04:10.240> the<00:04:10.360> same<00:04:10.570> time

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
creative freedom yet at the same time

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.920 
creative freedom yet at the same time
it's<00:04:10.930> still<00:04:11.140> like<00:04:11.350> binds<00:04:12.040> them<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.820> this<00:04:13.510> theme

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
it's still like binds them to this theme

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.340 
it's still like binds them to this theme
karela<00:04:14.890> deville<00:04:15.460> like<00:04:16.299> oh<00:04:16.480> this<00:04:16.720> doesn't<00:04:17.200> I

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
karela deville like oh this doesn't I

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.140 
karela deville like oh this doesn't I
mean<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:17.950> guess<00:04:18.130> it's<00:04:18.310> sorted<00:04:18.640> uses<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.000> color

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
mean I guess it's sorted uses the color

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.690 
mean I guess it's sorted uses the color
scheme<00:04:19.450> but<00:04:19.600> it<00:04:19.660> also<00:04:19.900> has<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.919> feel<00:04:21.310> that<00:04:21.549> you

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
scheme but it also has the feel that you

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.330 
scheme but it also has the feel that you
would<00:04:21.790> expect<00:04:22.419> cruella<00:04:23.260> de<00:04:23.470> Vil's<00:04:23.710> plot<00:04:24.190> to

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
would expect cruella de Vil's plot to

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.760 
would expect cruella de Vil's plot to
have<00:04:24.520> you<00:04:24.760> also<00:04:24.880> have<00:04:25.120> all

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
have you also have all

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.559 
have you also have all
these<00:04:25.889> sort<00:04:26.099> of<00:04:26.190> spotted<00:04:26.639> windows<00:04:27.120> with<00:04:27.389> the

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:27.569 
these sort of spotted windows with the

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.110 
these sort of spotted windows with the
the<00:04:28.229> darkness<00:04:28.740> behind<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.370> so<00:04:29.639> it<00:04:29.789> sort<00:04:30.030> of

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
the darkness behind it so it sort of

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.719 
the darkness behind it so it sort of
gives<00:04:30.629> it<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.810> Dalmatian<00:04:31.680> feel<00:04:32.039> it's<00:04:32.460> just

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
gives it that Dalmatian feel it's just

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.119 
gives it that Dalmatian feel it's just

it's it's a hammerhead but with the the
Hat<00:04:53.940> on<00:04:53.970> top<00:04:54.449> I<00:04:54.840> mean<00:04:55.470> really<00:04:55.770> cool<00:04:56.039> stuff<00:04:56.430> here

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
Hat on top I mean really cool stuff here

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.610 
Hat on top I mean really cool stuff here
I<00:04:56.970> highly<00:04:57.629> suggest<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:58.139> go<00:04:58.289> because<00:04:58.590> I

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
I highly suggest you go because I

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.240 
I highly suggest you go because I
haven't<00:04:58.860> looked<00:04:59.699> at<00:04:59.909> nearly<00:05:00.120> all<00:05:00.449> of<00:05:00.630> them<00:05:00.810> and

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
haven't looked at nearly all of them and

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.950 
haven't looked at nearly all of them and
I<00:05:02.250> suspect<00:05:02.789> that<00:05:02.880> there's<00:05:03.180> more<00:05:03.449> in<00:05:03.659> store

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
I suspect that there's more in store

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.719 
I suspect that there's more in store
because<00:05:04.319> this<00:05:04.590> looks<00:05:04.860> like<00:05:05.039> it<00:05:05.370> went<00:05:05.580> off

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
because this looks like it went off

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:06.469 
because this looks like it went off
really<00:05:06.270> well

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
really well

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.899 
really well
and<00:05:06.810> hopefully<00:05:07.770> we<00:05:08.069> get<00:05:08.159> to<00:05:08.340> see<00:05:08.490> more<00:05:08.669> look

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
and hopefully we get to see more look

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.249 
and hopefully we get to see more look
