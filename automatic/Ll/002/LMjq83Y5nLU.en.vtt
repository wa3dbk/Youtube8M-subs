 the magazine to the public 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.529
 leader than other publications out there in germany 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.999
 with 7 million copies sold per month 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:15.900
 in 36 countries 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.169
 elected for a little our ranking dp mil 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.339
 very recommendable thigh 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.119
 the bridgestone turanza is what made 300 worse 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.259
 the test 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.809
 five leading market brands was carried out to evaluate the performance of 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.500
 fuel savings 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.290
 is the comparison of safety levels 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.409
 particularly 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.409
 wet conditions

 author of luigi and with indication 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:45.930
 very recommendable 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.770
 only three brands and highlighted only crops up to 300 and relies on its 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.860
 balanced characteristics of its allied epilogue lack security for 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.270
 hydroplaning 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.600
 now braking 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.520
 noise at the same time as providing a task

 the text of the author alive for the tires 205/60 cent to 16 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.550
 used a mercedes-benz class c that measured fuel consumption by 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.450
 means of an apparatus with another 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.830
 installed in the vehicle 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.000
 at speeds was made I know I did 130 miles per hour 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.690
 the performance of tires in hydroplaning situations in 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.520
 straight and in vats 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.190
 the autobiography report published in the August 2010 issue alerted the 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.270
 readers on the other hand of the fuel economy afforded by the low 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.750
 rolling resistance 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.830
 who wants a decrease in security especially in the ward in floor 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.620
 wet the article draws attention to the new regulations made for the 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.420
 misunderstanding in the United States in 2012 but will require children to 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.250
 surrounded the safety index calls for fuel consumption while pointing 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.190
 that the absolute difference the rolling resistance had the tires party 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.150
 relatively low fan 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.700
 the body so that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.630
 the two largest economizers 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.800
 were just not particularly satisfying goals in the wet and 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.369
 need a bigger space to stop I'll stay with the publication of the camera 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:20.269
 Herrmann exerted every meter of braking distance 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.030
 throughout an extensive development program the safety items 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:25.839
 take it easy 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.549
 bridgestone has designated durans 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.969
 is that 300 travels to provide significant cost savings. 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:37.430
 fuel but with only up to the level where safety in the wet 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.399
 was not compromised 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.370
 this was achieved through new technology 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.269
 that reduces heating during this tournament vote 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.269
 allowing the improvement of rolling resistance 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:51.339
 fuel consumption 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:55.329
 all other performance characteristics were maintained including 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.309
 high level of safety in the wet
