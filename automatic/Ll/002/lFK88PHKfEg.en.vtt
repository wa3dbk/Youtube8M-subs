00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.609
 I'm doctor jorge aguilar vela 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.709
 orthopedist and spine surgeon and the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.839
 Today I am going to talk about a 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:11.519
 treatment of herniated disc that 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.370
 is accompanied with which with the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.710
 placement of a ligament one is a 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.529
 addition that allows us a space 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.289
 between one bone and another what is the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.820
 purpose of this good ligament is 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.310
 had seen that when someone had 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.929
 half disc with a backache that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.480
 he went to his legs or he smelled 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.759
 only to the back and it ran that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.829
 when stopping his sitting could not be well 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.469
 the vertebrae were loose as 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.059
 you are seeing on screen because it was coming out 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.910
 a lot of disk 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.640
 approximately when you get more than 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.039
 60% of the disk then this made 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.469
 this space that existed between these 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.680
 vertebrae the vertebrae had certain 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.660
 movement that we call him 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.899
 instability then it was seen that the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.239
 10 or 15 years these people presented 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.250
 pain and arthritis and discomfort in that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.100
 area even though they did not have hernia 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.140
 disc and then the studies led to 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.409
 conclude that it was for this 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.360
 exaggerated or unstable and then it 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.700
 He devised this addition that they are seeing 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.430
 which is like a package between the two 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.500
 thorns of the two bones that are of 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.050
 the vertebrae that allows it to 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.050
 keep space that does not close on 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.380
 space and that there is no pain again 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.470
 there are two types of attachments one that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.770
 flame day and another malinovski ligament 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.080
 that helps us to be able to do the same 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.690
 function to have a package in the middle of 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.850
 two bones as they see it on the screen 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.920
 see it as it is at the end and as 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.869
 this allows the space to be maintained 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.869
 and the vertebrae are not pinching 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.090
 each other and I did not pinch my nerves 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.789
 this is accompanied with removing the disk 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.179
 how did you see at the beginning of this screen 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.950
 when you pass them the video, see how it is knotted 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.369
 the ligament at the end already when 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.039
 we are placing this is the 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:08.190
 amd attachment release and here 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.739
 we are seeing how it is at the end and 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.870
 how is the malinowski afi at the end 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.870
 see how is a space with one
