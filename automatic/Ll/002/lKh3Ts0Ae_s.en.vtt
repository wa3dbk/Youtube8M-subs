00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.770
 Hello dear viewers today 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.519
 us next class today we 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.769
 get acquainted with the kind of not yarn understand 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.699
 how to read all the recommendations 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.720
 on the label from the yarn and see at all 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.560
 what are 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.880
 strings and yarn store probably saw 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.189
 what a big 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.840
 general variety is now different 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.219
 types of thread and yarn 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.980
 and all that is, let's say baby acrylic 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.660
 of which you can knit baby things 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.290
 there are even such 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.270
 teddy here is such a teddy not. 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.719
 viscose cotton 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:49.739
 that only you will not find 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.809
 But from the fight crooked, yes, as I said 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.750
 you can knit baby things 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:01.199
 Well, here's an example, he is such a baby cap 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:05.189
 that is, it is warm but at the same time I 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:10.590
 I think that it will not be possible 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:16.290
 cause baby allergies to touch 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.439
 very nice it turns out so here from 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.409
 such a plush thread 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:25.880
 the truth here is from the hook I tied here such 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.650
 Here is a jumpsuit is obtained very 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.890
 wonderful warm plump kids 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.530
 things you can even knit cap probably 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.530
 yes anything from the wind 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.189
 very interesting this wool skirt 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.680
 next well that's just 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.979
 simple acrylic here in a few strings 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:02.610
 for him I have bound such a child 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:16.349
 the suit turned out to be warm too 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:22.130
 blouse shantiki booties here this 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:23.970
 cotton clap such carpenters are enough 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:32.970
 consists of several 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:35.519
 not so too 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.970
 tie some things for the summer I think 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.680
 more 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:44.370
 spring-summer here is an example of knitting 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.360
 so what about such pain 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.360
 plump 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.909
 but this is also a baby acrylic 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.200
 just wanted to show that there are more 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.709
 dyed threads 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.230
 in such an interesting way but such 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.970
 very interesting colors in one thread 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.409
 to allow not to combine before 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.739
 constantly not to change the thread can take here 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:22.150
 such that it is here it is binding like yourself 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:22.150
 leads what are obtained spring 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.370
 well let's say flakes yes that's more 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.370
 thin cotton 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:53.330
 it turns out more so thin 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:04:01.460
 Well, let's say such lace 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:03.970
 Beretki some more thin 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.470
 the thread is already in order to 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:13.600
 knit some lace or 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.600
 make out the edges of the product thread so 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.790
 thread can be kept while knitting 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.290
 in two ways first take this 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.290
 tricked by his little finger 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.800
 through both ring and middle finger 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.170
 hold and clamp the pointer to well then 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.150
 have here we will be knitting a fishing rod so 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:44.020
 let's go show my little finger again 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:47.470
 we wind it through 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:54.400
 ring and middle finger and point 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:59.810
 holding the second way is just 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:05.440
 we wrap little finger and that's it 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.440
 that is, the thread tension we are 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:18.679
 tips on 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:21.209
 train at home get the thread out like 

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:24.300
 that is, choose a suitable 

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:27.989
 way to start to knit like 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:36.080
 it is more convenient for you and now we will look at 

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:36.080
 The label on the wool is also not. 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:44.869
 here is the etiquette to what is written here 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:49.259
 it is written that yarn for hand knitting 

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:50.819
 the composition of mohair that is how much this yarn 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:55.469
 big hank 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:59.389
 100 grams 500 meters and everything is here 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:03.349
 recommendations knitting density average 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:06.889
 indicates the recommended size here 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:09.649
 needles needles three and a half four and 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:15.479
 hook 4 number 4 

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:19.009
 how to wash and iron not iron to compress 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.009
 you can not just hand wash 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.300
 Well, again, I will say yes 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:30.629
 thread but still in my opinion 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.819
 pretty thin if you take 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:44.969
 hook number four as recommended 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:51.959
 science kids then i think that will be knitting 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:54.389
 not very dense very beautiful on 

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:57.360
 my opinion I would take the size here 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:07:00.449
 hooks probably somewhere two and a half 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:04.019
 for now I just love not to be gone 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:08.099
 tight that all all kinds were 

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:11.339
 the same all the eyelets are the same but 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:15.179
 it is in the process of mating you already understand 

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:17.969
 what do you need for all what is your number 

00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:20.700
 hook the best fit because someone 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:24.690
 loves a more 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:26.910
 whether the whole product was more perforated or something 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:30.090
 let's say so freely and someone loves 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:32.520
 on the contrary that tight knitting was it 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:37.650
 it will be clear in the process of how you 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:41.310
 start knitting here so I showed it to you 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:46.140
 The main types are not as correct 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:50.640
 keep the thread how to read the packaging on 

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:52.950
 beach I hope you come in handy 

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.040
 My recommendation to all good luck to all until 

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.040
 until
