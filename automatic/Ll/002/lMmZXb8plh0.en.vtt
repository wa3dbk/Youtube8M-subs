00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.760

now that the glass is off I can begin to

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.220 
now that the glass is off I can begin to
remove<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.310> 8<00:02:30.490> t10<00:02:31.180> Torx<00:02:31.450> screws<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.170> are

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.140 
going to want to watch out for the
magnets<00:02:36.160> because<00:02:36.310> they<00:02:36.550> have<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> tendency<00:02:36.700> to

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
magnets because they have a tendency to

the case the LCD is pretty big and takes

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.440 
the case the LCD is pretty big and takes
up<00:03:12.830> most<00:03:13.160> of<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.520> space<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.060> case<00:03:14.240> has

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
up most of the space that the case has

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
big to get in there and lift it up I'm

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.490 
big to get in there and lift it up I'm
going<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.460> use<00:03:19.670> my<00:03:20.120> probe<00:03:20.360> tool<00:03:20.600> I'm<00:03:21.200> going<00:03:21.260> to

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
going to use my probe tool I'm going to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.560 
going to use my probe tool I'm going to
start<00:03:21.770> lifting<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.250> LCD<00:03:22.730> from<00:03:22.940> near<00:03:23.210> the<00:03:23.360> top

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
start lifting the LCD from near the top

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.360 
start lifting the LCD from near the top
of<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.840> computer<00:03:23.990> and<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.650> do<00:03:24.830> that<00:03:24.980> I'm<00:03:25.190> going

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
of the computer and to do that I'm going

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.620 
of the computer and to do that I'm going
to<00:03:25.460> have<00:03:25.580> to<00:03:25.670> rotate<00:03:25.820> it<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.300> get<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:26.450> better

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
to have to rotate it to get a better

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:42.100 
to have to rotate it to get a better
angle<00:03:39.700> okay<00:03:40.700> now<00:03:41.060> that<00:03:41.270> I've<00:03:41.360> got<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.600> LCD

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
angle okay now that I've got the LCD

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.870 
angle okay now that I've got the LCD
slightly<00:03:42.709> lifted<00:03:43.070> out<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.400> case<00:03:43.610> I'm

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
slightly lifted out of the case I'm

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.340 
slightly lifted out of the case I'm
going<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.150> be<00:03:44.240> careful<00:03:44.570> not<00:03:44.660> to<00:03:44.840> lift<00:03:44.990> it<00:03:45.110> too

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
going to be careful not to lift it too

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.900 
going to be careful not to lift it too
far<00:03:45.590> because<00:03:45.920> there's<00:03:46.340> still<00:03:46.520> a<00:03:46.580> bunch<00:03:46.760> of

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
far because there's still a bunch of

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.060 
far because there's still a bunch of
cables<00:03:47.120> connected<00:03:47.810> underneath<00:03:48.050> to<00:03:48.740> start

cables connected underneath to start
disconnecting<00:03:49.370> those<00:03:49.820> I'll<00:03:50.060> begin<00:03:50.209> with<00:03:50.330> the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
disconnecting those I'll begin with the

00:03:50.540 --> 00:04:16.370 
disconnecting those I'll begin with the
vertical<00:03:51.050> sync<00:03:51.320> cable

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.479 

now<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.560> I've<00:04:17.650> got<00:04:17.799> all<00:04:17.829> four<00:04:18.250> of<00:04:18.280> those

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
remove the LCD from the outer case now

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.600 
remove the LCD from the outer case now
just<00:04:22.990> like<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.199> glass<00:04:23.560> when<00:04:23.979> you<00:04:24.100> remove<00:04:24.400> the

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
just like the glass when you remove the

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.550 
just like the glass when you remove the
LCD<00:04:24.729> you<00:04:25.389> want<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.780> make<00:04:25.900> sure<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:26.320> put<00:04:26.470> it

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
LCD you want to make sure to put it

LCD you want to make sure to put it
somewhere<00:04:26.800> safe<00:04:32.820> now<00:04:33.820> that<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.120> LCD<00:04:34.449> is<00:04:34.750> off

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
somewhere safe now that the LCD is off

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.750 
somewhere safe now that the LCD is off
we<00:04:35.139> get<00:04:35.229> our<00:04:35.350> first<00:04:35.710> real<00:04:36.130> glimpse<00:04:36.340> at<00:04:36.729> the

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
we get our first real glimpse at the

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.670 
we get our first real glimpse at the
inside<00:04:37.180> of<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.389> iMac<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:37.960> I'll<00:04:38.199> go<00:04:38.380> ahead<00:04:38.560> and

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
inside of the iMac and I'll go ahead and

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.550 
inside of the iMac and I'll go ahead and
rotate<00:04:38.800> it<00:04:39.070> around<00:04:39.250> so<00:04:39.460> you<00:04:39.520> can<00:04:39.639> see<00:04:39.789> it<00:04:40.560> we

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
rotate it around so you can see it we

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.770 
rotate it around so you can see it we
can<00:04:41.710> actually<00:04:41.919> start<00:04:42.520> to<00:04:42.820> get<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.449> work<00:04:43.600> on

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
can actually start to get to work on

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.540 
can actually start to get to work on
