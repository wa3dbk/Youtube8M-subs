00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
james shields are both high numbers so

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:13.730 
james shields are both high numbers so
we're<00:06:12.569> going<00:06:12.659> to<00:06:12.750> put<00:06:12.810> those<00:06:12.990> up<00:06:13.050> so<00:06:13.469> that<00:06:13.620> you

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
we're going to put those up so that you

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.649 
we're going to put those up so that you
can<00:06:13.889> see<00:06:14.099> them<00:06:14.310> also<00:06:15.090> there<00:06:15.300> are<00:06:15.330> two

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
can see them also there are two

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.050 
can see them also there are two
different<00:06:15.990> types<00:06:16.199> of<00:06:16.729> variations<00:06:17.729> that<00:06:17.879> are

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
different types of variations that are

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.300 
different types of variations that are
being<00:06:18.509> I<00:06:18.810> guess<00:06:18.990> discovered<00:06:19.590> as<00:06:19.800> we<00:06:20.009> speak

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
being I guess discovered as we speak

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.850 
being I guess discovered as we speak
there<00:06:20.879> are<00:06:20.909> color<00:06:21.509> swap<00:06:21.960> variations<00:06:22.710> I'm

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
there are color swap variations I'm

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.219 
there are color swap variations I'm
assuming<00:06:23.310> that<00:06:23.430> means<00:06:23.659> colors<00:06:24.659> will<00:06:24.870> change

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
assuming that means colors will change

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.230 
assuming that means colors will change
on<00:06:25.530> the<00:06:25.680> bottom<00:06:26.039> between<00:06:26.400> where<00:06:26.639> the<00:06:26.669> name<00:06:27.000> is

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
better look at them Elsberry Morgan who

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.189 
better look at them Elsberry Morgan who
I<00:06:41.430> mentioned<00:06:41.879> before<00:06:42.000> is<00:06:42.330> a<00:06:42.360> little<00:06:42.629> psychotic

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 
I mentioned before is a little psychotic

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:46.430 
I mentioned before is a little psychotic
Fowler<00:06:44.240> who<00:06:45.240> I<00:06:45.300> mentioned<00:06:45.509> before<00:06:45.719> his<00:06:46.020> hats<00:06:46.259> a

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
Fowler who I mentioned before his hats a

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.089 
Fowler who I mentioned before his hats a
little<00:06:46.620> too<00:06:46.770> big<00:06:46.949> and<00:06:48.110> David<00:06:49.110> Price<00:06:49.349> me<00:06:50.009> at

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.099 
little too big and David Price me at

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:51.700 
little too big and David Price me at
least<00:06:50.279> these<00:06:50.370> are<00:06:50.460> the<00:06:50.550> ones<00:06:50.669> that<00:06:50.729> i<00:06:50.879> got<00:06:51.090> and

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
least these are the ones that i got and

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.749 
least these are the ones that i got and
also<00:06:52.710> Mariano<00:06:53.520> Rivera<00:06:53.879> so<00:06:54.240> these<00:06:54.930> guys<00:06:55.759> could

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 
also Mariano Rivera so these guys could

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:58.730 
also Mariano Rivera so these guys could
exist<00:06:57.389> in<00:06:57.509> variations<00:06:58.110> that<00:06:58.259> I<00:06:58.409> guess<00:06:58.590> the

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
exist in variations that I guess the

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.409 
exist in variations that I guess the
hobby<00:06:58.919> has<00:06:59.099> yet<00:06:59.340> to<00:06:59.460> really<00:06:59.639> come<00:07:00.180> to<00:07:00.270> grips

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 
hobby has yet to really come to grips

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.899 
hobby has yet to really come to grips
with<00:07:00.599> and<00:07:00.990> there<00:07:01.529> are<00:07:01.620> also<00:07:01.830> image<00:07:02.580> swap

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:02.909 
with and there are also image swap

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:05.540 
with and there are also image swap
variation<00:07:03.569> so<00:07:03.719> I'm<00:07:03.810> assuming<00:07:04.099> you<00:07:05.099> can<00:07:05.250> find

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
variation so I'm assuming you can find

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.850 
variation so I'm assuming you can find
cards<00:07:06.180> for<00:07:06.330> instance<00:07:06.629> this<00:07:06.779> Joe<00:07:07.050> Mauer<00:07:07.289> is<00:07:07.469> one

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
cards for instance this Joe Mauer is one

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.579 
cards for instance this Joe Mauer is one
you<00:07:08.009> might<00:07:08.129> be<00:07:08.250> able<00:07:08.339> to<00:07:08.550> find<00:07:08.819> a<00:07:09.180> card<00:07:09.960> with

00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:10.589 
you might be able to find a card with

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:13.100 
you might be able to find a card with
this<00:07:11.370> picture<00:07:11.729> the<00:07:12.150> one<00:07:12.270> on<00:07:12.300> the<00:07:12.449> bottom<00:07:12.479> here

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.110 
this picture the one on the bottom here

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.559 
this picture the one on the bottom here
on<00:07:13.680> the<00:07:13.919> top<00:07:14.069> and<00:07:14.370> the<00:07:14.610> head<00:07:14.909> shot<00:07:15.210> on<00:07:15.449> the
