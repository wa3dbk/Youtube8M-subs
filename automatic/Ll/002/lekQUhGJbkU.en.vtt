curse<00:01:40.079> yeah<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.409> was<00:01:40.530> really<00:01:40.710> interesting

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
curse yeah I was really interesting

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.069 
curse yeah I was really interesting
because<00:01:41.400> they<00:01:41.850> didn't<00:01:42.210> give<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.509> too<00:01:42.930> much

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
because they didn't give up too much

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.660 
because they didn't give up too much
dragon<00:01:43.590> control<00:01:43.920> by<00:01:44.040> doing<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.490> because

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
dragon control by doing that because

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.889 
dragon control by doing that because
then<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.939> could<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.119> stall<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.630> out<00:01:45.720> have

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
then you could just stall it out have

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.899 
then you could just stall it out have
tristana<00:01:46.320> run<00:01:46.619> from<00:01:46.829> top<00:01:47.100> lane<00:01:47.369> down<00:01:47.610> there<00:01:47.790> if

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
tristana run from top lane down there if

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.609 
tristana run from top lane down there if
the<00:01:48.180> dragon<00:01:48.479> was<00:01:48.600> started<00:01:48.930> at<00:01:49.020> all<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.500> they

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
the dragon was started at all but they

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.139 
the dragon was started at all but they
also<00:01:49.799> had<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.040> gold<00:01:50.280> generation<00:01:50.729> item<00:01:51.030> on

also had a gold generation item on
laminations<00:01:51.659> Morgana<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.320> he<00:01:52.380> took<00:01:52.530> some<00:01:52.740> CS

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
laminations Morgana and he took some CS

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.859 
laminations Morgana and he took some CS
for<00:01:53.220> himself<00:01:53.340> too<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.850> they<00:01:53.939> had<00:01:54.090> about<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.270> 500

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
for himself too so they had about a 500

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.959 
for himself too so they had about a 500
gold<00:01:55.049> lead<00:01:55.259> before<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.040> dragon<00:01:56.520> fight<00:01:56.700> even

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
gold lead before that dragon fight even

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.060

started that they did all show up to so

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.649 
started that they did all show up to so
the<00:01:59.159> lane<00:01:59.310> swap<00:01:59.490> was<00:01:59.670> very<00:01:59.969> intelligent<00:02:00.299> by

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
the lane swap was very intelligent by

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.510 
the lane swap was very intelligent by
cloud<00:02:00.869> nine<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.140> do<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.530> sneaky<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.280> kind<00:02:02.460> of

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
cloud nine to do and sneaky is kind of

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.999 
cloud nine to do and sneaky is kind of
the<00:02:02.610> MVP<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.329> team<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:04.079> split<00:02:04.560> because

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
the MVP of that team this split because

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.980 
the MVP of that team this split because
he's<00:02:05.250> been<00:02:05.430> very<00:02:05.610> consistent<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.390> why<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:06.780> put

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
he's been very consistent so why not put

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.779 
he's been very consistent so why not put
some<00:02:07.170> free<00:02:07.350> farm<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.770> him<00:02:07.950> where<00:02:08.340> he<00:02:08.459> doesn't

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
some free farm on him where he doesn't

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.790 
some free farm on him where he doesn't
have<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.060> go<00:02:09.209> up<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.569> matchup<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.379> you

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
have to go up in a matchup so you

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.440 
have to go up in a matchup so you

into that as replay

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
into that as replay
because<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.920> think<00:02:13.980> we're<00:02:14.159> gonna<00:02:14.250> get<00:02:14.400> pretty

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
because I think we're gonna get pretty

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.580 
because I think we're gonna get pretty
in<00:02:14.819> depth<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.330> as<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.810> was<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:15.989> huge

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
in depth with it as it was a huge

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.589 
in depth with it as it was a huge
turning<00:02:16.980> point<00:02:17.129> in<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.940> game<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.360> kind<00:02:18.569> of

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
turning point in the game and kind of

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.940 
turning point in the game and kind of
where<00:02:18.750> everything<00:02:18.840> fell<00:02:19.230> apart<00:02:19.319> for<00:02:19.620> curse<00:02:19.799> so

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
where everything fell apart for curse so

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.470 
where everything fell apart for curse so
we're<00:02:20.040> gonna<00:02:20.159> pull<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.459> up<00:02:20.519> on<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.970> your

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
we're gonna pull that up on to your

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.649 
we're gonna pull that up on to your
screen<00:02:21.870> here<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.319> prolly<00:02:22.650> take<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.519> away<00:02:23.700> yeah

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
screen here and prolly take it away yeah

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.780 
screen here and prolly take it away yeah
so<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> Soaker<00:02:25.799> starting<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> dragon

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
so this is a Soaker starting the dragon

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.289 
so this is a Soaker starting the dragon
and<00:02:27.110> we<00:02:28.110> can<00:02:28.230> start<00:02:28.349> rolling<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.830> right<00:02:29.549> now<00:02:29.700> we

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
and we can start rolling it right now we

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.910 
and we can start rolling it right now we
swatch<00:02:30.599> balls<00:02:30.900> he<00:02:31.110> starts<00:02:31.319> backing<00:02:31.500> up<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.829> his

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
swatch balls he starts backing up to his

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.380 
swatch balls he starts backing up to his
turret<00:02:32.220> because<00:02:32.430> he<00:02:32.549> wants<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:32.879> get<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.120> TP

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
turret because he wants to get that TP

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.170 
turret because he wants to get that TP
up<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.720> falls<00:02:34.620> actually<00:02:35.010> gets<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.400> early<00:02:35.760> TP

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
up and falls actually gets the early TP

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.180 
up and falls actually gets the early TP
which<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.599> very<00:02:36.870> advantageous<00:02:37.079> and<00:02:37.860> then

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
which is very advantageous and then

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.520 
which is very advantageous and then
we're<00:02:38.310> gonna<00:02:38.400> freeze<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.970> right<00:02:39.000> boundary<00:02:39.530> so

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
we're gonna freeze it right boundary so

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.770 
we're gonna freeze it right boundary so
quast<00:02:41.370> responds<00:02:41.879> immediately<00:02:41.970> because<00:02:42.659> he

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
quast responds immediately because he

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.420 
quast responds immediately because he
knows<00:02:42.959> his<00:02:43.319> team's<00:02:43.560> already<00:02:43.920> dedicated<00:02:44.069> to

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
knows his team's already dedicated to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.430 
knows his team's already dedicated to
dragon<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:44.940> they<00:02:45.150> need<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.360> do<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
dragon and they need to do it the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.020 
dragon and they need to do it the
problem<00:02:46.769> with<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.160> they<00:02:47.579> have<00:02:47.730> four

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
problem with this is they have four

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.089 
problem with this is they have four
people<00:02:48.329> around<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.690> dragon<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.140> quoz<00:02:49.829> is

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
people around the dragon and quoz is

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.890 
people around the dragon and quoz is
technically<00:02:50.510> overextending<00:02:51.510> although<00:02:51.720> he's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
technically overextending although he's

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.349 
technically overextending although he's
not<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.200> there<00:02:52.349> so<00:02:53.160> at<00:02:53.489> this<00:02:53.700> point<00:02:53.910> they<00:02:54.209> need

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
not in there so at this point they need

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.960 
not in there so at this point they need
to<00:02:54.510> either<00:02:54.870> turn<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.709> help<00:02:56.160> cross<00:02:56.400> or<00:02:56.819> they

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
to either turn and help cross or they

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.280 
to either turn and help cross or they
need<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.150> cut<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.569> run<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.870> costing<00:02:58.170> us<00:02:58.230> a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
need a cut and run and costing us a

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.509 
need a cut and run and costing us a
flash<00:02:58.500> out<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.890> they<00:02:58.950> need<00:02:59.069> to<00:02:59.159> pick<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.430> new

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
flash out and they need to pick a new

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.970 
flash out and they need to pick a new
engage<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:01.049> we<00:03:01.170> can<00:03:01.319> roll<00:03:01.470> right<00:03:01.620> now<00:03:01.769> and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
engage but we can roll right now and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.589 
engage but we can roll right now and
notice<00:03:02.489> that<00:03:02.609> they<00:03:02.700> do<00:03:02.760> neither<00:03:03.209> they

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
notice that they do neither they

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.330 
notice that they do neither they
actually<00:03:03.750> have<00:03:04.049> cost<00:03:04.319> flash<00:03:04.620> out<00:03:04.859> but<00:03:05.220> they

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
actually have cost flash out but they

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.430 
actually have cost flash out but they
stay<00:03:05.670> in<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.030> fight<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.510> they<00:03:07.019> actually<00:03:07.290> have

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
stay in the fight and they actually have

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.589 
stay in the fight and they actually have
both<00:03:07.859> my<00:03:08.010> goal<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.310> before<00:03:08.790> they<00:03:08.909> can<00:03:09.060> relocate

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
both my goal in before they can relocate

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.509 
both my goal in before they can relocate
and<00:03:09.930> now<00:03:10.530> they're<00:03:10.890> already<00:03:11.099> at<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.280> health

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
and now they're already at a health

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.399 
and now they're already at a health
disadvantage<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.239> they<00:03:12.629> use<00:03:12.840> their<00:03:13.079> yah<00:03:13.230> so

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
disadvantage and they use their yah so

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.470 
disadvantage and they use their yah so
all's<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.709> got<00:03:13.739> exhausted<00:03:14.099> so<00:03:14.790> they<00:03:15.299> basically

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
all's I got exhausted so they basically

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.539 
all's I got exhausted so they basically
are<00:03:15.900> down<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.440> ultimate<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.980> start<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:17.310> fight

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
are down to ultimate to start this fight

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.150 
are down to ultimate to start this fight
and<00:03:17.760> at<00:03:18.389> this<00:03:18.599> point<00:03:18.780> it's<00:03:18.989> just<00:03:19.019> cloud<00:03:19.980> nine

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
and at this point it's just cloud nine

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.250 
and at this point it's just cloud nine
trying<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.519> clean<00:03:20.669> up<00:03:20.790> after<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.959> know<00:03:22.049> they

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
trying to clean up after you know they

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.420 
trying to clean up after you know they
take<00:03:22.380> damage<00:03:22.590> from<00:03:22.739> dragon<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.310> they're

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
take damage from dragon so they're

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.979 
take damage from dragon so they're
already<00:03:23.549> weak<00:03:23.910> around<00:03:24.150> Chris<00:03:24.299> aside<00:03:24.599> yeah

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
already weak around Chris aside yeah

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:25.789 
already weak around Chris aside yeah
when<00:03:25.109> you<00:03:25.169> put<00:03:25.319> yourself<00:03:25.590> in<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.709> situation

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
when you put yourself in that situation

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.680 
when you put yourself in that situation
I<00:03:26.579> was<00:03:26.700> think<00:03:26.849> about<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.030> hypothetical<00:03:27.540> there

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
I was think about the hypothetical there

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.720 
I was think about the hypothetical there
quast<00:03:28.200> he<00:03:28.500> could<00:03:28.769> have<00:03:28.859> just<00:03:28.919> stayed<00:03:29.310> where<00:03:29.700> he

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
quast he could have just stayed where he

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.490 
quast he could have just stayed where he
was<00:03:29.849> cuz<00:03:30.239> three<00:03:30.569> people<00:03:30.870> clumped<00:03:31.169> up<00:03:31.200> on<00:03:31.379> him

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
was cuz three people clumped up on him

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.110 
was cuz three people clumped up on him
they<00:03:31.620> missed<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.040> cocoon<00:03:32.400> if<00:03:32.609> he<00:03:32.879> had<00:03:32.970> all

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
they missed the cocoon if he had all

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.460 
they missed the cocoon if he had all
teed<00:03:33.450> himself<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.079> would<00:03:34.200> have<00:03:34.319> been<00:03:34.410> a

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
teed himself it would have been a

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.409 
teed himself it would have been a
three-man<00:03:35.040> possibly<00:03:35.579> form<00:03:35.849> an<00:03:35.970> ultimate

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
three-man possibly form an ultimate

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.030 
three-man possibly form an ultimate
therefore<00:03:36.750> Yasuo<00:03:37.169> which<00:03:37.530> he<00:03:37.620> ended<00:03:37.739> up<00:03:37.799> only

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
therefore Yasuo which he ended up only

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.530 
therefore Yasuo which he ended up only
using<00:03:38.370> on<00:03:38.459> high<00:03:38.639> and<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.180> were<00:03:39.269> talking<00:03:39.480> about

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
using on high and you were talking about

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.300 
using on high and you were talking about
this<00:03:39.780> where<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.019> can't<00:03:40.290> blow<00:03:40.650> up<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:40.980> Zed

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
this where you can't blow up a Zed

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.400 
this where you can't blow up a Zed
unless<00:03:42.180> everybody<00:03:42.810> is<00:03:42.930> on<00:03:43.049> him<00:03:43.109> because<00:03:43.260> I

unless everybody is on him because I

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.720 
unless everybody is on him because I
just<00:03:43.650> has<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:43.859> much<00:03:43.980> mobility<00:03:44.280> he's<00:03:44.549> very

scenarios that curse could have played

out<00:03:57.720> in<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:57.989> situation<00:03:58.319> probably<00:03:59.129> as

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
out in that situation probably as

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.460 
out in that situation probably as
someone<00:03:59.609> who<00:03:59.790> has<00:03:59.819> played<00:04:00.359> in<00:04:00.599> high<00:04:00.930> intensity

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
games like this team comes is it time

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.349 
games like this team comes is it time
for<00:04:04.260> everyone<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:04.769> be<00:04:04.859> quiet<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.459> one<00:04:05.970> person

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
for everyone to be quiet and one person

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.509 
for everyone to be quiet and one person
is<00:04:06.449> making<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.840> calls<00:04:07.079> or<00:04:07.319> is<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.739> relying<00:04:08.340> on

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
is making the calls or is it relying on

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.339 
is making the calls or is it relying on
instinct<00:04:09.120> there<00:04:09.329> and<00:04:09.510> trusting<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:09.900> quast

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
instinct there and trusting that quast

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.319 
instinct there and trusting that quast
will<00:04:10.650> make<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:10.949> right<00:04:11.160> decision<00:04:11.730> how<00:04:12.180> does

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
will make the right decision how does

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.900 
will make the right decision how does
that<00:04:12.419> go<00:04:12.629> I'm<00:04:13.500> not<00:04:13.709> quite<00:04:13.980> sure<00:04:14.010> how<00:04:14.340> curses

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
that go I'm not quite sure how curses

that go I'm not quite sure how curses
voice<00:04:15.510> comms<00:04:15.870> go<00:04:16.079> or<00:04:16.349> who's<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:17.039> shot<00:04:17.250> caller

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370

play this best-of-five against they

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.460 
play this best-of-five against they
surrendered<00:05:10.060> so<00:05:10.690> they<00:05:10.810> didn't<00:05:11.140> have<00:05:11.290> to

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
surrendered so they didn't have to

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.590 
surrendered so they didn't have to
continue<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.130> go<00:05:12.310> through<00:05:12.340> that<00:05:12.670> burden<00:05:13.240> they

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
continue to go through that burden they

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.930 
continue to go through that burden they
can<00:05:13.810> regroup<00:05:14.500> they<00:05:15.370> can<00:05:15.580> give<00:05:15.730> themselves

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
can regroup they can give themselves

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.940 
can regroup they can give themselves
some<00:05:16.330> time<00:05:16.660> and<00:05:16.930> they<00:05:17.320> don't<00:05:17.500> have<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:17.800> keep

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
some time and they don't have to keep

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
some time and they don't have to keep
taking<00:05:18.250> that<00:05:18.280> beating<00:05:18.730> so<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:18.880> think

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
taking that beating so I think

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.030 
taking that beating so I think
surrendering<00:05:19.480> actually<00:05:20.230> was<00:05:20.380> a<00:05:20.410> kind<00:05:20.890> of<00:05:20.980> a

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
surrendering actually was a kind of a

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.860 
surrendering actually was a kind of a
good<00:05:21.160> idea<00:05:21.400> by<00:05:21.610> them<00:05:21.790> in<00:05:22.000> that<00:05:22.210> regard<00:05:22.570> to<00:05:22.750> keep

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
good idea by them in that regard to keep

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.150 
good idea by them in that regard to keep
their<00:05:22.990> mentality<00:05:23.140> up<00:05:23.590> and<00:05:23.740> keep<00:05:23.890> their

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
their mentality up and keep their

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.670 
their mentality up and keep their
outlook<00:05:25.120> positive<00:05:25.630> I<00:05:25.810> feel<00:05:26.260> like<00:05:26.350> this<00:05:26.500> runner

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
outlook positive I feel like this runner

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.880 
outlook positive I feel like this runner
definitely<00:05:27.310> it<00:05:27.910> puts<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:28.660> stop<00:05:28.900> to<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:29.320> guess<00:05:29.470> the

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
definitely it puts a stop to I guess the

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.560 
definitely it puts a stop to I guess the
pain<00:05:30.130> of<00:05:30.340> having<00:05:31.060> to<00:05:31.240> live<00:05:31.390> through<00:05:31.510> it

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
pain of having to live through it

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.270

side<00:05:52.150> of<00:05:52.180> the<00:05:52.330> map<00:05:52.600> so<00:05:53.050> my<00:05:53.170> final<00:05:53.350> question<00:05:53.590> do

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
side of the map so my final question do

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.620 
side of the map so my final question do
you<00:05:53.890> probably<00:05:54.250> is<00:05:54.370> what<00:05:55.120> are<00:05:55.180> we<00:05:55.270> going<00:05:55.360> to<00:05:55.450> see

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
you probably is what are we going to see

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.300 
you probably is what are we going to see
in<00:05:55.810> pics<00:05:56.050> bands<00:05:56.290> we<00:05:56.470> can<00:05:56.590> see<00:05:56.740> that<00:05:56.860> Zed<00:05:57.130> off

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
in pics bands we can see that Zed off

in pics bands we can see that Zed off
the<00:05:57.430> board<00:05:57.640> I<00:05:57.820> think<00:05:58.720> it'd<00:05:58.810> be<00:05:58.840> really<00:05:58.930> smart

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
the board I think it'd be really smart

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.620 
the board I think it'd be really smart
to<00:05:59.500> banzett<00:05:59.980> I<00:06:00.190> think<00:06:00.580> that's<00:06:00.820> just<00:06:00.910> a<00:06:01.300> high

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
to banzett I think that's just a high

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.600 
to banzett I think that's just a high
staple<00:06:02.140> champion<00:06:02.470> similar<00:06:02.800> to<00:06:02.980> beer<00:06:03.370> since

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
staple champion similar to beer since

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.850 
staple champion similar to beer since
endurance<00:06:04.120> that<00:06:04.330> it's<00:06:04.570> just<00:06:04.810> regardless<00:06:05.740> of

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
endurance that it's just regardless of

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.740 
endurance that it's just regardless of
he's<00:06:06.010> played<00:06:06.250> a<00:06:06.280> recently<00:06:06.640> you<00:06:07.150> know<00:06:07.360> he<00:06:07.570> knows

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
he's played a recently you know he knows

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.060 
he's played a recently you know he knows
the<00:06:08.020> ins<00:06:08.140> and<00:06:08.290> out<00:06:08.410> of<00:06:08.500> that<00:06:08.530> champion<00:06:08.920> and

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
the ins and out of that champion and

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.740 
the ins and out of that champion and
it's<00:06:09.220> really<00:06:09.460> scary<00:06:09.730> for<00:06:09.910> him<00:06:09.970> so<00:06:10.480> I<00:06:10.510> could

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
it's really scary for him so I could

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.690 
it's really scary for him so I could
foresee<00:06:11.200> maybe<00:06:11.470> a<00:06:11.560> first<00:06:11.920> pic<00:06:12.160> said<00:06:12.430> on<00:06:12.640> a

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
foresee maybe a first pic said on a

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.200 
foresee maybe a first pic said on a
curse<00:06:13.540> aside<00:06:14.040> maybe<00:06:15.040> that<00:06:15.310> maybe<00:06:15.550> I<00:06:15.670> tristana

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
curse aside maybe that maybe I tristana

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.820 
curse aside maybe that maybe I tristana
and<00:06:16.390> try<00:06:16.480> to<00:06:16.540> pull<00:06:16.780> it<00:06:16.810> mid<00:06:17.140> so<00:06:17.560> I<00:06:17.590> think<00:06:17.740> they

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
and try to pull it mid so I think they

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.080 
and try to pull it mid so I think they
actually<00:06:18.070> have<00:06:18.160> a<00:06:18.190> lot<00:06:18.310> of<00:06:18.370> room<00:06:18.640> I<00:06:18.850> don't

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
actually have a lot of room I don't

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.730 
actually have a lot of room I don't
think<00:06:19.120> that<00:06:19.360> game<00:06:19.600> decides<00:06:20.080> what<00:06:20.350> they<00:06:20.440> need

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
think that game decides what they need

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.550 
think that game decides what they need
to<00:06:20.770> do<00:06:21.070> they<00:06:21.670> still<00:06:22.510> have<00:06:22.540> another<00:06:23.080> game<00:06:23.350> or

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
to do they still have another game or

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.350 
to do they still have another game or
two<00:06:23.920> games<00:06:24.130> to<00:06:24.370> lose<00:06:24.520> will<00:06:24.670> further<00:06:24.820> out<00:06:25.030> so<00:06:25.330> I

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
two games to lose will further out so I

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.940 
two games to lose will further out so I
think<00:06:25.570> they<00:06:25.630> have<00:06:25.660> a<00:06:25.780> lot<00:06:25.960> more<00:06:26.110> room<00:06:26.440> to<00:06:26.710> kind

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950 
think they have a lot more room to kind

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.040 
think they have a lot more room to kind
of<00:06:27.010> you<00:06:27.340> know<00:06:27.370> do<00:06:27.850> what<00:06:27.970> they<00:06:28.090> want<00:06:28.240> to<00:06:28.300> do<00:06:28.450> the

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050
