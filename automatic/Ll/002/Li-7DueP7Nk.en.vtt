00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
firstly that your dog is a good

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.490 
firstly that your dog is a good

candidate for these drugs because if the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.080 
candidate for these drugs because if the

dogs got liver and kidney disease it's

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.259 
dogs got liver and kidney disease it's
probably<00:04:09.449> not<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.900> good<00:04:10.079> candidate<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:11.269> also

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
probably not a good candidate and also

most of these episodes these tragic
episodes<00:04:33.750> have<00:04:33.960> been<00:04:34.070> in<00:04:35.070> dogs<00:04:35.370> with

the proportions in the world some dogs

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:50.700 
the proportions in the world some dogs

statistically<00:05:54.009> these<00:05:54.879> aren't<00:05:55.120> very<00:05:55.240> likely

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
statistically these aren't very likely

but<00:05:55.810> if<00:05:55.959> they<00:05:56.169> are<00:05:56.319> going<00:05:56.740> to<00:05:56.830> happen<00:05:57.279> it<00:05:57.939> is

00:05:57.989 --> 00:05:57.999 
but if they are going to happen it is

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:00.239 
but if they are going to happen it is
most<00:05:58.779> likely<00:05:58.899> to<00:05:59.229> happen<00:05:59.439> within<00:05:59.800> the<00:05:59.979> first

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:00.249 
most likely to happen within the first
