00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
this one for example and you just select

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.179 
this one for example and you just select
the<00:01:10.770> design<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.310> want<00:01:11.900> it<00:01:12.900> closed<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.619> then

broadcasting in flash I could choose a
flash<00:03:08.329> player<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:08.720> my<00:03:09.290> flash<00:03:09.560> parent<00:03:09.980> what

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
flash player and my flash parent what

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.710 
flash player and my flash parent what

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
the player will update so one of the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.210
