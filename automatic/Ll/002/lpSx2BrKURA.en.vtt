 Many have played there almost all for a long time 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.910

 spent much time at home 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.739
 household consciousness principle followed 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.650
 most 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.630

 against Peter prunes if you know was 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.540
 voted khl best 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.280
 powerful it does not hurt you that he takes away from 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.049
 you lara such a strongman or vice versa 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.790
 good that you two of you stand out from the team 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.250
 Now in defense in the attack here such 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.350
 powerful guys yes no mini shame and 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.260
 honestly for this title never 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.060
 Guyana does not have pursued could be better would be 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.299
 better is the appearance of this for a long time 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.319

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.340
 studied as a team and how you 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.400
 noted yes now we will have and protection 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.980
 and the attack says everything is fine with 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.510
 so good health you probably 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.670

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.670

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.489

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.739
 technique honing dong atmosphere such 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.629
 good how would such a coach like 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.730
 visit 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:59.109
 every word must be absorbed because 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:02.290
 that he has such an experience to learn something 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:06.310
 and there is where to grow as it turned out when I 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.379
 arrived there for the first time so with 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:13.349
 good mood prom with very good 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:16.630
 We are entering a new season. We hope that 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.340
 We will delight our fans with whom 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.180
 you had to meet icons or all 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.750
 know not all know but still we 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.550
 intersected against each other and played 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.280
 I recognize naturally well trumpeter 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.830
 Artyukhina village who maxim familiar too 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.830
 since the family so 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.310
 so many years on the same job, everyone is already all 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.220
 know how shorter the tallest of 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.000
 teams but generally alexey appears you 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:51.350
 competitor 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:56.720
 and you share almost sura with Peter Y. 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:59.050
 Tashkent city on pavel over the summer but 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.550
 they say at reception also grew therefore 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.050
 you may have to save perchi 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.430
 I’m not looking for this role yet 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.520
 saw you see you tomorrow 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.520
 we put up where we were what we did 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:24.470
 where was so little traveled to Lebanon 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:28.520
 traveled very much you on the south 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:32.830
 America rolled a little bit well 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:38.690
 spent lips psycho below 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:42.280
 taught the whole equator what tasks in 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.350
 Atlanta this year you have personal team 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.419
 nobody has ever set tasks for us but has disappeared 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.900
 she will be the first task to get into alloys 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:55.570
 there we will continue to look and 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:57.919
 understand but I naturally first 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.660
 hold our injuries there were no 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:03.919
 try to avoid well 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:06.260
 prepare to help the team perform 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.780
 the result will be set but 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:12.190
 the team of course strengthened all the guys 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.200
 who came all with names to all 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:18.550
 all very good skills that is 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:22.510
 who play you think the team 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.130
 appointed strengthened this year because 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.470
 that the main goal was not such 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.330
 failures like last year when there was 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.500
 One month we could not win 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.210
 that is, there should be nothing 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.140
 predicts this by nash was 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.790
 psychological climate for a good team 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.800
 all the guys played for each other all 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:46.170
 completely surrendered to every match and 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.170
 then I think everything will be fine
