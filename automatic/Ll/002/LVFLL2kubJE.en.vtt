00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.940
 Good day with you again Nastya 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.820
 and not mesh today my darling 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.210
 we'll talk about the spectrum he dagames 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.880
 the main characters of the acclaimed cartoon 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.850
 hunter monster school is hard to miss 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.789
 this tricky and everywhere a real journalist 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.060
 which keeps its hands on the pulse of the most 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.519
 fresh gossip and news and on girl 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.570
 comes from the English word spectrum 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.380
 that is ghost 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.500
 and the last name is der geist from german von 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.800
 der geist i.e. translation means 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.320
 from the ghost or from the spirit I believe that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.510
 image spectra inspired by popular 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.870
 American gossip girl series 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.450
 or gossip girl main character 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.629
 the series also maintains a popular blog 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.329
 gossip who read absolutely everything and 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.539
 sometimes what she writes in her blog 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.960
 greatly affects the fate of others 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.510
 besides for the entire time of the show no one so 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.729
 did not see the face of this ghost blogger 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.549
 gossip 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.650
 well and the spectrum of a purebred ghost for 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.680
 which does not exist closed doors 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.560
 or walls to collect gossip this time 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.799
 spit so if you're interested 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.369
 spectrum and she set out to write about you 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.670
 little article 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.009
 you do not hide from the diary spectrum we 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.549
 we learn that she is not just from the royal 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.759
 families 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.060
 and you can say five minutes to the princess 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.920
 since her father was to become 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.680
 ruler of a powerful state 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.259
 if the envious uncle had not done 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.509
 conspiracy and not cast out his success in the world 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.450
 monster new cartoon and puts everything on their 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.420
 places and revealing to us even more about life 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.630
 spectra if you still remember that this 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.420
 last name spectra background how things done to 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.720
 it becomes clear that the spectrum of princesses 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.049
 ghosts she found it difficult to return there 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.330
 because the pain of betrayal and and 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.930
 bitter memories still make of themselves 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.479
 know 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.239
 although friends she is likely the truth 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.239
 not yet ready to open even when they are with 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.760
 girls floated on the river river stiks 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.250
 Spectra clarified that they are with parents 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.739
 moved closer to monster high 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.560
 considering that the spectrum there will be much 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.019
 better but we all understand that 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.600
 parent most likely just wanted 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.600
 save the life of your ghostly daughter 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.310
 from the greedy uncle who occupied her throne 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.989
 father's 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.569
 feel this story is far from 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.720
 complete and we're not just going back in to 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.660
 the past the spectra of the product family in the world 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.540
 monsters do not accidentally ghosts because 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.030
 most are negative against 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.750
 monsters considering those aggressive 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.120
 villains 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.670
 thus it was assumed that 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.790
 exile in the world of monsters will be real 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.859
 hell for the heir to the throne 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.880
 spectrum is strong but highly impulsive 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:05.970
 the girl often she first does and then 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.890
 thinks about the consequences so don't think 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.590
 what would you like not to talk about 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.350
 souls new cartoon opens to us 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.989
 spectrum on the other hand we see that 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.510
 she really values â€‹â€‹her friends and 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.359
 despite their fears and reluctance 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.780
 see house spectrum yet returns to

 introduction notepads based on notes 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.709
 which can later be done 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.560
 a good little event article 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.100

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.500
 that your blog will only write from now on 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.780

 school's out collections 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.190
 it was followed by a collection Chapter will have time to 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.710
 January 12th, the series was released 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.590
 outfit called mole station among 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.110
 which there is a set for aspects in 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.330
 mid-june 13 years spectrum 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.240
 lit up in the collection until etc. 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.840
 Honduras was followed by a collection 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.930
 tired eleventh year pleased yet 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.080
 one screw for a spectrum called 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.050
 hulk thirteenth year the spectrum was 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.810
 released in the collections wash muds make and 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.760
 splash eagles night out 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.370
 the fourteenth year pleased the fans 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.830
 range in golf sport collections 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.440
 and of course the most fresh issue 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.720
 this hunter collection is a big part 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.419
 collections where the spectra came out have 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.199
 several 3 issues distinctive 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.909
 traits and puppet spectra are 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:16.889
 unique pier with very pronounced 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:19.840
 cheekbones pale almost white skinton 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.720
 transparent tips of the arms and legs abundance 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.120
 purple and lots and lots now 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.789
 I personally do not like the spectrum 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.740
 characters but new feature film 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.700
 showed me this baby on the other 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.310
 parties thus demonstrating 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.880
 positive sides of the puppet version 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.370
 I would say that the spectrum is an amateur to me 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.640
 really like her body with translucent 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.460
 limbs although you know I did not understand 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.330
 why the manufacturer did not bother too 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.160
 make transparent fixing brushes well 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:57.750
 at least try not to not right 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:00.150
 there were such things and so they hit my eyes 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.600
 overall body and range of glasses is gorgeous but 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.940
 That's supposedly so I said above for an amateur 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.670
 so I probably wouldn't be able to live 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.610
 with such a doll and what do you think about 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.530
 Spectrum write in the comments of its advantages 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.140
 and cons and also tell us which 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:19.380
 collections she is for you the most on 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:22.080
 I have it all, thank you for your attention for 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.770
 view all successful creative day and 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.770
 bye Bye
