00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.390
 very good clicker is in this 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.650
 tutorial or more than tutorial is going to be 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.410
 almost a tip or a trick we're going to 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.650
 explain how to record a CD with music 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.359
 that we bought in i-tunes if you can 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.240
 be that for many it is very simple 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.250
 but our friends our dear ones 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.500
 apple friends in simple things 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.840
 they tend to complicate a little and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.760
 this week 22 questions have come to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.180
 our to our mailbox in the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.469
 web in rs click point is so good 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.899
 we have decided to make this little 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.520
 tutorial to explain how you can pass 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.410
 the music that you have in the library 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.540
 of purchased itunes 6 that you have extracted 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.710
 from another device as you can pass it 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.110
 to a cb to listen in any 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.110
 music player we started 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.380
 resignation 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.760
 a player 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.210
 very well, as we said, it is already a 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.010
 pretty much forgotten practice almost the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.320
 record cds because now everything 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.580
 we have in the cloud or in our 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.560
 mobile devices that at the same time 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.229
 we can connect 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.450
 to a music player a speaker in 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.950
 the car itself but good still 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.750
 having people who want to spend their 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.280
 music or who is afraid to buy 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.620
 music in digital format let's say in the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.590
 cloud 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:41.100
 and not physically have it as a cedé 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.320
 alright then to create that cd's 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.390
 music with the songs that we have 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.330
 bought on itunes or that we have 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.280
 from some other device we're going to 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.390
 our library you have to put them 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.729
 in the library incorporate the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.580
 iTunes library if you have 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.290
 purchased is made directly if 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.820
 you bring another cd other is from another 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.490
 device by pass directly 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.130
 to the library in this case I had already 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.090
 selected the red hot chilli peppers 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.480
 they are a disc by the way and on this 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.040
 about this album we are going to create the cd that 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.650
 we want the first thing and here where is the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.180
 trick that apple has and that sometimes 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.880
 it distracts people a bit and that's why 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.340
 the doubts arise is that you have to create 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.640
 a playlist with this disc 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.700
 as simple as right button add 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.130
 sorry right button you click on the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.530
 arrow add to 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.820
 new playlist and good will 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.850
 you give a new playlist and you 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.350
 it creates it I have created it you go to lists 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.500
 of reproduction to your lists of 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.070
 reproduction and here is red hot chilli 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.920
 peppers by the way here for 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.580
 pass it to a cedé the only thing you have 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.250
 what to do is right mouse button and 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.830
 record playlist on a disc 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.720
 and this is the trick and tools do not record 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.790
 songs directly to an album but 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.560
 which records playlists continued 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.960
 now I want to make another kind of disk 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.070
 where I incorporate different authors 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.780
 I have to create a list of 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.360
 reproduction with all those those 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.250
 songs and they went to a disc 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.650
 that is the small big difference that 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.210
 has this wonderful application of 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.070
 iTunes 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.800
 well then you give to record list 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.750
 playback and a menu appears 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.430
 typical of recording settings you can 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.780
 record an audio CD to listen on 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.290
 a car or in a music player 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.150
 cd mp3 or even a data cd and 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.940
 you only want to have stored the 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.380
 songs because it is already selection 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.060
 we would make the audio cd to be able to 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.990
 listen to it for example on the player 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.459
 of the car and you give to record for nothing 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.990
 we hope we have helped you with this 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.530
 small 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.720
 I would not say tutorial but trick to record 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.460
 your cds and be able to listen to our 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.280
 music everywhere or just 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.990
 store it the old-fashioned way if it has 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.360
