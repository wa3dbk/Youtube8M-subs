00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
alright guys now that we've got our map

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.240 
alright guys now that we've got our map
imported<00:00:03.629> and<00:00:03.990> everything's<00:00:04.740> cleaned

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
imported and everything's cleaned

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.089 
imported and everything's cleaned
refreshed<00:00:06.210> we're<00:00:06.839> good<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.049> go<00:00:07.109> so<00:00:07.740> let's<00:00:07.950> go

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
refreshed we're good to go so let's go

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.820 
refreshed we're good to go so let's go
ahead<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.400> start<00:00:09.240> typing<00:00:09.420> some<00:00:09.780> code<00:00:09.990> the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
ahead and start typing some code the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.310 
ahead and start typing some code the
first<00:00:11.130> thing<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:11.460> need<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.670> do<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.210> have<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> way

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
first thing we need to do is have a way

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.379 
first thing we need to do is have a way
to<00:00:13.380> reference<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.130> layer<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:15.059> we<00:00:15.120> just

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
to reference that layer that we just

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.900 
to reference that layer that we just
made<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:16.230> let's<00:00:16.619> go<00:00:16.770> ahead<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.699> going

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
made so let's go ahead and this is going

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.760 
made so let's go ahead and this is going
to<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.090> basically<00:00:18.330> exactly<00:00:19.080> like<00:00:19.500> this

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
to be basically exactly like this

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.830 
to be basically exactly like this
background<00:00:20.100> layer<00:00:20.689> CC<00:00:22.010> TMX<00:00:23.010> layer<00:00:23.840> but

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
background layer CC TMX layer but

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.130 
background layer CC TMX layer but
instead<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.199> BG<00:00:25.650> layer<00:00:25.830> name<00:00:26.130> like<00:00:26.400> st<00:00:27.140> layer

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
instead of BG layer name like st layer

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.970 
instead of BG layer name like st layer
for<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> special<00:00:28.949> tiles<00:00:29.279> layer<00:00:30.380> looks<00:00:31.380> good<00:00:31.619> so

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
for a special tiles layer looks good so

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.900 
for a special tiles layer looks good so
now<00:00:32.219> let's<00:00:32.489> go<00:00:32.940> ahead<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.300> copy<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:34.910> copy

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
now let's go ahead and copy this copy

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.380 
now let's go ahead and copy this copy
that<00:00:36.329> shizz<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.010> paste<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.489> there's

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that shizz and paste it and there's

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.660 
that shizz and paste it and there's
through<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.989> old<00:00:40.140> copy<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.800> paste<00:00:43.670> better

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
through the old copy and paste better

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.279 
through the old copy and paste better
make<00:00:44.820> sure<00:00:44.850> that's<00:00:45.180> right<00:00:45.450> before<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:45.989> there

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
make sure that's right before I so there

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.260 
make sure that's right before I so there
we<00:00:46.500> go<00:00:46.530> all<00:00:46.860> right<00:00:47.039> everything<00:00:47.789> looks<00:00:48.030> good<00:00:48.210> so

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
we go all right everything looks good so

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.240 
we go all right everything looks good so
now<00:00:48.570> we're<00:00:49.170> done<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.680> we<00:00:49.920> don't<00:00:50.010> need

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
now we're done with this we don't need

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.979 
now we're done with this we don't need
to<00:00:50.370> save<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.789> we'll<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.300> build<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.629> all<00:00:51.780> later

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
to save it we'll just build it all later

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.680 
to save it we'll just build it all later
and<00:00:52.289> now<00:00:53.010> let's<00:00:53.219> go<00:00:53.460> ahead<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.940> synthesize

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
and now let's go ahead and synthesize

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.240 
and now let's go ahead and synthesize
this<00:00:55.670> synthesize<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:57.180> was<00:00:57.300> called<00:00:57.449> st<00:00:58.250> layer

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
this synthesize what was called st layer

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.110 
this synthesize what was called st layer
and<00:01:00.140> now<00:01:01.140> let's<00:01:01.440> go<00:01:01.680> ahead<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.920> d<00:01:02.340> alec<00:01:02.730> if<00:01:03.030> i

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and now let's go ahead and d alec if i

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.820 
and now let's go ahead and d alec if i
can<00:01:03.270> find<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.820> releases<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.500> self<00:01:07.500> dot<00:01:08.010> st

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
can find it and releases so self dot st

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.950 
can find it and releases so self dot st
layer<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.189> set<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.610> equal<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.090> nil<00:01:12.299> alright

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
layer and set this equal to nil alright

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.330 
layer and set this equal to nil alright
so<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.140> takes<00:01:13.590> care<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
so that takes care of all the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.270 
so that takes care of all the
housekeeping<00:01:14.970> stuff<00:01:15.680> make<00:01:16.680> sure<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:17.100> more

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
housekeeping stuff make sure one more

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.920 
housekeeping stuff make sure one more
time<00:01:17.430> everything's<00:01:17.820> powder<00:01:18.119> i<00:01:18.240> don't<00:01:18.720> want<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
time everything's powder i don't want to

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.260 
time everything's powder i don't want to
mess<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:20.009> now<00:01:20.280> what<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:21.000> is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
mess up there so now what we can do is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.249 
mess up there so now what we can do is
go<00:01:22.140> ahead<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.439> an<00:01:23.100> init<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:24.479> need<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:25.020> go<00:01:25.170> ahead

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
go ahead and an init we need to go ahead

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.940 
go ahead and an init we need to go ahead
and<00:01:25.650> load<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.189> layer<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.820> expand<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.659> it

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
and load this layer so expand in it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.230 
and load this layer so expand in it
alright<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.490> might<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:29.939> well<00:01:30.090> do

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
alright like that and might as well do

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.300 
alright like that and might as well do
it<00:01:30.270> right<00:01:30.390> after<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:31.530> load<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.860> background

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
it right after we load the background

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.670 
it right after we load the background
layer<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:33.060> when<00:01:33.210> you're<00:01:33.360> reading<00:01:33.570> we<00:01:34.439> can

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
layer so when you're reading we can

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.190 
layer so when you're reading we can
visually<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.430> all<00:01:35.820> our<00:01:35.850> layers<00:01:36.329> are<00:01:36.720> loaded

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
visually see all our layers are loaded

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.069 
visually see all our layers are loaded
at<00:01:37.560> relatively<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> same<00:01:38.369> time<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:39.960> we

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
at relatively the same time so what we

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.859 
at relatively the same time so what we
need<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.909> just<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.270> set<00:01:42.720> this

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
need to do is just like this set this

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.639 
need to do is just like this set this
equal<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.710> layer<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.240> self<00:01:45.240> dot<00:01:45.869> st<00:01:46.560> layer

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
equal to a layer so self dot st layer

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.340 
equal to a layer so self dot st layer
equals<00:01:50.149> what<00:01:51.149> map<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.630> want<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.869> use<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
equals what map do you want to use the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.209 
equals what map do you want to use the
map<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.829> course<00:01:53.270> layer<00:01:54.270> named<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.860> string

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
map of course layer named and the string

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.889 
map of course layer named and the string
for<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.939> remember<00:01:57.240> from<00:01:57.270> les<00:01:57.600> story

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
for this if you remember from les story

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.580 
for this if you remember from les story
we<00:01:58.320> name<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.680> st<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:00.000> now<00:02:00.240> st<00:02:00.960> layer<00:02:01.229> is

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
we name this st so now st layer is

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.580 
we name this st so now st layer is
actually<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.850> st<00:02:03.210> layer<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.229> we're<00:02:04.409> saying

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
actually the st layer and we're saying

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.319 
actually the st layer and we're saying
alright<00:02:04.890> that's<00:02:05.250> all<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.520> need<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.729> do<00:02:05.909> well

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
alright that's all we need to do well

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.809 
alright that's all we need to do well
actually<00:02:06.509> we<00:02:06.840> need<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> do<00:02:07.259> one<00:02:07.560> more<00:02:07.740> thing<00:02:07.819> st

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
actually we need to do one more thing st

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.430 
actually we need to do one more thing st
layer<00:02:09.690> dot

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
layer dot

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.740 
layer dot
we<00:02:13.440> need<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.950> set<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.340> visibility<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.360> to

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
we need the set of visibility to this to

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.839 
we need the set of visibility to this to
know<00:02:15.959> since<00:02:16.530> when<00:02:16.739> we<00:02:16.920> painted<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.459> with<00:02:17.670> those

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
know since when we painted it with those

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.449 
know since when we painted it with those
red<00:02:18.150> blocks<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:19.049> was<00:02:19.170> only<00:02:19.440> for<00:02:19.560> us<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.310> see

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
red blocks that was only for us to see

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.430 
red blocks that was only for us to see
the<00:02:20.489> game<00:02:20.819> developer<00:02:21.420> when<00:02:21.959> they're<00:02:22.080> actually

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
the game developer when they're actually

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.380 
the game developer when they're actually
playing<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.860> game<00:02:22.950> we<00:02:23.760> don't<00:02:23.879> want<00:02:24.090> them<00:02:24.209> to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
playing the game we don't want them to

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.199 
playing the game we don't want them to
see<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.599> that's<00:02:25.140> only<00:02:25.819> information<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:26.849> we

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
see that that's only information that we

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.630 
see that that's only information that we
should<00:02:27.420> have<00:02:27.659> I<00:02:27.930> mean<00:02:28.379> you<00:02:28.590> can<00:02:28.920> have<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.489> on

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
should have I mean you can have it on

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.890 
should have I mean you can have it on
there<00:02:29.819> if<00:02:29.909> you<00:02:30.030> want<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:30.390> your<00:02:30.510> games<00:02:30.690> going

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
there if you want but your games going

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.619 
there if you want but your games going
to<00:02:30.959> look<00:02:31.049> pretty<00:02:31.079> dumb<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:31.860> um<00:02:32.209> make<00:02:33.209> sure<00:02:33.239> that

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
to look pretty dumb so um make sure that

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.780 
to look pretty dumb so um make sure that
this<00:02:33.870> layer<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.200> invisible<00:02:34.980> by<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:35.610> way

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
this layer is invisible by the way

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.640 
this layer is invisible by the way
anytime<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:36.720> want<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.900> hide<00:02:37.049> a<00:02:37.110> layer<00:02:37.349> that's

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
anytime you want to hide a layer that's

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.360 
anytime you want to hide a layer that's
how<00:02:37.799> you<00:02:37.860> do<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.069> all<00:02:38.940> right<00:02:39.269> so<00:02:39.900> now<00:02:40.250> what<00:02:41.250> we

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
how you do it all right so now what we

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.670 
how you do it all right so now what we
need<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.700> do<00:02:41.879> is<00:02:42.150> we<00:02:42.420> need<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.840> add<00:02:42.989> a<00:02:43.319> new

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
need to do is we need to add a new

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.369 
need to do is we need to add a new
method<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.579> convert<00:02:44.970> all<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.450> tiles<00:02:45.930> to

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
method to convert all the tiles to

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.130 
method to convert all the tiles to
coordinates<00:02:46.980> later<00:02:47.940> on<00:02:48.239> what<00:02:48.840> we're<00:02:48.959> going<00:02:49.049> to

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
coordinates later on what we're going to

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.080 
coordinates later on what we're going to
be<00:02:49.200> doing<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.680> working<00:02:50.220> with<00:02:50.579> tile

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
be doing is working with tile

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.270 
be doing is working with tile
coordinates<00:02:51.840> instead<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:53.129> other

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
coordinates instead of the other

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.149 
coordinates instead of the other
properties<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.329> we<00:02:55.079> need<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> way<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.620> reference

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
properties so we need a way to reference

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.770 
properties so we need a way to reference
these<00:02:56.280> styles<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.000> retain<00:02:57.329> all<00:02:57.510> right<00:02:57.629> what

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
these styles and retain all right what

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.869 
these styles and retain all right what
the<00:02:57.810> heck<00:02:58.049> is<00:02:58.079> a<00:02:58.290> tile<00:02:58.560> coordinate<00:02:59.099> let<00:02:59.640> me<00:02:59.730> go

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
the heck is a tile coordinate let me go

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.479 
the heck is a tile coordinate let me go
ahead<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.120> explain<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.629> you<00:03:00.840> guys<00:03:01.489> pretend

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
ahead and explain to you guys pretend

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.240 
ahead and explain to you guys pretend
each<00:03:02.909> of<00:03:03.209> these<00:03:03.409> pretend<00:03:04.409> this<00:03:04.560> pretty<00:03:05.069> much

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
each of these pretend this pretty much

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.630 
each of these pretend this pretty much
is<00:03:05.430> our<00:03:05.579> map<00:03:06.829> toyota<00:03:07.829> has<00:03:07.920> built<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.609> a

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
is our map toyota has built in a

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.640 
is our map toyota has built in a
coordinate<00:03:09.209> system<00:03:09.269> for<00:03:09.900> referencing<00:03:10.440> each

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
coordinate system for referencing each

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.369 
coordinate system for referencing each
tile<00:03:11.190> on<00:03:11.370> your<00:03:11.519> map<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.879> starts<00:03:12.329> with<00:03:12.420> 0<00:03:12.750> 0<00:03:13.140> in

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
tile on your map it starts with 0 0 in

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.190 
tile on your map it starts with 0 0 in
the<00:03:13.500> top<00:03:13.530> left<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.849> goes<00:03:15.060> for<00:03:15.870> example

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
the top left and it goes for example

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.490 
the top left and it goes for example
this<00:03:16.319> one<00:03:16.380> would<00:03:16.680> be<00:03:16.709> 10<00:03:17.609> 20<00:03:18.859> 30<00:03:20.090> 31<00:03:21.090> 32<00:03:21.780> 33

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
this one would be 10 20 30 31 32 33

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.680 
this one would be 10 20 30 31 32 33
pretty<00:03:23.370> much<00:03:23.519> like<00:03:23.669> battleship<00:03:24.329> if<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.660> ever

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
pretty much like battleship if you ever

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.110 
pretty much like battleship if you ever
played<00:03:25.079> that<00:03:25.319> so<00:03:25.859> a<00:03:25.889> nice<00:03:26.130> what<00:03:26.549> we<00:03:26.669> need<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:26.879> do

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
played that so a nice what we need to do

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.830 
played that so a nice what we need to do
is<00:03:27.450> find<00:03:28.139> a<00:03:28.410> way<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:29.069> convert<00:03:29.459> our<00:03:29.700> map<00:03:30.030> so<00:03:30.810> we

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
is find a way to convert our map so we

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.559 
is find a way to convert our map so we
can<00:03:31.109> reference<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.769> as<00:03:31.950> its<00:03:32.910> coordinates

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
can reference it as its coordinates

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.680 
can reference it as its coordinates
because<00:03:34.560> later<00:03:34.919> on<00:03:35.010> when<00:03:35.519> we<00:03:35.669> check<00:03:35.970> for<00:03:36.180> what

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
because later on when we check for what

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.839 
because later on when we check for what
we<00:03:36.810> need<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.109> collide<00:03:37.410> in<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.680> stuff<00:03:38.129> and<00:03:38.370> I

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
we need to collide in the stuff and I

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.210 
we need to collide in the stuff and I
you<00:03:39.239> know<00:03:39.299> basically<00:03:40.199> what<00:03:40.680> I'm<00:03:40.769> saying<00:03:40.799> we

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
you know basically what I'm saying we

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.400 
you know basically what I'm saying we
need<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.459> way<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.819> convert<00:03:42.329> this<00:03:42.540> map<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:43.109> tiled

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
need a way to convert this map to tiled

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.189 
need a way to convert this map to tiled
coordinates<00:03:43.949> so<00:03:44.160> let's<00:03:45.090> go<00:03:45.269> ahead<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.690> enough

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
coordinates so let's go ahead and enough

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.650 
coordinates so let's go ahead and enough
from<00:03:46.319> your<00:03:46.440> in<00:03:46.650> let's<00:03:46.949> do<00:03:47.099> it<00:03:47.190> right<00:03:47.370> now<00:03:47.660> it's

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
from your in let's do it right now it's

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.879 
from your in let's do it right now it's
going<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:48.959> return<00:03:49.079> a<00:03:49.290> CG<00:03:50.040> points<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:52.310> tile

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
going to return a CG points and tile

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.550 
going to return a CG points and tile
cord

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.670 

for<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:01.480> just<00:04:02.480> go<00:04:02.660> ahead<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:02.960> we're<00:04:03.500> going<00:04:03.530> to

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
for and just go ahead and we're going to

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.640 
for and just go ahead and we're going to
pass<00:04:03.890> in<00:04:04.130> a<00:04:04.310> CG<00:04:04.870> points<00:04:07.600> position<00:04:08.600> I<00:04:08.810> actually

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
pass in a CG points position I actually

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.160 
pass in a CG points position I actually
got<00:04:10.010> this<00:04:10.190> off<00:04:10.400> of<00:04:10.430> some<00:04:10.790> guy<00:04:10.970> on<00:04:11.210> the<00:04:11.390> forums

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
got this off of some guy on the forums

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.080 
got this off of some guy on the forums
and<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:12.860> helped<00:04:13.070> me<00:04:13.160> out<00:04:13.190> a<00:04:13.310> lot<00:04:13.460> so<00:04:13.940> in<00:04:14.750> order

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
and it helped me out a lot so in order

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.789 
and it helped me out a lot so in order
what<00:04:17.090> it's<00:04:17.209> going<00:04:17.359> to<00:04:17.420> do<00:04:17.600> is<00:04:17.810> you're<00:04:18.200> going<00:04:18.739> to

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
what it's going to do is you're going to

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.580 
what it's going to do is you're going to
return<00:04:19.130> to<00:04:19.459> us<00:04:19.609> a<00:04:19.790> point<00:04:20.180> an<00:04:20.359> x<00:04:20.660> and<00:04:20.810> y<00:04:20.959> value<00:04:21.350> so

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
return to us a point an x and y value so

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.470 
return to us a point an x and y value so
we're<00:04:21.980> going<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.190> treat<00:04:22.400> x<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:22.820> y<00:04:22.910> separately

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
we're going to treat x and y separately

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.180 
we're going to treat x and y separately
instead<00:04:23.660> of<00:04:23.900> doing<00:04:24.290> it<00:04:24.410> all<00:04:24.530> in<00:04:24.680> one<00:04:24.830> shebang

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
instead of doing it all in one shebang

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.090 
instead of doing it all in one shebang
in<00:04:25.400> order<00:04:26.270> to<00:04:26.540> get<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.930> x<00:04:27.170> coordinate

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
in order to get the x coordinate

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.570 
in order to get the x coordinate
position<00:04:28.520> is<00:04:28.700> very<00:04:29.180> easy<00:04:29.450> just<00:04:30.100> go<00:04:31.100> ahead<00:04:31.280> and

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
position is very easy just go ahead and

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.660 
position is very easy just go ahead and
pass<00:04:32.360> in<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.780> exposition<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:33.710> /<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:35.240> map

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
pass in the exposition and / the map

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.780 
pass in the exposition and / the map
tile<00:04:37.670> size<00:04:38.110> dot<00:04:39.110> with<00:04:39.350> so<00:04:40.130> how<00:04:40.310> easy<00:04:40.550> is<00:04:40.760> this

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
tile size dot with so how easy is this

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.880 
tile size dot with so how easy is this
in<00:04:41.120> order<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.540> get<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.780> x<00:04:41.960> all<00:04:42.200> you<00:04:42.320> do<00:04:42.440> is<00:04:42.650> take

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
in order to get the x all you do is take

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.520 
in order to get the x all you do is take
and<00:04:43.100> take<00:04:43.640> your<00:04:43.850> position<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.450> divide<00:04:45.110> it<00:04:45.140> by

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
and take your position and divide it by

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.560 
and take your position and divide it by
the<00:04:45.560> width<00:04:46.070> of<00:04:46.250> a<00:04:46.430> tile<00:04:46.700> and<00:04:47.000> this<00:04:47.150> is<00:04:47.300> going<00:04:47.480> to

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
the width of a tile and this is going to

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.930 
the width of a tile and this is going to
give<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:47.930> your<00:04:48.440> x<00:04:48.740> coordinate<00:04:49.310> of<00:04:49.430> wherever

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
give you your x coordinate of wherever

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.800 
give you your x coordinate of wherever
you<00:04:50.720> know<00:04:50.840> whatever<00:04:51.230> title<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:51.830> want<00:04:52.750> why<00:04:53.750> is

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
you know whatever title you want why is

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.980 
you know whatever title you want why is
a<00:04:54.110> little<00:04:54.530> bit<00:04:55.180> different<00:04:56.180> because<00:04:56.330> we<00:04:56.780> need

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
a little bit different because we need

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.710 
a little bit different because we need
to<00:04:57.080> do<00:04:57.260> the<00:04:57.410> opposite<00:04:57.980> of<00:04:58.130> this<00:04:58.460> so<00:04:59.060> this

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
to do the opposite of this so this

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.159 
to do the opposite of this so this
formula<00:05:00.110> is<00:05:00.260> kind<00:05:00.500> of<00:05:00.560> weird<00:05:00.770> but<00:05:01.250> um<00:05:01.990> this<00:05:02.990> is

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
formula is kind of weird but um this is

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.050 
formula is kind of weird but um this is
what<00:05:03.350> the<00:05:03.740> guy<00:05:03.890> told<00:05:03.919> me<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.370> do<00:05:04.520> and<00:05:04.550> it<00:05:04.790> works

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
what the guy told me to do and it works

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.440 
what the guy told me to do and it works
for<00:05:05.240> me<00:05:05.360> so<00:05:06.260> let<00:05:07.160> me<00:05:07.250> see<00:05:07.430> if<00:05:07.460> I<00:05:07.640> can<00:05:07.880> remember

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
for me so let me see if I can remember

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:19.150 
for me so let me see if I can remember
this<00:05:11.169> alright<00:05:12.169> so<00:05:12.830> the<00:05:13.700> map<00:05:14.419> the<00:05:14.960> map<00:05:16.000> size<00:05:18.160> the

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
this alright so the map the map size the

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.060 
this alright so the map the map size the
height<00:05:19.370> of<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.610> map<00:05:19.850> and<00:05:20.690> we<00:05:21.380> need<00:05:21.560> a<00:05:21.590> time<00:05:21.860> to

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
height of the map and we need a time to

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.870 
height of the map and we need a time to
spy<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:23.060> map<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:24.470> tile<00:05:25.750> size<00:05:26.750> the<00:05:27.580> height<00:05:28.580> and

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
spy the map the tile size the height and

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.670 
spy the map the tile size the height and
this<00:05:29.390> is<00:05:29.540> pretty<00:05:29.780> much<00:05:29.930> going<00:05:30.200> to<00:05:30.260> give<00:05:30.470> you

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
this is pretty much going to give you

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.000 
this is pretty much going to give you
the<00:05:30.950> entire<00:05:31.760> height<00:05:32.600> of<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.930> map<00:05:33.140> and<00:05:33.350> then

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
the entire height of the map and then

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.700 
the entire height of the map and then
take<00:05:34.340> this<00:05:34.460> entire<00:05:34.940> thing<00:05:35.330> and<00:05:36.370> minus

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
take this entire thing and minus

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.230 
take this entire thing and minus
position<00:05:39.710> dot<00:05:40.700> y<00:05:41.229> and<00:05:42.910> let<00:05:43.910> me<00:05:44.030> make<00:05:44.180> sure

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
position dot y and let me make sure

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.120 
position dot y and let me make sure
that's<00:05:44.660> right<00:05:44.960> all<00:05:45.229> right<00:05:45.500> looks<00:05:45.770> good<00:05:45.979> and

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
that's right all right looks good and

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.070 
that's right all right looks good and
then<00:05:46.550> take<00:05:46.850> this<00:05:47.150> and<00:05:47.479> divide<00:05:47.840> by<00:05:47.990> the<00:05:48.650> map<00:05:50.080> dot

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
then take this and divide by the map dot

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.520 
then take this and divide by the map dot
tile<00:05:52.090> size<00:05:54.370> height<00:05:55.370> just<00:05:55.970> like<00:05:56.180> this<00:05:56.330> so<00:05:57.260> let

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
tile size height just like this so let

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.640 
tile size height just like this so let
me<00:05:57.560> read<00:05:57.860> this<00:05:57.890> and<00:05:58.280> make<00:05:58.520> sure<00:05:58.550> that<00:05:59.380> the<00:06:00.380> map

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
me read this and make sure that the map

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.560 
me read this and make sure that the map
down<00:06:01.130> map<00:06:01.400> size

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.300 

the<00:06:05.570> height<00:06:05.840> time<00:06:06.170> is<00:06:06.410> the<00:06:06.530> map<00:06:06.770> that<00:06:06.800> tile

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
the height time is the map that tile

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.520 
the height time is the map that tile
size<00:06:07.580> that<00:06:07.820> I<00:06:07.850> hide<00:06:08.090> my<00:06:08.300> knees<00:06:08.450> position<00:06:08.630> and

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
size that I hide my knees position and

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.240 
size that I hide my knees position and
doubt<00:06:09.740> why<00:06:10.040> looks<00:06:10.880> good<00:06:11.120> all<00:06:11.390> over<00:06:12.010> the<00:06:13.010> map

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
doubt why looks good all over the map

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.210 
doubt why looks good all over the map
tile<00:06:14.240> size<00:06:14.540> height<00:06:14.960> so<00:06:15.500> it<00:06:15.530> looks<00:06:15.830> pretty<00:06:15.980> good

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
tile size height so it looks pretty good

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.630 
tile size height so it looks pretty good
if<00:06:16.460> I<00:06:16.580> messed<00:06:16.850> up<00:06:17.030> your<00:06:17.690> formula<00:06:18.440> again<00:06:19.310> I'm

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
if I messed up your formula again I'm

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
talking to that guy that I stole this

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.350 
talking to that guy that I stole this
from<00:06:21.230> dude<00:06:21.980> if<00:06:22.250> I<00:06:22.340> mess<00:06:22.520> up<00:06:22.550> your<00:06:22.820> formula<00:06:23.240> I'm

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
from dude if I mess up your formula I'm

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.300 
from dude if I mess up your formula I'm
sorry<00:06:23.630> I'll<00:06:23.780> fix<00:06:23.990> it<00:06:24.080> later<00:06:24.170> but<00:06:24.500> anyways<00:06:25.100> and

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
sorry I'll fix it later but anyways and

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.160 
sorry I'll fix it later but anyways and
what<00:06:26.120> we<00:06:26.240> want<00:06:26.360> to<00:06:26.480> do<00:06:26.570> eventually<00:06:26.870> is

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
what we want to do eventually is

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:33.100 
what we want to do eventually is
returned<00:06:27.560> CCP<00:06:28.570> X<00:06:29.570> Y<00:06:30.580> so<00:06:31.580> basically<00:06:32.240> all<00:06:32.450> this

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
returned CCP X Y so basically all this

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.550 
returned CCP X Y so basically all this
method<00:06:33.500> does<00:06:33.530> add<00:06:34.420> it<00:06:35.420> pretty<00:06:35.810> much<00:06:35.960> takes<00:06:36.320> a

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
method does add it pretty much takes a

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.460 
method does add it pretty much takes a
tile<00:06:36.890> and<00:06:37.510> converts<00:06:38.510> it<00:06:38.690> to<00:06:38.750> the<00:06:39.080> coordinates

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
tile and converts it to the coordinates

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.370 
tile and converts it to the coordinates
that<00:06:40.130> we<00:06:40.310> need<00:06:40.550> because<00:06:41.030> later<00:06:41.510> on<00:06:41.600> in<00:06:42.020> the

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
that we need because later on in the

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.140 
that we need because later on in the
next<00:06:42.530> tutorial<00:06:42.710> we're<00:06:43.610> going<00:06:43.640> to<00:06:43.820> be<00:06:43.940> working

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
next tutorial we're going to be working

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.630 
next tutorial we're going to be working
with<00:06:44.510> the<00:06:44.840> coordinates<00:06:45.500> so<00:06:46.100> that's<00:06:46.310> why<00:06:46.460> we

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
with the coordinates so that's why we

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.760 
with the coordinates so that's why we
need<00:06:46.790> it<00:06:46.970> well<00:06:47.419> like<00:06:47.600> I<00:06:47.720> said<00:06:47.780> that's<00:06:48.410> for<00:06:48.680> the

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
need it well like I said that's for the

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.380 
need it well like I said that's for the
next<00:06:48.800> tutorial<00:06:49.130> it's<00:06:49.910> probably<00:06:50.030> going<00:06:50.300> to

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
next tutorial it's probably going to

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.080 
next tutorial it's probably going to
take<00:06:50.480> a<00:06:50.780> little<00:06:51.650> bit<00:06:51.860> of<00:06:51.919> time<00:06:52.190> we<00:06:52.700> got<00:06:52.850> one

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
take a little bit of time we got one

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.480 
take a little bit of time we got one
more<00:06:53.240> method<00:06:53.480> to<00:06:53.750> go<00:06:53.900> and<00:06:54.230> then<00:06:54.530> we<00:06:55.160> see<00:06:55.340> this

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
more method to go and then we see this

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.110 
more method to go and then we see this
game<00:06:56.390> up<00:06:56.690> and<00:06:57.050> running<00:06:57.560> so<00:06:58.040> uh<00:06:58.070> thank<00:06:58.910> you<00:06:58.970> guys
