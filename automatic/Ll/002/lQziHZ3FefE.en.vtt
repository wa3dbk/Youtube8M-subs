00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 and with that I wish a wonderful and 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.460
 I wish you a warm welcome 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.080
 welcome especially as you can read 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.519
 revenge is black pudding 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.820
 but that fits wonderfully I hope so 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.369
 works now because of that you see me 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.720
 at the attacks we brought 184 km 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.400
 look at the repetition in wiser 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.539
 foresight according to precisely because the degree can 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.250
 i still perform vengeance i hope so 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.630
 is still going 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.830
 I quickly started elgato 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.109
 and quickly finish printing 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.949
 I hope I can work 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.050
 I should go very fast 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.329
 repeat and then I hope that the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.410
 Revenge is still going and hope that he will me 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.149
 came back online because that 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.420
 otherwise a bit stupid because 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:51.289
 I wanted to attack them 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:53.039
 of the guys max somehow you hang game 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.739
 what's going on there 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.160
 I'm not on the internet like you 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.440
 are you there again a thing like 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.170
 said wlan is now launched and the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.689
 Revenge is still possible and now it suits me 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.159
 just want the gold that means that 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.119
 First what I do I look first 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:16.290
 Well , King checkboxes were canceling 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:20.090
 I had to see, maybe I had to 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.540
 The view is unfortunately not okay now 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.880
 we see if we somehow clear 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.290
 what could have been registered is the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.040
 little man in the back there are clear 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.040
 program would have been in it 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.310
 And plenty of it 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.330
 that was a bit of a bokern 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.590
 of course my little castle units 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.210
 per dad not taken at all 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.320
 Of course, this is a bit stupid now 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.920
 I hope I will go anyway 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.380
 create 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.210
 i can not promise it i will 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.470
 just try down my resources 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.210
 border I have no heroes 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.050
 that means it could be hardcore too 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:05.780
 go backwards 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:11.780
 i can not guarantee anything i can 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:16.670
 just hope that my super so now 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:20.150
 Let's see that we fit in here 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.080
 plan to destroy the billings i hope 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.310
 that time is not ours now 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.160
 easy I have too much time already 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.080
 that's why it consumes more 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.790
 archers that here the buildings 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.200
 a bit quick if I am 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.910
 finally another puck yet 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.590
 then take it a bit 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.910
 goes faster 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.680
 I want to turn to the three gold camps 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.510
 It's going to be extremely difficult just because I have him 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.489
 I noticed right now that 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.489
 I no one wise of course no 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.760
 now I do not have to talk thoughtfully 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:56.799
 how's the name no heroes here 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:59.750
 Of course, that's very clever 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.019
 which of course, of course, really the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.209
 Also make the screen as you do 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:10.660
 then 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:12.980
 no, they too are so wonderful 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.730
 I have wonderful okay the first gold 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.730
 campers loose in it 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:21.560
 now it will be critical no no 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.910
 Giant bomb fuck off the course stupid 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.500
 I had the wrong army with me 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.019
 very clearly so it is not possible 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.910
 In other words, I hope we get that 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.049
 now still with a few 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.680
 Archers away so the second gold 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.090
 Stock but we have no units 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.810
 more on resources go that is now 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.810
 a little stupid 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:49.890
 shit that everything is free in such a 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:51.510
 situation there simply simply complete 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.040
 the family every so clear it runs its 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.260
 Of course, there is also something right 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:02.040
 That's why clever is still a bit 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:09.240
 Take with gold could be good suboptimal 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:10.530
 Of course, moving the colt is complete 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.959
 take it with you maybe you can do it 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.130
 still 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.769
 then we did at least plus 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.540
 At least I hope so 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.980
 and yes that was a fight now as well as 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.329
 you should not do them 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.380
 I see, I am with giants 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.520
 the way I can then still the same 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.540
 another case show because they know 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.300
 none here really show up 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.560
 So a little bit so at least 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.060
 I have now done a plus but 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.810
 but only made but only tenth 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.190
 but at least I wanted to calculate 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.390
 that of course now optimal thing 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.590
 but we just look with 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.630
 There was a war on her, I see 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:44.460
 already fight with the whole day 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.290
 yes, good with my big army 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.640
 yes that was actually already the 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.479
 Revenge as I wanted to show and I wanted 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.160
 actually thought like a bit 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.600
 prettier gets a bit shitty though 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.590
 that must be sometimes I mean 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.490
 also wants a little something new about it 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.840
 I also want to learn something 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.910
 really with these giants of the seas 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.440
 getting along also always shows nicely 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.390
 beautiful games for the next 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.229
 let's play archer for 11 and 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.200
 otherwise I wish one more 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.060
 beautiful weekend and at 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.720
 next time everything is better not out 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.720
 take care
