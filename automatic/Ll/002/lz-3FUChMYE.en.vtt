00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.670
 It is very difficult to erase this. 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.729
 map 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.440

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.900
 Japanese 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.550
 the map and the global spend mom here does not have 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.960
 nothing to see here this is a package that 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.510
 won this year 2013 good q3 done it 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.510
 everything up close and it will run perfectly 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.930
 Only I 'm having trouble still 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.990
 he is not recognizing the radars 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.850
 mobile phone it is not showing on the screen and 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.340
 I give more preference for this to 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:53.580
 that he shows but the rest is perfect 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.580
 It's progressed so it's okay, hug it.
