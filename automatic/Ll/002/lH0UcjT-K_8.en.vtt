00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
use import this code into that bit

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.460 
use import this code into that bit
so<00:01:03.970> first<00:01:04.420> we're<00:01:04.630> going<00:01:04.750> to<00:01:04.840> create<00:01:05.260> a<00:01:05.350> new

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.210 
black and that the reason why is because
on<00:02:21.640> our<00:02:21.850> CSS<00:02:22.420> styles<00:02:22.810> we've<00:02:23.230> got<00:02:23.380> our<00:02:23.530> body<00:02:23.920> tag

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
on our CSS styles we've got our body tag

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.759 
on our CSS styles we've got our body tag
which<00:02:24.430> also<00:02:24.640> TD<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.510> th<00:02:25.900> which<00:02:26.049> is<00:02:26.170> table<00:02:26.560> stuff

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
which also TD in th which is table stuff

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.240 
which also TD in th which is table stuff
and<00:02:27.400> we<00:02:27.489> want<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:28.150> not<00:02:28.630> have<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.140> be<00:02:29.920> colored

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
and we want to not have that be colored

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.830 
and we want to not have that be colored
just<00:02:30.580> be<00:02:30.700> transparent<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.360> we're<00:02:31.480> going<00:02:31.600> to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
just be transparent so we're going to

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.530 
just be transparent so we're going to
click<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:33.400> then<00:02:33.700> click<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.060> again<00:02:34.150> till<00:02:34.450> it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
click that then click it again till it

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.600 
click that then click it again till it
goes<00:02:34.660> up<00:02:34.870> this<00:02:34.989> and<00:02:35.200> then<00:02:35.350> remove<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.799> TD<00:02:36.160> nth

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
goes up this and then remove that TD nth

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.750 
goes up this and then remove that TD nth
it's<00:02:36.790> just<00:02:37.090> body<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:37.799> now<00:02:38.799> if<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.040> preview<00:02:39.489> in

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
it's just body and now if you preview in

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.140 
it's just body and now if you preview in
chrome<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.980> see<00:02:42.280> it's<00:02:42.549> not<00:02:42.700> black<00:02:43.030> anymore

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
chrome you see it's not black anymore

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.949 
chrome you see it's not black anymore
it's<00:02:43.570> just<00:02:43.900> clean<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.680> plain<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:46.570> that's<00:02:46.750> our

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
it's just clean and plain so that's our

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.410 
it's just clean and plain so that's our
table<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.590> put<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.220> into<00:02:48.459> our<00:02:49.590> web<00:02:50.590> page

contact form done and ready to test
so<00:04:12.780> now<00:04:12.930> if<00:04:13.020> we<00:04:13.110> come<00:04:13.680> over<00:04:13.830> to<00:04:14.040> our<00:04:15.440> chrome<00:04:16.440> and

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
so now if we come over to our chrome and

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.610 
so now if we come over to our chrome and
we<00:04:16.769> test<00:04:16.980> it<00:04:17.100> so<00:04:17.280> just<00:04:17.459> put<00:04:17.670> test<00:04:18.480> to<00:04:19.609> email<00:04:20.609> a

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
we test it so just put test to email a

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.290 
we test it so just put test to email a
you<00:04:22.620> can<00:04:23.040> all<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.400> think<00:04:23.670> you<00:04:23.760> can<00:04:23.880> use<00:04:24.060> fake

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
you can all I think you can use fake

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.570 
you can all I think you can use fake
emails<00:04:24.720> but<00:04:25.020> better<00:04:25.620> if<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.860> did<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.130> real<00:04:26.400> one

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
emails but better if you did a real one

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.480 
emails but better if you did a real one
so<00:04:26.760> maybe<00:04:26.940> I'll<00:04:27.930> just<00:04:28.350> use<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.800> which<00:04:29.070> might<00:04:29.370> be

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
so maybe I'll just use it which might be

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.900 
so maybe I'll just use it which might be
a<00:04:29.520> bit<00:04:29.700> confused<00:04:30.030> about<00:04:30.120> I'll<00:04:30.330> just<00:04:30.510> use<00:04:30.780> the

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
a bit confused about I'll just use the

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.060 
a bit confused about I'll just use the
email<00:04:32.910> which<00:04:33.750> I'm<00:04:33.900> sending<00:04:34.200> to<00:04:34.320> so<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.710> can<00:04:34.860> see

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
email which I'm sending to so it can see

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.090 
email which I'm sending to so it can see
that<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.930> when<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:36.960> replied<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.500> replies<00:04:37.890> what

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
that I when I replied to it replies what

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.830 
that I when I replied to it replies what
thing<00:04:38.310> message<00:04:39.030> I<00:04:39.240> am<00:04:40.190> testing<00:04:41.190> this<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.480> if

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
thing message I am testing this and if

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.690 
thing message I am testing this and if
you<00:04:42.960> click<00:04:43.110> Submit<00:04:43.170> it<00:04:43.890> just<00:04:44.190> shows<00:04:44.340> yourself

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
you click Submit it just shows yourself

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.970 
you click Submit it just shows yourself
form<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.360> that's<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.750> problem<00:04:45.960> is<00:04:46.169> that<00:04:46.200> PHP

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
form and that's the problem is that PHP

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.500 
form and that's the problem is that PHP
only<00:04:47.370> works<00:04:47.610> when<00:04:47.790> it's<00:04:47.940> uploaded<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.330> server

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
only works when it's uploaded to server

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.659 
only works when it's uploaded to server
so<00:04:48.900> i'll<00:04:49.320> upload<00:04:49.560> these<00:04:49.950> files<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.640> server

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
so i'll upload these files to the server

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.960 
so i'll upload these files to the server
and<00:04:51.090> then<00:04:51.180> test<00:04:51.480> it<00:04:51.600> again<00:04:51.870> so<00:04:52.740> now<00:04:53.130> this<00:04:53.400> this

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
and then test it again so now this this

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.000 
and then test it again so now this this
PHP<00:04:54.540> script<00:04:55.080> does<00:04:55.230> not<00:04:55.380> work<00:04:55.560> with<00:04:55.770> all<00:04:55.919> the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
PHP script does not work with all the

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.340 
PHP script does not work with all the
web<00:04:56.190> hosts<00:04:56.580> so<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.600> one<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:57.810> test<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.200> roof

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
web hosts so the one I test the roof

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.380 
web hosts so the one I test the roof
just<00:04:58.560> now<00:04:58.710> which<00:04:58.950> I<00:04:59.160> somehow<00:04:59.820> can't<00:05:00.120> show<00:05:00.330> you

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
just now which I somehow can't show you

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.730 
just now which I somehow can't show you

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
because I did it and then I did it again

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.650 
because I did it and then I did it again
didn't<00:05:02.160> work<00:05:02.310> so<00:05:02.910> it<00:05:03.000> does<00:05:03.150> show<00:05:03.300> that<00:05:03.330> the

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660
