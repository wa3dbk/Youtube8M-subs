00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.940 
looks to be the perfect size for Sheen
so<00:03:42.760> hopefully<00:03:43.660> it'll<00:03:43.780> work<00:03:44.019> out<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:44.709> was<00:03:44.919> a

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
so hopefully it'll work out it was a

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.460 
so hopefully it'll work out it was a
little<00:03:45.370> bit<00:03:45.519> pricey<00:03:45.819> $2.99<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:46.989> then<00:03:47.109> I<00:03:47.139> had

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
little bit pricey $2.99 and then I had

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.809 
little bit pricey $2.99 and then I had
the<00:03:48.459> 20%<00:03:49.299> off<00:03:49.599> coupon<00:03:50.079> I<00:03:50.109> was<00:03:50.440> but<00:03:50.650> if<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:51.519> works

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
the 20% off coupon I was but if it works

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.909 
the 20% off coupon I was but if it works
it's<00:03:52.090> gonna<00:03:52.359> be<00:03:52.900> in<00:03:53.019> there<00:03:53.200> forever<00:03:53.440> so<00:03:53.680> I

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
it's gonna be in there forever so I

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.699 
it's gonna be in there forever so I
didn't<00:03:54.190> really<00:03:54.340> mind<00:03:54.669> and<00:03:55.120> then<00:03:55.810> let<00:03:56.560> me<00:03:56.680> show

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
was so pretty it's actually like a

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.240 
was so pretty it's actually like a
placemat<00:04:04.329> but<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:05.049> is<00:04:05.349> made<00:04:05.620> out<00:04:05.769> of<00:04:05.919> shells

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
placemat but it is made out of shells

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.699 
placemat but it is made out of shells
it's<00:04:06.790> so<00:04:07.209> pretty<00:04:07.599> I<00:04:07.690> love<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.079> color

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
and I got this for the center of my

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.339 
and I got this for the center of my
table<00:04:12.430> my<00:04:13.000> white<00:04:13.269> table<00:04:13.690> in<00:04:13.810> my<00:04:13.930> breakfast

nook<00:04:14.620> I<00:04:14.889> don't<00:04:15.669> know<00:04:15.910> if<00:04:16.180> it's<00:04:16.570> going<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:17.019> work

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
nook I don't know if it's going to work

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.890 
nook I don't know if it's going to work
in<00:04:17.500> there<00:04:17.680> but<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.609> original<00:04:19.180> price<00:04:19.479> on<00:04:19.510> this

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
in there but the original price on this

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.780 
in there but the original price on this
was<00:04:21.450> 12.95<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.500> was<00:04:23.680> going<00:04:23.919> to<00:04:24.039> pay

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
was 12.95 and I was going to pay

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.700 
was 12.95 and I was going to pay
because<00:04:25.270> I<00:04:25.390> just<00:04:25.600> think<00:04:25.780> it's<00:04:25.990> really<00:04:26.410> really

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
because I just think it's really really

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.990 
because I just think it's really really
pretty<00:04:27.090> but<00:04:28.090> when<00:04:28.360> I<00:04:28.390> went<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:28.990> pay<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.680> was

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
pretty but when I went to pay it was

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.610 
pretty but when I went to pay it was
ridiculous<00:04:31.000> it<00:04:31.030> was<00:04:31.330> like<00:04:31.510> three<00:04:31.840> dollars<00:04:31.990> so

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
ridiculous it was like three dollars so

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.250 
ridiculous it was like three dollars so
I<00:04:32.920> was<00:04:33.490> bad<00:04:33.670> about<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:34.060> but<00:04:34.630> it's<00:04:34.780> really

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
I was bad about that but it's really

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260 
I was bad about that but it's really
pretty<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:35.830> thought<00:04:36.070> I<00:04:36.310> could<00:04:36.430> put<00:04:36.730> it<00:04:37.150> in

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
pretty and I thought I could put it in

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.510 
pretty and I thought I could put it in
the<00:04:37.300> center<00:04:37.630> of<00:04:37.750> my<00:04:37.870> table<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:38.560> then<00:04:39.160> put

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
the center of my table and then put

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.130 
the center of my table and then put
something<00:04:39.790> in<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.210> center<00:04:40.570> like<00:04:40.780> a<00:04:40.840> vase<00:04:41.110> with

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
something in the center like a vase with

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.260 
something in the center like a vase with
fresh<00:04:41.710> flowers<00:04:41.920> or<00:04:42.520> something<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:43.000> don't<00:04:43.180> know

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
fresh flowers or something I don't know

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.600 
fresh flowers or something I don't know
if<00:04:43.390> it'll<00:04:43.540> work<00:04:43.600> but<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:44.410> figured<00:04:44.980> I<00:04:45.220> really

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
if it'll work but I figured I really

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.820 
if it'll work but I figured I really
liked<00:04:45.790> it<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.120> I'll<00:04:46.210> find<00:04:46.540> somewhere<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.530> put

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
liked it and I'll find somewhere to put

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.360 
liked it and I'll find somewhere to put
it<00:04:47.920> and<00:04:48.100> then<00:04:48.310> this<00:04:48.610> stuff<00:04:49.570> is<00:04:49.870> from<00:04:50.320> Target<00:04:50.920> I

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
it and then this stuff is from Target I

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.020 
it and then this stuff is from Target I
went<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.840> dollar<00:04:52.990> spot<00:04:53.290> and<00:04:53.770> I<00:04:54.190> am

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
went to the dollar spot and I am

pack<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.050> pencils<00:05:02.800> I<00:05:03.370> thought<00:05:03.610> they<00:05:03.760> were

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
pack of pencils I thought they were

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.600 
pack of pencils I thought they were

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
pretty I like to use pencils a lot

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.060 
pretty I like to use pencils a lot
because<00:05:07.120> I<00:05:07.200> like<00:05:08.200> to<00:05:08.350> be<00:05:08.470> able<00:05:08.530> to<00:05:08.740> erase

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
because I like to be able to erase

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.280 
because I like to be able to erase
instead<00:05:09.610> of<00:05:09.730> having<00:05:09.970> a<00:05:10.150> big<00:05:10.300> Madison<00:05:11.020> thing

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
instead of having a big Madison thing

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.890 
instead of having a big Madison thing
and<00:05:11.800> then<00:05:12.160> I<00:05:12.280> picked<00:05:12.640> up<00:05:12.760> these<00:05:13.060> pens<00:05:13.510> and

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
and then I picked up these pens and

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.140 
and then I picked up these pens and
thought<00:05:14.050> they<00:05:14.170> were<00:05:14.200> cute<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:15.550> then<00:05:15.820> I<00:05:15.910> also

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
thought they were cute and then I also

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.710 
thought they were cute and then I also
got<00:05:16.540> these<00:05:17.530> straws<00:05:18.100> these<00:05:18.820> are<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:19.270> type<00:05:19.510> that

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
got these straws these are the type that

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.680 
got these straws these are the type that
are<00:05:19.870> in<00:05:20.050> those<00:05:20.740> plastic<00:05:21.250> cups<00:05:22.000> with<00:05:22.360> straws

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.070 
are in those plastic cups with straws
and<00:05:23.440> I<00:05:23.770> noticed<00:05:24.130> that<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.700> straws<00:05:25.060> get<00:05:25.690> kind

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
and I noticed that the straws get kind

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.540 
and I noticed that the straws get kind
of<00:05:26.170> gross<00:05:26.350> after<00:05:26.710> a<00:05:26.740> while<00:05:26.980> and<00:05:27.280> I've<00:05:27.340> tried

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
of gross after a while and I've tried

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.340

pipe<00:05:27.970> cleaners<00:05:28.420> and<00:05:28.690> everything<00:05:29.080> to<00:05:29.230> clean

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
pipe cleaners and everything to clean

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.120
