00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Talk to you, youtube or beauty 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.400
 video money we will continue in the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.319
 series of d 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.250
 My first movie I think I am 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.250
 that phone 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.650
 sorry good he come here I will talk 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.260
 about framing one should ask the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.590
 that framing of cameras should not be 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.820
 ask what is good framing 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.100
 framing is a way for you to go 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.560
 frame as your name already tells me 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.599
 Sorry for the redundancy your object for 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.400
 better tell your story for example and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.160
 if framing would be where you are going to place 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.219
 so that you will put in your scene 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.410
 and he'll capture it, we 'll go some 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.180
 types of framing you using them 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.629
 in your movies not be a good thing 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.610
 cool 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.219
 before I started this video I wanted 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:01:00.750
 To say that finally I'm done. 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:01:01.350
 in my studio to stock then several 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.420
 shapes 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.549
 so what are the framing types 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.740
 a wedding before you start talking 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.350
 with its framing chips is very 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.350
 useful and it's always good to use it on your 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.729
 your movies or where you are struggling because 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.189
 you better help tell this story 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.439
 it emphasizes the best you want 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.960
 show what you want to tell 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.189
 so come on the different types of 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.890
 framework we have a 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.759
 framing the general plan is that it will 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.850
 do what 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.590
 what is it right general doctor is when 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.390
 you in court when the whole plan 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.850
 you show everything when you want 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.310
 show all your scene you will have a 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.009
 thing is main and will show everything 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.110
 environment where it is either indoor or 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.820
 together with your character 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.920
 So you're going to show the environment. 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.170
 the next plan that we have the plan 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.350
 American plan is when 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.360
 you pick up when you catch the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.180
 characters of the knee 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.149
 more or less up then you go 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.950
 get them from the knee above that 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.399
 plan is called a Pan - American because 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.750
 the 1940s they were heavily used 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.729
 for the actors of hollywood the actors 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.390
 not by hollywood directors 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.950
 next open plan 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.080
 open when you find the whole 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.150
 object in your week for example if I 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.819
 had an open plan that would be catching on 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.709
 I entirely plan the next plan 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.230
 mid- plane when you hit 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.880
 only half of your object or person 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.709
 What are you trying to show by 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.209
 example here would be taking more or 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.970
 less my waist up the plane 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.190
 doctor take the half of your waist 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.140
 object next year is the foreground 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:41.020
 oprah or near plan 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.550
 the run that close plan it will give 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.140
 more emphasis what you want to show by 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.660
 example that we have a plan 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.300
 next stage I would never be in the 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.430
 colloquy that are close to me, not 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.769
 so close are relatively 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.810
 next to me the next plan is the 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.060
 Fools who call you when you 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.700
 want to give your picture a closer look 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.920
 example here I am in the goals with you 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.769
 next close to super close 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.570
 would be even more so than the club for example 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.570
 here i am super course 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.459
 the next and last plan I do not know if I 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.709
 I told everyone here probably 5 is the 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.920
 detail plane is when you want to show 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.660
 just a detail of your scene to tell 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.180
 a story to show this detail 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.230
 that goes into making will be important will 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.299
 at the time you're telling your 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.579
 history and cases and weave in another plane 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.500
 as a general plan a fifth year 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.730
 American you can not show 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.980
 your viewers 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.739
 hence it is necessary for your image 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.540
 for example the breaking of a glass or a 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.060
 clock showing the hours 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.769
 This is cool, you're showing your 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.150
 character to get more into the story 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.670
 when necessary and that it does not 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.410
 could see or perceive if you 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.019
 is in a more open plan 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.600
 Ok guys so these are the plans is 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.430
 our planet is a framework for 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.989
 what's for weddings are the types 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.310
 always very good framing you 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.049
 use a frame to tell a 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.470
 story I have not always gotten to record some 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.570
 a place just okay is to take several tex is 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.430
 going back to our past I got several 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.590
 texts with different plans 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.450
 to tell your story and leave your 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.700
 movie or your short what you are going to do 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.620
 more dynamic your video even with 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.169
 video you are a more dynamic thing 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.299
 that you may want to tell your 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.830
 story 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.360
