00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
wondering and this is the curd is 107

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.680 
wondering and this is the curd is 107
that's<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> number<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.570> looks

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that's the number of it and it looks

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.200 
that's the number of it and it looks
like<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.230> sort<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.850> gets<00:00:44.850> longer

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
like that it's just sort of gets longer

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.330 
like that it's just sort of gets longer
the<00:00:45.329> end<00:00:45.450> normally<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.260> would<00:00:46.410> apply<00:00:46.770> your

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the end normally you would apply your

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.799 
the end normally you would apply your
lashes<00:00:47.579> after<00:00:48.030> you've<00:00:48.120> done<00:00:48.239> your<00:00:48.300> eyeliner

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
lashes after you've done your eyeliner

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.459 
lashes after you've done your eyeliner
so<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:50.100> glue<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.640> use<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.360> adhesive<00:00:51.510> it's

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
so the glue that I use the adhesive it's

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.080 
so the glue that I use the adhesive it's
sort<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.010> rubbed<00:00:53.250> off<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> earlier

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
sort of rubbed off is the earlier

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.880 
sort of rubbed off is the earlier
adhesive<00:00:54.870> glue<00:00:55.050> which<00:00:55.410> looks<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:56.719> that

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
adhesive glue which looks like that

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.349 
adhesive glue which looks like that
right<00:00:58.890> now<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.370> beginning<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.910> beginning<00:01:00.239> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
right now it's beginning is beginning to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.689 
right now it's beginning is beginning to
get<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> little<00:01:00.600> bit<00:01:01.050> clumpy<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.370> doesn't

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
get a little bit clumpy but it doesn't

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.880 
get a little bit clumpy but it doesn't
matter<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.449> who's<00:01:03.570> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.840> apply<00:01:04.170> some<00:01:04.739> of

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
matter and who's going to apply some of

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.850 
matter and who's going to apply some of
the<00:01:04.979> glue<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.729> top<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.510> lashes<00:01:06.860> which

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the glue to the top of the lashes which

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.280 
the glue to the top of the lashes which
is<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> top<00:01:08.340> there<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.970> if<00:01:09.630> you've<00:01:09.780> got<00:01:09.990> black

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
is the top there and if you've got black

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.440 
is the top there and if you've got black
glue<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:10.950> probably<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> lot<00:01:11.460> easier<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:12.060> use<00:01:12.270> I

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
glue it's probably a lot easier to use I

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.030
