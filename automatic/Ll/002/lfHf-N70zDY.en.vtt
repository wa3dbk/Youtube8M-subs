flakes<00:01:53.149> mixed<00:01:53.990> in<00:01:54.139> with<00:01:54.609> shrimp<00:01:55.609> pellets

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
flakes mixed in with shrimp pellets

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.330 
flakes mixed in with shrimp pellets
which<00:01:56.090> they<00:01:56.270> loved<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:57.009> occasional<00:01:58.009> live

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
which they loved and occasional live

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.399 
which they loved and occasional live
worms<00:01:58.789> that's<00:01:59.090> what<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.689> plus<00:01:59.990> algae<00:02:00.319> wafers

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
worms that's what and plus algae wafers

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.440 
worms that's what and plus algae wafers
that's<00:02:00.859> what<00:02:01.009> mine<00:02:01.159> was<00:02:01.279> fenced<00:02:01.579> as<00:02:01.700> well<00:02:02.420> I

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
that's what mine was fenced as well I

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.099 
that's what mine was fenced as well I
also<00:02:02.539> would<00:02:03.109> feed<00:02:03.319> mine<00:02:03.499> krill<00:02:05.020> that<00:02:06.020> was

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
also would feed mine krill that was

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.410 
also would feed mine krill that was
broken<00:02:06.319> up<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.889> fix<00:02:07.130> worms<00:02:09.520> well<00:02:10.520> so<00:02:10.789> bloodworm

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
broken up to fix worms well so bloodworm

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.840 
broken up to fix worms well so bloodworm
so<00:02:12.319> it's<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.620> very<00:02:12.860> adaptable<00:02:13.280> fish<00:02:13.550> in<00:02:13.670> terms

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
so it's a very adaptable fish in terms

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.350 
so it's a very adaptable fish in terms
of<00:02:14.000> diet<00:02:14.320> it's<00:02:15.320> also<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:16.130> would<00:02:16.970> say<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.150> fire

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
of diet it's also I would say the fire

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.710 
of diet it's also I would say the fire
mouth<00:02:17.600> is

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
mouth is

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.450 
mouth is
non-standard<00:02:19.170> community<00:02:19.590> fish<00:02:19.770> but<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.220> does

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
non-standard community fish but it does

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.420 
non-standard community fish but it does
well<00:02:20.760> in<00:02:20.970> kind<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.450> rough-and-tumble

not<00:02:35.730> around<00:02:35.910> our<00:02:36.090> cichlids<00:02:36.830> so<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:37.890> kept<00:02:38.130> mine

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
not around our cichlids so I kept mine

they'll<00:02:46.980> bug<00:02:47.280> other<00:02:47.520> fish<00:02:47.790> too<00:02:48.000> much<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.420> they

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.330 
despite them being of different genus
I've<00:03:49.320> Alton<00:03:49.620> heard<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.830> people<00:03:50.010> crossing

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
I've Alton heard the people crossing

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.940 
I've Alton heard the people crossing
fire<00:03:50.730> mouths<00:03:51.000> with<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.320> Texas<00:03:52.320> cichlids<00:03:52.709> for

fire mouths with a Texas cichlids for

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.500 
fire mouths with a Texas cichlids for

whole bunch of blood a whole bunch of

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.789 
whole bunch of blood a whole bunch of
ourself<00:03:56.250> merchants<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.560> there's<00:03:58.560> some

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
ourself merchants and there's some

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.710 
ourself merchants and there's some
genetic<00:03:59.220> reason<00:03:59.580> for<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.970> particulate

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
genetic reason for that particulate

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.870 
genetic reason for that particulate
because<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.200> way<00:04:01.290> how<00:04:01.440> they<00:04:01.620> speciate<00:04:02.190> for

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
because the way how they speciate for

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.880 
because the way how they speciate for
some<00:04:03.060> reason<00:04:03.420> they<00:04:03.600> seem<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.110> evolve<00:04:04.500> really

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
some reason they seem to evolve really

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.920 
some reason they seem to evolve really
fast<00:04:05.190> but<00:04:05.940> their<00:04:06.090> core<00:04:06.299> genetics<00:04:06.630> hasn't

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
fast but their core genetics hasn't

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.539 
fast but their core genetics hasn't
changed<00:04:07.170> so<00:04:07.260> much<00:04:07.440> so<00:04:07.650> they<00:04:07.769> maintain<00:04:08.040> ability

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
changed so much so they maintain ability

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.270 
changed so much so they maintain ability
to<00:04:08.880> crossbreed<00:04:09.600> with<00:04:09.840> each<00:04:09.989> other<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.440> as<00:04:11.250> a

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
to crossbreed with each other and as a

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.410 
to crossbreed with each other and as a
result<00:04:11.610> of<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:11.970> while<00:04:12.090> it's<00:04:12.180> actually

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
result of that and while it's actually

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.690 
result of that and while it's actually
possible<00:04:12.660> them<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.870> crossbreed<00:04:13.430> with<00:04:14.430> enough

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
possible them to crossbreed with enough

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.430 
possible them to crossbreed with enough
frequency<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:15.660> creates<00:04:16.019> a<00:04:16.080> new<00:04:16.200> species

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
frequency that creates a new species

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.680 
frequency that creates a new species
sometimes<00:04:17.660> so<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.900> fire<00:04:19.320> mouse<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.890> a<00:04:19.919> pretty

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
sometimes so the fire mouse is a pretty

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.120 
sometimes so the fire mouse is a pretty
good<00:04:21.690> starter<00:04:22.169> cichlid<00:04:22.530> because<00:04:22.830> it's<00:04:22.979> not

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
good starter cichlid because it's not

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.130 
good starter cichlid because it's not
die<00:04:23.310> aggressive<00:04:23.790> it's<00:04:24.060> not<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.540> big<00:04:24.900> either

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
die aggressive it's not that big either

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.170 
die aggressive it's not that big either
but<00:04:26.010> keep<00:04:26.190> in<00:04:26.280> mind<00:04:26.310> if<00:04:26.580> you're<00:04:26.669> one<00:04:26.789> keep<00:04:27.000> this

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
but keep in mind if you're one keep this

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.450 
but keep in mind if you're one keep this

aggressive cichlid like like a convict
or<00:04:56.960> bigger<00:04:57.380> species<00:04:57.920> we'll<00:04:58.250> just<00:04:58.460> whip<00:04:58.610> them

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
or bigger species we'll just whip them
