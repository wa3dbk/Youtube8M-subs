00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.190 
didn't even see me playing dead like a
boss<00:03:20.790> but<00:03:21.480> now<00:03:22.700> yes<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:24.150> basically<00:03:24.510> that's

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
boss but now yes so basically that's

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.199 
boss but now yes so basically that's
pretty<00:03:25.530> much<00:03:25.620> what<00:03:25.829> you<00:03:25.889> want<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.069> do<00:03:26.190> they<00:03:27.150> do

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
pretty much what you want to do they do

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.180 
pretty much what you want to do they do
actually<00:03:27.419> cap<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:28.349> spawns<00:03:28.620> quite<00:03:28.859> a<00:03:28.889> bit<00:03:29.099> in

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
actually cap the spawns quite a bit in

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.830 
actually cap the spawns quite a bit in
this<00:03:29.280> game<00:03:29.519> so<00:03:30.150> kind<00:03:30.419> of<00:03:30.480> throws<00:03:30.660> off<00:03:30.810> the

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
this game so kind of throws off the

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.750 
this game so kind of throws off the
spawns<00:03:31.230> but<00:03:31.530> eventually<00:03:31.950> like<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.579> doesn't

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
spawns but eventually like it doesn't

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.159 
spawns but eventually like it doesn't
really<00:03:32.910> matter<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.299> much<00:03:33.450> it's<00:03:33.870> only<00:03:33.930> when

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
really matter that much it's only when

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.140 
really matter that much it's only when
you're<00:03:34.230> on<00:03:34.380> like<00:03:34.889> a<00:03:34.919> starting<00:03:35.489> streak<00:03:35.760> cuz

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
you're on like a starting streak cuz

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.670 
you're on like a starting streak cuz
then<00:03:36.329> like<00:03:36.720> say<00:03:36.959> if<00:03:37.019> you're<00:03:37.169> on<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.290> 20<00:03:37.530> kill

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
then like say if you're on a 20 kill

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.890 
then like say if you're on a 20 kill
streak<00:03:37.889> already<00:03:38.129> you<00:03:38.280> can<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.579> basically

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
streak already you can just basically

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.909 
streak already you can just basically
like<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.079> doesn't<00:03:40.319> really<00:03:40.440> matter<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.709> just

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
like it doesn't really matter you just

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.259 
like it doesn't really matter you just
pick<00:03:41.040> four<00:03:41.280> kills<00:03:41.489> off<00:03:41.639> anywhere<00:03:41.910> but<00:03:42.120> you

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269
