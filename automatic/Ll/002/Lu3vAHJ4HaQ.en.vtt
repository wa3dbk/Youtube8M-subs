00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.070
 [Music] 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.800
 the infection in the urine or as 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.310
 scientifically he is known infection 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.970
 urinary is one of the causes most 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.949
 frequent consultation in patients 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.650
 both in external consultation and in 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.900
 emergency services and it's a great 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.140
 cause of hospitalization in the 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:44.610
 patients the urinary tract infection can be 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.739
 see many factors and it's not normal that 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.399
 patients present infection in the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.070
 urinate some patients especially 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.280
 Women believe that because of their condition 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.820
 of being a woman is normal to be having 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.300
 often urinary tract infections and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.759
 they make the decision to self-medicate if a 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.369
 antibiotic and she served them once 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.280
 they decide that the next time 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.670
 have a urinary infection this same 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.700
 treatment will serve you 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.299
 this is a big mistake because 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.340
 usually there is always a cause that 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.790
 makes patients present 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.119
 urinary tract infections and if that cause does not 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.000
 is detected and not treated is going to do that 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.220
 infections are perpetuated 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.560
 UTIs are managed 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.659
 frequently with antibiotics 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.509
 but the simple act of receiving 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.700
 antibiotics does not guarantee that it does not 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.610
 will continue to present 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.490
 therefore I invite the patients 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.950
 who are having urinary infections 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.409
 or that they had the first episode of 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.530
 urinary tract infection 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.960
 promptly the ferret sometimes the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.299
 Urinary tract infections can be due to 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.259
 important malformations in 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.869
 kidneys for example that a kidney is 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.599
 partially clogged or blocked and this 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.780
 over time it will lead to a deterioration 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:18.080
 of renal function and even loss 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.140
 of the whole of the organ therefore 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.420
 the message today is every patient that has 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.630
 been diagnosed with infection 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.819
 urinary tract should consult the urologist for 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.220
 find what is the cause and make a 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.220
 effective and on time treatment 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.240
 [Music] 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.480
 sooner
