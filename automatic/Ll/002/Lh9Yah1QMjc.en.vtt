just go ahead and put some reclaimer on
it<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:53.389> see<00:02:54.389> if<00:02:54.450> we<00:02:54.569> can't<00:02:54.810> get<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.109> out

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
it and see if we can't get that out

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.390 
it and see if we can't get that out
because<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.379> set<00:02:58.560> for<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.769> long<00:02:58.920> time<00:02:59.189> what

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
because this is set for a long time what

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.149 
because this is set for a long time what
we<00:02:59.519> might<00:02:59.730> end<00:02:59.879> up<00:03:00.030> doing<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:03.769> we'll<00:03:04.769> reclaim

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
we might end up doing is we'll reclaim

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.099 
we might end up doing is we'll reclaim
the<00:03:05.340> emulsion<00:03:05.670> out<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.269> we<00:03:06.599> might<00:03:06.780> have<00:03:06.930> to

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
the emulsion out and we might have to

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.940 
the emulsion out and we might have to
come<00:03:07.290> back<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:08.280> get<00:03:08.819> rid<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.950> stain

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
come back and get rid of that stain

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.069 
come back and get rid of that stain
again<00:03:11.400> let's<00:03:12.239> see<00:03:12.419> if<00:03:12.480> we<00:03:12.569> can't<00:03:12.810> get<00:03:12.930> this

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
again let's see if we can't get this

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.770 
again let's see if we can't get this
thing<00:03:13.139> cleaned<00:03:13.620> up<00:03:14.239> so<00:03:15.239> we'll<00:03:15.389> need<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.540> leave

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
thing cleaned up so we'll need to leave

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.589 
thing cleaned up so we'll need to leave
this<00:03:15.959> set<00:03:16.200> for<00:03:16.469> a<00:03:16.560> couple<00:03:17.310> minutes<00:03:17.599> that's

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
this set for a couple minutes that's

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.000 
this set for a couple minutes that's
good<00:03:20.750> we<00:03:21.750> pulled<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.139> screen<00:03:22.469> it<00:03:22.620> was<00:03:22.709> really

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
good we pulled this screen it was really

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.949 
good we pulled this screen it was really
difficult<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:24.329> can<00:03:24.480> see<00:03:24.659> that<00:03:24.840> the

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
difficult and you can see that the

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.539 
difficult and you can see that the
emulsion<00:03:25.260> is<00:03:25.469> starting<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.799> break<00:03:25.949> away<00:03:26.159> and

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
emulsion is starting to break away and

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.140 
emulsion is starting to break away and
you<00:03:27.329> also<00:03:27.480> see<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:28.199> zoom<00:03:29.010> in<00:03:29.159> a<00:03:29.189> little<00:03:29.370> bit<00:03:29.519> that

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
you also see a zoom in a little bit that

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.839 
you also see a zoom in a little bit that
that<00:03:30.389> goal<00:03:30.659> is<00:03:31.109> starting<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.859> loosen<00:03:32.639> up<00:03:32.730> a

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
that goal is starting to loosen up a

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.720 
that goal is starting to loosen up a
little<00:03:32.879> bit<00:03:33.120> too<00:03:33.449> because<00:03:34.319> now<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:35.010> was<00:03:35.159> bonded

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
little bit too because now it was bonded

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.869 
little bit too because now it was bonded
more<00:03:36.689> to<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.349> emulsion<00:03:37.709> than<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.430> was<00:03:38.639> to<00:03:38.849> the

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
more to the emulsion than it was to the

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.209 
more to the emulsion than it was to the
fabric<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:40.169> what<00:03:40.349> we're<00:03:40.469> going<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.620> try<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.919> do

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:41.219 
fabric so what we're going to try to do

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.059 
fabric so what we're going to try to do
is<00:03:41.609> break<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.299> emulsion<00:03:42.930> away<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:43.620> that

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
is break that emulsion away and that

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.679 
is break that emulsion away and that
gold<00:03:44.400> ink<00:03:44.579> then<00:03:44.760> should<00:03:44.969> loosen<00:03:45.299> up<00:03:45.389> to<00:03:45.540> where

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
gold ink then should loosen up to where

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.800 
gold ink then should loosen up to where
we<00:03:45.840> can<00:03:45.989> get<00:03:46.169> it<00:03:46.199> off<00:03:46.409> also<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:47.430> our<00:03:47.609> goal<00:03:47.879> is<00:03:48.540> to

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
we can get it off also so our goal is to

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.759 
we can get it off also so our goal is to
save<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.079> screen

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
save a screen

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.920 
save a screen

mileage rub on a little bit more I

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.010 
mileage rub on a little bit more I
really<00:05:12.940> made<00:05:13.150> a<00:05:13.180> trick<00:05:13.449> here<00:05:13.630> they've<00:05:13.750> added

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
really made a trick here they've added

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:23.909 
really made a trick here they've added
some<00:05:14.050> Golding<00:05:14.530> back<00:05:22.440> ok<00:05:23.440> we're<00:05:23.590> going<00:05:23.680> to<00:05:23.770> see

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
some Golding back ok we're going to see

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:32.140 
some Golding back ok we're going to see
if<00:05:24.039> we<00:05:24.070> can<00:05:24.250> save<00:05:24.490> this<00:05:24.699> screen

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.650 

real<00:05:33.150> faint<00:05:33.450> but<00:05:34.110> I<00:05:34.140> think<00:05:34.530> I<00:05:35.420> think<00:05:36.420> you<00:05:36.510> could

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
real faint but I think I think you could

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.980 
real faint but I think I think you could
make<00:05:36.690> that<00:05:36.900> screen<00:05:37.380> work<00:05:37.590> oh<00:05:37.860> yeah<00:05:38.810> let's<00:05:39.810> say

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
make that screen work oh yeah let's say

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.780 
make that screen work oh yeah let's say
that<00:05:40.200> straight<00:05:43.280> Blake's<00:05:44.280> telling<00:05:44.610> me<00:05:44.700> he'd

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
that straight Blake's telling me he'd

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.100 
that straight Blake's telling me he'd
like<00:05:44.940> to<00:05:44.970> hit<00:05:45.150> it<00:05:45.180> one<00:05:45.390> more<00:05:45.420> time<00:05:45.840> with<00:05:46.020> the

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
like to hit it one more time with the

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.140 
like to hit it one more time with the
greaser<00:05:46.380> but<00:05:46.650> what<00:05:46.800> I<00:05:46.830> would<00:05:47.100> do<00:05:47.280> in<00:05:48.030> a

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
greaser but what I would do in a

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.240 
greaser but what I would do in a
situation<00:05:48.390> like<00:05:48.810> that<00:05:48.960> is<00:05:49.740> to<00:05:49.860> go<00:05:50.070> with<00:05:50.220> a
