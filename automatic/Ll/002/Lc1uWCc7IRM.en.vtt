you<00:01:03.890> guys<00:01:04.040> know<00:01:04.280> order<00:01:04.790> of<00:01:04.910> your<00:01:05.059> exercises

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
you guys know order of your exercises

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.570 
you guys know order of your exercises
matter<00:01:05.960> when<00:01:06.230> creating<00:01:06.680> a<00:01:06.800> routine<00:01:06.980> so<00:01:07.460> we

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
matter when creating a routine so we

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.890 
matter when creating a routine so we
make<00:01:07.760> sure<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:08.000> do<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.120> bench<00:01:08.420> press<00:01:08.570> first

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
make sure to do a bench press first

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.150 
make sure to do a bench press first
because<00:01:09.230> we<00:01:09.350> knew<00:01:09.500> that<00:01:09.620> was<00:01:09.770> going<00:01:09.800> to<00:01:09.950> engage

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
because we knew that was going to engage

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.400 
because we knew that was going to engage
our<00:01:10.550> shoulders<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.450> then<00:01:11.900> go<00:01:12.080> over<00:01:12.230> to

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
our shoulders and then go over to

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.380 
our shoulders and then go over to
overhead<00:01:12.800> press<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.280> really<00:01:13.790> fatigue<00:01:14.150> them

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
overhead press to really fatigue them

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.700 
overhead press to really fatigue them
and<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:14.660> feel<00:01:14.900> you<00:01:15.080> did<00:01:15.230> it<00:01:15.320> two<00:01:15.410> other<00:01:15.560> way

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
and I feel you did it two other way

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.590 
and I feel you did it two other way
around<00:01:16.040> your<00:01:16.640> bench<00:01:16.880> press<00:01:16.940> wouldn't<00:01:17.420> be<00:01:17.510> as

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
around your bench press wouldn't be as

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.820 
around your bench press wouldn't be as
strong<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.080> that's<00:01:18.140> something<00:01:18.470> we<00:01:18.560> didn't

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
strong and that's something we didn't

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.340 
strong and that's something we didn't
want<00:01:19.040> to<00:01:19.130> happen

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:40.719 

I<00:01:26.119> can<00:01:27.119> see

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:53.429 

please

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.740 

like<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:54.189> said<00:01:54.250> earlier<00:01:54.700> guys<00:01:54.880> we<00:01:55.119> started<00:01:55.600> the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
like I said earlier guys we started the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.810 
like I said earlier guys we started the
benchpress<00:01:56.079> process<00:01:56.829> we're<00:01:57.039> actually<00:01:57.280> doing

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
benchpress process we're actually doing

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.550 
benchpress process we're actually doing
push-up<00:01:58.360> so<00:01:58.539> you<00:01:58.719> always<00:01:58.930> want<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.229> do<00:01:59.350> some

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
push-up so you always want to do some

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.080 
push-up so you always want to do some
sorta<00:01:59.829> calisthenics<00:02:00.460> for<00:02:00.640> bodyweight

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
sorta calisthenics for bodyweight

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.730 
sorta calisthenics for bodyweight
movement<00:02:01.659> before<00:02:02.049> you<00:02:02.380> actually<00:02:02.530> start

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
movement before you actually start

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.440 
movement before you actually start
moving<00:02:03.220> weight<00:02:03.430> so<00:02:03.610> that's<00:02:03.729> why<00:02:03.939> we<00:02:04.090> did<00:02:04.240> pull

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
moving weight so that's why we did pull

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.120 
moving weight so that's why we did pull
ups<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:04.840> pull<00:02:05.020> ups<00:02:05.049> are<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.350> bit<00:02:05.530> easy<00:02:05.770> for<00:02:06.039> us

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
ups and pull ups are a bit easy for us

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.910 
ups and pull ups are a bit easy for us
so<00:02:06.280> we<00:02:06.399> decided<00:02:06.729> to<00:02:06.850> do<00:02:07.000> them<00:02:07.149> weighted

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.220 

after<00:02:11.790> those<00:02:11.880> pull-ups<00:02:12.390> our<00:02:12.540> back<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:13.020> nice

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
after those pull-ups our back is nice

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.870 
after those pull-ups our back is nice
and<00:02:13.440> warm<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.920> filled<00:02:14.190> with<00:02:14.250> blood<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:14.730> now

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
and warm and filled with blood so now

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.820 
and warm and filled with blood so now
we're<00:02:15.060> going<00:02:15.240> onto<00:02:15.540> some<00:02:15.810> dumbbell<00:02:16.319> rows<00:02:16.560> I'm

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
we're going onto some dumbbell rows I'm

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.500 
we're going onto some dumbbell rows I'm
telling<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.220> guys<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.819> is<00:02:18.030> probably<00:02:18.240> one<00:02:18.480> of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
telling you guys this is probably one of

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.540 
telling you guys this is probably one of
the<00:02:18.630> most<00:02:18.750> effective<00:02:19.290> ways<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.709> build<00:02:20.310> those

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
the most effective ways to build those

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.520 
the most effective ways to build those
lats<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.630> want<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.959> make<00:02:22.110> sure<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.440> you

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
lats you want to make sure that you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.050 
lats you want to make sure that you
actually<00:02:22.680> land<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.130> dumbbell<00:02:23.550> hanging<00:02:23.910> for

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
actually land the dumbbell hanging for

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.480 
actually land the dumbbell hanging for
even<00:02:24.300> half<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.750> second<00:02:25.350> at<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.890> bottom<00:02:26.340> to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
even half a second at the bottom to

important<00:02:38.640> we<00:02:38.760> made<00:02:38.940> sure<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.180> do<00:02:39.510> these<00:02:39.660> at

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
important we made sure to do these at

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.660 
important we made sure to do these at
the<00:02:40.140> overhead<00:02:40.440> presses<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.040> we<00:02:41.459> may<00:02:41.610> should

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the overhead presses and we may should

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.580 
the overhead presses and we may should
do<00:02:42.000> another<00:02:42.239> muscle<00:02:42.660> group<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.930> between<00:02:43.350> so

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
do another muscle group in between so

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.920 
do another muscle group in between so
like<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.890> one<00:02:44.070> we<00:02:44.190> do<00:02:44.459> execute<00:02:45.060> these<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:45.750> do

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
like that one we do execute these we do

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.510 
like that one we do execute these we do
it<00:02:46.050> with<00:02:46.170> good<00:02:46.410> form<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:47.010> wouldn't<00:02:47.280> jerk

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
it with good form and we wouldn't jerk

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.180 
it with good form and we wouldn't jerk
too<00:02:47.730> much<00:02:51.530> come<00:02:52.530> on<00:02:52.680> guys<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:53.100> the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
towards the end so I thought we have

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.120 
towards the end so I thought we have
something<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.019> look<00:02:58.110> forward<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.860> again

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
this is the easiest muscle group to

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.540 
this is the easiest muscle group to
target<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.260> we<00:03:01.380> made<00:03:01.560> sure<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:02.220> know<00:03:02.340> what

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
target so we made sure you know what

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.949 
target so we made sure you know what
