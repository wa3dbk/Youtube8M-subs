texture<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.960> think<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> pretty

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
texture I think this is a pretty

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.090 
texture I think this is a pretty
straightforward<00:00:41.840> 3c<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.230> I'm<00:00:43.440> not<00:00:43.649> sure<00:00:43.920> I

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
straightforward 3c but I'm not sure I

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.860 
straightforward 3c but I'm not sure I
could<00:00:44.160> be<00:00:44.520> wrong<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.000> she<00:00:45.120> has<00:00:45.270> pretty<00:00:45.539> loose

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
could be wrong but she has pretty loose

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.709 
could be wrong but she has pretty loose
curls<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.890> teeny<00:00:47.280> bit<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.640> heat<00:00:48.000> damage<00:00:48.270> in

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
curls and a teeny bit of heat damage in

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.810 
curls and a teeny bit of heat damage in
different<00:00:49.110> spots<00:00:49.410> all<00:00:49.649> over<00:00:49.680> her<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.250> just

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
different spots all over her here just

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.760 
different spots all over her here just
from<00:00:50.910> straightening<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.719> lot<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.469> not

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
from straightening it a lot but it's not

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.900 
from straightening it a lot but it's not
too<00:00:53.010> big<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.460> deal

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
too big of a deal

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
I'm working with and I know I've done

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.869 
I'm working with and I know I've done
flexi<00:01:00.390> rods<00:01:00.629> before<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.469> my<00:01:01.920> transitioning

curl<00:01:03.120> friend<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> think<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.619> really

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
curl friend but I think it's really

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.010 
curl friend but I think it's really
helpful<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> see<00:01:05.549> how<00:01:05.820> flexi<00:01:06.360> rods<00:01:06.570> work<00:01:06.840> on

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
helpful to see how flexi rods work on

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.539 
helpful to see how flexi rods work on
different<00:01:07.260> hair<00:01:07.590> textures<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
different hair textures because the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.490 
different hair textures because the
results<00:01:09.000> definitely<00:01:09.299> come<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:09.990> differently

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
results definitely come out differently

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.679 
results definitely come out differently
so<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.280> starting<00:01:11.640> off<00:01:11.820> by<00:01:11.850> sectioning<00:01:12.510> her

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
so I'm starting off by sectioning her

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.510 
so I'm starting off by sectioning her
hair<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.049> half<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.590> I'm<00:01:13.680> gonna<00:01:13.830> get<00:01:14.100> ready<00:01:14.250> to

work<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.060> bottom<00:01:15.479> section<00:01:15.720> first<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
work on this bottom section first and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.649

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.620 
it's a lot silkier it's not too coarse
so<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.649> really<00:01:55.950> doesn't<00:01:56.399> require<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.090> lot<00:01:57.360> of

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
so it really doesn't require a lot of

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.730 
so it really doesn't require a lot of

I'll show you how to use in a second so
I'm<00:02:28.330> applying<00:02:28.629> a<00:02:28.959> good<00:02:29.260> amount<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.650> that

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
I'm applying a good amount of that

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.460 
I'm applying a good amount of that
mousse<00:02:30.160> over<00:02:30.489> this<00:02:30.819> entire<00:02:31.239> section<00:02:31.660> making

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
mousse over this entire section making

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.199 
mousse over this entire section making
sure<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.769> is<00:02:32.890> thoroughly<00:02:33.250> distributed<00:02:34.030> and

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
sure that is thoroughly distributed and

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.330 
sure that is thoroughly distributed and
this<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:34.930> really<00:02:35.200> helps<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.680> keep<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.069> curl

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
this just really helps to keep the curl

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.120 
this just really helps to keep the curl
after<00:02:37.209> I<00:02:37.239> remove<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.989> flexi<00:02:38.440> rod<00:02:38.650> when<00:02:38.980> this

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
after I remove the flexi rod when this

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.250 
after I remove the flexi rod when this
style<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.519> complete<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.569> it<00:02:40.780> just<00:02:40.989> really

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
style is complete so it just really

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.410 
style is complete so it just really
gives<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.560> lot<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.769> staying<00:02:42.220> power<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.790> hold<00:02:43.150> so

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
gives a lot of staying power and hold so

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.539 
gives a lot of staying power and hold so
I<00:02:43.450> thoroughly<00:02:43.959> detangled<00:02:44.260> this<00:02:44.590> section<00:02:44.980> one

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
I thoroughly detangled this section one

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.400 
I thoroughly detangled this section one
more<00:02:45.760> time<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.299> now<00:02:46.630> I'm<00:02:46.870> getting<00:02:47.170> ready<00:02:47.290> to

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
more time and now I'm getting ready to

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.680 
more time and now I'm getting ready to
work<00:02:47.650> with<00:02:47.709> these<00:02:47.950> little<00:02:48.010> papers<00:02:48.670> now<00:02:49.180> my<00:02:49.390> mom

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
work with these little papers now my mom

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.289 
work with these little papers now my mom
always<00:02:50.170> use<00:02:50.590> these<00:02:50.799> on<00:02:51.010> my<00:02:51.190> hair<00:02:51.489> as<00:02:51.670> long<00:02:52.000> as<00:02:52.180> I

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
always use these on my hair as long as I

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.569 
always use these on my hair as long as I
can<00:02:52.360> remember<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:53.260> she<00:02:53.650> basically<00:02:53.829> just<00:02:54.370> puts

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
can remember and she basically just puts

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.370 
can remember and she basically just puts
them<00:02:54.730> on<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.030> ends<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.720> then<00:02:55.870> folds<00:02:56.230> them

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
them on the ends and then folds them

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.440 
them on the ends and then folds them
over<00:02:56.680> like<00:02:56.860> this<00:02:57.069> and<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.670> just<00:02:57.910> keeps<00:02:58.299> the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
over like this and it just keeps the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.449 
over like this and it just keeps the
ends<00:02:58.900> from<00:02:59.019> getting<00:02:59.410> frizzy<00:02:59.739> while<00:03:00.280> you're

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
ends from getting frizzy while you're

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.150 
ends from getting frizzy while you're
drying<00:03:00.849> so<00:03:01.510> that's<00:03:01.959> all<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.319> is<00:03:02.349> really<00:03:02.769> simple

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
drying so that's all it is really simple

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.009 
drying so that's all it is really simple
don't<00:03:03.640> worry<00:03:03.850> if<00:03:04.060> you<00:03:04.209> don't<00:03:04.389> have<00:03:04.600> these<00:03:04.780> at

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
don't worry if you don't have these at

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.170 
don't worry if you don't have these at
home<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.920> now<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:06.459> this<00:03:06.639> little<00:03:06.910> circular

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
home so now in this little circular

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.770 
home so now in this little circular
motion<00:03:07.840> as<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:08.049> can<00:03:08.380> see<00:03:08.620> I'm<00:03:08.889> just<00:03:08.920> kind<00:03:09.220> of

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
motion as you can see I'm just kind of

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.840 
motion as you can see I'm just kind of
rolling<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.810> hair<00:03:11.230> onto<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:11.980> flexi<00:03:12.430> rod<00:03:12.639> now

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
rolling the hair onto the flexi rod now

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.879 
rolling the hair onto the flexi rod now
I<00:03:13.030> prefer<00:03:13.359> this<00:03:13.690> method<00:03:14.230> as<00:03:14.410> opposed<00:03:14.769> to

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
I prefer this method as opposed to

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.979 
I prefer this method as opposed to
wrapping<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.579> hair<00:03:15.790> around<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.329> flexi<00:03:16.810> rod

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
wrapping the hair around the flexi rod

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.140 
wrapping the hair around the flexi rod
smoothly<00:03:17.410> because<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.310> gives<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:18.639> more<00:03:18.850> of<00:03:18.910> a

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
smoothly because it gives you more of a

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.270 
smoothly because it gives you more of a
natural-looking<00:03:19.690> curl<00:03:20.260> as<00:03:20.560> opposed<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.069> that

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
natural-looking curl as opposed to that

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.059 
natural-looking curl as opposed to that
cookie<00:03:21.700> cutter<00:03:22.030> candy<00:03:22.750> curl<00:03:23.019> that<00:03:23.530> we<00:03:23.680> often

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
cookie cutter candy curl that we often

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.580 
cookie cutter candy curl that we often
see<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:24.700> really<00:03:25.389> like<00:03:25.600> this<00:03:25.780> method<00:03:26.019> and<00:03:26.500> as

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
see so I really like this method and as

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.900 
see so I really like this method and as
you<00:03:26.739> can<00:03:26.889> see<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.190> just<00:03:27.340> went<00:03:27.670> ahead<00:03:27.760> and

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
you can see I just went ahead and

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.599 
you can see I just went ahead and
secured<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.599> and<00:03:28.750> we<00:03:28.900> have<00:03:29.109> our<00:03:29.440> first<00:03:29.920> flexi

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
secured it and we have our first flexi

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:39.650 
secured it and we have our first flexi
rod<00:03:30.790> set

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
a lot of them I used really chunky

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.719 
a lot of them I used really chunky

dryer for about an hour and when I took
up<00:06:10.550> let's<00:06:10.759> see<00:06:10.909> rods<00:06:11.089> out<00:06:11.270> they<00:06:11.539> were<00:06:11.599> still<00:06:11.930> a

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
up let's see rods out they were still a

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.019 
up let's see rods out they were still a
bit<00:06:12.080> damp<00:06:12.499> so<00:06:12.919> I<00:06:12.979> just<00:06:13.249> put<00:06:13.460> her<00:06:13.580> back<00:06:13.610> under

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:14.029 
bit damp so I just put her back under

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:16.149 
bit damp so I just put her back under
there<00:06:14.419> and<00:06:14.659> the<00:06:15.020> curls<00:06:15.289> still<00:06:15.619> remained<00:06:15.979> the

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:16.159 
there and the curls still remained the

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.129 
there and the curls still remained the
same<00:06:16.369> when<00:06:16.909> you<00:06:16.999> take<00:06:17.210> out<00:06:17.330> the<00:06:17.479> flexi<00:06:17.899> rods

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.200

like<00:06:18.349> when<00:06:18.740> they're<00:06:19.009> like<00:06:19.189> 3/4<00:06:19.879> of<00:06:19.969> the<00:06:20.089> way

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210
