three<00:06:12.960> xenakis<00:06:13.410> initially<00:06:13.950> but<00:06:14.520> the<00:06:14.790> genre<00:06:15.210> is

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
three xenakis initially but the genre is

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.060 
three xenakis initially but the genre is
just<00:06:15.390> so<00:06:15.540> good<00:06:15.750> in<00:06:15.990> the<00:06:16.140> main<00:06:16.320> that<00:06:16.590> we<00:06:16.800> had<00:06:16.950> to

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
just so good in the main that we had to

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.280 
just so good in the main that we had to
put<00:06:17.250> one<00:06:17.370> in<00:06:17.670> demand<00:06:17.940> for<00:06:18.630> a<00:06:18.690> Zen<00:06:18.810> ago<00:06:18.960> so<00:06:19.170> the

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
put one in demand for a Zen ago so the

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.080 
put one in demand for a Zen ago so the
deck<00:06:19.440> switches<00:06:19.830> to<00:06:19.980> agro<00:06:20.310> mode<00:06:20.520> very<00:06:20.790> quickly
