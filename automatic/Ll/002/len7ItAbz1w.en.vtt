00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:07.479 
hey this is Todd Walker I'd like to

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:08.820 
hey this is Todd Walker I'd like to
welcome<00:00:07.599> everybody<00:00:08.080> back<00:00:08.109> for<00:00:08.469> another<00:00:08.620> video

welcome everybody back for another video

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.680 
welcome everybody back for another video
drum<00:00:09.219> lesson<00:00:09.549> I've<00:00:10.030> been<00:00:10.180> getting<00:00:10.389> quite<00:00:10.660> a

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
drum lesson I've been getting quite a

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.650 
drum lesson I've been getting quite a
few<00:00:10.780> requests<00:00:11.500> in<00:00:11.619> for<00:00:11.950> the<00:00:12.070> linear<00:00:12.490> type<00:00:13.449> of

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
few requests in for the linear type of

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.750 
few requests in for the linear type of
style<00:00:14.020> so<00:00:14.410> what<00:00:15.010> half<00:00:15.189> of<00:00:15.309> you<00:00:15.369> today<00:00:15.520> is

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
style so what half of you today is

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.630 
style so what half of you today is
basically<00:00:16.119> a<00:00:16.209> 4/4<00:00:16.869> triplet<00:00:17.800> linear<00:00:18.130> pattern

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
basically a 4/4 triplet linear pattern

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.400 
basically a 4/4 triplet linear pattern
now<00:00:19.090> remember<00:00:19.539> there's<00:00:19.750> just<00:00:20.019> so<00:00:20.289> many

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
now remember there's just so many

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.650 
now remember there's just so many
players<00:00:20.770> out<00:00:21.100> there<00:00:21.369> and<00:00:21.490> so<00:00:21.700> many<00:00:21.760> ideas<00:00:22.420> on

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
players out there and so many ideas on

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.600 
players out there and so many ideas on
this<00:00:22.900> but<00:00:23.680> I<00:00:23.710> just<00:00:23.800> put<00:00:24.100> something<00:00:24.340> together

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
this but I just put something together

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.300 
this but I just put something together
in<00:00:25.000> triplet<00:00:25.600> form<00:00:25.900> so<00:00:26.619> again<00:00:26.980> at<00:00:27.100> the<00:00:27.190> end

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
in triplet form so again at the end

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.560 
in triplet form so again at the end
it'll<00:00:27.490> be<00:00:27.640> written<00:00:27.940> on<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.180> board<00:00:28.449> and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
it'll be written on the board and

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.240 
it'll be written on the board and
transcribed<00:00:29.199> so<00:00:29.410> you<00:00:29.500> can<00:00:29.619> see<00:00:29.800> it<00:00:29.920> but<00:00:30.010> here's

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
transcribed so you can see it but here's

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.950 
transcribed so you can see it but here's
what<00:00:30.340> the<00:00:30.460> pattern<00:00:30.820> is<00:00:30.940> it's<00:00:31.150> basically<00:00:31.570> one

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
what the pattern is it's basically one

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.110 
what the pattern is it's basically one
triplet<00:00:32.289> two<00:00:32.500> triplet<00:00:32.739> three<00:00:33.609> triplet<00:00:33.640> four

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
triplet two triplet three triplet four

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.119 
triplet two triplet three triplet four
triplet<00:00:34.420> on<00:00:35.670> one<00:00:36.670> triplet<00:00:37.149> its<00:00:38.019> foot<00:00:38.769> right

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
triplet on one triplet its foot right

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:46.819 
triplet on one triplet its foot right
left<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:42.300> two<00:00:43.300> triplet<00:00:43.749> it's<00:00:44.199> right<00:00:45.190> foot<00:00:46.030> left

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
left on two triplet it's right foot left

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.500 
left on two triplet it's right foot left
two<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:49.589> three<00:00:50.589> triplet<00:00:51.249> it's<00:00:51.489> right<00:00:52.030> foot

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
two on three triplet it's right foot

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.910 
two on three triplet it's right foot
foot<00:00:53.069> three<00:00:54.069> triple<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:54.940> on<00:00:55.929> four<00:00:56.499> triplet

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
foot three triple and on four triplet

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.189 
foot three triple and on four triplet
it's<00:00:57.519> left<00:00:58.030> right<00:00:58.239> left<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.629> here's<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:02.019> whole

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
it's left right left so here's the whole

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.890 
it's left right left so here's the whole
pattern<00:01:02.499> slowly<00:01:03.100> in<00:01:03.519> triplet<00:01:04.330> form<00:01:04.629> with<00:01:04.869> a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
pattern slowly in triplet form with a

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:15.870 
pattern slowly in triplet form with a
linear<00:01:05.170> idea<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:15.070> I'm<00:01:15.130> gonna<00:01:15.250> put<00:01:15.460> an<00:01:15.550> open

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
linear idea now I'm gonna put an open

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.420 
linear idea now I'm gonna put an open
hi-hat<00:01:16.120> on<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.690> three<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.470> I'm<00:01:18.100> going<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.310> use

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
hi-hat on the three and I'm going to use

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.160 
hi-hat on the three and I'm going to use
some<00:01:18.640> ghost<00:01:18.940> strokes<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.630> again<00:01:19.840> all<00:01:20.020> these

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
some ghost strokes and again all these

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.010 
some ghost strokes and again all these
will<00:01:20.380> be<00:01:20.410> notated<00:01:20.920> on<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.730> board<00:01:22.000> as<00:01:22.150> well<00:01:22.180> so

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
will be notated on the board as well so

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.620 
will be notated on the board as well so
here's<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.530> pattern<00:01:23.710> slowly<00:01:24.670> with<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.390> ghost

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
here's the pattern slowly with the ghost

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.000 
here's the pattern slowly with the ghost
strokes<00:01:26.050> and<00:01:26.260> open<00:01:27.070> hi-hat<00:01:27.310> on<00:01:27.790> three<00:01:28.950> okay<00:01:29.950> so

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
strokes and open hi-hat on three okay so

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.560 
strokes and open hi-hat on three okay so
here's<00:01:30.310> what<00:01:30.490> it<00:01:30.520> sounds<00:01:30.790> like<00:01:31.120> all<00:01:31.330> put

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
here's what it sounds like all put

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:44.399 
here's what it sounds like all put
together<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:33.130> two<00:01:33.670> three<00:01:34.240> triplet<00:01:34.690> floor

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.590 

if<00:01:45.409> I<00:01:45.560> do<00:01:45.619> this<00:01:45.920> maybe<00:01:46.250> a<00:01:46.430> slow<00:01:46.820> shuffle<00:01:47.570> groove

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
if I do this maybe a slow shuffle groove

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.670 
if I do this maybe a slow shuffle groove
and<00:01:48.259> then<00:01:48.770> also<00:01:49.009> some<00:01:49.490> 16<00:01:50.090> throw<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.170> triplet

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
and then also some 16 throw the triplet

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.649 
and then also some 16 throw the triplet
linear<00:01:52.009> groove<00:01:52.400> in<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.270> can<00:01:53.390> just<00:01:53.420> see

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
linear groove in and you can just see

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.149 
linear groove in and you can just see
how<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:53.899> can<00:01:54.049> kind<00:01:54.259> of<00:01:54.350> work<00:01:54.530> with<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.770> couple<00:01:55.009> of

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
how it can kind of work with a couple of

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.010 
how it can kind of work with a couple of
different<00:01:55.460> styles<00:01:55.700> it's<00:01:56.119> just<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.420> change<00:01:56.750> up

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
different styles it's just a change up

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.219 
different styles it's just a change up
on<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.350> groove<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:57.860> feel<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:59.090> slow<00:01:59.600> shuffle

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
on the groove and feel so slow shuffle

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.200 
on the groove and feel so slow shuffle
first<00:02:00.530> then<00:02:00.920> into<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.310> triplet<00:02:01.700> linear<00:02:02.030> and

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
first then into the triplet linear and

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.870 
first then into the triplet linear and
then<00:02:02.600> some<00:02:02.869> 6/8<00:02:03.500> feel<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.190> then<00:02:04.549> into<00:02:04.789> the

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
then some 6/8 feel and then into the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:48.420 
then some 6/8 feel and then into the
triplet<00:02:05.299> linear<00:02:06.039> one<00:02:07.039> two<00:02:07.640> three

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.030 

all<00:02:49.430> right<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:50.330> there<00:02:50.600> you<00:02:50.720> have<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:50.990> I'm<00:02:51.620> Todd

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
all right so there you have it I'm Todd
