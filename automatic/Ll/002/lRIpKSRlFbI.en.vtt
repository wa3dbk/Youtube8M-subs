I<00:00:12.559> do<00:00:13.559> tend<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.430> wherever<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.940> am<00:00:15.270> and<00:00:15.539> look<00:00:15.780> for

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
I do tend to wherever I am and look for

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.170 
I do tend to wherever I am and look for
places<00:00:16.949> where<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.310> might<00:00:17.520> be<00:00:17.580> able<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:18.030> get

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
places where I might be able to get

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.240 
places where I might be able to get
indigenous<00:00:18.840> clays<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.890> thought<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.160> would

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
indigenous clays and I thought it would

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.939 
indigenous clays and I thought it would
be<00:00:20.400> great<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.940> get<00:00:21.060> some<00:00:21.119> London<00:00:21.539> clay<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.920> I

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
be great to get some London clay so I

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.919 
be great to get some London clay so I
was<00:00:23.189> able<00:00:23.339> to<00:00:23.519> do<00:00:23.849> that<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.119> saw<00:00:24.599> some

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:24.929 
was able to do that I saw some

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.380 
was able to do that I saw some
construction<00:00:25.619> site<00:00:25.859> when<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.099> went<00:00:26.339> to<00:00:26.400> gallery

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
construction site when I went to gallery

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.989 
construction site when I went to gallery
so<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.140> decided<00:00:28.589> to<00:00:28.949> see<00:00:29.490> if<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.640> could<00:00:29.699> get

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:29.999 
so I decided to see if I could get

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:35.569 
so I decided to see if I could get
something<00:00:32.750> when<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.780> was<00:00:34.230> asked<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.400> would<00:00:35.550> be

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
something when I was asked if I would be

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.210 
something when I was asked if I would be
interested<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.300> doing<00:00:36.480> residency<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.740> at

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the VNA it just immediately struck me as

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.950 
the VNA it just immediately struck me as
something<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.270> couldn't<00:00:43.110> say<00:00:43.379> no<00:00:43.590> to

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960

ahead planned ahead projects had to do
with<00:01:05.129> lost<00:01:05.580> ceramic<00:01:06.390> arts<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.380> technology

with lost ceramic arts and technology

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.000 
with lost ceramic arts and technology
which<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.730> something<00:01:08.910> I<00:01:09.150> specialize<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:10.010> 17th

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
which is something I specialize in 17th

which is something I specialize in 17th
and<00:01:11.160> 18th<00:01:11.220> century<00:01:11.910> ceramic<00:01:12.330> techniques<00:01:12.840> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
how those techniques in the context of

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.240 
how those techniques in the context of
the<00:01:16.680> pieces<00:01:16.890> relate<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.930> 21st<00:01:18.930> century<00:01:19.560> issues

the pieces relate to 21st century issues

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.270 
the pieces relate to 21st century issues
and<00:01:20.780> one<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.870> the<00:01:21.930> most<00:01:22.230> exciting<00:01:22.620> things<00:01:23.040> for

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and one of the most exciting things for

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.610 
and one of the most exciting things for
me<00:01:23.340> was<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> idea<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.300> curating<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.290> case

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
me was the idea of curating this case

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.250 
me was the idea of curating this case
and<00:01:26.070> picking<00:01:26.700> objects<00:01:27.270> from<00:01:27.510> the<00:01:27.720> collection

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
and picking objects from the collection

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.610 
and picking objects from the collection
of<00:01:28.500> course<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.580> VNA<00:01:29.940> has<00:01:30.360> such<00:01:31.140> an<00:01:31.320> enormous

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
of course the VNA has such an enormous

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.250 
of course the VNA has such an enormous
collection<00:01:32.580> of<00:01:32.790> things<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.180> interest<00:01:34.170> me

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
collection of things that interest me

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.190 
collection of things that interest me
because<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.940> draw<00:01:36.300> a<00:01:36.330> lot<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:37.080> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
because I really draw a lot on the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.310 
because I really draw a lot on the
history<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.560> ceramics

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.350 

the<00:01:41.070> other<00:01:41.250> things<00:01:41.940> that<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.210> been

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the other things that have been

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.750 
the other things that have been
happening<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:43.440> a<00:01:43.500> part<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.950> being<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
happening as a part of being in the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.970 
happening as a part of being in the
studios<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.570> being<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.900> the<00:01:45.990> museum<00:01:46.410> have

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
studios and being in the museum have

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.610 
studios and being in the museum have
arose<00:01:47.280> out<00:01:47.730> of<00:01:47.940> all<00:01:48.900> these<00:01:49.050> things<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.500> were

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
arose out of all these things that were

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.040 
arose out of all these things that were
going<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.460> London<00:01:50.880> during<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.630> time<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.840> my

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
going on in London during the time of my

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.250 
going on in London during the time of my
residence<00:01:52.530> season<00:01:53.450> one<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.480> the<00:01:54.690> cases

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
residence season one of the cases

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.010 
residence season one of the cases
evolved<00:01:56.040> with<00:01:56.580> my<00:01:56.940> interest<00:01:57.330> in<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:57.840> use<00:01:57.990> of

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
evolved with my interest in the use of

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.320 
evolved with my interest in the use of
pattern<00:01:58.620> on<00:01:58.770> 18th<00:01:59.160> century<00:01:59.490> Staffordshire<00:02:00.090> so

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
pattern on 18th century Staffordshire so

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.290 
pattern on 18th century Staffordshire so
plays<00:02:00.690> I<00:02:01.110> was<00:02:01.860> trying<00:02:02.160> to<00:02:02.250> think<00:02:02.580> of<00:02:02.790> something

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
plays I was trying to think of something

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.530 
plays I was trying to think of something
that<00:02:03.660> most<00:02:04.050> people<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:06.180> could<00:02:06.330> see

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
that most people have that you could see

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.020 
that most people have that you could see
this<00:02:06.660> proliferation<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.800> pattern<00:02:08.729> put

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
this proliferation of pattern put

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.170 
this proliferation of pattern put
together<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.540> different<00:02:09.660> ways<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:11.180> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
together in different ways and the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.510 
together in different ways and the
Olympics<00:02:12.630> being<00:02:12.930> here<00:02:13.320> allowed<00:02:14.130> for<00:02:14.340> me<00:02:14.400> to

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
Olympics being here allowed for me to

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.310 
Olympics being here allowed for me to
reach<00:02:14.850> out<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.180> see<00:02:15.300> if<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.510> could<00:02:15.570> get<00:02:15.959> some

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
reach out to see if I could get some

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.560 
reach out to see if I could get some
Olympic<00:02:16.800> trainers<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.490> sort<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.180> take<00:02:18.360> that

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
Olympic trainers to sort of take that

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.180 
Olympic trainers to sort of take that
idea<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.620> few<00:02:20.190> steps<00:02:20.430> further<00:02:21.680> Nike<00:02:22.680> was<00:02:22.800> really

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190

trainers here those kinds of objects to
me<00:02:28.620> transcend<00:02:29.280> time<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:29.970> really<00:02:30.540> am<00:02:30.959> very

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.920 
me transcend time and I really am very
very<00:02:31.500> interested<00:02:31.770> in<00:02:32.550> things<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.720> can

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
very interested in things that I can

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.620 
very interested in things that I can
feel<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.860> eliminate<00:02:35.610> all<00:02:35.910> those<00:02:36.180> barriers

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
feel that eliminate all those barriers

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.340 
feel that eliminate all those barriers
of<00:02:36.900> time<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.680> ideas<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.750> past<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.110> present

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
of time and ideas and past and present

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.850 
of time and ideas and past and present
and<00:02:41.070> are<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.400> right<00:02:42.090> here<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.810> moment<00:02:43.020> my

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
and are just right here in the moment my

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.330 
and are just right here in the moment my
work<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.250> very<00:02:45.150> much<00:02:45.390> about<00:02:45.570> even<00:02:46.050> though<00:02:46.140> it

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
work is very much about even though it

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.580 
work is very much about even though it
references<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> lot<00:02:47.519> of<00:02:48.170> historical<00:02:49.170> things

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
references a lot of historical things

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.740 
references a lot of historical things
that<00:02:49.769> it<00:02:50.100> connects<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.880> them<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.269> present

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
that it connects to them in the present

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.270 
that it connects to them in the present
so<00:02:51.870> they're<00:02:52.019> very<00:02:52.170> much<00:02:52.260> about<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.830> present

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
so they're very much about the present

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.009 
so they're very much about the present
and<00:02:53.430> looking<00:02:53.790> at<00:02:53.940> those<00:02:54.150> things<00:02:54.510> because<00:02:54.930> we

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
and looking at those things because we

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.690 
and looking at those things because we
only<00:02:55.200> look<00:02:55.560> at<00:02:55.709> things<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.130> our<00:02:56.250> present

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
only look at things in our present

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.900 
only look at things in our present
moment<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:57.570> there<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:57.930> no<00:02:58.140> experience<00:02:58.799> of<00:02:59.130> the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
moment so there is no experience of the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.620 
moment so there is no experience of the
past<00:03:00.239> other<00:03:00.720> than<00:03:01.110> our<00:03:02.000> present<00:03:03.000> experience

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
past other than our present experience

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.830 
past other than our present experience
of<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.019> I<00:03:04.580> think<00:03:05.580> of<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.730> company<00:03:06.360> like<00:03:06.510> Nike

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
of it I think of a company like Nike

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.960 
of it I think of a company like Nike
being<00:03:07.380> probably<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.830> biggest<00:03:08.040> companies<00:03:08.940> in

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
being probably the biggest companies in

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.840 
being probably the biggest companies in
the<00:03:09.150> world<00:03:09.239> in<00:03:09.870> terms<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.350> what<00:03:11.250> everyone

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
the world in terms of what everyone

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.530 
the world in terms of what everyone
consumes<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:13.430> dragons<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.610> me<00:03:14.790> also<00:03:15.060> have

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
consumes and dragons to me also have

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.020 
consumes and dragons to me also have
that<00:03:15.840> connection<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.950> I've<00:03:17.190> used<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.640> some

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
that connection and I've used that some

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.070 
that connection and I've used that some
of<00:03:18.150> my<00:03:18.269> other<00:03:18.480> work

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
of my other work

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.500 
of my other work
a<00:03:19.110> dragon<00:03:19.709> sort<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:19.950> sweeping<00:03:20.910> up<00:03:21.030> everything

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
a dragon sort of sweeping up everything

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.449 
a dragon sort of sweeping up everything
in<00:03:21.630> its<00:03:21.750> path<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:22.500> becomes<00:03:22.830> part<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.310> its

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
in its path and it becomes part of its

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.880 
in its path and it becomes part of its
sort<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.209> being<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.049> this<00:03:25.260> piece<00:03:25.560> is

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
sort of being and so this piece is

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.580 
sort of being and so this piece is
really<00:03:26.549> about<00:03:27.180> exploring<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:28.080> idea<00:03:29.480> so<00:03:30.480> I

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
really about exploring that idea so I

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.170 
really about exploring that idea so I
decided<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.709> start<00:03:32.040> experimenting<00:03:32.640> with<00:03:32.820> all

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
decided to start experimenting with all

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.350 
decided to start experimenting with all
these<00:03:33.360> different<00:03:33.930> London<00:03:34.380> clay<00:03:35.090> by<00:03:36.090> using

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
these different London clay by using

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.970 
these different London clay by using
this<00:03:36.600> silicon<00:03:37.380> rubber<00:03:37.709> compound

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
this silicon rubber compound

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.740 
this silicon rubber compound
the<00:03:39.610> clay<00:03:39.849> that<00:03:40.060> just<00:03:40.239> came<00:03:40.420> out<00:03:40.569> of<00:03:40.599> the

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
the clay that just came out of the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.110 
the clay that just came out of the
ground<00:03:40.959> took<00:03:41.379> right<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.830> it<00:03:42.129> and<00:03:42.400> just<00:03:42.730> seemed

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
ground took right to it and just seemed

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.100 
ground took right to it and just seemed
to<00:03:43.209> have<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:43.690> specific<00:03:44.530> connection<00:03:46.110> almost

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
to have a specific connection almost

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.720 
to have a specific connection almost
like<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.349> was<00:03:47.470> made<00:03:47.709> for<00:03:47.950> that<00:03:48.010> purpose<00:03:48.370> that

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
like it was made for that purpose that

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.250 
like it was made for that purpose that
which<00:03:48.849> is<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.510> know<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:49.750> extraordinary

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
which is you know the extraordinary

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.360 
which is you know the extraordinary
thing<00:03:50.440> about<00:03:50.470> clay<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.610> has<00:03:51.879> this<00:03:52.860> ability<00:03:53.860> to

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
thing about clay it has this ability to

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.580 
thing about clay it has this ability to
be<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.120> perfect<00:03:55.360> thing<00:03:55.780> for<00:03:55.810> things<00:03:56.349> that<00:03:56.500> we

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
be the perfect thing for things that we

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.150 
be the perfect thing for things that we
haven't<00:03:56.800> conceived<00:03:57.340> of<00:03:57.580> yet<00:03:57.849> and<00:03:58.769> it's<00:03:59.769> like<00:04:00.130> a
