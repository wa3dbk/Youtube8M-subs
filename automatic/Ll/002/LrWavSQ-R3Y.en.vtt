the thing that you realized that was the
easy<00:02:28.980> way<00:02:29.310> out<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.610> then<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.090> tried<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.360> make

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
easy way out and then you tried to make

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.280 
easy way out and then you tried to make
it<00:02:30.780> more<00:02:30.990> than<00:02:31.140> more<00:02:31.980> than<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.220> meal<00:02:32.550> as<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.930> get

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
it more than more than a meal as you get

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.610 
it more than more than a meal as you get
older<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.980> sandwiches<00:02:35.430> became<00:02:35.850> more

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
elaborate and more intense and then they

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.460 
elaborate and more intense and then they
actually<00:02:39.390> became<00:02:39.630> better<00:02:39.840> than<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.230> actual

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470
