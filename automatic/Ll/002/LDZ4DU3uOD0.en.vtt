00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.850
 to protect the feet from bumps or from 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.690
 strange substances there are shoes 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:15.140
 special protection because if there was 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.300
 heard something about it but 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.570
 It's a very good invention, because 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.770
 always give each person a blow in 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.660
 the little finger said no good 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.560
 well you can stop this kind of 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.300
 situations 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.080
 and investigate how is it being 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.480
 applying 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.810
 super good because we'll see what's what 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.910
 that they discovered in the next 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:42.590
 no wind 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.590
 one of those shoes because I 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.280
 my mind stepped redoubled 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.770
 myself 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.230
 it's not that you're yourself 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.850
 sure we have to get 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.100
 before starting to manufacture the shoes 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.650
 of protection in the tanneries 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.150
 prepare the skin that is going to be used in 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.640
 this place that receives 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.520
 welcome from the min 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.940
 the hair and the flesh and so you get flower 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.369
 whole or the highest quality on the skin 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.530
 immediately the skin is given a 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.229
 special treatment called tanning 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.710
 so that it is resistant and not perishable 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.040
 that is, it will last forever and it will be 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.660
 puts color and gives the final finish 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.619
 When the skin is ready it sends the 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.619
 Shoes factory 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.030
 from pixar 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.850
 we have the skin now what do you think if 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.210
 we see how shoes are made in 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.210
 March 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.860
 a protective shoe first it 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.100
 draw each one 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.380
 and check these drawings are digitized and 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.270
 they are sent to a special printer who in 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.640
 place to print on paper goes 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.180
 cutting the pieces on skin cloth 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.810
 Sponge or any material that goes 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.810
 to use 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.760
 manufacturing process starts cutting 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.739
 the pieces of shoes after the 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.890
 pieces are used as molds 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.810
 of cookies called swag to cut the 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.050
 skin with the help of the pressure of a 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.940
 griddle 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.370
 since you have all the pieces you 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.280
 unite with seams and the seams are 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.230
 glue the shoe and the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.930
 floor are placed on a base with the 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.150
 foot shape and at the tip is added 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.200
 the steel castle in addition to others 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.190
 accessories 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.450
 because these castles 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.450
 on the impact of one 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.290
 immediately the shoe sole is put on 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.750
 and he gets into a press that is like a 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.180
 water flare where by heat 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.520
 merges to join the rest of the shoe 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.190
 this process is called vulcanized 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.910
 in this factory there is another way of joining 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.180
 the sole the shoe 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.150
 of the latest technology and of German origin 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.190
 father not father and be surprised because 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.560
 all the soles that are produced in this 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.780
 factory are anti-skid and 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.730
 Wear resistant and agents 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.730
 contaminants like acids 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.160
 the shoe is complete, the 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.650
 burrs of the sole 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.180
 he puts the template and the shoelaces and 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.910
 gives them a final finish 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.370
 finally the shoes get into their 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.010
 boxes and they are taken to the product warehouse 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.610
 finished or to the boarding area 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.490
 to send them direct to the customer and 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:56.080
 fall in this factory in a month it 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.080
 produce to service 30 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.090
 The quality of the shoes is very 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.040
 important that's why they apply 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.069
 laboratory tests to guarantee 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.040
 the protection of whoever uses them 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.019
 the most important test is impact 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.430
 and that a mass is dropped on the 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.769
 cap to measure your record 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.500
 The resistance of the 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.080
 shoes to electric shocks and 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.260
 for that they are introduced some balines 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.450
 of copper and electricity is applied 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.580
 in this incredible data the shoes of 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:37.500
 Protection supports electric shocks 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.500
 of more than 14 thousand volts 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:47.740
 Finally, they have other tests 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.740
 to know if the skin has resistance 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.540
 all the 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.319
 then those are for you 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.169
 safe and comfortable 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.849
 we are realistic and right-handed 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.009
 from the footwear factory of 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.819
 protection also entered something that has 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.819
 Mexico state 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.119
 then we put more 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.020
 it's so awesome is those shoes 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:25.780
 greater protection is incredible that 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.780
 support up electric shocks no 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.390
 I do not know exactly glasses
