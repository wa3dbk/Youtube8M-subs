 naples very dangerous with the incursion 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.960
 the central passage 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.240
 the goalkeeper save from 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.990
 it costs if I'm not mistaken it has been to cai and not 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.119
 to conclude not too convinced the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.160
 conclusion of the number 7 of Naples with 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.470
 the Naples that steals the ball and I try now 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.329
 to accelerate very large launches a 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.160
 left for the sign that enters the area 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.199
 of rigor indeed and mertens stops 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.249
 ball on the right parried to the ground by da 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.800
 costa goes to deploy the attack of 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.759
 Naples best jumpers also arrive 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.350
 the defenders 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.149
 the two plants that entered the area of 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.670
 penalty together with trouble leaves the corner 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.780
 there is a first door detours aside 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.160
 the ball player from Naples who 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.610
 however, the sampdoria is then removed 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.780
 inside the miracle of da costa that 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.030
 we must say he was also lucky 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.360
 because the wayne's shot was strong and 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.310
 central and what he found himself there with 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.110
 the ball on the body and managed to 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.820
 divert it and in the corner you do 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.700
 However, the tabby steal the ball part 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.070
 still naples with tyrone balloon on 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.750
 Right Thyon prefers to do everything from 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.369
 only great play and ball that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.920
 ends up very little 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.840
 all this at the twenty -first of the first 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.540
 great time really played by

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.250

 download on de silvestri cross inside 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.360
 very low-flying conclusion 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.120
 over the crossbar and sampdoria 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.970
 very close to the goal of the advantage I think 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.870
 has been eder insists naples with cajon 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.700

 even naples takes the lead 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.430
 with disputes over the assists of higuain 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.500

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.560
 he was attacking more at this start 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.170
 shooting at the eighth minute therefore 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.120
 mertens unlocks score 10 for i

 of the sampdoria with the left

 murderous of gabbiadini who went to 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.940
 hit the ball right into the crossbar 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.950
 which bounced almost on the line a

 you disputes this time from the coast 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.520
 wrong because the shot was not 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.130
 irresistible but failed to 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.440
 divert the ball and the Naples mortgage 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.000
 the victory because in the seventeenth

 Raffaele's arms I must say that the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.280
 history 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.830
 but today it was really unfortunate it was 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.370
 player wells indeed to conclude in 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.370
 this way
