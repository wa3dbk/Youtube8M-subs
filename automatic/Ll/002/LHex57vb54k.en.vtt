00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:15.650
 As a basic mechanic here, of course, it's a matter of scale 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:17.460
 There is also a plus, or even humanity and sociality 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.570
 Trained a 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.000
 I think that can work energetically to take the front line to the time of ultimate 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.690
 Easy-to-understand 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.539
 I am thinking of a business pot that will remain in my memory 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:33.020
 More than easy to remember 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.080
 If you give an answer at first 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:42.070
 The student is going to understand on the spot 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:43.730
 It's quite common that when you look back on it later it is missing 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.340
 Because 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:52.540
 Instead of giving an answer at first 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:57.070
 Think about the students as much as possible and try to answer them last 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:02.090
 It is a file I am conscious of such things 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:05.510
 I Why Tteyuu only thinking Pape Le possible to say whether this is so you can Well 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.320
 I think it is part of the movement that is hard to understand in the textbook 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:16.420
 Teru was also first idea Tteyuu what happens in this kind of movement When you have 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.420
 You have taken the form of it from going to show'll come using, for example, power point 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:30.020
 Various anxiety 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:34.040
 I think that there are a lot of movies, but actually I'm from this post and actually wear it while wearing 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.090
 Snugly in the direction it took a primary mechanic 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.780
 8 Curicular Orika 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:45.840
 Since it has been incorporated to love Dongshih 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.890
 I feel that I will finish to the level that passes the first grade naturally if you can wear elbows and classes 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.470
 is 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:55.900
 Toka is a concern against the Well First person 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:02:00.659
 We teach things like compassion the other plate-breaking 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:06.420
 Deep compassion 20% is because 1 in this body part 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:11.670
 Of course, for classes, first-class people are of course practical skills as a mother though 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.490
 More advanced knowledge-Acne to be able to acquire these things 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:20.320
 We guidance 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:20.320
 Thank you please in the school with the expectation to the word that it is anxiety
