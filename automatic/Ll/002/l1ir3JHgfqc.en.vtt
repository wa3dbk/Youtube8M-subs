00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 a space what the world wka must that 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.389
 I sleep more the night months it starts to 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:19.890
 marry sorting weird kind of 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:21.630
 hallucinations and so hello to all 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.369
 and to all and 2.95 and we find ourselves for 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.890
 a brand new video viella video 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.230
 goblin challenge launched by airways 03 which 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.260
 spreads in twin job youtuber 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.870
 i was disappointed by mr killer so who 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.320
 team that was challenged by ko 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.210
 boeing to whom he was left by ruiz 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.550
 I think that's it but it must be 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.200
 that's very often that's the purpose of the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.670
 challenge if you do not know but I 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.739
 think all the stop attacking the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.539
 last turn the last level goblins 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.489
 so too many acids with the make up 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.070
 next so here are five goals and may 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.989
 15 wizard so this is a suitable compo 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.090
 not for a new vest because in the water it 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.039
 are there people who eat vnf so we 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.329
 welcomes four kinds that are two 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.780
 sisters of rage one night two jumps a 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.150
 care spell for lousy troops 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.590
 rather well I'm all match but 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.240
 on the other hand for spells I have not everything 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.770
 max we do not have the right to the castle 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.860
 toulon and we do not have the right to heroes 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.360
 so I would not use them and on 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.400
 those in insurance and so we will do 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.890
 everything remains so the goal is not to 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.689
 to make a child the goal is obviously to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.220
 to do 100% because it turns there successful 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.720
 to do it even airways the first time 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.060
 but the goal is to do the best 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.770
 possible time so we go right away 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.490
 I do not know if he took me out 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.490
 there if it goes 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.910
 so obviously it starts from the 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.200
 when I throw a thing is there 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:49.010
 for now I have nothing launched so that 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:55.010
 do not count 1 2 3 howie went that 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:58.040
 was rather nickel here ok so here I 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.540
 think a little stressed here we have not 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.060
 all wizards but is beginning to me 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.710
 thunder storm a dish ok so soon to my 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.070
 fate of soa if we believe he still 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.510
 okay so what annoys me is that the 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.200
 Wizards they will own their 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.630
 side it's not very cool we'll put 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.890
 in rage here 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:26.840
 ok ok ok it's going pretty well i'm yes 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.770
 yes it's going pretty well friends on 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.320
 is already at forty-four percent 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.530
 forty-six frankly frankly yes 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.970
 there is way to a care spell here yes 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.780
 yes yes where 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.890
 we had hot we were very very hot 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.060
 frankly it's really great 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.200
 well here I am I am satisfied but 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.420
 I do not know if I beat the record of 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.580
 airways because he announced a minute 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.130
 5 I think but hey we'll see 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.690
 so I already have 80% it's really 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.890
 awesome and it's fate that's where they got 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.310
 almost more binder but a lot of 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.690
 luck aca noah's upholsterer really 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.519
 a lot of troops and big golem 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.049
 so it's cool 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.850
 ok ok go go we dispatch thing 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.650
