00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330 

all<00:00:00.179> right<00:00:00.359> this<00:00:00.840> one<00:00:01.079> is<00:00:01.230> called<00:00:01.439> cross<00:00:01.860> bench

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
all right this one is called cross bench

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.309 
all right this one is called cross bench
pullovers<00:00:02.970> and<00:00:03.210> I<00:00:03.449> like<00:00:03.780> it<00:00:03.929> quite<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.140> bit

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
pullovers and I like it quite a bit

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.639 
pullovers and I like it quite a bit
because<00:00:04.440> it<00:00:04.920> works<00:00:05.160> your<00:00:05.940> if<00:00:06.569> there<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.470> think

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
because it works your if there I think

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.490 
because it works your if there I think
if<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:07.950> is<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.069> chest<00:00:08.580> opener<00:00:08.820> or<00:00:09.240> as<00:00:09.690> stretching

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
if it is a chest opener or as stretching

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.470 
if it is a chest opener or as stretching
of<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> chest<00:00:11.070> really<00:00:11.550> helps<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.150> not

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
of the chest really helps you have not

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.480 
of the chest really helps you have not
be<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:12.870> much<00:00:13.049> like<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.469> but<00:00:13.740> more<00:00:13.950> open<00:00:14.309> like

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
be so much like this but more open like

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.029 
be so much like this but more open like
this<00:00:14.639> more<00:00:15.059> naturally<00:00:15.690> like<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.470> but<00:00:16.949> it

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
this more naturally like that but it

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.800 
this more naturally like that but it
also<00:00:17.190> strengthens<00:00:17.550> your<00:00:18.029> upper<00:00:18.359> back<00:00:18.539> muscles

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
also strengthens your upper back muscles

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.900 
also strengthens your upper back muscles
and<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.710> adds<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.189> little<00:00:20.430> bit<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.609> balance

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
and it adds in a little bit of balance

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.660 
and it adds in a little bit of balance
as<00:00:21.029> well<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.510> cross<00:00:22.199> bench<00:00:22.680> pullovers<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
as well so cross bench pullovers it is a

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.820 
as well so cross bench pullovers it is a
little<00:00:23.970> bit<00:00:24.060> more<00:00:24.240> intermediate<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.439> I

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
little bit more intermediate and I

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.830 
little bit more intermediate and I
wouldn't<00:00:26.130> advise<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.760> beginners<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.720> but

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
wouldn't advise a beginners to do it but

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.029 
wouldn't advise a beginners to do it but
it's<00:00:27.960> definitely<00:00:28.349> something<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:28.800> work

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
it's definitely something you can work

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.450 
it's definitely something you can work

up towards so how you get into the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.639 
up towards so how you get into the
position<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.300> exercise<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.440> need<00:00:34.590> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
position of the exercise you need to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.900 
position of the exercise you need to
make<00:00:34.890> sure<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> dumbbell

positioned on the bench so I am relaxed

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.410 
positioned on the bench so I am relaxed
on<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.140> bench<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.620> my<00:01:01.859> head<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.489> balanced<00:01:03.329> on

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
on the bench here my head is balanced on

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.640 
on the bench here my head is balanced on
the<00:01:03.480> bench<00:01:03.719> my<00:01:03.960> upper<00:01:04.229> back<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.530> my<00:01:04.619> shoulders

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the bench my upper back and my shoulders

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.380 
the bench my upper back and my shoulders
are<00:01:05.129> balanced<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.610> bench<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.270> I'm

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
are balanced on the bench and I'm

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.200 
are balanced on the bench and I'm
creating<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:07.320> bridge<00:01:08.070> position<00:01:08.820> with<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> rest

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
creating a bridge position with the rest

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.880 
creating a bridge position with the rest
of<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:09.450> body<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.470> balance

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
of my body so this is for the balance

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.670 
of my body so this is for the balance
stability<00:01:11.460> comes<00:01:11.700> into<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.560> don't

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
stability comes into it so you don't

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.469 
stability comes into it so you don't
want<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.340> far<00:01:14.640> back<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> best<00:01:15.270> that

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
want to be so far back on the best that

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.300 
want to be so far back on the best that
your<00:01:15.600> head<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.810> hanging<00:01:16.200> off<00:01:16.290> which<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.650> have

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
your head is hanging off which I have

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.679 
your head is hanging off which I have
seen<00:01:17.580> some<00:01:17.820> people<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:18.630> I've

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
that this area here is balanced and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.840 
that this area here is balanced and
