00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.560
 traditional transportation systems 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.360
 do not adapt efficiently to the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.730
 mobility needs of large 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.970
 century transit infrastructures 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.650
 twenty-one 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.030
 at heathrow airport it has been 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.150
 implemented the innovative 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.640
 ultra global infrastructure prt for 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.590
 address this challenge 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.509
 this is the first implantation of a 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.180
 system of these characteristics in a 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.059
 airport around the world 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.250
 brt systems are composed of a network 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.129
 of self-guided electric vehicles 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.260
 For Passenger 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.330
 monitored by smart sensors 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.210
 the system allows a precise execution 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.339
 of intervals and routes resulting in a 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.100
 high - capacity infrastructure 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.710
 passenger service the system allows 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.050
 complex networks adapting to the flow of 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.400
 buildings and transporting the passenger of 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.250
 door to door 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.050
 there is no waiting time for the vehicle and 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.050
 route develops without congestion 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.710
 in heathrow these advantages allow the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.930
 system to adapt perfectly to 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.870
 strict travel patterns imposed 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.570
 for an airport infrastructure in 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.630
 london 21 vehicles move by 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.340
 a route of almost 4 kilometers 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.590
 transporting a total of 1500 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.540
 passengers a day representing a 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.020
 substantial improvement of the conditions of the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.909
 traffic on the perimeter of the airport 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.079
 with an assessment by the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.869
 users up to 47 out of 5 ultra 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.149
 global prt offers a solution 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.310
 completely innovative transport 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.130
 public that will provide a fast service 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.679
 and effective to passengers and contribute to 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.170
 remarkable environmental advantages with 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:55.110
 a total reduction of emissions and a 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.189
 70% saving of the energy used 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.189
 in conventional systems
