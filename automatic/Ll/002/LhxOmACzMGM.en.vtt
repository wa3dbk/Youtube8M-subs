00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
about what's happened during the week I

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.110 
about what's happened during the week I
enjoyed<00:01:43.520> particularly<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:46.030> celebration<00:01:47.030> of

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
enjoyed particularly the celebration of

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
enjoyed particularly the celebration of
cetology<00:01:47.570> say<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:49.070> street<00:01:50.000> party<00:01:50.810> we<00:01:50.960> had

cetology say and the street party we had
in<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.470> cinema<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:53.170> think<00:01:54.170> that<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.620> residents

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
in the cinema I think that the residents

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.300 
in the cinema I think that the residents
benefit<00:01:55.790> massively<00:01:56.330> from<00:01:56.630> having

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
benefit massively from having

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.550 
benefit massively from having
