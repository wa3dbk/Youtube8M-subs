arrow<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.509> very<00:01:42.750> good<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.939> but<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.090> think<00:01:45.240> we

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
arrow is very good and but we I think we

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.590 
arrow is very good and but we I think we
can<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.979> about<00:01:47.790> playoffs<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.450> very

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
can do it and about playoffs it's very

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.270 
can do it and about playoffs it's very
hard<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.869> say<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.380> best-of-five<00:01:49.799> it's

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
hard to say like best-of-five it's

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.760 
hard to say like best-of-five it's
completely<00:01:50.700> different<00:01:51.110> we'll<00:01:52.110> prepare<00:01:52.350> and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
completely different we'll prepare and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.550 
completely different we'll prepare and
we'll<00:01:52.950> do<00:01:53.159> our<00:01:53.430> best<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:55.079> hard<00:01:55.290> for<00:01:55.439> me

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
we'll do our best but it's hard for me

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.590

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
different tone that we hear from the

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.980 
different tone that we hear from the
rocket<00:02:12.270> members<00:02:12.660> of

rocket members of
in<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.230> springs<00:02:13.500> but<00:02:13.650> there<00:02:13.800> was<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:13.980> lot<00:02:14.100> of

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
in the springs but there was a lot of

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.920 
in the springs but there was a lot of
course<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.880> well<00:02:15.270> we're<00:02:15.450> going<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.630> get<00:02:15.720> top

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
course of well we're going to get top

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.300 
course of well we're going to get top
two<00:02:16.110> we're<00:02:16.290> going<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.500> make<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.770> might<00:02:17.010> even<00:02:17.190> be

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
two we're going to make it might even be

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.190 
two we're going to make it might even be
become<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.940> champions<00:02:18.330> now<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.630> has<00:02:18.780> all<00:02:18.930> kind

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
become the champions now it has all kind

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.140 
become the champions now it has all kind
of<00:02:19.260> its<00:02:19.620> more<00:02:19.830> subdued<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.520> think<00:02:20.940> it's<00:02:21.030> good

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
of its more subdued I think it's good

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.430 
of its more subdued I think it's good
for<00:02:21.360> them<00:02:21.480> going<00:02:21.630> into<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.960> playoffs<00:02:22.050> that

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
for them going into the playoffs that

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.230 
for them going into the playoffs that
way<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.770> certainly<00:02:23.550> think<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.180> see

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
way I certainly think it is you can see

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.270 
way I certainly think it is you can see
that<00:02:24.360> they<00:02:24.660> looked<00:02:24.900> at<00:02:25.110> what<00:02:25.320> they<00:02:25.470> did

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
that they looked at what they did

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.460 
that they looked at what they did
yesterday<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.970> fix<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.720> lot<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.870> their<00:02:28.080> issues

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470

their preparation paid off what was the

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450

of<00:04:39.510> five<00:04:39.750> of<00:04:39.810> that<00:04:40.140> of<00:04:40.320> us<00:04:40.500> if<00:04:40.650> I<00:04:40.770> guess<00:04:41.160> that

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
of five of that of us if I guess that

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.400 
of five of that of us if I guess that

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410

that match of s case Freddie wants you

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.370 
that match of s case Freddie wants you
to<00:04:47.250> tells<00:04:47.580> us<00:04:47.820> it's<00:04:48.030> not<00:04:48.360> getting<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.200> top

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
to tells us it's not getting to the top

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.760 
to tells us it's not getting to the top
that's<00:04:49.680> hard<00:04:49.980> it's<00:04:50.280> staying<00:04:50.790> there

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.619 

it's<00:04:55.370> really<00:04:55.490> difficult<00:04:55.759> to<00:04:56.120> go<00:04:56.300> an<00:04:56.389> entire

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:56.629 
it's really difficult to go an entire

it's really difficult to go an entire

spit on being in life there's a lot of

spit on being in life there's a lot of
work<00:04:58.610> behind<00:04:58.759> the<00:04:58.970> scenes<00:04:59.030> and<00:04:59.539> you<00:04:59.720> have<00:04:59.840> to

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
work behind the scenes and you have to

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.830 
work behind the scenes and you have to
keep<00:05:00.470> updated<00:05:01.340> with<00:05:01.370> every<00:05:01.759> patch<00:05:01.970> you<00:05:02.720> have

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
keep updated with every patch you have

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.629

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
to be aware of the matter you have to

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.879 
to be aware of the matter you have to
adapt<00:05:05.030> and<00:05:05.659> that's<00:05:05.960> like<00:05:06.139> five<00:05:06.470> or<00:05:06.650> six<00:05:06.770> times

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
adapt and that's like five or six times

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.490 
adapt and that's like five or six times
a<00:05:07.190> split<00:05:07.430> so<00:05:07.669> it's<00:05:08.030> it's<00:05:08.900> not<00:05:09.020> like<00:05:09.199> you<00:05:09.349> just

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
a split so it's it's not like you just

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.140 
a split so it's it's not like you just
master<00:05:09.919> something<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:10.370> keep<00:05:10.490> playing<00:05:10.819> it<00:05:11.030> and

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
master something and keep playing it and

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.760 
master something and keep playing it and
keep<00:05:11.300> playing<00:05:11.449> it<00:05:11.750> and<00:05:11.840> tell<00:05:12.020> you<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.199> best<00:05:12.409> if

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
keep playing it and tell you the best if

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.070 
keep playing it and tell you the best if
they<00:05:12.979> manage<00:05:13.340> to<00:05:13.370> do<00:05:13.580> with<00:05:13.699> them<00:05:13.909> I<00:05:14.120> don't<00:05:14.990> know

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
they manage to do with them I don't know

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.300 
they manage to do with them I don't know
if<00:05:15.199> any<00:05:15.319> other<00:05:15.500> team<00:05:15.710> will<00:05:15.860> have<00:05:15.949> a<00:05:15.979> match<00:05:16.159> it

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310
