00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.430
 But helena 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.010
 the photograph actually runs the time 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.010
 with that Japanese origin 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.420
 My father had a camera and he always 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.450
 I liked taking a picture and since I was little. 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.160
 take camera and photograph people 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.970
 who knew me very much 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.970
 who had looked 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.670
 use the camera canon and western 5 and it is 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.830
 very easy because to turn on the camera 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.710
 only you put in or what you get out of there 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.290
 you put it in automatic mode when 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.030
 You put the camera there. 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.160
 fit for you in the best way 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.230
 possible that the camera think is better 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.790
 that it is much faster at the time of 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.790
 you click and take photos 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.170
 take photos in a more discreet way 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.960
 with this camera is very easy when 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.430
 want to take a more stolen photo made 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.619
 Can you even lower it a little? 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.479
 most observed up to the best angle 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:24.090
 for you to take in this necessarily 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.090
 Do you show that you 're taking photos? 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.900
 it is also touch then with a simple 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.370
 touch you can focus the object on the 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.890
 clicking on it is automatically 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:39.410
 take focus will receive is possible 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.600
 view the photos you took is not 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.420
 just run your finger over the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.390
 screen and you can watch yourself in the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.240
 front or back of photo details one 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.910
 zoom or lower also had the advantage 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.460
 use a camera I only know you 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.420
 can quickly change the lens of the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.910
 camera 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.130
 so you can is with high definition 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.460
 in high quality take picture with these 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.460
 lenses 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.970
 when I see people like this one thing 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.930
 What do you think right now is trying to put 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.300
 photography 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.830
 A little of this feeling for me is 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.630
 fantastic son because really 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.630
 said that search through photography
