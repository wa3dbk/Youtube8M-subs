00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
 hello to all the pilots and welcome 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.500
 in the dangerous for a video that 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.270
 is called five minutes to find 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.620
 ships modules and weapons in 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.940
 the game so that's a question that 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.460
 very often comes back to the forums 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.320
 but who is actually been asked about 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.960
 the youtube channel 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.210
 so for the ships there is when 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.039
 even a simpler tool that are the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.510
 websites I made a very video 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.130
 recently that is on the chain 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.769
 youtube i would put you the url under the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.900
 video where you get back the station you 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.150
 are the ship you are looking for and that 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.320
 will give you a radius around you 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.739
 where you can find the ships 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.059
 searched for the second thing you 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.649
 can obviously do it's small to 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.629
 small with the experience note especially 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.450
 on net point terminals you have some 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.440
 newspapers and this is where I note to 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.629
 whenever I find something 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.000
 well I note in what system I 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.280
 am and what is there what is 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.079
 still quite practical 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.190
 after for modules and weapons 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.739
 obviously it's still a little bit 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.109
 complicated and the more you go up in 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.609
 class and in size plus it will 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.100
 hard to find but when 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.860
 even a somewhat magical formula that is 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.330
 simple enough to use or at least that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.460
 should allow you to start 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.490
 your searches you go in the map 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.840
 and instead of classifying by savings into 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.299
 putting all the savings you do not 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.430
 keep that said savings high 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.830
 technology actually it's they 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.850
 which are the most provided in terms of 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.650
 equipment weapons and modules and for 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.740
 further refine your search so 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.810
 to be even safer to have only 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.900
 the big technology and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.310
 well you will use the filter of 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.960
 population that you are going to ride a 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.740
 little bit their attention for a little 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.869
 little time for it to happen 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.229
 refresh but that's going to make 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.720
 disappear stations with a small 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.210
 population and here in this case 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 well we see that there is a system 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.040
 around me that corresponds to 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.450
 criteria which is ltt 15 198 where 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.509
 actually there are a lot of things 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.820
 so for the equipment of my clippers 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.549
 and from my ship personally I 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.290
 are going to be far hills that's here then 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.420
 the advantage of are far hills is that 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.030
 the resort is really just 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.300
 next to the star so it's still 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.950
 extremely fast and well I hope that 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.470
 this video will be useful 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.390
 do not forget high tech anymore 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.060
 population a little bit high and that 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.500
 should normally correspond to 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.950
 stations you should find what 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.690
 you look for 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.690
 I give you some that I have 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.280
 found it's a gift I have a big 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.709
 technological station with a lot of 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.660
 class 6 gear for those with 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.900
 cobra sales of imperial ascq 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:42.819
 vulture clippers it's at adidas 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.489
 stations in the system ltt 1873 we have 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.370
 also a station that is not bad 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:54.040
 that I use as well as they have lp 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.630
 900 8-11 who also has a lot of 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.819
 things and that is a federal station 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.330
 with aspects the federal dropship 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:04.150
 lorca the future and a lot of things brief 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.730
 Here you see that with already enough 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.560
 tips for finding stations at 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.030
 technologies and population and both 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.440
 stations that I gave you one in 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.239
 the empire the other in the federation 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.209
 it should already give you some leads 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.390
 on this I tell you good flight to all and to 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.390
 very soon
