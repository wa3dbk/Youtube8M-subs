hey<00:00:08.750> this<00:00:08.900> is<00:00:09.050> Martin

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.710 

how<00:00:12.010> to<00:00:12.070> use<00:00:12.310> surface<00:00:12.880> cages<00:00:13.330> for<00:00:13.510> stop-motion

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:13.720 
how to use surface cages for stop-motion

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.770 
how to use surface cages for stop-motion
and<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:15.490> have<00:00:15.610> here<00:00:15.790> at<00:00:15.910> surface<00:00:16.270> cage<00:00:16.480> which

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
and we have here at surface cage which

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.200 
and we have here at surface cage which
is<00:00:16.960> really<00:00:17.260> simple<00:00:17.740> all<00:00:17.920> of<00:00:18.610> this<00:00:18.700> is<00:00:18.880> a<00:00:18.910> dowel

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
is really simple all of this is a dowel

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.750 
is really simple all of this is a dowel
rod<00:00:19.480> made<00:00:19.720> from<00:00:19.900> wood<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:21.340> could<00:00:21.520> stick<00:00:21.730> a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
rod made from wood you could stick a

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.570 
rod made from wood you could stick a
pencil<00:00:22.060> also<00:00:22.420> in<00:00:22.779> a<00:00:22.840> piece<00:00:22.990> of<00:00:23.140> clay<00:00:23.320> and<00:00:23.619> take

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
pencil also in a piece of clay and take

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.170 
pencil also in a piece of clay and take
some<00:00:24.760> wire<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:26.230> is<00:00:26.640> 1/16<00:00:27.640> inch<00:00:27.880> gauge

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
some wire this is 1/16 inch gauge

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.920 
some wire this is 1/16 inch gauge
aluminum<00:00:28.570> wire<00:00:30.270> but<00:00:31.270> you<00:00:31.330> can<00:00:31.480> use<00:00:31.630> you<00:00:31.779> know

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
aluminum wire but you can use you know

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.960 
aluminum wire but you can use you know
any<00:00:32.230> kind<00:00:32.410> of<00:00:32.529> wire<00:00:32.680> you'd<00:00:32.890> like<00:00:33.040> but<00:00:33.280> aluminum

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
any kind of wire you'd like but aluminum

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.850 
any kind of wire you'd like but aluminum
works<00:00:34.360> really<00:00:34.540> well<00:00:34.840> because<00:00:35.080> it's<00:00:35.440> flexible

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
works really well because it's flexible

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.420 
works really well because it's flexible
and<00:00:36.520> doesn't<00:00:37.360> break<00:00:37.570> too<00:00:37.600> easily<00:00:38.160> if<00:00:39.160> you<00:00:39.220> use

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
and doesn't break too easily if you use

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.009 
and doesn't break too easily if you use
like<00:00:39.520> steel<00:00:39.820> wire<00:00:40.120> it<00:00:40.300> might<00:00:40.449> break<00:00:40.690> kind<00:00:40.870> of

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
like steel wire it might break kind of

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.639 
like steel wire it might break kind of
quick<00:00:41.199> so<00:00:41.760> aluminum<00:00:42.760> wire<00:00:42.940> is<00:00:43.090> great<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:44.440> have

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
quick so aluminum wire is great we have

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.340 
quick so aluminum wire is great we have
also<00:00:44.860> an<00:00:45.190> armature<00:00:45.550> ball<00:00:46.059> and<00:00:46.210> socket<00:00:46.600> made

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
also an armature ball and socket made

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.549 
also an armature ball and socket made
from<00:00:47.530> brass<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:49.570> also<00:00:49.719> have<00:00:50.020> a<00:00:50.050> pair<00:00:50.530> of

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
from brass we also have a pair of

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.979 
from brass we also have a pair of
calipers<00:00:50.829> which<00:00:51.640> I'll<00:00:51.880> explain<00:00:52.510> how<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.750> use

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
calipers which I'll explain how to use

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.660 
calipers which I'll explain how to use
later<00:00:53.800> on<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.690> pencil<00:00:56.140> and<00:00:56.860> just<00:00:57.219> a<00:00:57.340> plain

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
later on and the pencil and just a plain

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.880 
later on and the pencil and just a plain
wooden<00:00:57.910> dowel<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.510> this<00:00:59.170> is<00:00:59.320> gonna<00:00:59.440> be<00:00:59.590> used

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
wooden dowel and this is gonna be used

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.660 
wooden dowel and this is gonna be used
also<00:01:00.219> for<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:01.510> a<00:01:01.570> surface<00:01:01.960> gauge<00:01:05.460> alright<00:01:06.460> so

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
also for as a surface gauge alright so

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.340 
also for as a surface gauge alright so
for<00:01:06.820> this<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:07.509> first<00:01:07.539> thing<00:01:07.810> we<00:01:07.960> want<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.200> do

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
to figure out well if you're gonna

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.230 
to figure out well if you're gonna
animate<00:01:43.810> something<00:01:44.380> at<00:01:44.849> 24<00:01:45.849> frames<00:01:46.090> per

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
animate something at 24 frames per

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.559 
animate something at 24 frames per
second<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:47.679> want<00:01:48.220> to<00:01:48.280> determine<00:01:48.580> how<00:01:49.000> fast

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
second you want to determine how fast

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.870 
second you want to determine how fast
the<00:01:49.840> part<00:01:50.080> moves<00:01:50.289> and<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:51.369> want<00:01:51.550> to<00:01:51.610> do<00:01:51.729> that

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
the part moves and you want to do that

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.199 
the part moves and you want to do that
by<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.420> know<00:01:52.450> let's<00:01:52.720> say<00:01:53.489> you<00:01:54.489> want<00:01:54.670> this<00:01:54.849> arm

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
by you know let's say you want this arm

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.919 
by you know let's say you want this arm
to<00:01:55.300> move<00:01:55.599> down<00:01:55.840> within<00:01:56.849> you<00:01:57.849> know<00:01:57.940> half<00:01:58.810> a

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
to move down within you know half a

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.070 
to move down within you know half a
second<00:01:59.319> that<00:01:59.500> would<00:02:00.280> be<00:02:00.459> 12<00:02:00.729> moves<00:02:01.149> from<00:02:01.630> here

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
second that would be 12 moves from here

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.719 
second that would be 12 moves from here
to<00:02:02.759> here<00:02:04.289> you<00:02:05.289> can<00:02:05.470> use<00:02:05.619> your<00:02:05.739> calipers<00:02:06.310> I

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
to here you can use your calipers I

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.779 
to here you can use your calipers I
showed<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.479> before<00:02:07.599> and<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:09.280> can<00:02:09.459> figure<00:02:09.700> out

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
showed you before and you can figure out

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.860 
showed you before and you can figure out
the<00:02:10.060> distance<00:02:10.239> by<00:02:10.660> measuring<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:11.410> and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
the distance by measuring it and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.890 
the distance by measuring it and
literally<00:02:13.870> dividing<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.650> by<00:02:14.709> 12<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:16.480> if<00:02:16.720> we

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
literally dividing that by 12 so if we

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.580 
literally dividing that by 12 so if we
have<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.860> know

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
have you know

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.319 
have you know
twelve<00:02:20.590> sixteenths<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.370> an<00:02:21.489> inch<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:22.150> would

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
twelve sixteenths of an inch that would

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.589 
twelve sixteenths of an inch that would
be<00:02:22.510> six<00:02:23.439> eight<00:02:23.709> three<00:02:24.159> three<00:02:24.670> quarters<00:02:25.359> of<00:02:25.480> an

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
be six eight three three quarters of an

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.440 
be six eight three three quarters of an
inch<00:02:25.689> let's<00:02:25.989> say<00:02:26.969> you<00:02:27.969> know<00:02:28.090> you'd<00:02:28.239> have<00:02:28.269> to

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
inch let's say you know you'd have to

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.860 
inch let's say you know you'd have to
divide<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.780> up<00:02:29.019> into<00:02:30.000> 1/16<00:02:31.109> inch<00:02:32.109> increments

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
divide that up into 1/16 inch increments

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.170 
divide that up into 1/16 inch increments
for<00:02:34.870> your<00:02:35.049> your<00:02:35.500> move<00:02:35.730> now<00:02:36.730> there's<00:02:36.909> a<00:02:36.969> lot

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
for your your move now there's a lot

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.910 
for your your move now there's a lot
more<00:02:37.329> involved<00:02:37.719> in<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.530> first<00:02:38.709> thing<00:02:38.859> I

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
more involved in that the first thing I

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.940 
more involved in that the first thing I
want<00:02:39.099> to<00:02:39.159> discuss<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:40.230> once<00:02:41.230> your<00:02:41.379> boat<00:02:41.650> your

pose is set your first pose like this
you<00:02:45.280> would<00:02:45.400> first<00:02:45.639> you<00:02:46.150> wouldn't<00:02:46.389> have<00:02:46.480> your

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
you would first you wouldn't have your

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.030 
you would first you wouldn't have your
gauging<00:02:47.049> or<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.260> can<00:02:47.349> remove<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.799> and<00:02:47.859> you

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
gauging or you can remove it and you

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.770 
gauging or you can remove it and you
would<00:02:48.159> take<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.370> picture<00:02:48.609> so<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.450> would<00:02:49.659> be

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
would take a picture so that would be

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.830 
would take a picture so that would be
the<00:02:49.870> first<00:02:50.049> frame<00:02:50.409> of<00:02:50.620> film<00:02:50.859> and<00:02:51.220> then<00:02:52.209> you

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
the first frame of film and then you

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.030 
the first frame of film and then you
know<00:02:52.930> let's<00:02:53.079> say<00:02:53.200> you're<00:02:53.319> using<00:02:53.349> stop<00:02:54.010> motion

know let's say you're using stop motion

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.580 
know let's say you're using stop motion
Pro<00:02:54.579> or<00:02:54.819> some<00:02:55.030> other<00:02:55.180> software<00:02:55.629> and<00:02:56.349> you<00:02:56.439> would

so you click off your frame of film you
want<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.549> do<00:03:10.090> what<00:03:10.239> they<00:03:10.359> call<00:03:10.569> easing<00:03:11.019> in

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
want to do what they call easing in

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.699 
want to do what they call easing in
which<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.459> move<00:03:12.609> your<00:03:12.669> part<00:03:13.230> just<00:03:14.230> ever<00:03:14.409> so

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
which is to move your part just ever so

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.209 
which is to move your part just ever so
slightly<00:03:15.030> downward<00:03:16.030> from<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.260> tip<00:03:17.919> of<00:03:18.069> the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:18.219 
slightly downward from the tip of the

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:20.789 
slightly downward from the tip of the
gauge<00:03:19.169> and<00:03:20.169> you<00:03:20.230> want<00:03:20.349> to<00:03:20.409> do<00:03:20.469> that<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.709> the

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
gauge and you want to do that in the

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.699 
gauge and you want to do that in the
direction<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:22.049> your<00:03:23.049> arm<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.379> going<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.530> move

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
direction that your arm is going to move

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:24.839 
direction that your arm is going to move
in<00:03:23.859> so<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:24.129> just<00:03:24.250> want<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.400> move<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.609> down<00:03:24.639> just

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
in so you just want to move it down just

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.399 
in so you just want to move it down just
a<00:03:25.120> little<00:03:25.150> bit<00:03:28.199> all<00:03:29.199> right

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
a little bit all right

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.409 
a little bit all right
remove<00:03:29.919> the<00:03:30.040> gauge<00:03:30.220> that's<00:03:30.579> your<00:03:30.849> your<00:03:31.150> ease

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
remove the gauge that's your your ease

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:36.360 
remove the gauge that's your your ease
in<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:33.400> what<00:03:33.639> that<00:03:33.819> does<00:03:34.000> is<00:03:35.220> anything<00:03:36.220> that's

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
in and what that does is anything that's

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.920 
in and what that does is anything that's
you<00:03:36.790> know<00:03:36.879> starting<00:03:37.329> in<00:03:37.419> a<00:03:37.510> position<00:03:37.750> like

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
you know starting in a position like

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.869 
you know starting in a position like
this<00:03:38.109> that<00:03:38.470> you're<00:03:38.560> moving<00:03:38.859> down<00:03:39.040> it<00:03:39.639> takes

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
this that you're moving down it takes

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.210 
this that you're moving down it takes
time<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.209> speed<00:03:40.720> up<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.889> know<00:03:41.979> from<00:03:42.189> that

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
time to speed up you know from that

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.030 
time to speed up you know from that
position<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:44.019> get<00:03:44.169> to<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.349> next<00:03:44.620> position

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
position to get to the next position

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.339 
position to get to the next position
nothing<00:03:45.699> just<00:03:45.939> moves<00:03:46.389> instantly<00:03:46.989> it's<00:03:47.199> going

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
nothing just moves instantly it's going

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.879 
nothing just moves instantly it's going
to<00:03:47.409> be<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:47.739> know<00:03:47.769> gradual<00:03:48.629> and<00:03:49.629> so<00:03:50.109> the<00:03:50.709> middle

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
to be you know gradual and so the middle

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.740 
to be you know gradual and so the middle
part<00:03:51.159> of<00:03:51.189> your<00:03:51.280> arc<00:03:51.549> would<00:03:51.759> have<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.299> the

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
part of your arc would have the the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.280 
part of your arc would have the the
widest<00:03:53.379> gap<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:55.030> end<00:03:55.209> you<00:03:55.540> when<00:03:55.840> you<00:03:55.959> ease

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
widest gap and the end you when you ease

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.569 
widest gap and the end you when you ease
out<00:03:56.620> would<00:03:57.159> have<00:03:57.189> the<00:03:57.819> least<00:03:59.220> in<00:04:00.220> other<00:04:00.310> words

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
out would have the least in other words

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.460 
out would have the least in other words
when<00:04:01.569> we<00:04:01.720> put<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.650> gauge<00:04:02.829> here<00:04:03.099> like<00:04:03.280> this<00:04:03.579> and

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
when we put the gauge here like this and

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.699 
when we put the gauge here like this and
we<00:04:05.470> eased<00:04:05.739> in<00:04:06.009> just<00:04:06.549> a<00:04:06.669> slight<00:04:07.000> bit<00:04:07.319> the<00:04:08.319> final

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
we eased in just a slight bit the final

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.199 
we eased in just a slight bit the final
move<00:04:08.829> is<00:04:08.979> going<00:04:09.099> to<00:04:09.159> be<00:04:09.310> easing<00:04:09.639> out<00:04:09.759> which<00:04:10.060> is

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
move is going to be easing out which is

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.629 
move is going to be easing out which is
gonna<00:04:10.329> meet<00:04:10.569> a<00:04:10.599> slight<00:04:10.900> bit<00:04:11.049> also<00:04:11.229> so<00:04:12.099> that's

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
gonna meet a slight bit also so that's

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.539 
gonna meet a slight bit also so that's
the<00:04:12.790> general<00:04:12.909> idea

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
the general idea

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.430 
the general idea
but<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:15.669> gauge<00:04:15.879> is<00:04:16.209> used<00:04:16.479> in<00:04:16.780> space<00:04:17.109> so<00:04:17.380> you

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
but the gauge is used in space so you

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.349 
but the gauge is used in space so you
can<00:04:17.620> see<00:04:17.889> exactly<00:04:18.039> how<00:04:18.459> far<00:04:18.759> your<00:04:19.030> puppets

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
can see exactly how far your puppets

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.110 
can see exactly how far your puppets
moved<00:04:19.659> so<00:04:20.560> for<00:04:20.829> example<00:04:21.220> when<00:04:21.340> we<00:04:21.489> first<00:04:21.789> eased

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
moved so for example when we first eased

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.409 
moved so for example when we first eased
in<00:04:23.130> you<00:04:24.130> know<00:04:24.220> like<00:04:24.370> this<00:04:24.580> we're<00:04:25.150> gonna<00:04:25.270> move

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
in you know like this we're gonna move

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.350 
in you know like this we're gonna move
the<00:04:25.570> gauge<00:04:25.979> snap<00:04:26.979> frame<00:04:27.460> number<00:04:27.729> two<00:04:27.940> so<00:04:28.270> you

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
the gauge snap frame number two so you

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.670 
the gauge snap frame number two so you
took<00:04:28.510> one<00:04:28.719> moved<00:04:29.440> it<00:04:29.650> took<00:04:30.130> another<00:04:30.340> frame

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
took one moved it took another frame

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.939 
took one moved it took another frame
put<00:04:31.740> your<00:04:31.860> gage<00:04:32.070> back<00:04:32.340> in<00:04:32.550> like<00:04:32.759> this<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.949> you

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
put your gage back in like this and you

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.249 
put your gage back in like this and you
can<00:04:35.220> you<00:04:36.150> know<00:04:36.270> stick<00:04:36.479> your<00:04:36.630> gains<00:04:36.840> right<00:04:37.110> back

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
can you know stick your gains right back

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.290 
can you know stick your gains right back
there<00:04:37.470> on<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.710> tip<00:04:37.889> of<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.100> finger<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:39.180> you

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
there on the tip of the finger and you

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.990 
there on the tip of the finger and you
don't<00:04:39.449> want<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.780> move<00:04:40.289> to<00:04:40.470> be<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.860> slight<00:04:41.340> move

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
don't want the move to be a slight move

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.370 
don't want the move to be a slight move
you<00:04:42.180> wanted<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.479> be<00:04:42.600> a<00:04:42.630> little<00:04:42.690> bit<00:04:42.900> more<00:04:43.139> than

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
you wanted to be a little bit more than

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.700 
you wanted to be a little bit more than
before<00:04:43.740> because<00:04:44.639> you're<00:04:45.169> slowing<00:04:46.169> in<00:04:46.440> or

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
before because you're slowing in or

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.560 
before because you're slowing in or
easing<00:04:47.039> in<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.490> this<00:04:48.120> move<00:04:48.389> would<00:04:48.539> be

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
easing in and this move would be

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.129 
easing in and this move would be
slightly<00:04:49.050> more<00:04:50.389> so<00:04:51.389> you<00:04:51.479> move<00:04:51.660> it<00:04:51.750> maybe<00:04:51.960> like

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
slightly more so you move it maybe like

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.590 
slightly more so you move it maybe like
that<00:04:52.320> much<00:04:52.699> and<00:04:53.699> you<00:04:53.759> want<00:04:53.910> to<00:04:54.030> do<00:04:54.120> that<00:04:54.270> you

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
that much and you want to do that you

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.029 
that much and you want to do that you
know<00:04:54.690> you<00:04:54.930> want<00:04:55.139> to<00:04:55.169> divide<00:04:55.380> into<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.740> twelve

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
know you want to divide into the twelve

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.540 
know you want to divide into the twelve
frames<00:04:56.310> for<00:04:56.520> half<00:04:56.699> a<00:04:56.789> second<00:04:57.150> now<00:04:58.130> you<00:04:59.130> can<00:04:59.310> use

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
frames for half a second now you can use

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.490 
frames for half a second now you can use
a<00:04:59.580> gauge<00:05:00.060> like<00:05:00.449> this<00:05:00.750> or<00:05:01.620> calipers<00:05:02.130> and<00:05:03.380> if<00:05:04.380> you

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
a gauge like this or calipers and if you

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.820 
a gauge like this or calipers and if you
wanna<00:05:05.120> equally<00:05:06.120> spaced<00:05:06.449> on<00:05:06.690> them<00:05:06.930> if<00:05:07.620> you

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
wanna equally spaced on them if you

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.189 
wanna equally spaced on them if you
equally<00:05:08.250> spaced<00:05:08.550> something<00:05:09.000> across<00:05:09.419> a<00:05:10.789> line

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
equally spaced something across a line

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.279 
equally spaced something across a line
it<00:05:13.199> would<00:05:13.380> move<00:05:13.650> at<00:05:14.099> an<00:05:14.220> equal<00:05:14.699> rate<00:05:15.090> of<00:05:15.930> speed

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
it would move at an equal rate of speed

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.180 
it would move at an equal rate of speed
okay<00:05:16.770> so<00:05:17.759> it's<00:05:18.630> kind<00:05:18.840> of<00:05:18.870> like<00:05:19.050> this<00:05:19.259> it<00:05:20.099> would

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
okay so it's kind of like this it would

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:28.040 
okay so it's kind of like this it would
look<00:05:20.280> like<00:05:20.340> this<00:05:22.520> alright<00:05:25.729> so<00:05:26.729> um<00:05:27.030> you<00:05:27.930> know

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
look like this alright so um you know

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.570 
look like this alright so um you know
you<00:05:28.139> could<00:05:28.410> divide<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.889> down<00:05:29.070> let's<00:05:29.370> say<00:05:29.520> you

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
you could divide it down let's say you

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.909 
you could divide it down let's say you
want<00:05:29.849> to<00:05:29.910> move<00:05:30.030> this<00:05:30.590> let's<00:05:31.590> say<00:05:31.710> we're<00:05:31.830> gonna

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
want to move this let's say we're gonna

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.260 
want to move this let's say we're gonna
move<00:05:32.130> this<00:05:32.310> arm<00:05:32.639> and<00:05:34.070> you<00:05:35.070> know<00:05:35.130> 3/8<00:05:35.789> inch

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
move this arm and you know 3/8 inch

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.379 
move this arm and you know 3/8 inch
increments<00:05:37.190> we<00:05:38.190> could<00:05:38.430> stick<00:05:38.789> our<00:05:38.940> gauge<00:05:39.150> on

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
increments we could stick our gauge on

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.450 
increments we could stick our gauge on
the<00:05:39.510> tip<00:05:39.659> of<00:05:39.780> the<00:05:39.870> finger<00:05:40.789> like<00:05:41.789> this<00:05:43.310> take<00:05:44.310> our

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
the tip of the finger like this take our

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.830 
the tip of the finger like this take our
calipers<00:05:44.970> and<00:05:45.930> get<00:05:46.050> this<00:05:46.199> in<00:05:46.380> focus<00:05:47.780> all<00:05:48.780> right

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
calipers and get this in focus all right

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.589 
calipers and get this in focus all right
take<00:05:49.110> our<00:05:49.289> calipers<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:50.120> close<00:05:51.120> them<00:05:51.330> to<00:05:51.479> me

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
take our calipers and close them to me

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.430 
take our calipers and close them to me
let's<00:05:51.810> say<00:05:51.930> three<00:05:52.169> eighths<00:05:52.349> and<00:05:53.990> then<00:05:54.990> you<00:05:55.169> can

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
let's say three eighths and then you can

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.170 
let's say three eighths and then you can
put<00:05:56.039> that<00:05:56.190> alongside<00:05:56.580> your<00:05:57.030> gauge<00:05:57.210> like<00:05:58.050> this

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
put that alongside your gauge like this

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.800 
put that alongside your gauge like this
and<00:06:00.380> literally<00:06:01.380> move<00:06:01.650> that<00:06:01.919> hand<00:06:02.810> the

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
and literally move that hand the

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.330 
and literally move that hand the
distance<00:06:04.289> of<00:06:04.470> the<00:06:04.590> calipers<00:06:05.070> gap<00:06:07.130> all<00:06:08.130> right

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
distance of the calipers gap all right

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.659 
distance of the calipers gap all right
so<00:06:08.820> then<00:06:08.940> you<00:06:08.970> remove<00:06:09.300> everything<00:06:10.669> take

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
so then you remove everything take

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.029 
so then you remove everything take
another<00:06:11.909> frame<00:06:12.150> of<00:06:12.180> film<00:06:12.740> let's<00:06:13.740> say<00:06:13.889> that's

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
another frame of film let's say that's

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.409 
another frame of film let's say that's
the<00:06:14.159> third<00:06:14.370> move<00:06:14.610> and<00:06:14.820> then<00:06:14.940> that's<00:06:15.150> gonna<00:06:15.330> be

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
the third move and then that's gonna be

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.189 
the third move and then that's gonna be
all<00:06:15.690> equal<00:06:16.050> spacing<00:06:16.530> so<00:06:17.690> put<00:06:18.690> your<00:06:18.780> gauge<00:06:18.960> back

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
all equal spacing so put your gauge back

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:20.950 
all equal spacing so put your gauge back
in<00:06:19.409> after<00:06:19.680> you<00:06:19.740> take<00:06:19.889> that<00:06:20.009> frame<00:06:20.190> of<00:06:20.250> film

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
in after you take that frame of film

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.499 
in after you take that frame of film
like<00:06:21.960> this<00:06:24.110> take<00:06:25.110> your<00:06:25.229> calipers<00:06:26.360> just<00:06:27.360> to

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:27.509 
like this take your calipers just to

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:31.100 
like this take your calipers just to
come<00:06:27.659> here<00:06:27.690> like<00:06:28.050> this<00:06:29.659> move<00:06:30.659> that<00:06:30.840> hand

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
come here like this move that hand

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.969 
come here like this move that hand
exactly<00:06:32.180> the<00:06:33.180> same<00:06:33.509> distance<00:06:34.500> then<00:06:34.740> you<00:06:34.770> moved

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
exactly the same distance then you moved

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.080 
exactly the same distance then you moved
it<00:06:35.130> before<00:06:36.470> and<00:06:37.470> repeat<00:06:38.340> the<00:06:38.460> process<00:06:38.639> and

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
it before and repeat the process and

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.719 
it before and repeat the process and
you'll<00:06:39.210> get<00:06:39.389> a<00:06:39.659> very<00:06:39.960> intimate<00:06:40.680> emotion<00:06:41.279> it

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
you'll get a very intimate emotion it

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:44.060 
you'll get a very intimate emotion it
won't<00:06:41.909> be<00:06:42.029> very<00:06:42.270> realistic<00:06:42.690> unless<00:06:43.229> it's<00:06:43.469> like

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
won't be very realistic unless it's like

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.230 
won't be very realistic unless it's like
a<00:06:44.099> ball<00:06:44.370> rolling<00:06:44.820> down<00:06:44.849> it

or<00:06:45.449> something<00:06:45.840> but<00:06:46.500> anything<00:06:46.860> like<00:06:47.009> I<00:06:47.130> say

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
or something but anything like I say

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.570 
or something but anything like I say
that's<00:06:47.490> speeding<00:06:47.880> up<00:06:48.090> and<00:06:48.210> speeding<00:06:48.360> down<00:06:49.580> if

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
that's speeding up and speeding down if

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.159 
that's speeding up and speeding down if
let's<00:06:51.030> it's<00:06:51.150> mechanical<00:06:51.690> or<00:06:51.810> something<00:06:52.110> you

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169 
let's it's mechanical or something you

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:53.540 
let's it's mechanical or something you
want<00:06:52.319> to<00:06:52.410> make<00:06:52.530> sure<00:06:52.710> if<00:06:52.830> it's<00:06:53.009> like<00:06:53.130> a<00:06:53.160> living

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
want to make sure if it's like a living

want to make sure if it's like a living
being<00:06:54.050> the<00:06:55.050> way<00:06:55.500> it's<00:06:55.650> going<00:06:55.770> to<00:06:55.830> naturally

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:56.009

and<00:07:13.470> you<00:07:14.280> can<00:07:14.430> do<00:07:14.520> the<00:07:14.639> same<00:07:14.759> thing<00:07:15.000> instead<00:07:15.300> of

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:15.389 
and you can do the same thing instead of

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:19.760 
and you can do the same thing instead of
using<00:07:16.310> calipers<00:07:17.310> like<00:07:17.699> this<00:07:18.560> you<00:07:19.560> can<00:07:19.740> just

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
using calipers like this you can just

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.589 
using calipers like this you can just
use<00:07:20.190> the<00:07:20.400> little<00:07:20.580> tick<00:07:20.820> mark<00:07:21.060> on<00:07:21.210> your<00:07:21.389> pencil
