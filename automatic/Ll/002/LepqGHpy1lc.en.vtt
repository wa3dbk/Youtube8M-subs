00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
stability so I'm already on track to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.999 
stability so I'm already on track to
that<00:02:05.299> I'm<00:02:05.450> getting<00:02:05.720> my<00:02:05.899> cna<00:02:06.350> right<00:02:06.530> now<00:02:06.709> and

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
I'm still thinking if I want to do my LP

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.180 
I'm still thinking if I want to do my LP
and<00:02:09.830> after<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.280> cna<00:02:10.700> um<00:02:11.410> before<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:12.650> do<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.890> RN

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
or if I just want to go stretch the RN

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.340 
or if I just want to go stretch the RN
but<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:16.160> LPN<00:02:16.580> would<00:02:16.730> help<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.090> anyway<00:02:17.480> um<00:02:17.720> if

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
through I know older nurses they

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.770 
through I know older nurses they
probably<00:02:37.549> say<00:02:37.940> go<00:02:38.150> from<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.420> cna<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.870> the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
probably say go from the cna to the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.080 
probably say go from the cna to the
but<00:02:40.200> newer<00:02:40.470> nurses<00:02:40.920> might<00:02:41.100> say<00:02:41.280> well<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.670> LPN

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
but newer nurses might say well the LPN

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.420 
but newer nurses might say well the LPN
helps<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.510> get<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.780> your<00:02:42.840> iron<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.350> just<00:02:44.010> put
