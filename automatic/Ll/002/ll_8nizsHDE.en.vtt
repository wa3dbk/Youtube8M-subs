store and they had me turn it on and
sink<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.670> actually<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.060> sink<00:01:27.299> was<00:01:27.420> any

good<00:02:13.829> cheer<00:02:14.099> so<00:02:14.280> let's<00:02:14.459> go<00:02:14.670> through<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:16.110> cable

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
good cheer so let's go through the cable

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.929 
good cheer so let's go through the cable
the<00:02:16.739> cable<00:02:16.769> of<00:02:17.099> course<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.579> new<00:02:17.700> lightning

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
the cable of course is the new lightning

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.190 
the cable of course is the new lightning
cable<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.569> it's<00:02:18.720> wrapped<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:18.989> this<00:02:19.140> plastic

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
cable so it's wrapped in this plastic

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.130 
cable so it's wrapped in this plastic
here<00:02:19.890> it's<00:02:20.010> USB<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.700> right<00:02:20.909> now<00:02:20.939> this<00:02:21.720> cable

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
here it's USB so right now this cable

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.720 
here it's USB so right now this cable
theoretically<00:02:22.560> does<00:02:22.709> not<00:02:22.829> have<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.370> not<00:02:23.549> any

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
theoretically does not have is not any

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.699 
theoretically does not have is not any
faster<00:02:24.209> than<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.420> traditional<00:02:24.750> 30-pin<00:02:25.439> but<00:02:25.680> I

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
faster than the traditional 30-pin but I

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.589 
faster than the traditional 30-pin but I
assume<00:02:26.220> when<00:02:26.730> they<00:02:26.760> make<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.150> Thunderbolt

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
assume when they make it the Thunderbolt

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.539 
assume when they make it the Thunderbolt
model<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.079> connects<00:02:28.470> it'll<00:02:29.310> be<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.400> lot

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
model that connects it'll be a lot

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.580 
model that connects it'll be a lot
faster<00:02:29.819> but<00:02:30.359> it's<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.930> digital<00:02:31.049> connector

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
faster but it's a digital connector

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.069 
faster but it's a digital connector
right<00:02:31.739> here<00:02:31.849> you<00:02:32.849> can<00:02:33.000> plug<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.299> both<00:02:33.480> ways<00:02:33.750> so

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
right here you can plug in both ways so

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.110 
right here you can plug in both ways so
you<00:02:34.170> can<00:02:34.260> actually<00:02:34.290> plug<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.579> your<00:02:35.670> iPhone

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
you can actually plug in to your iPhone

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.750 
you can actually plug in to your iPhone
either<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.720> direction<00:02:37.400> or<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.430> other<00:02:38.519> way

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
either this direction or the other way

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.979 
either this direction or the other way
which<00:02:38.939> is<00:02:39.060> actually<00:02:39.150> really<00:02:39.450> convenient<00:02:39.840> I

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
which is actually really convenient I

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.360 
which is actually really convenient I
know<00:02:40.079> it's<00:02:40.260> kind<00:02:40.439> of<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.590> first-world<00:02:40.980> problem

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
know it's kind of a first-world problem

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.410 
know it's kind of a first-world problem
but<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.549> know<00:02:41.640> sometimes<00:02:41.939> in<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.239> middle<00:02:42.329> of

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
they weren't the greatest so I always

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.469 
they weren't the greatest so I always
just<00:03:40.590> kept<00:03:40.799> them<00:03:41.010> around<00:03:41.579> as<00:03:41.790> like<00:03:41.940> almost<00:03:42.239> a

broke<00:03:47.849> a<00:03:48.030> couple<00:03:48.239> of<00:03:48.359> weeks<00:03:48.419> ago<00:03:48.569> so<00:03:48.810> I'll

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
broke a couple of weeks ago so I'll

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.689 
broke a couple of weeks ago so I'll
probably<00:03:49.019> using<00:03:49.409> these<00:03:49.440> in<00:03:49.620> my<00:03:49.709> main<00:03:49.889> pair<00:03:50.579> of

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
probably using these in my main pair of

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:51.949 
probably using these in my main pair of
headphones<00:03:50.849> for<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.299> little<00:03:51.389> bit<00:03:51.599> but<00:03:51.750> here's

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
headphones for a little bit but here's

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.080 
headphones for a little bit but here's
the<00:03:52.019> mic<00:03:52.319> control<00:03:52.650> as<00:03:52.799> well<00:03:52.829> good<00:03:53.699> response

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
the mic control as well good response

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.580 
the mic control as well good response
looks<00:03:54.599> a<00:03:54.720> little<00:03:54.870> bit<00:03:55.019> different<00:03:55.409> than<00:03:55.500> the

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
looks a little bit different than the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.960 
looks a little bit different than the
old<00:03:55.739> one<00:03:55.949> too<00:03:56.129> just<00:03:56.159> because<00:03:56.400> these<00:03:56.909> little

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
old one too just because these little

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.849 
old one too just because these little
plastic<00:03:57.479> parts<00:03:57.810> right<00:03:57.930> here<00:03:57.989> it's<00:03:58.739> probably

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
plastic parts right here it's probably

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.770 
plastic parts right here it's probably
they<00:03:59.579> probably<00:03:59.790> added<00:04:00.269> that<00:04:00.389> on<00:04:00.510> for<00:04:00.690> like

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
they probably added that on for like

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.030 
they probably added that on for like
durability<00:04:01.049> or<00:04:01.319> something<00:04:01.650> very<00:04:01.979> good

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
durability or something very good

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.039 
durability or something very good
response<00:04:02.340> for<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.639> buttons<00:04:02.879> as<00:04:03.000> well<00:04:03.180> up<00:04:03.720> and

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
response for the buttons as well up and

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.390 
response for the buttons as well up and
down<00:04:04.199> and<00:04:04.409> in<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:04.919> back<00:04:05.040> there's<00:04:05.069> also

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
down and in the back there's also

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.030 
down and in the back there's also
printed<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.209> microphone<00:04:06.870> simple<00:04:07.379> so<00:04:07.859> let<00:04:07.979> me

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
printed is a microphone simple so let me

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.680 
printed is a microphone simple so let me
just<00:04:08.159> show<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.400> quick<00:04:08.609> comparison<00:04:08.879> of<00:04:09.479> the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
just show you a quick comparison of the

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.140 
just show you a quick comparison of the
iphone<00:04:10.079> 4s<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.979> the<00:04:11.129> iphone<00:04:11.250> 5<00:04:11.760> he<00:04:11.940> probably

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
iphone 4s and the iphone 5 he probably

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.789 
iphone 4s and the iphone 5 he probably
seen<00:04:12.329> a<00:04:12.389> million<00:04:12.569> of<00:04:12.750> them<00:04:12.780> but<00:04:13.470> i'll<00:04:13.560> just

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
seen a million of them but i'll just

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.559
