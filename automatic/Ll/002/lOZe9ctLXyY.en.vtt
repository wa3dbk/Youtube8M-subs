00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.500
 coconut oil slimline to 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.349
 otherwise studies have been done on islands 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.200
 of Polynesia where they drink and cook 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.230
 with a coconut oil and most of the 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.910
 population do not suffer diseases 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.789
 cardiovascular disease or excess weight 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.770
 it may be surprising to realize 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.910
 that saturated fats of origin 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:30.030
 natural indeed have actually 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:33.120
 surprising health benefits 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.470
 we can say then that the oil 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.530
 of coconut promotes heart health 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.080
 it also helps weight loss to that 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.180
 our immune system is healthy 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.770
 healthy 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.670
 to have a more efficient metabolism 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.970
 it provides us with a source of energy 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.310
 immediate 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:02.199
 It also helps us to maintain our 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.610
 skin with a healthy and youthful appearance 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.640
 supports the proper functioning of the 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.409
 thyroid gland an investigation has 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.290
 demonstrated that due to its effect 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.920
 metabolic , coconut oil increases the 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.000
 Thyroid activity 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.310
 you have probably heard that a 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.350
 slow thyroid is one of the reasons why 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.510
 which some people are unable 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.990
 to lose weight no matter what 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.020
 make 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.250
 take coconut oil in this case you're going 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.250
 to help regulate the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.450
 besides the coconut oil does not produce 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.670
 insulin spikes in your torrent 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.850
 blood so it is recommended 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.479
 case of diabetes in cases of stress or 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.479
 pathological anxiety 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.650
 after analyzing its virtues the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.250
 saturated or requested fats that are 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.070
 of plant origin are not harmful 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.009
 as a few years ago the bad was commented 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.280
 are the saturated fats transformed 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.570
 industrially like trans fats or 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.120
 hydrogenated 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.030
 We can use the coconut oil to 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.300
 cooking since its components do not 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.790
 alter or disappear their properties 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.230
 antioxidants as in other oils and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.379
 fats 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.200
 In summary we can say that the oil 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.659
 of coconut makes us feel active 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.120
 helps to lose weight in the event that 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.430
 we also increase activity 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.280
 of the thyroid gland regulates the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.670
 metabolism and it goes very well in cases of 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.610
 diabetes or stress thank you for listening to me
