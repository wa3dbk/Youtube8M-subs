pack but I'll show you a quick
demonstration<00:00:15.389> how<00:00:16.139> they<00:00:16.289> work<00:00:17.119> here's<00:00:18.119> a

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
demonstration how they work here's a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.170 
demonstration how they work here's a
kind<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.480> good<00:00:18.600> shake<00:00:19.640> make<00:00:20.640> sure<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.000> change

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
kind of good shake make sure you change

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.730 
kind of good shake make sure you change
in<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.510> metal<00:00:21.779> gear<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.350> can<00:00:22.470> be<00:00:22.560> easily

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
in a metal gear so it can be easily

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.000 
in a metal gear so it can be easily
rotated<00:00:23.100> backwards<00:00:23.609> without<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.269> railing

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
rotated backwards without the railing

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:39.599 
rotated backwards without the railing
and<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.130> apply<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:27.090> foam<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.320> chain

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.119 

so<00:00:40.609> as<00:00:40.699> you<00:00:40.789> can<00:00:40.910> see<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.690> phones

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
so as you can see the phones

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.380 
so as you can see the phones
encapsulated<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:43.190> chain<00:00:43.429> it's<00:00:43.969> also<00:00:44.120> gone

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
encapsulated the chain it's also gone

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.000 
encapsulated the chain it's also gone
onto<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.659> sprockets<00:00:45.140> we<00:00:45.469> can<00:00:45.680> move<00:00:45.800> it<00:00:45.949> around

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
onto the sprockets we can move it around

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.619 
onto the sprockets we can move it around
a<00:00:46.309> little<00:00:46.339> bit<00:00:46.640> if<00:00:46.760> you<00:00:46.789> get<00:00:46.969> a<00:00:47.000> bit<00:00:47.180> of<00:00:47.269> excess

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
a little bit if you get a bit of excess

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.169 
a little bit if you get a bit of excess
buildup<00:00:48.489> see<00:00:49.489> where<00:00:49.640> you<00:00:49.729> need<00:00:49.850> it

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
buildup see where you need it

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.450 
buildup see where you need it
the<00:00:50.809> trick<00:00:51.050> is<00:00:51.199> now<00:00:51.350> is<00:00:51.500> to<00:00:51.649> let<00:00:51.800> that<00:00:52.010> wet<00:00:52.250> out

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
the trick is now is to let that wet out

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.990 
the trick is now is to let that wet out
let<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.089> phone<00:00:54.079> do<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.469> work<00:00:54.619> for<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:58.000> once

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
let the phone do the work for you once

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.759 
let the phone do the work for you once
the<00:00:59.180> chain<00:00:59.420> once<00:00:59.809> the<00:00:59.930> foam<00:01:00.109> is<00:01:00.260> wetted<00:01:00.649> out

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
the chain once the foam is wetted out

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.810 
the chain once the foam is wetted out
you<00:01:01.280> get<00:01:01.430> your<00:01:01.519> chain<00:01:01.729> cleaning<00:01:02.089> sponge<00:01:03.820> great

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
you get your chain cleaning sponge great

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.240 
you get your chain cleaning sponge great
little<00:01:05.059> device<00:01:05.210> just<00:01:06.170> slot<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:06.860> onto<00:01:07.159> the

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
little device just slot it onto the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.029 
little device just slot it onto the
chain<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:10.700> then<00:01:10.850> again<00:01:11.380> hold<00:01:12.380> on<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.679> it<00:01:12.800> and

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
chain and then again hold on to it and

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.749 
chain and then again hold on to it and
rotate<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:14.409> chain<00:01:15.409> back<00:01:15.619> this<00:01:15.860> now<00:01:16.520> usually

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
rotate the chain back this now usually

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.300 
rotate the chain back this now usually
you<00:01:16.970> would<00:01:17.119> let<00:01:17.560> did<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:18.649> know<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:18.860> foam<00:01:19.100> or

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
you would let did you know the foam or

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.820 
you would let did you know the foam or
wet<00:01:19.490> out<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:20.360> that<00:01:20.569> she<00:01:20.600> doesn't<00:01:20.929> get<00:01:21.110> doesn't

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
wet out so that she doesn't get doesn't

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:36.609 
wet out so that she doesn't get doesn't
build<00:01:21.920> up<00:01:22.039> on<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.310> edge<00:01:22.399> of<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.580> sponge

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.969 

so<00:01:37.609> once<00:01:37.850> you've<00:01:38.030> rotated<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:38.719> for<00:01:39.049> 20<00:01:39.560> seconds

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
so once you've rotated it for 20 seconds

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.609 
so once you've rotated it for 20 seconds
or<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:40.479> you<00:01:41.479> can<00:01:41.630> take<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.869> sponge<00:01:42.049> off<00:01:42.350> and

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
or so you can take the sponge off and

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.679 
or so you can take the sponge off and
you<00:01:42.740> can<00:01:42.890> see<00:01:42.920> that<00:01:43.609> the<00:01:43.700> dirts<00:01:43.909> encapsulated

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
you can see that the dirts encapsulated

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.300 
you can see that the dirts encapsulated
in<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.810> sponge<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.409> can<00:01:45.649> be<00:01:45.679> taken<00:01:45.770> away<00:01:46.250> in

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
in a sponge so that can be taken away in

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.330 
in a sponge so that can be taken away in
what<00:01:46.810> now<00:01:47.810> you<00:01:47.869> would<00:01:48.049> normally<00:01:48.409> rinse<00:01:49.159> that

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
what now you would normally rinse that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.590 
what now you would normally rinse that
down<00:01:49.549> rewards<00:01:49.909> to<00:01:50.060> get<00:01:50.179> rid<00:01:50.299> of<00:01:50.390> all<00:01:50.509> the

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
down rewards to get rid of all the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.149 
down rewards to get rid of all the
contaminants<00:01:51.049> if<00:01:51.409> you're<00:01:51.679> in<00:01:51.770> workshop

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
contaminants if you're in workshop

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.850 
contaminants if you're in workshop
environment<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.939> mean<00:01:53.840> just<00:01:54.319> get<00:01:54.469> yourself<00:01:54.799> a

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
environment I mean just get yourself a

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.539 
environment I mean just get yourself a
cloth<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.700> give<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:55.969> a<00:01:56.000> wipe<00:01:56.179> down<00:01:56.209> again<00:01:57.549> it's

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
cloth and give it a wipe down again it's

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.120 
cloth and give it a wipe down again it's
not<00:01:58.700> ideal<00:01:58.939> but<00:01:59.359> in<00:02:00.229> a<00:02:00.530> lot<00:02:00.829> of<00:02:00.859> cases

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
not ideal but in a lot of cases

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.999 
not ideal but in a lot of cases
sometimes<00:02:01.909> that's<00:02:02.090> what<00:02:02.240> getting<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.659> do<00:02:06.009> and

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
sometimes that's what getting to do and

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.100 
sometimes that's what getting to do and
that's<00:02:07.219> it

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
that's it

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.930 
that's it
nice<00:02:09.110> clean<00:02:09.349> chain<00:02:09.560> ready<00:02:10.009> for<00:02:10.280> reeling<00:02:10.729> me

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
nice clean chain ready for reeling me
