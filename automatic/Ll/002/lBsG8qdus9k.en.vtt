somewhere
hopefully<00:01:44.740> they've<00:01:44.890> got<00:01:45.100> enough<00:01:45.310> room<00:01:45.550> it's

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
hopefully they've got enough room it's

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.370 
and a water heater which isn't even that
useful<00:01:57.480> because<00:01:58.480> it<00:01:58.630> stays<00:01:58.870> pretty<00:01:59.110> warm

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380
