00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.899
 after tinting the entrance to have 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.269
 mounted a shelf with the relative 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.740
 mirror the decorated hangers and have 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.599
 renewed the doors 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.089
 we continue equipping the door of the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.220
 storage room with storage compartments and door 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.340
 small parts mom what a mess 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.019
 but here I have to do absolutely nothing 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.560
 maybe the back of this door can me 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.730
 to help 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.730
 that is, if you do it yourself it's easy 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.910
 with the flexible m we trace 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.880
 on the inside of the door with two points 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.880
 distant about 30 cm from the upper edge 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.839
 with a straight strip used as one 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.309
 row we join the two points with a line 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:01:01.309
 horizontal with the same system 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.879
 we trace two other instant lines 30 e 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.950
 60 cm from the first we prepare a 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.990
 strip as wide as the door and there 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.930
 we support above a bar reggi 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.580
 hanging cabinets we mark the points in 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.400
 which the screws will be placed for 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.920
 support the bar 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.440
 we practice some invitation forums for 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.440
 screws with a 2 mm diameter bit 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.060
 place the bar again on a 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.500
 strip and fix it with some screws 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.500
 wood self-tapping 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.970
 in our laboratory DIY 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.190
 we realize a small shelf dell 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.520
 two sides perforated to receive one 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.740
 plug we equip the aluminum rod with 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.409
 a small cap at the end and insert it 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.940
 in the holes of the hips 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.650
 then we block it from the other end 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.650
 with a second cap 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.020
 to apply the shelf to the door 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.020
 We use the thousand nail adhesive 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.459
 we lay some on the back of the shelf 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.540
 adhesive cords in particular in 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.540
 near the edges 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.459
 in the central part we apply it to 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.459
 zig Zag 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.920
 the shelf can now be supported 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.950
 at the door long the upper line e 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.050
 pressed in place in a few seconds 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.959
 thanks to its suction effect it remains 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.910
 also fixed on the back of the stars 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.170
 we spread the glue a thousand nails e 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.120
 we apply the strip in 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.290
 correspondence of the second line 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.290
 traced on the door 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.480
 on another strip we mark points 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.690
 close together in which to apply gods 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.690
 hooks we make invitation holes 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.610
 we use the hooks of the plugs s 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.180
 fisher that we live manually in the holes 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.180
 of invitation 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.220
 this strip is also equipped 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.950
 of adhesive thousand nails on its back 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.480
 as the previous ones is based is 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.070
 fixed on the door along the third line 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.440
 after a few hours we can equip the 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.910
 central strip hanging from the bar 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.910
 of the small trays for small parts 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.830
 now all I have to do is fill up 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.410
 these useful containers with so many things 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.980
 that I will have so well in sight and in reach 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.980
 of hand 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:33.250
