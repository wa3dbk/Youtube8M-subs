I do the Preston Reed slap thumb for the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.660 
I do the Preston Reed slap thumb for the
rhythm<00:00:39.079> now<00:00:40.079> we're<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.250> chord

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
rhythm now we're going to do a chord

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.760 
rhythm now we're going to do a chord
which<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.480> pretty<00:00:42.930> much<00:00:43.020> repeated<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:43.739> a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
which is pretty much repeated with a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.630 
which is pretty much repeated with a
variation<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.550> fret<00:00:45.510> 3<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.350> 2<00:00:46.800> 2<00:00:47.039> which<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.579> do

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
variation on fret 3 it is 2 2 which I do

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
here's where I differ a lot from what

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.520 
here's where I differ a lot from what
Andy<00:01:05.970> McKee<00:01:06.270> does<00:01:06.450> Andy<00:01:06.750> McKee<00:01:06.990> does<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> triple

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
Andy McKee does Andy McKee does a triple

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
so you can see the technique it's down

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:22.520 
so you can see the technique it's down
thumb<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:20.570> that<00:01:21.570> technique<00:01:22.140> has<00:01:22.290> never

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
thumb and that technique has never

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.219 
thumb and that technique has never
worked<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.130> me<00:01:23.310> I'm<00:01:23.580> no<00:01:24.180> good<00:01:24.420> at<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.630> so
