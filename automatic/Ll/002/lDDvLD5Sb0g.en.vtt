my<00:00:40.790> electric<00:00:41.240> wok<00:00:41.450> this<00:00:42.440> is<00:00:42.620> regular<00:00:43.010> canola

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
my electric wok this is regular canola

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.400 
my electric wok this is regular canola
oil<00:00:43.700> peanut<00:00:44.240> oil<00:00:44.420> is<00:00:44.660> probably<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.200> best

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
oil peanut oil is probably the best

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.720 
oil peanut oil is probably the best
choice<00:00:45.650> but<00:00:46.010> today<00:00:46.250> we're<00:00:46.430> going<00:00:46.580> with

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
choice but today we're going with

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.760 
choice but today we're going with
regular<00:00:47.150> canola<00:00:47.450> oil<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.080> we're<00:00:48.290> adding<00:00:48.440> the

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
regular canola oil so we're adding the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.560 
regular canola oil so we're adding the
frozen<00:00:49.460> prawns<00:00:49.730> these<00:00:50.060> aren't<00:00:50.330> going<00:00:50.480> to

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
frozen prawns these aren't going to

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.140 
frozen prawns these aren't going to
require<00:00:50.930> a<00:00:50.960> lot<00:00:51.650> of<00:00:51.800> cooking<00:00:52.160> but<00:00:52.790> they<00:00:52.940> will

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
require a lot of cooking but they will

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.930 
require a lot of cooking but they will
release<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.600> fair<00:00:53.990> bit<00:00:54.410> of<00:00:54.710> water<00:00:55.220> as<00:00:55.550> they<00:00:55.730> cook

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
release a fair bit of water as they cook

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.730 
release a fair bit of water as they cook
so<00:00:55.970> we're<00:00:56.330> going<00:00:56.450> to<00:00:56.540> cook<00:00:56.750> them<00:00:57.050> first<00:00:57.380> and

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740

so we're going to cook them first and
then<00:00:58.400> remove<00:00:58.880> them

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.160 

these<00:01:06.850> will<00:01:06.970> take<00:01:07.150> just<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.570> couple<00:01:07.690> of<00:01:07.870> minutes

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
these will take just a couple of minutes

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.320 
these will take just a couple of minutes
and<00:01:08.290> put<00:01:08.500> them<00:01:08.680> aside<00:01:08.800> and<00:01:09.640> then<00:01:09.970> do<00:01:10.150> the

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
sure to move the food around

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.520 
sure to move the food around
continuously<00:01:18.940> in<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.450> water<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.990> prawns<00:01:20.380> are

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
continuously in the water the prawns are

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.140 
continuously in the water the prawns are
pink<00:01:20.800> all<00:01:21.010> the<00:01:21.250> way<00:01:21.369> through<00:01:21.640> that's<00:01:21.850> when

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
pink all the way through that's when

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.270 
pink all the way through that's when
they're<00:01:22.300> cooked<00:01:22.509> and<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:23.500> see<00:01:23.680> that<00:01:23.860> these<00:01:24.009> just

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
they're cooked and I see that these just

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.950 
they're cooked and I see that these just
have<00:01:24.490> a<00:01:24.520> little<00:01:24.850> bit<00:01:25.090> longer<00:01:25.240> go<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:25.869> then

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
have a little bit longer go and then

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.480 
have a little bit longer go and then
we're<00:01:26.080> gonna<00:01:26.259> pull<00:01:26.500> them<00:01:26.650> out<00:01:26.770> put<00:01:27.070> them<00:01:27.100> aside

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
we're gonna pull them out put them aside

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.190 
we're gonna pull them out put them aside
and<00:01:27.880> start<00:01:28.360> nicely<00:01:28.750> done

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
and start nicely done

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.740 
and start nicely done
so<00:01:29.500> let's<00:01:29.950> scoop<00:01:30.940> them<00:01:31.119> out<00:01:31.210> I'm<00:01:31.390> using<00:01:31.479> a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
so let's scoop them out I'm using a

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.930 
so let's scoop them out I'm using a
slotted<00:01:32.110> spoon<00:01:32.409> here<00:01:32.830> so<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.220> liquid<00:01:33.580> drains

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
slotted spoon here so the liquid drains

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.499 
slotted spoon here so the liquid drains
out<00:01:34.150> okay<00:01:34.570> so<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:35.110> prawns<00:01:35.710> are<00:01:36.250> cooked

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
out okay so the prawns are cooked

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.510 
out okay so the prawns are cooked
removed<00:01:37.509> from<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.899> wok<00:01:38.140> I've<00:01:38.979> now<00:01:39.250> got<00:01:39.490> a

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
removed from the wok I've now got a

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.240 
removed from the wok I've now got a
couple<00:01:39.789> of<00:01:39.940> tablespoons<00:01:40.270> of<00:01:40.930> my<00:01:41.500> canola<00:01:42.009> oil

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
couple of tablespoons of my canola oil

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.389 
couple of tablespoons of my canola oil
which<00:01:42.490> I'm<00:01:42.700> heating<00:01:42.970> up<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:44.259> time<00:01:44.830> to<00:01:44.979> add<00:01:45.160> the

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
which I'm heating up and time to add the

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.370 
which I'm heating up and time to add the
vegetables<00:01:45.550> you<00:01:46.090> could<00:01:46.240> use<00:01:46.420> fresh<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:47.140> course

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
vegetables you could use fresh of course

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.139 
vegetables you could use fresh of course
and<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.680> would<00:01:47.800> be<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:47.950> great<00:01:48.220> choice<00:01:48.460> in<00:01:49.060> this

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
and that would be a great choice in this

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.969 
and that would be a great choice in this
case<00:01:49.210> I'm<00:01:49.570> using<00:01:49.600> frozen<00:01:50.080> because<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:50.649> was<00:01:50.770> so

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
case I'm using frozen because I was so

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.960 
case I'm using frozen because I was so
lazy

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.920 

[Music]

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
[Music]

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.770 
[Music]
so<00:01:58.930> here<00:01:59.590> we<00:01:59.740> are<00:01:59.970> heating<00:02:00.970> up<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.330> frozen

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
so here we are heating up the frozen

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.060 
so here we are heating up the frozen
vegetables<00:02:02.320> should<00:02:02.470> only<00:02:02.620> take<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:02.950> couple
