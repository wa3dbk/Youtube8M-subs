00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.900 

as<00:00:06.359> we<00:00:07.259> start<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.830> delve<00:00:08.160> into<00:00:08.370> this<00:00:08.849> whole

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
as we start to delve into this whole

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.830 
as we start to delve into this whole
idea<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.740> the<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.040> way<00:00:11.370> cells<00:00:11.849> divide<00:00:12.330> let's

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
idea of the the way cells divide let's

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.419 
idea of the the way cells divide let's
just<00:00:13.080> do<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> quick<00:00:13.410> review<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.889> cell<00:00:14.219> cycle

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
just do a quick review of the cell cycle

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.070 
just do a quick review of the cell cycle
and<00:00:14.700> make<00:00:14.880> sure<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.240> know<00:00:15.420> where<00:00:15.690> we're<00:00:15.839> going

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
and make sure you know where we're going

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.010 
and make sure you know where we're going
and<00:00:16.379> where<00:00:16.980> we've<00:00:17.160> been<00:00:17.420> remember<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.570> that

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
and where we've been remember that that

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.050 
and where we've been remember that that
generally<00:00:19.740> speaking<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:20.250> cell<00:00:20.490> doesn't<00:00:20.850> spend

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
generally speaking a cell doesn't spend

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.759 
generally speaking a cell doesn't spend
much<00:00:21.180> time<00:00:21.300> dividing<00:00:22.080> at<00:00:22.170> all<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.470> spends

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
much time dividing at all it spends

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.370 
much time dividing at all it spends
about<00:00:22.890> 10%<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.550> its<00:00:23.730> life<00:00:23.939> some<00:00:24.840> cells<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.350> fact

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
about 10% of its life some cells in fact

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.189 
about 10% of its life some cells in fact
never<00:00:26.220> divide<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.090> we'll<00:00:27.779> talk<00:00:28.050> about

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
never divide and we'll talk about

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.990 
never divide and we'll talk about
actually<00:00:28.740> yeah<00:00:29.310> we'll<00:00:29.460> talk<00:00:29.609> about<00:00:29.849> that

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
actually yeah we'll talk about that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.919 
actually yeah we'll talk about that
later

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
later

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.970 
later
but<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> bottom<00:00:31.650> line<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.390> here<00:00:33.390> g1<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.559> where

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
but the bottom line is here g1 is where

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.709 
but the bottom line is here g1 is where
most<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.489> your<00:00:35.670> cells<00:00:35.880> activities<00:00:36.510> are<00:00:36.630> going

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
most of your cells activities are going

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.930 
most of your cells activities are going
to<00:00:36.809> occur<00:00:37.140> then<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> cell<00:00:38.430> starts<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.790> get

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
to occur then the cell starts to get

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.299 
to occur then the cell starts to get
ready<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.420> replication<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.620> grows<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> little

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
ready for replication it grows a little

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.760 
ready for replication it grows a little
bit<00:00:41.670> more<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:41.969> G<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.629> G's<00:00:43.200> standing<00:00:43.590> for

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
bit more in G to the G's standing for

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.830 
bit more in G to the G's standing for
gap<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.309> want<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.730> spend<00:00:44.969> our<00:00:45.239> time<00:00:45.300> right

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
gap but we want to spend our time right

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.650 
gap but we want to spend our time right
now<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.770> section<00:00:47.100> right<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:47.660> this

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
now in this section right here this

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.770 
now in this section right here this
section<00:00:49.020> which<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.829> going<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.160> be<00:00:50.370> called

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
section which is going to be called

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.970 
section which is going to be called
mitosis<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.789> cytokinesis<00:00:53.809> now<00:00:54.980> immediately

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
mitosis and cytokinesis now immediately

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.189 
mitosis and cytokinesis now immediately
the<00:00:56.489> vocabulary<00:00:57.210> starts<00:00:57.539> coming<00:00:57.840> out<00:00:57.960> like

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the vocabulary starts coming out like

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.069 
the vocabulary starts coming out like
like<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.980> asteroids<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> sky<00:01:00.539> all

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
like like asteroids out of the sky all

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.280 
like like asteroids out of the sky all
right<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:02.460> yes<00:01:02.699> biology<00:01:03.629> does<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> lot<00:01:04.260> of

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
right and yes biology does have a lot of

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.370 
right and yes biology does have a lot of
vocabulary<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.070> yes<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:06.360> word<00:01:06.540> mitosis<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
vocabulary and yes the word mitosis is

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.620 
vocabulary and yes the word mitosis is
important<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.340> word<00:01:08.490> cytokinesis<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
important and the word cytokinesis is

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.880 
important and the word cytokinesis is
important<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.320> haven't<00:01:10.470> even<00:01:10.619> written

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
important but I haven't even written

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.250 
important but I haven't even written
them<00:01:11.070> down<00:01:11.100> yet<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.760> Amaya<00:01:12.479> derelict<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.140> my

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
them down yet so Amaya derelict in my

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.109 
them down yet so Amaya derelict in my
teaching<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:13.920> no<00:01:14.130> absolutely<00:01:14.700> not<00:01:14.909> we're

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
teaching here no absolutely not we're

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.210 
teaching here no absolutely not we're
gonna<00:01:15.299> use<00:01:15.479> those<00:01:15.689> words<00:01:15.869> plenty<00:01:16.439> but<00:01:17.040> what<00:01:17.189> I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
gonna use those words plenty but what I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.399 
gonna use those words plenty but what I
want<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> understand<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.869> point<00:01:18.990> is

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
want you to understand at this point is

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.130 
want you to understand at this point is
the<00:01:20.130> cellular<00:01:20.790> events<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.689> are<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:21.840> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the cellular events that are going to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.890 
the cellular events that are going to
happen<00:01:22.350> right<00:01:23.100> here<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.570> stage

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
happen right here in this in this stage

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.830 
happen right here in this in this stage
called<00:01:25.229> mitosis<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.610> I'm<00:01:27.090> then<00:01:27.420> we're<00:01:27.689> going

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
called mitosis and I'm then we're going

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.929 
called mitosis and I'm then we're going
to<00:01:27.900> talk<00:01:28.140> about<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.890> events<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.490> happen<00:01:29.820> in

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
to talk about the events that happen in

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.830 
to talk about the events that happen in
the<00:01:30.680> cytokinesis<00:01:31.680> stage<00:01:32.400> all<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.540> stuff

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the cytokinesis stage all of this stuff

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.130 
the cytokinesis stage all of this stuff
the<00:01:34.350> interphase<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.210> phase<00:01:36.509> when<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
the interphase the the phase when the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.140 
the interphase the the phase when the
cell<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.380> not<00:01:37.680> actively<00:01:38.130> dividing<00:01:38.520> we've

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
cell is not actively dividing we've

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.760 
cell is not actively dividing we've
spent<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.540> lot<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.810> time<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.259> we'll<00:01:40.409> spend<00:01:40.680> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
spent a lot of time and we'll spend a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.530 
spent a lot of time and we'll spend a
lot<00:01:40.860> more<00:01:40.890> time<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.369> as<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:42.000> study<00:01:42.210> cell

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
lot more time on that as we study cell

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.539 
lot more time on that as we study cell
physiology<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:43.829> we<00:01:43.890> want<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.340> talk<00:01:44.490> about

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
physiology but now we want to talk about

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.569 
physiology but now we want to talk about
right<00:01:45.299> there<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:46.049> M<00:01:46.320> phase<00:01:46.619> what's<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.549> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
right there that M phase what's going to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.240 
right there that M phase what's going to
happen<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.270> want<00:01:48.450> two<00:01:48.509> cell<00:01:48.689> divides<00:01:49.250> later

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
happen to want two cell divides later

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.580 
happen to want two cell divides later
there'll<00:01:50.700> be<00:01:50.759> plenty<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.270> time<00:01:51.360> for<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> names

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
there'll be plenty of time for the names

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.340 
there'll be plenty of time for the names
of<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> phases<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.850> right<00:01:54.090> now<00:01:54.329> let's<00:01:55.110> see

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
of the phases but right now let's see

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.830 
of the phases but right now let's see
what<00:01:55.500> happens<00:01:55.950> okay<00:01:56.360> well<00:01:57.360> let's<00:01:57.540> quickly

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
what happens okay well let's quickly

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.719 
what happens okay well let's quickly
review<00:01:58.079> what's<00:01:58.770> up<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.070> chromosomes<00:01:59.549> what's

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
review what's up with chromosomes what's

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.980 
review what's up with chromosomes what's
a<00:01:59.790> chromosome<00:02:00.240> all<00:02:00.450> about

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
a chromosome all about

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.080 
a chromosome all about
remember<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.829> chromosomes<00:02:02.399> are<00:02:02.640> about

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
remember the chromosomes are about

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.980 
remember the chromosomes are about
packing<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.719> DNA<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.829> only<00:02:05.310> pack<00:02:05.579> DNA<00:02:06.060> into<00:02:06.960> a

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
packing of DNA you only pack DNA into a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.290 
packing of DNA you only pack DNA into a
chromosome<00:02:07.590> when<00:02:08.280> you're<00:02:08.550> going<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.060> do

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
chromosome when you're going to do

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.220 
chromosome when you're going to do
mitosis<00:02:10.080> mitosis<00:02:10.920> better<00:02:11.640> write<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:11.910> down

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
mitosis mitosis better write that down

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.500 
mitosis mitosis better write that down
sorry<00:02:13.230> guys<00:02:13.470> vocabulary<00:02:14.270> can't<00:02:15.270> speak

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
sorry guys vocabulary can't speak

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.199 
sorry guys vocabulary can't speak
without<00:02:15.660> vocabulary<00:02:16.349> alright<00:02:17.099> so<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:17.879> in<00:02:18.060> this

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
without vocabulary alright so so in this

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.180 
without vocabulary alright so so in this
mitotic<00:02:18.840> division<00:02:19.200> or<00:02:19.319> in<00:02:19.379> this<00:02:19.500> mitosis

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
mitotic division or in this mitosis

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.860 
mitotic division or in this mitosis
we're<00:02:20.550> going<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.819> form<00:02:21.030> chromosomes<00:02:21.599> and

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
we're going to form chromosomes and

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.710 
we're going to form chromosomes and
chromosomes<00:02:22.590> end<00:02:23.370> up<00:02:24.239> looking<00:02:24.540> like

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
chromosomes end up looking like

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.580 
chromosomes end up looking like
something<00:02:24.959> like<00:02:25.200> this

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.839 

and<00:02:28.590> let's<00:02:28.800> talk<00:02:29.040> about<00:02:29.099> what<00:02:29.819> makes

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
and let's talk about what makes

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.150 
and let's talk about what makes
something<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.660> chromosome<00:02:31.140> well<00:02:31.709> remember

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
something a chromosome well remember

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.550 
something a chromosome well remember
it's<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:32.519> it's<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.090> has<00:02:33.120> its<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.720> has<00:02:33.870> its<00:02:34.080> DNA

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
it's it's it's it has its it has its DNA

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.580 
it's it's it's it has its it has its DNA
and<00:02:34.830> its<00:02:35.400> DNA<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.849> packed<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.530> there's<00:02:37.530> a

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
and its DNA is packed and there's a

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.839 
and its DNA is packed and there's a
structure<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.459> chromosome<00:02:40.430> all<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.670> this

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
structure on that chromosome all of this

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.210 
structure on that chromosome all of this
would<00:02:42.180> be<00:02:42.330> one<00:02:42.629> molecule<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:43.260> DNA<00:02:43.319> all<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.129> way

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
would be one molecule of DNA all the way

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.350 
would be one molecule of DNA all the way
down<00:02:44.400> all<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.670> way<00:02:44.730> down<00:02:44.879> all<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.120> way<00:02:45.209> down

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
down all the way down all the way down

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.900 
down all the way down all the way down
all<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.540> way<00:02:45.629> down<00:02:45.840> all<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.050> way<00:02:46.110> down<00:02:46.730> yet<00:02:47.730> in

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
all the way down all the way down yet in

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.339 
all the way down all the way down yet in
the<00:02:48.060> center<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.660> chromosome<00:02:49.170> there's

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
the center of the chromosome there's

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.490 
the center of the chromosome there's
this<00:02:49.440> kind<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.830> pinched<00:02:50.580> in<00:02:50.760> section<00:02:51.330> and

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
this kind of pinched in section and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.570 
this kind of pinched in section and
that's<00:02:52.500> called<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.910> centromere<00:02:57.739> and<00:02:58.739> within

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
that's called the centromere and within

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.390 
that's called the centromere and within
the<00:02:59.879> centromere<00:03:00.599> is<00:03:00.750> going<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.980> very

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
the centromere is going to be a very

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.820 
the centromere is going to be a very
important<00:03:03.000> structure<00:03:03.300> okay<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.349> we'll<00:03:04.650> see

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
important structure okay and we'll see

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.649 
important structure okay and we'll see
why<00:03:05.069> it's<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.459> important<00:03:05.909> in<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.090> second<00:03:06.510> and

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
why it's so important in a second and

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.660 
why it's so important in a second and
that<00:03:07.349> is<00:03:07.379> going<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.739> be<00:03:07.890> called<00:03:08.159> the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
that is going to be called the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.960 
that is going to be called the
kinetochore<00:03:10.099> within<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.550> centromere<00:03:13.970> the

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
kinetochore within the centromere the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.960 
kinetochore within the centromere the
kinetic<00:03:15.450> or<00:03:15.980> kinetic<00:03:16.980> energy<00:03:17.400> starting<00:03:17.909> to

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
kinetic or kinetic energy starting to

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.920 
kinetic or kinetic energy starting to
think<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.209> might<00:03:18.300> have<00:03:18.450> something<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.750> do<00:03:18.840> with

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
think it might have something to do with

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.600 
think it might have something to do with
motion<00:03:19.200> right<00:03:19.560> well<00:03:20.040> if<00:03:20.159> you're<00:03:20.310> thinking

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
motion right well if you're thinking

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.280 
motion right well if you're thinking
that<00:03:20.700> you're<00:03:20.849> absolutely<00:03:21.180> correct<00:03:21.810> alrighty

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
that you're absolutely correct alrighty

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.330 
that you're absolutely correct alrighty
so<00:03:22.769> so<00:03:23.129> what<00:03:23.700> what<00:03:24.409> mitosis<00:03:25.409> is<00:03:25.530> about<00:03:25.799> number

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
so so what what mitosis is about number

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.280 
so so what what mitosis is about number
one<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:26.610> forming<00:03:27.000> chromosomes<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.599> just<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.230> I

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
one is forming chromosomes and just so I

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.660 
one is forming chromosomes and just so I
can<00:03:28.470> show<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.680> they<00:03:28.860> they<00:03:28.980> really<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.519> can

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
can show you they they really you can

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.520 
can show you they they really you can
form<00:03:29.909> chromosomes<00:03:30.360> in<00:03:30.540> three<00:03:30.750> different<00:03:30.959> ways

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
form chromosomes in three different ways

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.320 
form chromosomes in three different ways
the<00:03:31.799> centromere<00:03:32.370> doesn't<00:03:32.760> always<00:03:32.879> have<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.239> be

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
the centromere doesn't always have to be

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.229 
the centromere doesn't always have to be
in<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.569> center<00:03:34.019> okay<00:03:34.879> this<00:03:35.879> one<00:03:36.120> in

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
in the center okay this one in

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.660 
in the center okay this one in
particular<00:03:36.390> has<00:03:36.980> its<00:03:37.980> chromosome<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.580> the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
particular has its chromosome in the

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.690 
particular has its chromosome in the
sent<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.330> center<00:03:39.690> but<00:03:40.170> some<00:03:40.409> can<00:03:40.590> be

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
sent in the center but some can be

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.470 
sent in the center but some can be
off-center<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:43.290> indeed<00:03:43.920> some<00:03:44.849> can<00:03:45.180> be<00:03:45.299> at

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
off-center and and indeed some can be at

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.890 
off-center and and indeed some can be at
the<00:03:45.629> very<00:03:45.810> top<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.379> the<00:03:46.650> chromosome<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:48.540> anyway

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
the very top of the chromosome so anyway

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.680 
the very top of the chromosome so anyway
we<00:03:49.049> these<00:03:49.860> these<00:03:50.159> three<00:03:50.549> chromosomes<00:03:51.239> the

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
we these these three chromosomes the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.039 
we these these three chromosomes the
this<00:03:51.930> metacentric<00:03:52.920> chromosome<00:03:53.730> this<00:03:54.299> akhrot

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
this metacentric chromosome this akhrot

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.920 
this metacentric chromosome this akhrot
centric<00:03:55.830> chromosome<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:56.970> Tilo<00:03:57.480> centric

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
centric chromosome and this Tilo centric

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.530 
centric chromosome and this Tilo centric
chromosome<00:03:58.379> all<00:03:58.920> have<00:03:59.280> their<00:03:59.790> centromeres<00:04:00.269> in

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
chromosome all have their centromeres in

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.149 
chromosome all have their centromeres in
different<00:04:00.810> places<00:04:01.019> but<00:04:01.530> that's<00:04:01.680> not<00:04:01.980> as

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
different places but that's not as

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.750 
different places but that's not as
important<00:04:02.610> as<00:04:02.700> what's<00:04:03.090> going<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.330> happen<00:04:03.780> here

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
important as what's going to happen here

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.160 
important as what's going to happen here
what's<00:04:05.760> going<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.000> happen<00:04:06.420> is<00:04:06.750> going<00:04:07.049> to

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
what's going to happen is going to

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.830 
what's going to happen is going to
evolve<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.920> kinetochore<00:04:08.489> now<00:04:08.700> once<00:04:09.569> again<00:04:09.810> I

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
evolve the kinetochore now once again I

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.660 
evolve the kinetochore now once again I
want<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.260> think<00:04:10.470> about<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.830> concept<00:04:11.489> of

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
want you to think about the concept of

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.509 
want you to think about the concept of
mitosis<00:04:12.239> rather<00:04:13.230> than<00:04:13.500> memorizing<00:04:13.950> phases

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
mitosis rather than memorizing phases

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.080 
mitosis rather than memorizing phases
what's<00:04:15.480> your<00:04:15.659> job<00:04:15.900> what's<00:04:16.739> your<00:04:16.889> goal<00:04:17.160> if

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
what's your job what's your goal if

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.699 
what's your job what's your goal if
these<00:04:18.419> are<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.630> chromosomes<00:04:19.290> in<00:04:19.530> their

these are the chromosomes in their
doubled<00:04:20.070> form<00:04:20.370> what<00:04:20.850> is<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.329> want<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.660> do

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
doubled form what is it you want to do

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.810 
doubled form what is it you want to do
with<00:04:21.959> these<00:04:22.109> chromosomes<00:04:22.500> if<00:04:22.889> you're<00:04:23.340> a<00:04:23.370> cell

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
with these chromosomes if you're a cell

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.420 
with these chromosomes if you're a cell
remember<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.720> purpose<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:25.199> mitosis<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.919> form

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
remember the purpose of mitosis to form

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.900 
remember the purpose of mitosis to form
an<00:04:26.550> ident

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
an ident

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.680

to<00:04:27.000> go<00:04:27.150> copy<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:28.340> therefore<00:04:29.340> your<00:04:29.850> role<00:04:30.180> is<00:04:30.480> to

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
to go copy and therefore your role is to

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.170 
to go copy and therefore your role is to
get<00:04:31.050> these<00:04:31.260> chromosomes<00:04:31.710> so<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.550> you<00:04:32.970> have

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
get these chromosomes so that you have

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.540 
get these chromosomes so that you have
half<00:04:34.170> of<00:04:34.410> those<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:34.890> you<00:04:35.130> you<00:04:35.370> can

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
half of those so that you you can

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.520 
half of those so that you you can
actually<00:04:35.730> have<00:04:36.180> them<00:04:36.480> so<00:04:37.110> because<00:04:37.380> they're

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
actually have them so because they're

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.010 
actually have them so because they're
doubled<00:04:37.890> and<00:04:38.070> then<00:04:38.610> split<00:04:38.910> them<00:04:39.000> that's<00:04:39.750> all

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
doubled and then split them that's all

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.240 
doubled and then split them that's all
it<00:04:40.260> is<00:04:40.290> we<00:04:41.040> double<00:04:41.660> we<00:04:42.660> split<00:04:42.960> we<00:04:43.680> double<00:04:44.040> we

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
it is we double we split we double we

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.160 
it is we double we split we double we
split<00:04:44.550> we<00:04:44.820> double<00:04:45.210> we<00:04:45.300> split<00:04:45.540> that's<00:04:45.720> all<00:04:45.960> you

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
split we double we split that's all you

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.680 
split we double we split that's all you
do<00:04:46.350> your<00:04:46.650> whole<00:04:46.830> life<00:04:47.220> okay<00:04:47.760> with<00:04:48.150> yourselves

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
do your whole life okay with yourselves

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.630 
do your whole life okay with yourselves
well<00:04:50.360> that<00:04:51.360> doesn't<00:04:51.540> sound<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:51.960> hard<00:04:52.080> and

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
well that doesn't sound so hard and

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.100 
well that doesn't sound so hard and
really<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:54.300> whole<00:04:54.570> idea<00:04:55.020> of<00:04:55.080> mitosis<00:04:57.110> phases

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
really the whole idea of mitosis phases

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.170 
really the whole idea of mitosis phases
aside<00:04:58.500> is<00:04:59.270> more<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:01.050> more<00:05:01.560> a<00:05:01.850> concept<00:05:02.850> of<00:05:03.030> what

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
aside is more the more a concept of what

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.490 
aside is more the more a concept of what
happens<00:05:03.510> in<00:05:03.720> your<00:05:03.960> in<00:05:04.200> your<00:05:04.820> cells<00:05:05.820> and<00:05:06.210> your

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
happens in your in your cells and your

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.930 
happens in your in your cells and your

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
cytoskeleton and in your cytosol than

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.100 
cytoskeleton and in your cytosol than
what<00:05:09.090> happens<00:05:09.390> to<00:05:09.480> your<00:05:09.570> chromosomes<00:05:09.960> because

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
what happens to your chromosomes because

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.720 
what happens to your chromosomes because
that's<00:05:10.350> very<00:05:10.470> important<00:05:10.980> I<00:05:11.100> want<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.460> talk<00:05:11.610> to

that's very important I want to talk to

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.670 
that's very important I want to talk to
you<00:05:11.790> a<00:05:11.820> little<00:05:11.940> bit<00:05:12.150> about<00:05:12.270> how<00:05:13.170> chromosomes

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
you a little bit about how chromosomes

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.540 
you a little bit about how chromosomes
move<00:05:14.400> there's<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.270> magic<00:05:15.690> of<00:05:15.840> mitosis

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
move there's the magic of mitosis

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:25.870 
move there's the magic of mitosis
chromosomal<00:05:17.550> movement

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880
