00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.830
 a very bitter defeat today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.660
 against about 18 99 on my you can 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.099
 the whole thing already really in 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.099
 Summarize words that happened today 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.660
 earn much more today 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.340
 very annoying how do you have the support 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.050
 today also perceived by the fans 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.119
 after the game there was applause, of course 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.840
 Talk to you because you just have 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.300
 The fans today fought brutally today 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.760
 were just great 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.630
 We missed the last ones 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.390
 weeks 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.160
 I am super happy that I do not know 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.190
 What happened there but I'm glad 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.000
 if our club and the fans themselves 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.059
 have agreed 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.449
 It was just Hanover 96 today 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.059
 Thanks the coach a 1 2 defeat 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.239
 against hoffmann how does your analysis fall 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.890
 of the game too soon after the final whistle 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.020
 first time in this frame 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.120
 Giant compliment to the public one has 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.840
 yes heard a lot and I'm only four 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.220
 days here 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.600
 It was a great support 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.140
 that was the way it was for me 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.369
 could imagine so in the ideal case and 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.650
 I believe neither audience nor 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.060
 Team today really deserves here 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.299
 to leave the place as a loser 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.700
 I believe that the team is just 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.979
 after the offside gate after 3 35 seconds 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.750
 I mean that's complicated yes 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.720
 because i mean i have all these things 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.640
 even as a player you experienced that 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.450
 really does the four and gets it 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.430
 so in arrears 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.450
 because the teams produced a reaction 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.060
 that was for me that was 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.590
 to see the most important thing in the game 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.960
 for a mentality what kind of a 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.369
 morale that was absolutely intact and me 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.270
 think out the back in the second 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.430
 halfway we had three four 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 opportunities to win the game 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.509
 and unfortunately it is so that 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.310
 Hope home is also able to 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.340
 your quality then a reasonable 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.840
 attack that they did 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.229
 and it is bitter for the team 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.210
 but I have it right after the game 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.610
 said that if we continue the way 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.800
 go that we keep the class 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.509
 would you tell our hunger what? 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.800
 exactly you have chosen for words 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.750
 the final whistle in the round 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.810
 I said so first because that 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.820
 audience yes then again starts to 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.180
 clap that she deserves it 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.460
 to have 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.320
 through a performance and that would be me 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.200
 not a gift but a through 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.360
 a good really intense game 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.800
 and I believe that everyone 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.960
 has seen that the decision 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.640
 team wanted and I say this also 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.840
 deserved and I have 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.160
 They gave them away , that they did 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.520
 that they really thank you 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.230
 audience that they look simple 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.030
 that the audience that the team 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.220
 is intact and that we are in the right place 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.220
 direction go trainer heartfelt thanks
