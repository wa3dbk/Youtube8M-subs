00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.710
 no no 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.400
 we started with the questions when 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.690
 you believe 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.470
 Goodnight 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.170
 but 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.000
 hi Alberto 10 I wanted to ask you about 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.829
 cabral and if he knows anything because he had very 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.690
 bad looks the picture on television is 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.720
 a sprain first in first 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.850
 place 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.330
 it does not seem like a serious choice 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.130
 we will wait for studies but a priori 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.880
 it seems to be just a twist that 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.880
 ends in a sprain 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.750
 yes good night mister behind marcelo 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.420
 cooperative radio of chile wanted to know 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.650
 if orellana or infiltrated if you are going to have 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.150
 that play involved the following 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.190
 matches and how he saw him and on the other hand 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.780
 if you do not believe that the tuco hernández has 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.180
 still a lot to improve in terms of 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.440
 offensive contribution gentlemen is no longer a 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.940
 infiltrated by that in the entrance in 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.640
 heat did not overcome the pain then 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.130
 I need an infiltration to the aesthetics 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.430
 I think with respect to hernández 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.530
 team lacked offensive weight but it's not 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.619
 a problem of a soccer player also me 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.590
 he really liked his performance is one because 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:28.160
 It gives us great solidity and today it seems to me that 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.250
 had a performance to highlight me 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.560
 liked how he played offensively gives me the 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.620
 feeling that if we missed but we 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.450
 the whole team lacked depth 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.550
 especially in the first part where the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.200
 ball circulated in our favor or between 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.020
 we better in the second 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.000
 against Madrid he needed very little 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.610
 to close the game and escape in the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.620
 marker 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.840
 well there's no your right there's no 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.840
 another rejón of the chain being around here 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.880
 I wanted to ask what image is left of the 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.410
 party if you think you have done a good 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.770
 match your team and if you go from just or 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.770
 not the result 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.880
 If the result seems to me that I do not know if 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.619
 it was for three goals but Madrid in 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.800
 account for situations of goal that 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.820
 let's win the match 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.770
 we do not create much danger and 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.380
 I continuously believe that the position of 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.200
 first time I need more depth 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.430
 in attack to generate situations the 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.260
 goal destabilizes the game puts it 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.230
 side to madrid and then in two losses 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.930
 of exit of the ball the madrid finds 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.820
 two goals and close the game we knew 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.740
 if we know about the danger and the 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.660
 forcefulness of losing that kind of 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.700
 values ​​against an attack like that of the 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.170
 Real Madrid 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.610
 unfortunately they got lost it seems to me 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.840
 that the party also has a before and 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.460
 after the first goal the first goal 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.280
 change the procedure when we had been 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.720
 it seems to me a team that recovered very 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.880
 well the ball and that played in the field 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.550
 rival with 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.330
 fluidity without depth yes but 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.980
 taking over the game and the goal changes 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.160
 the course of the game and then two 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.640
 losses make us receive more punishment to 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.490
 the best in goals than the situation 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.970
 is or the domain of real madrid can 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.690
 mark but the victory of real madrid 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.690
 of just 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.719
 francais Garre here to have Radio 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.700
 reiterated now the importance of 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:30.620
 first goal is a penalty I do not know if the 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.359
 his players have told him how they have 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.040
 seen have protested a lot at the time 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.719
 what do you think and what 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.389
 sensations leaves I have not seen it 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:40.459
 I'll play they say it was not and in front of 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.819
 the referee's failures never never me 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.819
 I mean 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.610
 any more questions 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.610
 thanks to the night
