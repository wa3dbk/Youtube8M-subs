00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
computer I mean it's it does all the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.609 
computer I mean it's it does all the
normal<00:01:27.420> stuff<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.900> expect<00:01:28.259> only<00:01:28.380> thing

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.899 
the same thing
right<00:01:37.979> because<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.310> still<00:01:38.490> run<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> same

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
right because you can still run the same

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.539 
right because you can still run the same
thing<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.299> 8<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.049> 7<00:01:40.590> you're<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.920> going

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
thing on 8 so on 7 you're just going

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.649 
thing on 8 so on 7 you're just going
with<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> Start<00:01:41.970> menu<00:01:42.270> right<00:01:42.479> you're<00:01:42.570> gonna

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
with the Start menu right you're gonna

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.359 
with the Start menu right you're gonna
be<00:01:42.780> running<00:01:42.869> steam<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.439> thing<00:01:43.560> anyway<00:01:43.799> so

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
be running steam on this thing anyway so

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.679 
be running steam on this thing anyway so
that's<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.820> good<00:01:44.970> point<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.479> really

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
that's a good point so it is really

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.300 
that's a good point so it is really
mattered<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.110> yeah<00:01:46.229> yes<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.890> yeah<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
mattered it yeah yes so yeah the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.380 
mattered it yeah yes so yeah the
operating<00:01:47.700> sister's<00:01:47.970> kind<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.149> gets<00:01:48.270> out<00:01:48.360> of

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
operating sister's kind of gets out of

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.130 
operating sister's kind of gets out of
the<00:01:48.509> way<00:01:48.630> yeah

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
the way yeah

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.719 
the way yeah
so<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.740> only<00:01:49.920> thing<00:01:50.159> now<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.369> could<00:01:50.670> probably

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
so the only thing now I could probably

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.460 
so the only thing now I could probably
show<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.119> that's<00:01:51.479> probably<00:01:52.170> really

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
show you that's probably really

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.109 
show you that's probably really
important<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> games<00:01:53.399> what<00:01:53.820> does<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.000> look

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
important is the games what does it look

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.690 
important is the games what does it look
like<00:01:54.270> how<00:01:54.479> does<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.659> perform<00:01:55.130> 1080p<00:01:56.130> at<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.369> 14

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
like how does it perform 1080p at a 14

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.370 
like how does it perform 1080p at a 14
inch<00:01:56.820> screen<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.240> very<00:01:57.570> high<00:01:57.840> dots<00:01:58.110> per<00:01:58.350> inch

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
inch screen is a very high dots per inch

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.959 
inch screen is a very high dots per inch
very<00:01:58.829> high<00:01:59.009> something<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> game

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
very high something this is a game

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.389 
very high something this is a game
called<00:02:00.000> company<00:02:00.540> Heroes<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.229> an<00:02:01.290> RTS<00:02:01.829> do<00:02:02.310> you

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
called company Heroes it's an RTS do you

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.249 
called company Heroes it's an RTS do you
find<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.759> annoying<00:02:03.000> how<00:02:03.299> bright<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.600> alien

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
find it annoying how bright that alien

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.300 
find it annoying how bright that alien
wearing<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.770> almost<00:02:04.920> looks<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.189> it's

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
wearing is it almost looks like it's

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.330 
wearing is it almost looks like it's
part<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> yeah

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
part of the yeah

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.729 
part of the yeah
it<00:02:06.640> kind<00:02:07.210> of<00:02:07.270> gets<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.200> way<00:02:08.289> I<00:02:08.319> don't<00:02:08.590> want

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
it kind of gets in the way I don't want

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:09.990 
it kind of gets in the way I don't want
to<00:02:08.800> see<00:02:08.950> their<00:02:09.130> branding<00:02:09.550> I've<00:02:09.640> covered<00:02:09.880> that

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
to see their branding I've covered that

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.410 
to see their branding I've covered that
up<00:02:10.380> but<00:02:11.380> this<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:11.739> pretty<00:02:12.099> much<00:02:12.220> how<00:02:12.489> this<00:02:13.270> is

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
up but this is pretty much how this is

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.150 
up but this is pretty much how this is
company<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.870> heroes<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:14.530> could<00:02:14.680> see<00:02:14.860> that

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
company of heroes and you could see that

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.280 
company of heroes and you could see that
performance-wise<00:02:16.020> went<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.110> this<00:02:17.170> is

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
performance-wise went and this is

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.770 
performance-wise went and this is
running<00:02:17.530> about<00:02:17.590> medium<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.520> high<00:02:18.849> settings<00:02:19.450> on

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
running about medium to high settings on

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.920 
running about medium to high settings on
the<00:02:19.870> game<00:02:20.050> playing<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:20.950> game<00:02:21.099> is<00:02:21.310> not<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:21.970> 60

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
the game playing this game is not is 60

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.390 
the game playing this game is not is 60
frames<00:02:23.140> per<00:02:23.230> second<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:23.890> can<00:02:24.099> see<00:02:24.250> that

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
frames per second so you can see that

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.870 
frames per second so you can see that
it's<00:02:24.580> not<00:02:24.700> really<00:02:24.880> all<00:02:25.209> that<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:26.319> know<00:02:26.880> crazy

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
it's not really all that you know crazy

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.130 
it's not really all that you know crazy
and<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.269> hardware<00:02:28.599> now<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:28.810> could<00:02:29.019> probably

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
and the hardware now you could probably

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.220 
and the hardware now you could probably
run<00:02:29.349> some<00:02:29.560> first-person<00:02:30.489> shooters<00:02:30.790> like

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
run some first-person shooters like

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.750 
run some first-person shooters like
battlefield<00:02:32.230> 4<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.620> all<00:02:32.680> that<00:02:32.830> stuff<00:02:33.099> but

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
battlefield 4 and all that stuff but

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.520 
battlefield 4 and all that stuff but
here's<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.480> here's<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.900> score<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.290> we<00:02:35.380> got

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
here's the here's the score that we got

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.680 
here's the here's the score that we got
a<00:02:35.800> running<00:02:36.430> 3d<00:02:36.670> mark<00:02:36.910> which<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.209> probably<00:02:37.630> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
a running 3d mark which is probably the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.449 
a running 3d mark which is probably the
most<00:02:37.840> important<00:02:38.140> thing<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.290> want<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.530> know<00:02:38.620> so

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
most important thing you want to know so

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.750 
most important thing you want to know so
this<00:02:39.700> right<00:02:40.239> here<00:02:40.299> ran<00:02:40.690> about<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.989> 59<00:02:41.590> 47<00:02:42.340> so

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
this right here ran about a 59 47 so

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.550 
this right here ran about a 59 47 so
this<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:43.030> just<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.600> little<00:02:44.080> bit<00:02:44.170> higher<00:02:44.350> than

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
this is just a little bit higher than

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.259 
this is just a little bit higher than
your<00:02:44.680> typical<00:02:44.830> gaming<00:02:45.580> laptop<00:02:45.940> that's<00:02:46.120> the

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
your typical gaming laptop that's the

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.720 
your typical gaming laptop that's the
that's<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.569> orange<00:02:47.280> orange<00:02:48.280> bar<00:02:48.519> right<00:02:48.610> here

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
that's the orange orange bar right here

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.460 
that's the orange orange bar right here
so<00:02:48.850> it's<00:02:48.970> about<00:02:49.090> 19%<00:02:49.480> better<00:02:49.959> in<00:02:50.080> most<00:02:50.290> gaming

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
so it's about 19% better in most gaming

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.900 
so it's about 19% better in most gaming
laptops<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:50.980> are<00:02:51.130> out<00:02:51.220> there<00:02:51.250> running<00:02:51.489> 3d

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
laptops that are out there running 3d

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.720 
laptops that are out there running 3d
mark<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:54.010> that's<00:02:54.160> really<00:02:54.370> pretty<00:02:54.489> good

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
mark and so that's really pretty good

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.460 
mark and so that's really pretty good
considering<00:02:55.420> all<00:02:55.690> that's<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:55.989> here<00:02:56.140> now<00:02:56.260> I

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
considering all that's in here now I

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.570 
considering all that's in here now I
haven't<00:02:56.830> really<00:02:56.980> got<00:02:57.099> a<00:02:57.130> chance<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.430> talk

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
haven't really got a chance to talk

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.650 
haven't really got a chance to talk
about<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.819> specs<00:02:58.030> ones<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.239> can<00:02:58.330> run<00:02:58.480> through

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
about the specs ones you can run through

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.809 
about the specs ones you can run through
it<00:02:58.750> real<00:02:58.870> quick<00:02:59.049> ok<00:02:59.380> this<00:02:59.500> has<00:02:59.650> an<00:02:59.830> i7<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.670> has

it real quick ok this has an i7 this has

most part this laptop

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.809 
most part this laptop
it<00:03:26.290> can<00:03:26.440> run<00:03:26.590> pretty<00:03:26.739> much<00:03:26.950> most<00:03:27.220> games<00:03:27.519> that

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
it can run pretty much most games that

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.610 
it can run pretty much most games that
you'd<00:03:28.180> expect<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:28.569> to<00:03:28.600> run<00:03:28.780> on<00:03:28.900> here<00:03:29.079> now<00:03:29.290> is<00:03:29.470> it

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
you'd expect it to run on here now is it

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.400 
you'd expect it to run on here now is it
dedicated<00:03:29.859> graphics<00:03:30.340> or<00:03:31.269> motherboard<00:03:32.260> you

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
dedicated graphics or motherboard you

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.199 
dedicated graphics or motherboard you
know<00:03:32.500> iris<00:03:32.799> graphics<00:03:32.950> what<00:03:33.549> is<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.730> GeForce

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
know iris graphics what is the GeForce

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.240 
know iris graphics what is the GeForce
it<00:03:34.359> says<00:03:34.590> GTX<00:03:35.850> 760<00:03:36.850> v<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.600> it<00:03:38.590> runs<00:03:39.040> really

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
it says GTX 760 v and it runs really

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.490 
it says GTX 760 v and it runs really
well<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.579> mean<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.239> I'm<00:03:40.690> gonna<00:03:41.019> go<00:03:41.109> back<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.380> this

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
well I mean it I'm gonna go back to this

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.110 
well I mean it I'm gonna go back to this
game<00:03:41.709> again<00:03:42.010> this<00:03:42.400> hopefully<00:03:42.819> could<00:03:42.940> show

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
game again this hopefully could show

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.849 
game again this hopefully could show
some<00:03:43.329> more<00:03:43.450> demos<00:03:43.630> on<00:03:43.930> some<00:03:44.560> of<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.680> stuff

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
some more demos on some of the stuff

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.650 
some more demos on some of the stuff
here<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.040> probably<00:03:45.370> wanna<00:03:46.299> see<00:03:46.420> if<00:03:46.480> I<00:03:46.540> could

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
here you probably wanna see if I could

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.360 
here you probably wanna see if I could
be<00:03:46.720> somewhere<00:03:46.930> zooming<00:03:47.350> in<00:03:47.440> here<00:03:47.620> but<00:03:47.829> yeah

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
be somewhere zooming in here but yeah

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.740 
be somewhere zooming in here but yeah
this<00:03:48.549> is<00:03:48.670> just<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.910> bunch<00:03:49.060> of<00:03:49.180> Units<00:03:49.510> moving

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
this is just a bunch of Units moving

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.819 
this is just a bunch of Units moving
around<00:03:49.840> see<00:03:50.170> if<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.290> could<00:03:50.410> target<00:03:50.560> something

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
around see if I could target something

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.090 
around see if I could target something
here<00:03:51.209> yeah<00:03:52.209> so<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.600> can<00:03:52.720> see<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:53.100> that's

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
here yeah so you can see that that's

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.650 
here yeah so you can see that that's
really<00:03:54.549> not<00:03:54.670> so<00:03:54.880> he's<00:03:55.090> gonna<00:03:55.209> super

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
really not so he's gonna super

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.569 
really not so he's gonna super
challenging<00:03:56.200> yeah<00:03:56.440> it's<00:03:56.620> not<00:03:56.769> challenging<00:03:57.400> J

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
challenging yeah it's not challenging J

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.129 
challenging yeah it's not challenging J
in<00:03:57.730> terms<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:58.090> like<00:03:58.209> pushing<00:03:58.450> its<00:03:58.630> performance

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
in terms of like pushing its performance

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.280 
in terms of like pushing its performance
but<00:03:59.769> in<00:04:00.760> terms<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.180> running<00:04:01.329> 3d<00:04:01.720> mark<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.170> all

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
but in terms of running 3d mark and all

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.539 
but in terms of running 3d mark and all
the<00:04:02.380> other<00:04:02.530> first-person<00:04:03.040> shooters<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.370> you

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
the other first-person shooters that you

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.309 
the other first-person shooters that you
essentially<00:04:04.269> yeah<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:04.690> benchmarks<00:04:05.109> are<00:04:05.200> good

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
essentially yeah the benchmarks are good

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.050 
essentially yeah the benchmarks are good
I'd<00:04:05.680> expect<00:04:06.100> that<00:04:06.160> from<00:04:06.340> Alienware<00:04:06.850> now

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
I'd expect that from Alienware now

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.120 
I'd expect that from Alienware now
where's<00:04:07.359> the<00:04:07.480> question<00:04:07.870> right<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.590> clearly

want to make that logo because of the

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.159 
want to make that logo because of the
name<00:04:15.730> how<00:04:16.150> much<00:04:16.330> more<00:04:16.599> is<00:04:16.720> is<00:04:16.870> what<00:04:16.989> how<00:04:17.049> much

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
name how much more is is what how much

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.930 
name how much more is is what how much
is<00:04:17.320> this<00:04:17.440> less<00:04:17.620> so<00:04:17.769> we<00:04:17.979> have<00:04:18.099> the<00:04:18.489> price<00:04:18.700> range

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
is this less so we have the price range

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.039 
is this less so we have the price range
starts<00:04:19.239> at<00:04:19.359> 10<00:04:19.539> 99

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
starts at 10 99

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.809 
starts at 10 99
ends<00:04:20.349> up<00:04:20.530> at<00:04:20.620> 59<00:04:21.159> that's<00:04:21.340> not<00:04:21.489> bad<00:04:21.639> as

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:21.819 
ends up at 59 that's not bad as

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.960 
ends up at 59 that's not bad as
configured<00:04:22.360> as<00:04:22.449> pin<00:04:22.629> 99<00:04:23.280> this<00:04:24.280> one<00:04:24.520> right<00:04:24.639> here

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
configured as pin 99 this one right here

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.640 
configured as pin 99 this one right here
particular<00:04:25.750> configuration<00:04:26.349> this<00:04:26.470> one's

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
particular configuration this one's

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.290 
particular configuration this one's
$15.99<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:27.430> this<00:04:27.550> is<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.699> higher-end<00:04:28.120> one

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
$15.99 so this is the higher-end one

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.629 
$15.99 so this is the higher-end one
okay<00:04:28.659> this<00:04:28.840> comes<00:04:29.050> with<00:04:29.229> 16<00:04:29.530> gigs<00:04:29.710> of<00:04:29.830> ram<00:04:30.039> as<00:04:30.460> a
