 he thinks that working his whole life 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:28.110
 can give a better future did you know 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.730
 that after 40 years of work the 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.010
 statistics indicate that people 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.880
 ends as follows 1% rich 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.440
 financially independent 4% 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.200
 let's see how the 95 percent is 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:50.520
 remaining still working 5 percent 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:53.579
 dead 36 percent bankrupt 54 per 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.850
 hundred in which group would you like to be 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.120
 in five percent or 95 percent 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.399
 percent that 5 percent has as common 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.040
 denominator that they own their own 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.440
 business agrees that its 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.500
 probability of success is much higher 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.360
 if you own your own 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.430
 I imagine that you do not want to move to 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.390
 be part of those who run 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.520
 after the money currently the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.220
 stress has determined the quality of life 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.270
 and the health of people if you do not believe it 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.220
 I observed the following 50 percent of 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.070
 the deaths is due to attacks to the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.390
 heart that curiously most 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.850
 occur on Monday of the other 50 the 33 by 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.250
 hundred die for cancer these 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.430
 diseases are modern and grow in 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.460
 alarmingly they will be related to 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.610
 pace of modern life pressures 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.190
 economic will include to understand the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.930
 origin of this problem is necessary 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.330
 understand what is happening in the 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.330
 global economy and how it affects us 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.860
 we've heard a lot about the 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.950
 globalization the truth is that it is 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.670
 imminent success their entrepreneurs 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:16.490
 they warn about the rich are every 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.980
 become richer and there are more and more poor people 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.530
 in his latest book by Robert Kiyosaki and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.260
 donald trump titled we want you to be 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.010
 rich expose to detail as the class 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.320
 media is disappearing and exposing the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.500
 importance of preparing us to operate in 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.930
 this new era there is a fall 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.420
 inevitable in the quality of life and of 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.270
 Gradually we see how economically 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.870
 the middle class is mainly 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.870
 affected 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.680
 but because the class is disappearing 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.440
 mean we are aware of the alarming 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.040
 fall of jobs and the crisis derived from 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.320
 this industry now no longer want 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.600
 hire fixed seats so 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.820
 tend to outsource to companies that 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.700
 they offer the same service to minors 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.280
 cost but they are not companies in our 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.610
 country the big consortiums in india 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.940
 Malaysian philippines are absorbing the 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.940
 most of the market what about the 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.580
 mergers that are very fashionable after the 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.459
 unification of two or more companies that is 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.370
 the first thing that you cut or the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.800
 mentioned regenieries that are each 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.290
 more common times that is nothing other than 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:38.060
 evaluate and simplify work in 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.190
 less personal and automations the 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.350
 technology supplies more and more jobs 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.910
 how many companies have not gone to the 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.510
 bankruptcy due to the penetration of 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.930
 china products taiwan korea 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.790
 thailand singapore in our markets 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.710
 what about medical safety and 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.410
 pensions offered for a job 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.300
 traditional experts talk about 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.840
 strong reductions in these 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.790
 benefits even in some countries 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.790
 there is talk of a possible technical bankruptcy 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.370
 it is amazing and alarming that nowadays 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.109
 only 20 percent of graduates 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.900
 of the universities is at 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.660
 work and more delicate is that 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.820
 salaries mostly do not allow them or 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.810
 even recover the expenses of his 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:34.680
 tuition is why the expert of 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.510
 business Robert Kyosaki says the advice 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.110
 more dangerous that you can give to a 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.150
 boy today is go to school take out 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.680
 good grades and looking for a job 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.740
 safe 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.350
 adding all these elements we understand 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.930
 why the middle class tends to 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.639
 disappear as more and more 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.770
 people who are facing this 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.740
 situation and that's why I 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.690
 we share this opportunity to avoid 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.050
 that is a victim more of the 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.169
 trends that we mentioned in the 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.750
 world there are two types of people 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.970
 who work for the money and those who 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.460
 they make money work for them 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.160
 if they want the money to work for 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.310
 you invite him to get in touch 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:24.229
