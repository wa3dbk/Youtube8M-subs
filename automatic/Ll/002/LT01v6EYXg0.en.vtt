00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
needle now mattress stitch is my

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.810 
needle now mattress stitch is my
favorite<00:00:16.320> way<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.500> seem<00:00:17.070> items<00:00:17.609> together

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
favorite way to seem items together

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.760 
favorite way to seem items together
because<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.539> creates<00:00:18.840> virtually<00:00:19.529> an

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
because it creates virtually an

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.390 
because it creates virtually an
invisible<00:00:20.430> seem<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.900> go<00:00:22.619> ahead<00:00:22.740> thread<00:00:23.250> your

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
invisible seem so go ahead thread your

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.210 
invisible seem so go ahead thread your
tapestry<00:00:23.460> needle<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.500> lay<00:00:25.500> your<00:00:25.740> two<00:00:25.980> pieces

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
tapestry needle and lay your two pieces

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.089 
tapestry needle and lay your two pieces
side<00:00:26.970> by<00:00:27.180> side<00:00:27.449> with<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.199> right<00:00:28.619> side<00:00:28.890> facing

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
side by side with the right side facing

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.950 
side by side with the right side facing
out<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.760> you're<00:00:29.910> always<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.599> see<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
out so you're always going to see the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.780 
out so you're always going to see the
right<00:00:31.230> side<00:00:31.560> while<00:00:31.980> you're<00:00:32.130> working<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
right side while you're working the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.270 
right side while you're working the
mattress<00:00:33.210> stitch<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.559> idea<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.250> to

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
mattress stitch and the idea is to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.370 
mattress stitch and the idea is to
basically<00:00:35.700> pull<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.630> two<00:00:36.780> pieces<00:00:36.809> together

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
basically pull the two pieces together

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.600 
basically pull the two pieces together
and<00:00:37.860> create<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.670> completely<00:00:39.210> invisible<00:00:39.930> seem

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
and create a completely invisible seem

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.150 
and create a completely invisible seem
so<00:00:41.610> along<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.390> edge<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:42.800> you're<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:44.040> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
so along the edge here you're going to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.490 
so along the edge here you're going to
work<00:00:44.820> from<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.210> bottom<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.809> top<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
work from the bottom to the top and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.380 
work from the bottom to the top and
you're<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.489> choose<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.000> either<00:00:48.149> work

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
you're going to choose to either work

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.770 
you're going to choose to either work
half<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.870> stitch<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.110> or<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:50.370> full<00:00:50.820> stitch<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.420> now

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
half a stitch in or a full stitch in now

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.209 
half a stitch in or a full stitch in now
these<00:00:51.899> instructions<00:00:52.559> are<00:00:52.710> for<00:00:52.890> when<00:00:53.100> you're

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
these instructions are for when you're

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.619 
these instructions are for when you're
joining<00:00:54.050> stockinette<00:00:55.050> stitch<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:56.600> which<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
joining stockinette stitch so which is

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.810 
joining stockinette stitch so which is
typically<00:00:58.079> where<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.980> mattress

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
typically where you see this mattress

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.610 
typically where you see this mattress
stitch<00:01:00.180> used<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.050> does<00:01:01.199> create<00:01:01.410> an

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
stitch used because it does create an

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.600 
stitch used because it does create an
invisible<00:01:02.070> seem<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.710> we're<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.369> start

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
invisible seem so we're going to start

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.840 
invisible seem so we're going to start
at<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> bottom<00:01:06.110> just<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.950> get<00:01:08.430> our<00:01:08.549> yarn

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
at the bottom just to get our yarn

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.030 
at the bottom just to get our yarn
started<00:01:09.420> here<00:01:09.689> we're<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> tie<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:10.680> in

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
started here we're going to tie this in

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.160 
started here we're going to tie this in
a<00:01:11.159> very<00:01:11.189> loose<00:01:12.000> half<00:01:12.330> hitch<00:01:12.540> knot<00:01:12.570> which<00:01:13.020> we're

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
a very loose half hitch knot which we're

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.469 
a very loose half hitch knot which we're
going<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> undo<00:01:13.619> later<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.159> don't<00:01:14.460> tug<00:01:15.360> it

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
going to undo later so don't tug it

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.510 
going to undo later so don't tug it
tight<00:01:15.890> because<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.009> will<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.159> able<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
tight because you will be able to get it

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.690 
tight because you will be able to get it
out<00:01:17.640> later<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:19.470> what<00:01:20.070> we're<00:01:20.250> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.580> is

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
out later so what we're going to do is

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.770 
out later so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.970> make<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.119> decision<00:01:21.600> whether

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
we're going to make a decision whether

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.200 
we're going to make a decision whether
we're<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> use<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> half<00:01:22.860> stitch<00:01:23.189> or<00:01:23.490> full

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
we're going to use a half stitch or full

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.840 
we're going to use a half stitch or full
stitch<00:01:24.680> but<00:01:25.680> what<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.130> part<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.729> that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
stitch but what and part of that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.390 
stitch but what and part of that
decision<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.450> whether<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.770> have<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> selvage

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
decision is whether you have a selvage

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.550 
decision is whether you have a selvage
stitch<00:01:29.700> included<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.630> your<00:01:30.780> pattern<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.409> that

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
stitch included in your pattern in that

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.260 
stitch included in your pattern in that
case<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.770> take<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.189> full<00:01:32.400> stitch<00:01:32.670> otherwise

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
case you take the full stitch otherwise

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.539 
case you take the full stitch otherwise
take<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.110> half<00:01:34.320> stitch<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.950> what<00:01:35.400> we're

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
take the half stitch and what we're

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.890 
take the half stitch and what we're
going<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.729> do<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.090> work<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:37.439> bar<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:38.250> between

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
going to do is work the bar in between

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.230 
going to do is work the bar in between
the<00:01:39.900> rows<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.860> v's<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.790> knit<00:01:41.970> stitches

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240

it creates an invisible seam and let's

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.170 
it creates an invisible seam and let's
go<00:03:06.739> ahead<00:03:06.829> and<00:03:06.950> undo<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.280> knot<00:03:07.549> because<00:03:07.909> then
