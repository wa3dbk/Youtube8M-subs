you<00:01:22.630> a<00:01:22.659> full<00:01:22.960> view<00:01:23.260> of<00:01:23.320> house<00:01:23.770> clever<00:01:24.040> look<00:01:24.340> and

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
you a full view of house clever look and

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.700 
you a full view of house clever look and
the<00:01:25.060> reason<00:01:25.330> why<00:01:25.450> I<00:01:25.480> squivers<00:01:25.960> white<00:01:26.380> it's

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
the reason why I squivers white it's

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.490 
the reason why I squivers white it's
just<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.040> show<00:01:27.070> like<00:01:27.400> he<00:01:27.550> said<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
just to show like he said and the

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.980 
just to show like he said and the
paleness<00:01:29.800> of<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.430> skin<00:01:30.790> and<00:01:31.150> stuff<00:01:31.659> like<00:01:31.810> that

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
paleness of the skin and stuff like that

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.719 
paleness of the skin and stuff like that
because<00:01:32.080> never<00:01:32.350> anything<00:01:32.950> ever<00:01:33.250> goes<00:01:33.490> right

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
because never anything ever goes right

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.030 
because never anything ever goes right
for<00:01:33.820> school<00:01:34.060> work<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.680> I'm<00:01:35.680> thinking<00:01:35.920> about

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
for school work and I'm thinking about

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.740 
for school work and I'm thinking about
changing<00:01:36.430> this<00:01:36.490> pixel<00:01:36.850> art<00:01:37.000> up<00:01:37.180> a<00:01:37.360> little<00:01:37.510> bit

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
changing this pixel art up a little bit

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.990 
changing this pixel art up a little bit
but<00:01:38.050> if<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.320> guys<00:01:38.470> like<00:01:38.770> it<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.159> don't<00:01:39.790> see

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
but if you guys like it and don't see

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.360 
but if you guys like it and don't see
any<00:01:40.030> flaws<00:01:40.420> in<00:01:40.450> it<00:01:40.870> I'm<00:01:41.500> gonna<00:01:41.710> keep<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:42.100> so

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
any flaws in it I'm gonna keep it so

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.890 
any flaws in it I'm gonna keep it so
make<00:01:42.760> sure<00:01:42.790> you<00:01:42.940> give<00:01:43.090> me<00:01:43.150> some<00:01:43.299> feedback<00:01:43.479> so<00:01:43.840> I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
make sure you give me some feedback so I

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.649 
make sure you give me some feedback so I
can<00:01:44.140> know<00:01:44.370> what<00:01:45.370> I<00:01:45.430> have<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.790> change<00:01:46.030> or<00:01:46.360> keep

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
can know what I have to change or keep

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.320 
can know what I have to change or keep
the<00:01:46.810> same<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.340> I'm<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.610> reason<00:01:48.760> why<00:01:49.000> it<00:01:49.150> kind

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
the same and I'm the reason why it kind

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.850 
the same and I'm the reason why it kind
of<00:01:49.360> looks<00:01:49.570> like<00:01:49.659> he's<00:01:49.900> standing<00:01:50.229> on<00:01:50.380> his<00:01:50.440> pixel

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
of looks like he's standing on his pixel

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.820 
of looks like he's standing on his pixel
art<00:01:51.390> cuz<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:52.570> would<00:01:52.690> have<00:01:53.020> made<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.290> big<00:01:53.650> flower

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
art cuz I would have made the big flower

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.469 
art cuz I would have made the big flower
in<00:01:54.010> front<00:01:54.280> of<00:01:54.370> him<00:01:54.490> but<00:01:54.729> that<00:01:54.940> really<00:01:55.210> wouldn't

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
in front of him but that really wouldn't

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.210 
in front of him but that really wouldn't
be<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:55.600> Pixlr<00:01:56.140> that<00:01:56.350> would<00:01:56.470> be<00:01:56.560> two<00:01:56.740> pixel<00:01:57.070> art

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
be a Pixlr that would be two pixel art

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.350 
be a Pixlr that would be two pixel art
so<00:01:57.960> that's<00:01:58.960> just<00:01:59.260> about<00:02:00.159> that<00:02:00.460> he's<00:02:01.180> actually

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
so that's just about that he's actually

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.580 
so that's just about that he's actually
dropping<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:02.080> and<00:02:02.380> crying<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:04.450> yeah<00:02:04.930> so<00:02:05.260> I

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
dropping it and crying and yeah so I

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.350 
dropping it and crying and yeah so I
never<00:02:05.920> saw<00:02:06.280> this<00:02:06.400> quick<00:02:06.580> start<00:02:06.760> on<00:02:07.060> YouTube
