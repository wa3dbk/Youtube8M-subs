can argue that you put him in the
conversation<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> think<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.020> thing<00:01:34.049> with

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
conversation and I think one thing with

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.319 
conversation and I think one thing with
Kelly<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:35.100> we're<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.670> deep<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.000> our<00:01:36.150> front

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
Kelly because we're so deep on our front

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.880

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869

those seven rebounds scored about 18
points<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.110> think<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.649> extended<00:01:44.100> him<00:01:44.189> out<00:01:44.340> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
points I think if you extended him out a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.639 
points I think if you extended him out a
little<00:01:44.549> bit<00:01:44.729> he<00:01:44.880> was<00:01:45.000> playing<00:01:45.240> 32<00:01:45.899> 33<00:01:46.290> minutes

a<00:01:46.799> game<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.189> think<00:01:47.729> believe<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.180> or<00:01:48.270> not<00:01:48.360> those

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
a game I think believe it or not those

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.420 
a game I think believe it or not those
numbers<00:01:48.930> could<00:01:49.020> even<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.409> better<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.950> Kelly<00:01:50.189> I

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
numbers could even be better so Kelly I

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.039 
numbers could even be better so Kelly I
