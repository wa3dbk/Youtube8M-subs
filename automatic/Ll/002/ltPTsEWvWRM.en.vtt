00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.870
 how about you guys are welcome 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.240
 week more to our game show 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.940
 Here we talk about the news that 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.670
 surround the sector and we will see the games 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.020
 more interesting than expected for 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.359
 within very little 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.720
 that said let's start to see the program 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.720
 from today 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.130
 nothing worse than sitting down to live 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.040
 multiplayer experience of your game 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.230
 favorite and find cheaters who are 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.780
 devote to hindering earn points 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.940
 unfairly and block the rest of 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.270
 players using exploit or 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.820
 colloquially called hedges 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.760
 in the multiplayer mode of max payne 3 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.680
 there are also these types of cheats 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.510
 It only takes a few weeks in the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.790
 market but they have already been distributed 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.800
 dozens of tricks to modify the 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.400
 qualities and abilities 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.230
 players of the latest rockstar title 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.600
 however, the study does not want 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.810
 these guys invade their servers and has 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.760
 presented 7 pool a server to which 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.830
 they will send the cheaters so they do not 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.350
 can invade clean games 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.350
 lasseter bracelet like a cell 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.000
 online punishment is to say instead of varying 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.840
 to the player for life the way 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.390
 multiplayer 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.520
 rockstar has thought about re-educating these 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.350
 characters making their only 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.180
 experience in max online mode 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.610
 payne 3 be within this room 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.460
 the best thing is that the jeter pool alone 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.620
 will have cheating players so to see 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.800
 how it feels to receive your own 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.750
 medicine since all the players 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.720
 will use these tricks and there will be no 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.910
 so much play to denounce a 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.040
 cheat and be able to send it to lasseter 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.690
 pool rockstar has enabled a 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.330
 contact form in which 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.270
 we must point out to the user his 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.729
 gamertag leader and if possible send 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.830
 a video capture as proof by 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.830
 both objects are finished 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.740
 reuse the best characters of the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.020
 comic world to create a new 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.690
 game is a trend that is being 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.090
 using a lot lately however 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.630
 it seems that the formula works and they arrive 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.360
 good titles the last one is iniesta gus 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.490
 amonas a fighting game developed 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.130
 by netherrealm that will face the 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.750
 heroes of dif and with those of mortal kombat 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.600
 for his know-how saying gangs 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.360
 all against all and under the environments 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.489
 more spectacular that's just the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.430
 beginning of what jazz enjoys 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.260
 monas will offer us the team of 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.810
 development has opted to create a 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.209
 graphic gray section moving away from the 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.480
 colorful corny that surround some 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.100
 personalities of dc I personally like 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.959
 the air of comics that they have given to 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.239
 game but I like that the 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.820
 scenarios are part of the action already 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.850
 which we interact with them take 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.350
 objects or even shred them and pass 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.080
 to another quickly 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.230
 you in justice what's amonas will not come 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.820
 Until 2013, in principle, it will only reach 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.770
 playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii and therefore 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.840
 It will be interesting to see what adaptation 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.150
 do the guys from neder ring for 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.180
 take advantage of the gamepad of the new 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.070
 nintendo already know our attentive 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.930
 program because we will talk to you often 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.930
 of this promising title 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.860
 activision has posted a new video 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.260
 of call of duty black ops' 2 the trailer 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.870
 It has the name William and his intention 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.890
 is to speak to us of raúl menéndez the new 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.890
 bad of the plot 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.950
 I personally have serious doubts about 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.200
 the title and I'm not just talking about one 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.450
 forced story that takes center stage 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.960
 to the classic fps style of the franchise 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.709
 but also more than disappointing 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.709
 paragraph graphics of the game 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.180
 it will be my thing but among the call of 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.580
 developed by traders and those of 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.889
 infinity ward I am undoubtedly with the 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.169
 seconds but going back to the new video 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.419
 of call of duty black ops 2 what we see 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.940
 is a series of sequences that will give us 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.840
 to know the real enemy in the 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.840
 new delivery 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.540
 we have also cast new images 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.910
 of the spectacular vehicles of 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.890
 combat some of the futuristic weapons 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.140
 that we will see in the game and how not 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.940
 we also have a few drones 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.940
 flying over the chaotic city 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.680
 a call of duty black ops 2 was announced 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.960
 as a messiah for the fps genre of 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.750
 war action but little by little we're going 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.820
 seeing details that I honestly do not 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.820
 accompany expectations 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.479
 his name is michael fassbender and what 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:25.090
 we've seen under the magneto role in 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.129
 x-men franz klaus in prometheus or in 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.919
 great productions like damn 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:33.069
 bastards and we talk about him because 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:36.240
 will be according to ubisoft the protagonist of the 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:38.860
 movie the assassin scripts 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.750
 effectively one of the most franchises 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.120
 followed and successful in the world of 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.639
 video game is about to go through 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.669
 where others have already tried without penalty 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:50.470
 no glory maybe this is because every 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.780
 adaptation has undergone changes 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.849
 important of the plot moving away the 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.759
 film production of the 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:59.889
 real story of the game that's why 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:02.199
 ubisoft has rejected several studies 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.780
 of hollywood between them to sonny that 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.819
 have offered to shoot such film and 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.370
 has decided to take care of all the 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:11.469
 process making sure you do not touch 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.990
 not a pencil in the story besides that 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:16.300
 you can control at all times 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.169
 fidelity of the script and the scenes of 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.449
 assassin's creed 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.729
 ubisoft was clear that michael 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:25.099
 Fassbender would be the perfect actor to 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:27.560
 give life to desmond mails and to the character 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:29.389
 fictitious at the moment there are no details 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.819
 about the episode on which it will be based 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.310
 said movie the rest of the cast nor 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:36.469
 release date but we are sure of 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.930
 that assassin's creed can mark a 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:41.650
 before and after in this kind of 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.650
 adaptations 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.190
 good friends what a pity we have 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.860
 to leave but we return tomorrow with 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:55.970
 another program and with new titles to the 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.970
 sight a greeting
