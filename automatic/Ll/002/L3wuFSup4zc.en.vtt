been bleeding this is possibly the
grossest<00:03:50.000> nail<00:03:50.660> tutorial<00:03:51.319> ever<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:56.150> that's

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
grossest nail tutorial ever and that's

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.620 
grossest nail tutorial ever and that's
the<00:03:56.420> first<00:03:56.630> design<00:03:56.959> done<00:03:58.060> another<00:03:59.060> way<00:03:59.269> to<00:03:59.329> do

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
the first design done another way to do

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.780 
the first design done another way to do
it<00:03:59.750> is<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.109> take<00:04:00.470> your<00:04:00.620> false<00:04:00.829> nail<00:04:01.100> making

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
it is to take your false nail making

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.289 
it is to take your false nail making
each<00:04:01.850> other<00:04:01.970> is<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.420> same<00:04:03.820> length<00:04:04.820> as<00:04:05.120> your

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
each other is the same length as your

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.340 
each other is the same length as your
natural<00:04:05.720> nail<00:04:05.900> again<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:09.130> just<00:04:10.130> take<00:04:10.670> random

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
natural nail again and just take random

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.590 
natural nail again and just take random
chunks<00:04:12.350> out<00:04:12.470> of<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.769> top<00:04:13.069> of<00:04:13.250> it<00:04:13.400> so<00:04:13.670> just

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
chunks out of the top of it so just

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.690 
chunks out of the top of it so just
taking<00:04:15.170> some<00:04:15.380> clippers<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.959> just<00:04:18.709> put<00:04:19.100> random

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
taking some clippers and just put random

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.840 
taking some clippers and just put random
like<00:04:20.090> triangles<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:21.380> just<00:04:22.039> anything<00:04:22.400> just<00:04:22.760> to

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
like triangles and just anything just to

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
like triangles and just anything just to
make<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.090> nail<00:04:23.240> look<00:04:23.419> like<00:04:23.539> it's<00:04:23.720> being

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
make the nail look like it's being

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:33.510 
make the nail look like it's being
broken

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.379 

so<00:04:34.479> you<00:04:34.599> end<00:04:34.720> up<00:04:34.840> with<00:04:34.990> something<00:04:35.410> like<00:04:35.560> this

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
so you end up with something like this

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.640 
so you end up with something like this
