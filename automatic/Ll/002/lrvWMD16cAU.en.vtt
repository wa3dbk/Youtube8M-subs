so<00:02:16.900> no<00:02:17.650> CD<00:02:18.069> players<00:02:18.310> know<00:02:18.849> your<00:02:19.000> equipment<00:02:19.239> the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
so no CD players know your equipment the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.470 
so no CD players know your equipment the
software<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.319> all<00:02:20.469> good<00:02:20.799> but<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.299> the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
software is all good but this is the

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.559 
software is all good but this is the
real<00:02:22.629> thing<00:02:24.000> bigger<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> better

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
real thing bigger the better

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.479 
real thing bigger the better
well<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:26.560> doesn't<00:02:26.829> really<00:02:26.980> apply<00:02:27.280> in

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
well that doesn't really apply in

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.819 
well that doesn't really apply in
totality<00:02:28.269> in<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.659> in<00:02:28.900> DJing

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
totality in this in DJing

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.050 
totality in this in DJing
just<00:02:30.069> that<00:02:30.219> because<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.519> equipment<00:02:30.730> is

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
just that because the equipment is

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.119 
just that because the equipment is
bigger<00:02:31.329> doesn't<00:02:31.930> mean<00:02:32.079> it's<00:02:32.230> better<00:02:32.409> yes

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
bigger doesn't mean it's better yes

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.559 
bigger doesn't mean it's better yes

need to look after them
you<00:03:13.810> can't<00:03:14.049> just<00:03:14.230> keep<00:03:14.349> growing<00:03:14.650> them<00:03:14.829> and

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
you can't just keep growing them and

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.649 
you can't just keep growing them and
bombarding<00:03:15.370> me<00:03:15.459> with<00:03:15.489> those<00:03:15.879> decibel<00:03:16.359> levels

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
bombarding me with those decibel levels

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.240 
bombarding me with those decibel levels
so<00:03:17.109> whenever<00:03:17.319> you're<00:03:17.530> practicing<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.129> you're
