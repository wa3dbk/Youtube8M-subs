you need built-in as you can see the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.109 
you need built-in as you can see the
two-and-a-half<00:01:32.220> designs<00:01:32.579> are<00:01:32.850> hot-swappable

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119

here we've got the hot swappable two and

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.660 
here we've got the hot swappable two and
a<00:01:49.649> half<00:01:49.850> inch<00:01:50.990> so<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.229> nice<00:01:52.439> it's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
a half inch so this is nice it's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.530 
a half inch so this is nice it's

with<00:03:09.260> actually<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.410> nand<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:11.010> all<00:03:11.579> that

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
with actually the nand and all that

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.460 
with actually the nand and all that
stuff<00:03:11.910> it's<00:03:12.150> all<00:03:12.329> good<00:03:12.570> now<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.900> all<00:03:13.019> sorted

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
stuff it's all good now and all sorted

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.289

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
but it just kind of sucks like if I

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.090 
but it just kind of sucks like if I
would<00:03:15.420> have<00:03:15.510> filmed<00:03:15.660> after<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.079> could<00:03:16.260> you

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
would have filmed after you could you

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.800 
would have filmed after you could you
would<00:03:17.130> be<00:03:17.430> able<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.700> tell<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:17.970> i<00:03:18.450> had<00:03:18.720> to

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
would be able to tell that i had to

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.060 
would be able to tell that i had to
finagle<00:03:19.109> a<00:03:19.290> little<00:03:19.500> bit<00:03:19.590> here<00:03:19.769> like<00:03:19.859> why<00:03:20.010> is

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
finagle a little bit here like why is

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.530 
finagle a little bit here like why is
this<00:03:20.220> i<00:03:20.579> wasn't<00:03:20.880> streamlined<00:03:21.269> for<00:03:21.420> the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
this i wasn't streamlined for the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.509 
this i wasn't streamlined for the
tutorial<00:03:21.690> wasn't<00:03:22.590> professional<00:03:22.709> enough<00:03:23.250> in

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
tutorial wasn't professional enough in

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.640 
tutorial wasn't professional enough in
my<00:03:23.640> opinion<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.180> working<00:03:24.870> on<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.019> proto<00:03:25.260> be<00:03:25.470> to

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
my opinion so working on the proto be to

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.199 
my opinion so working on the proto be to
install<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.310> then<00:03:26.340> i'm<00:03:26.790> going<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:26.940> be<00:03:27.060> working

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
install and then i'm going to be working

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.090 
install and then i'm going to be working
on<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.420> proto<00:03:27.690> be<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.079> install<00:03:28.470> with<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.620> demon

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
on the proto be to install with a demon

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.740 
on the proto be to install with a demon
as<00:03:29.250> well<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:29.760> we're<00:03:30.150> working<00:03:30.269> on<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.630> we've<00:03:30.720> got
