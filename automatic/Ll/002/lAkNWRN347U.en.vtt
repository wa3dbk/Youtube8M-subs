this is what we're building with today I

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.280 
this is what we're building with today I
don't<00:01:30.090> think<00:01:30.270> we'll<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.659> mostly<00:01:30.900> lock<00:01:31.170> so

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
don't think we'll get to mostly lock so

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.390 
don't think we'll get to mostly lock so
I'm<00:01:31.380> gonna<00:01:31.470> put<00:01:31.650> them<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.799> my<00:01:31.890> inventory<00:01:32.159> just

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.880 
to save time because again we don't have
a<00:01:34.799> lot<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.100> time<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.909> do<00:01:36.119> anything<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.320> let's<00:01:37.740> go

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and then down on the other side and what

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.980 
and then down on the other side and what
this<00:02:49.860> means<00:02:50.420> is<00:02:51.420> get<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.600> little<00:02:51.810> bit<00:02:51.900> more

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
this means is get a little bit more

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.660 
this means is get a little bit more
space<00:02:52.230> what<00:02:52.650> we<00:02:52.740> can<00:02:52.890> do<00:02:53.040> here<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.340> maybe<00:02:53.460> have

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
space what we can do here is maybe have

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.130 
space what we can do here is maybe have
some<00:02:53.850> sort<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.060> balcony<00:02:54.480> going<00:02:54.690> over<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.930> pool

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
some sort of balcony going over the pool

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.840 
some sort of balcony going over the pool
and<00:02:55.830> then<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.190> other<00:02:56.220> side<00:02:56.550> there<00:02:56.730> it's

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
and then on the other side there it's

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.850 
and then on the other side there it's
gonna<00:02:56.940> just<00:02:57.150> be<00:02:57.210> a<00:02:57.330> solid<00:02:57.720> room<00:02:57.960> now<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.410> saw<00:02:58.830> a

gonna just be a solid room now I saw a

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.230 
gonna just be a solid room now I saw a
lot<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.220> comments<00:02:59.760> where<00:02:59.850> people<00:03:00.060> were<00:03:00.120> like

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
gonna it's not gonna be like this the

gonna it's not gonna be like this the
entire<00:03:15.360> time<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:15.900> don't<00:03:16.020> worry<00:03:16.260> about<00:03:16.650> that

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
entire time so don't worry about that

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.460 
entire time so don't worry about that
okay

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
okay

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.709 
okay

do not fear

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:24.360 
do not fear
like<00:03:22.719> that<00:03:22.870> we<00:03:23.560> will<00:03:23.739> definitely<00:03:23.890> have<00:03:24.099> a<00:03:24.189> lot

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
like that we will definitely have a lot

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.619 
like that we will definitely have a lot
of<00:03:24.400> other<00:03:24.579> colors<00:03:24.909> this<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.090> just<00:03:25.359> a<00:03:25.450> little

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
of other colors this is just a little

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.030 
of other colors this is just a little
bit<00:03:25.719> of<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.930> little<00:03:26.290> bit<00:03:26.409> of<00:03:26.469> planning<00:03:26.769> I<00:03:26.829> hope

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
bit of a little bit of planning I hope

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.229 
bit of a little bit of planning I hope
that's<00:03:27.280> something<00:03:27.430> that<00:03:27.730> he<00:03:27.819> wanted<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.150> do

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
that's something that he wanted to do

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.580 
that's something that he wanted to do
again<00:03:28.450> that's<00:03:28.599> gonna<00:03:28.689> be<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.930> difficult<00:03:29.379> part

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
again that's gonna be the difficult part

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.470 
again that's gonna be the difficult part
in<00:03:29.709> this<00:03:29.799> series<00:03:29.980> here<00:03:30.280> because<00:03:31.180> we<00:03:31.299> have

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
in this series here because we have

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.849 
in this series here because we have
obviously<00:03:31.719> different<00:03:32.140> building<00:03:32.379> styles<00:03:32.739> we

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
obviously different building styles we

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.440 
obviously different building styles we
both<00:03:33.069> have<00:03:33.250> two<00:03:33.489> different<00:03:33.670> ideas<00:03:33.909> of<00:03:34.120> what<00:03:34.359> we

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
both have two different ideas of what we

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.319 
both have two different ideas of what we
want<00:03:34.629> to<00:03:34.750> happen<00:03:34.900> during<00:03:35.859> the<00:03:36.040> build<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.579> so

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
want to happen during the build and so

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.720 
want to happen during the build and so
it's<00:03:37.719> gonna<00:03:37.840> be<00:03:38.049> quite<00:03:38.349> the<00:03:38.560> challenge<00:03:38.769> to<00:03:39.159> try

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
it's gonna be quite the challenge to try

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.339 
it's gonna be quite the challenge to try
and<00:03:39.879> connect<00:03:40.180> all<00:03:40.480> of<00:03:40.540> those<00:03:40.810> things<00:03:41.139> together

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
and connect all of those things together

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.959 
and connect all of those things together
and<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.769> make<00:03:42.280> sure<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:42.519> that's<00:03:42.609> actually

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:42.969 
and a make sure that that's actually

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:44.879 
and a make sure that that's actually
what<00:03:43.060> happens<00:03:43.359> but<00:03:43.989> I<00:03:44.049> will<00:03:44.290> say<00:03:44.500> this<00:03:44.650> I've

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
what happens but I will say this I've

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.190 
what happens but I will say this I've
done<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.459> build<00:03:45.819> like<00:03:46.030> this<00:03:46.209> my<00:03:46.420> friend<00:03:46.629> Chris

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
done a build like this my friend Chris

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.629 
done a build like this my friend Chris
and<00:03:47.379> I<00:03:47.439> once<00:03:47.650> we<00:03:47.859> did<00:03:48.010> this<00:03:48.069> build<00:03:48.310> where<00:03:48.519> we

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
and I once we did this build where we

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.490 
and I once we did this build where we
had<00:03:48.790> an<00:03:48.909> hour<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.299> build<00:03:49.510> but<00:03:50.019> neither<00:03:50.230> one<00:03:50.469> of

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
had an hour to build but neither one of

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.660 
had an hour to build but neither one of
us<00:03:50.620> was<00:03:50.739> allowed<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.069> talk<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.400> each<00:03:51.489> other

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
us was allowed to talk to each other

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.399 
us was allowed to talk to each other
while<00:03:52.239> we<00:03:52.329> worked<00:03:52.510> on<00:03:52.659> the<00:03:52.750> same<00:03:52.900> build<00:03:53.200> and

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
while we worked on the same build and

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.319 
while we worked on the same build and
actually<00:03:53.829> turned<00:03:54.040> out<00:03:54.129> really<00:03:54.189> good<00:03:54.639> so<00:03:55.239> I'm

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
actually turned out really good so I'm

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.879 
actually turned out really good so I'm
not<00:03:55.510> too<00:03:55.720> worried<00:03:56.019> I<00:03:56.139> think<00:03:56.409> this<00:03:56.560> will<00:03:56.709> turn

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
not too worried I think this will turn

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.009 
not too worried I think this will turn
into<00:03:56.919> something<00:03:57.370> but<00:03:58.359> it's<00:03:58.480> just<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.720> matter<00:03:58.900> of

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
into something but it's just a matter of

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.750 
into something but it's just a matter of
you<00:03:59.230> know<00:03:59.319> figuring<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.859> out<00:03:59.950> how<00:04:00.489> it's<00:04:00.669> gonna

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
you know figuring it out how it's gonna

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.159 
you know figuring it out how it's gonna
happen<00:04:01.120> now<00:04:01.239> over<00:04:01.510> here<00:04:01.750> what<00:04:01.900> we<00:04:01.989> have<00:04:02.019> is

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
happen now over here what we have is

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.349 
happen now over here what we have is
something<00:04:02.590> going<00:04:02.769> on<00:04:02.799> like<00:04:02.859> this<00:04:03.129> what<00:04:04.090> we<00:04:04.209> can

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
something going on like this what we can

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.309 
something going on like this what we can
do<00:04:04.659> is<00:04:05.430> maybe<00:04:06.430> we'll<00:04:06.700> run<00:04:06.879> over<00:04:06.909> here<00:04:07.359> and<00:04:07.510> take

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
do is maybe we'll run over here and take

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.809 
do is maybe we'll run over here and take
a<00:04:08.349> little<00:04:08.530> bit<00:04:08.620> of<00:04:08.709> brick<00:04:09.010> that<00:04:09.639> could

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
a little bit of brick that could

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:10.890 
a little bit of brick that could
probably<00:04:09.969> work<00:04:10.269> we'll<00:04:10.480> take<00:04:10.629> some<00:04:10.750> of<00:04:10.810> this

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
probably work we'll take some of this

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.420 
probably work we'll take some of this
brick<00:04:11.139> here<00:04:11.379> see<00:04:11.829> if<00:04:11.889> we<00:04:11.980> can<00:04:12.099> work<00:04:12.219> with<00:04:12.400> that

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
brick here see if we can work with that

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.009 
brick here see if we can work with that
or<00:04:12.790> maybe<00:04:12.969> some<00:04:13.209> of<00:04:13.239> this<00:04:13.419> brick<00:04:13.659> we'll<00:04:13.840> try

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
or maybe some of this brick we'll try

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.199 
or maybe some of this brick we'll try
them<00:04:14.109> both<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.439> some<00:04:14.909> district<00:04:15.909> okay<00:04:16.180> I

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
them both and some district okay I

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.640 
them both and some district okay I
already<00:04:16.389> have<00:04:16.479> that<00:04:16.660> we'll<00:04:17.229> see<00:04:17.349> we<00:04:17.440> can<00:04:17.560> do

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
already have that we'll see we can do

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.930 
already have that we'll see we can do
with<00:04:17.769> these<00:04:17.919> here<00:04:18.130> but<00:04:18.280> what<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.430> want<00:04:18.609> to<00:04:18.669> do<00:04:18.820> is

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
with these here but what I want to do is

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.039 
with these here but what I want to do is
obviously<00:04:19.269> we<00:04:19.599> need<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:19.750> come<00:04:19.870> up<00:04:19.959> with

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
obviously we need to come up with

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.659 
obviously we need to come up with
something<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.410> do<00:04:20.590> some<00:04:21.099> kind<00:04:21.250> of<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.430> pillar

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
something to do some kind of a pillar

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.279 
something to do some kind of a pillar
over<00:04:21.940> here<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.270> this<00:04:22.330> is<00:04:22.389> obviously<00:04:23.020> this<00:04:23.139> is

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
over here and this is obviously this is

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.600 
over here and this is obviously this is
all<00:04:23.500> things<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:23.889> are<00:04:23.979> probably<00:04:24.160> going<00:04:24.370> to

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
all things that are probably going to

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.510 
all things that are probably going to
change<00:04:25.000> as<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:26.110> build<00:04:26.289> progresses<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:27.010> will

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
change as the build progresses I will

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.279 
change as the build progresses I will
just<00:04:27.669> say<00:04:27.760> that<00:04:27.789> right<00:04:28.150> now<00:04:28.330> but<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.080> gives<00:04:29.229> us

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
just say that right now but it gives us

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.510 
just say that right now but it gives us
an<00:04:29.440> idea<00:04:29.500> of<00:04:29.830> what<00:04:29.949> we're<00:04:30.070> working<00:04:30.220> with<00:04:30.370> here

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
an idea of what we're working with here

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.250 
an idea of what we're working with here
so<00:04:31.060> let's<00:04:31.180> go<00:04:31.270> ahead<00:04:31.419> and<00:04:31.539> bring<00:04:31.840> this<00:04:32.020> pillar

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
so let's go ahead and bring this pillar

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.230 
so let's go ahead and bring this pillar
down<00:04:32.440> in<00:04:33.280> terms<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.729> building<00:04:34.060> length

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
down in terms of the building length

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.879 
down in terms of the building length
obviously<00:04:34.750> five<00:04:34.960> minutes<00:04:35.229> is<00:04:35.320> not<00:04:35.500> a<00:04:35.560> lot<00:04:35.740> of

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
obviously five minutes is not a lot of

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.350 
obviously five minutes is not a lot of
time<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.220> idea<00:04:36.460> behind<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.849> series<00:04:37.090> is<00:04:37.270> we

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
time the idea behind the series is we

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.939 
time the idea behind the series is we
want<00:04:37.539> it<00:04:37.599> to<00:04:37.659> be<00:04:37.780> quick<00:04:37.990> we<00:04:38.530> want<00:04:38.710> it<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.830> happen

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
want it to be quick we want it to happen

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.800 
want it to be quick we want it to happen
quickly<00:04:39.370> we<00:04:39.639> wanted<00:04:39.849> to<00:04:39.909> be<00:04:40.000> fast<00:04:40.270> paced<00:04:40.389> but

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
quickly we wanted to be fast paced but

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.969 
quickly we wanted to be fast paced but
at<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.050> same<00:04:41.229> time<00:04:41.470> we<00:04:41.620> want<00:04:41.770> it<00:04:41.830> to<00:04:41.889> be

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
at the same time we want it to be

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.439 
at the same time we want it to be
interesting<00:04:42.460> so<00:04:42.580> if<00:04:42.639> you<00:04:42.729> guys<00:04:42.880> genuinely

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
interesting so if you guys genuinely

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.140 
interesting so if you guys genuinely
think<00:04:43.690> five<00:04:43.930> minutes<00:04:43.960> is<00:04:44.349> not<00:04:44.590> enough<00:04:44.650> time

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
think five minutes is not enough time

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.129 
think five minutes is not enough time
because<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:46.240> did<00:04:46.360> see<00:04:46.510> some<00:04:46.750> comments

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
because I did see some comments

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.540 
because I did see some comments
mentioning<00:04:47.889> things<00:04:47.979> like<00:04:48.190> that<00:04:48.340> we<00:04:48.520> can

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
mentioning things like that we can

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.820 
mentioning things like that we can
definitely<00:04:49.000> consider<00:04:49.300> consider<00:04:50.259> extending

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
definitely consider consider extending

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.320 
definitely consider consider extending
it<00:04:51.070> a<00:04:51.099> little<00:04:51.280> bit<00:04:51.430> but<00:04:51.580> again<00:04:51.669> that's<00:04:52.000> that's

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
it a little bit but again that's that's

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.490 
it a little bit but again that's that's
something<00:04:52.479> that<00:04:52.630> we'll<00:04:52.750> just<00:04:52.780> have<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.020> figure

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
something that we'll just have to figure

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.960 
something that we'll just have to figure
out<00:04:53.620> here<00:04:53.800> as<00:04:53.889> we<00:04:54.039> go<00:04:55.139> so<00:04:56.139> yeah<00:04:57.130> it's<00:04:57.669> just<00:04:57.729> kind

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
out here as we go so yeah it's just kind

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.060 
out here as we go so yeah it's just kind
of<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.150> matter<00:04:58.270> of<00:04:58.449> messing<00:04:59.169> around<00:04:59.259> some<00:04:59.979> of

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
of a matter of messing around some of

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.230 
of a matter of messing around some of
these<00:05:00.159> things<00:05:00.430> I'm<00:05:00.610> gonna<00:05:00.699> have<00:05:00.880> to<00:05:00.970> come<00:05:01.120> back

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
these things I'm gonna have to come back

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.210 
these things I'm gonna have to come back
and<00:05:01.419> change<00:05:01.659> but<00:05:02.229> I<00:05:02.259> also<00:05:02.470> can't<00:05:02.770> spend<00:05:03.009> a<00:05:03.070> lot

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
of time on everything obviously I don't

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.420 
of time on everything obviously I don't
have<00:05:04.840> I<00:05:05.139> don't<00:05:05.380> have<00:05:05.470> a<00:05:05.500> lot<00:05:05.650> of<00:05:05.680> time<00:05:05.860> so<00:05:06.310> if<00:05:06.370> I

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430

have I don't have a lot of time so if I
sit<00:05:06.639> here<00:05:06.729> and<00:05:06.849> work<00:05:07.000> on<00:05:07.180> those<00:05:07.360> corner<00:05:07.780> for

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
sit here and work on those corner for

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.360 
sit here and work on those corner for
the<00:05:08.020> entire<00:05:08.259> video<00:05:08.409> it's<00:05:08.740> not<00:05:08.919> gonna<00:05:09.009> work<00:05:09.190> so

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
the entire video it's not gonna work so

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.129 
the entire video it's not gonna work so
I<00:05:09.400> may<00:05:09.580> come<00:05:09.789> back<00:05:09.940> we'll<00:05:10.479> work<00:05:10.630> on<00:05:10.780> that<00:05:10.810> and

I may come back we'll work on that and
you<00:05:11.229> might<00:05:11.380> have<00:05:11.440> a<00:05:11.500> better<00:05:11.710> idea<00:05:11.770> for<00:05:12.250> how

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
you might have a better idea for how

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.860 
you might have a better idea for how
we'll<00:05:12.970> do<00:05:13.090> that<00:05:13.210> that's<00:05:13.449> not<00:05:13.570> that's<00:05:13.780> not

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
we'll do that that's not that's not

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.320 
we'll do that that's not that's not
gonna<00:05:14.080> stay<00:05:14.199> like<00:05:14.320> that<00:05:14.759> for<00:05:15.759> now<00:05:15.880> that's<00:05:16.120> what

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
gonna stay like that for now that's what

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.540 
gonna stay like that for now that's what
it's<00:05:16.479> going<00:05:16.599> to<00:05:16.690> look<00:05:16.780> like<00:05:16.960> now<00:05:17.680> obviously<00:05:18.280> we

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
it's going to look like now obviously we

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.540 
it's going to look like now obviously we
we<00:05:19.330> have<00:05:19.509> a<00:05:19.539> work<00:05:20.110> to<00:05:20.289> do<00:05:20.409> everywhere<00:05:20.919> let's

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
we have a work to do everywhere let's

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.129 
we have a work to do everywhere let's
see<00:05:21.669> if<00:05:21.759> we<00:05:21.880> can<00:05:22.030> go<00:05:22.150> ahead<00:05:22.270> and<00:05:22.389> give<00:05:22.720> this<00:05:22.840> for

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
see if we can go ahead and give this for

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.480 
see if we can go ahead and give this for
some<00:05:23.380> sort<00:05:23.409> of<00:05:23.590> design<00:05:23.830> so<00:05:23.949> we've<00:05:24.070> three<00:05:24.310> right

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
some sort of design so we've three right

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.350 
some sort of design so we've three right
there<00:05:24.750> one<00:05:25.750> two<00:05:26.050> three<00:05:26.470> and

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
there one two three and

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.580 
there one two three and
it<00:05:27.659> doesn't<00:05:27.900> really<00:05:27.990> matter<00:05:28.169> what's<00:05:28.409> going<00:05:28.469> on

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
it doesn't really matter what's going on

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.740 
it doesn't really matter what's going on
over<00:05:28.830> there<00:05:29.039> we'll<00:05:29.909> come<00:05:29.939> in<00:05:30.210> here<00:05:30.539> and<00:05:30.659> we've

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
over there we'll come in here and we've

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.369 
over there we'll come in here and we've
got<00:05:30.780> a<00:05:30.960> 1<00:05:31.439> 1<00:05:32.310> 2<00:05:32.580> 3<00:05:32.939> so<00:05:33.569> we<00:05:33.659> keep<00:05:33.780> that<00:05:33.840> space<00:05:34.169> and

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:34.379 
got a 1 1 2 3 so we keep that space and

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.070 
got a 1 1 2 3 so we keep that space and
consistent<00:05:34.939> and<00:05:35.939> now<00:05:36.090> what<00:05:36.360> we<00:05:36.449> have<00:05:36.479> here<00:05:36.689> is

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
consistent and now what we have here is

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.080 
consistent and now what we have here is
this<00:05:37.229> beautiful<00:05:37.439> or<00:05:38.129> we<00:05:38.310> can<00:05:38.460> put<00:05:38.639> one<00:05:38.759> here

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
this beautiful or we can put one here

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.029 
this beautiful or we can put one here
too<00:05:39.360> just<00:05:39.389> to<00:05:39.719> keep<00:05:39.840> it<00:05:39.960> up<00:05:40.050> we<00:05:40.680> have<00:05:40.830> this<00:05:40.979> a

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
too just to keep it up we have this a

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.520 
too just to keep it up we have this a
little<00:05:41.939> bit<00:05:42.150> of<00:05:42.240> looks<00:05:42.870> like<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.110> houses<00:05:43.259> up

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
little bit of looks like the houses up

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.719 
little bit of looks like the houses up
on<00:05:43.650> stilts<00:05:43.889> now<00:05:44.039> that's<00:05:44.219> nice

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
on stilts now that's nice

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.369 
on stilts now that's nice
ok<00:05:45.030> so<00:05:45.090> that's<00:05:45.240> just<00:05:45.599> some<00:05:45.780> simple<00:05:46.050> stuff<00:05:46.199> here

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379 
ok so that's just some simple stuff here

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:47.300 
ok so that's just some simple stuff here
let's<00:05:46.560> go<00:05:46.650> ahead<00:05:46.800> and<00:05:46.889> figure<00:05:46.979> out<00:05:47.069> how<00:05:47.189> this

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
let's go ahead and figure out how this

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.980 
let's go ahead and figure out how this
is<00:05:47.460> going<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.819> actually<00:05:48.150> connect<00:05:48.629> to<00:05:48.659> the<00:05:48.810> main

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
is going to actually connect to the main

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.959 
is going to actually connect to the main
house<00:05:49.199> I<00:05:49.500> think<00:05:50.039> because<00:05:50.310> our<00:05:50.400> pools<00:05:50.699> over

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969 
house I think because our pools over

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:51.860 
house I think because our pools over
there<00:05:51.090> we're<00:05:51.180> gonna<00:05:51.270> want<00:05:51.479> it<00:05:51.539> to<00:05:51.629> come<00:05:51.780> in

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
there we're gonna want it to come in

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.990 
there we're gonna want it to come in
this<00:05:52.080> direction<00:05:52.580> because<00:05:53.580> if<00:05:53.699> it<00:05:53.789> doesn't

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
this direction because if it doesn't

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.480 
this direction because if it doesn't
we're<00:05:54.360> gonna<00:05:54.449> end<00:05:54.659> up<00:05:54.750> with<00:05:55.189> they're<00:05:56.189> going<00:05:56.400> to

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
we're gonna end up with they're going to

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.540 
we're gonna end up with they're going to
end<00:05:56.639> up<00:05:56.789> with<00:05:57.710> not<00:05:58.710> enough<00:05:58.740> room<00:05:59.129> between<00:05:59.219> the

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
end up with not enough room between the

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.610 
end up with not enough room between the
pool<00:05:59.729> so<00:06:00.389> I<00:06:00.419> don't<00:06:00.629> quite<00:06:00.870> know<00:06:01.050> I'm<00:06:01.199> thinking

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
pool so I don't quite know I'm thinking

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.890 
pool so I don't quite know I'm thinking
what<00:06:01.800> could<00:06:02.039> possibly<00:06:02.550> happen<00:06:02.789> here<00:06:03.150> is<00:06:03.659> this

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
what could possibly happen here is this

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.450 
what could possibly happen here is this
kind<00:06:04.139> of<00:06:04.169> could<00:06:04.319> be<00:06:04.409> like<00:06:04.529> an<00:06:04.650> indoor<00:06:05.250> garden

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
kind of could be like an indoor garden

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.469 
kind of could be like an indoor garden
space<00:06:05.759> I<00:06:05.909> don't<00:06:06.060> if<00:06:06.120> you've<00:06:06.210> been<00:06:06.300> to<00:06:06.389> those

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
space I don't if you've been to those

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.029 
space I don't if you've been to those
hotels<00:06:06.960> where<00:06:07.199> they<00:06:07.229> have<00:06:07.409> the<00:06:07.560> rooms<00:06:07.800> all

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
hotels where they have the rooms all

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:09.469 
hotels where they have the rooms all
facing<00:06:08.460> inward<00:06:08.759> and<00:06:08.879> then<00:06:08.969> in<00:06:09.090> the<00:06:09.150> middle<00:06:09.330> is

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
facing inward and then in the middle is

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.140 
facing inward and then in the middle is
like<00:06:09.629> this<00:06:09.779> big<00:06:10.159> thing<00:06:11.159> kind<00:06:11.759> of<00:06:11.789> like<00:06:11.909> either

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150

like this big thing kind of like either
a<00:06:12.180> pool<00:06:12.449> or<00:06:12.659> something<00:06:12.870> like<00:06:12.930> that<00:06:12.990> that's

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
a pool or something like that that's

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:14.659 
a pool or something like that that's
kind<00:06:13.650> of<00:06:13.680> what<00:06:13.800> could<00:06:13.889> happen<00:06:14.009> here<00:06:14.310> so<00:06:14.340> the

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
kind of what could happen here so the

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.850 
kind of what could happen here so the
house<00:06:14.819> will<00:06:15.029> be<00:06:15.090> around<00:06:16.050> in<00:06:16.199> this<00:06:16.319> area<00:06:16.379> and<00:06:16.770> in

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
house will be around in this area and in

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
think and then our depth will be 50 oh

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.149 
think and then our depth will be 50 oh
no<00:06:30.779> our<00:06:30.870> depth<00:06:31.080> will<00:06:31.229> be<00:06:31.259> a<00:06:31.379> 3<00:06:31.979> and<00:06:32.190> then<00:06:32.279> water

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159 
no our depth will be a 3 and then water

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:36.950 
no our depth will be a 3 and then water
but<00:06:35.159> see<00:06:35.339> it<00:06:35.430> doesn't<00:06:35.580> want<00:06:35.789> to<00:06:35.849> do<00:06:36.029> that<00:06:36.240> so

next episode um again we could maybe up

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.219 
next episode um again we could maybe up
the<00:07:30.300> time<00:07:30.479> to<00:07:30.599> like<00:07:30.719> seven<00:07:31.050> and<00:07:31.110> a<00:07:31.199> half

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:31.229 
the time to like seven and a half

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:32.749 
the time to like seven and a half
minutes<00:07:31.710> because<00:07:31.800> I<00:07:31.889> think<00:07:32.009> 10<00:07:32.400> minutes<00:07:32.430> is

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 
minutes because I think 10 minutes is

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:34.129 
minutes because I think 10 minutes is
too<00:07:32.879> long<00:07:33.089> we<00:07:33.120> want<00:07:33.509> it<00:07:33.569> to<00:07:33.659> be<00:07:33.779> like<00:07:33.930> a<00:07:33.960> nice

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:34.139 
too long we want it to be like a nice

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:35.930 
too long we want it to be like a nice
fast-paced<00:07:34.770> series<00:07:35.069> but<00:07:35.219> I<00:07:35.250> agree<00:07:35.669> that<00:07:35.699> five

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:35.940 
fast-paced series but I agree that five

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.309 
fast-paced series but I agree that five
minutes<00:07:36.240> is<00:07:36.330> depending<00:07:37.020> on<00:07:37.110> what<00:07:37.199> you're

00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 
minutes is depending on what you're

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:38.870 
minutes is depending on what you're
doing<00:07:37.349> five<00:07:37.800> minutes<00:07:38.099> is<00:07:38.190> not<00:07:38.430> a<00:07:38.490> lot<00:07:38.610> of<00:07:38.759> time

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 
doing five minutes is not a lot of time

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.270 
doing five minutes is not a lot of time
