00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
when you're in this business of coming

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.840 
when you're in this business of coming
up<00:00:03.689> with<00:00:03.720> new<00:00:04.290> treatments<00:00:05.130> for<00:00:05.250> patients<00:00:05.490> it's

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
up with new treatments for patients it's

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.270 
up with new treatments for patients it's
all<00:00:06.000> sounds<00:00:06.450> really<00:00:06.660> exciting<00:00:07.350> but<00:00:07.649> until<00:00:08.130> you

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
all sounds really exciting but until you

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.339 
all sounds really exciting but until you
actually<00:00:08.460> see<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.150> data<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.929> shows<00:00:10.320> that

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
actually see the data that shows that

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.060 
actually see the data that shows that
the<00:00:11.099> drug<00:00:11.550> has<00:00:12.240> done<00:00:12.599> what<00:00:13.170> it's<00:00:13.410> supposed<00:00:13.889> to

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
the drug has done what it's supposed to

the drug has done what it's supposed to
do<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.389> actually<00:00:15.540> are<00:00:16.020> making<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
do and that you actually are making a

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.800

clinical<00:00:25.080> pharmacology<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.950> science<00:00:26.400> of

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
clinical pharmacology is the science of

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.210 
clinical pharmacology is the science of
learning<00:00:26.820> what<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.690> body<00:00:27.930> does<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.920> drug

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
learning what the body does to a drug

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.550 
learning what the body does to a drug
where<00:00:29.520> does<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.790> go<00:00:29.970> how<00:00:30.360> is<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.660> absorb<00:00:31.230> how<00:00:31.410> is

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
where does it go how is it absorb how is

where does it go how is it absorb how is
it<00:00:31.680> clear<00:00:31.980> how<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.490> it<00:00:32.580> metabolized<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:34.050> are

it clear how is it metabolized we are

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.780 
it clear how is it metabolized we are
the<00:00:34.230> people<00:00:34.500> who<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.860> tell<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.220> whether<00:00:35.490> to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the people who can tell you whether to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.550 
the people who can tell you whether to
take<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:35.970> drug<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.630> food<00:00:36.870> or<00:00:37.020> without<00:00:37.230> food

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
take the drug with food or without food

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.530 
take the drug with food or without food
with<00:00:37.830> milk<00:00:38.070> or<00:00:38.220> without<00:00:38.460> milk<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.360> take

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
with milk or without milk what to take

it with and what not to take it with it

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.070 
it with and what not to take it with it
seems<00:00:41.610> very<00:00:41.790> simple<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.420> do<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:42.930> it's

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
seems very simple to do this but it's

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.680 
seems very simple to do this but it's
actually<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> very<00:00:43.620> complex<00:00:44.010> science<00:00:44.690> we'll

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
actually a very complex science we'll

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.330 
actually a very complex science we'll
get<00:00:45.930> different<00:00:46.080> data<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.620> first<00:00:46.650> data<00:00:47.070> we'll

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
get different data the first data we'll

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.549 
get different data the first data we'll
get<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.880> what<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.239> call<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.600> pharmacokinetic

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
get is what we call the pharmacokinetic

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.460 
get is what we call the pharmacokinetic
data<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.100> that's<00:00:50.280> really<00:00:50.460> looking<00:00:50.880> at<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
data and that's really looking at the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.440 
data and that's really looking at the
concentration<00:00:52.470> over<00:00:52.710> time<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:54.059> drug<00:00:54.300> we

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
concentration over time of the drug we

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.870 
concentration over time of the drug we
just<00:00:54.660> gave<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.710> we'll<00:00:55.890> get<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.160> PD<00:00:56.580> data

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
just gave then we'll get the PD data

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.670 
just gave then we'll get the PD data
which<00:00:57.150> generally<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.780> collected<00:00:58.230> at<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.470> same

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
which generally is collected at the same

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.370 
which generally is collected at the same
time<00:00:58.950> points<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.580> is<00:00:59.640> looking<00:01:00.090> at

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
time points and this is looking at

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.230 
time points and this is looking at
changes<00:01:01.380> in<00:01:01.410> things<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.130> then<00:01:02.760> we'll<00:01:02.940> start

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.240 
changes in things and then we'll start

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.050 
changes in things and then we'll start
modeling<00:01:04.050> this<00:01:04.290> data<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.770> building<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.430> pk/pd

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
modeling this data and building a pk/pd

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.020 
modeling this data and building a pk/pd

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
FDA is really working with us closely to

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.249 
FDA is really working with us closely to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
evaluate the kind of data that we take

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.440 
evaluate the kind of data that we take
stepwise<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.160> them<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.580> then<00:01:47.940> build<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
stepwise to them and then build the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.540 
stepwise to them and then build the
story<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.929> we<00:01:49.050> build<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.530> evidence<00:01:49.709> as<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.369> go

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
story so we build the evidence as we go

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.910 
story so we build the evidence as we go
then<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.420> confirm<00:01:51.929> that<00:01:51.959> this<00:01:52.319> is<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.560> drug

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
then we can confirm that this is a drug

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.590 
then we can confirm that this is a drug
it<00:01:53.100> does<00:01:53.369> what<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.759> supposed<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.209> do<00:01:54.420> and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it does what it's supposed to do and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.090 
it does what it's supposed to do and
here<00:01:55.020> are<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> side<00:01:55.440> effects<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:55.979> can

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
here are the side effects and we can

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.820 
here are the side effects and we can
actually<00:01:56.399> inform<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.090> patients<00:01:57.709> when<00:01:58.709> you

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
actually inform the patients when you

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.800 
actually inform the patients when you
open<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.190> box<00:01:59.429> of<00:01:59.729> pills<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.300> see<00:02:00.569> a<00:02:00.600> little

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
open a box of pills you see a little

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.840 
open a box of pills you see a little
package<00:02:01.289> insert<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.950> all<00:02:02.459> that<00:02:02.670> information

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
package insert and all that information

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.969 
package insert and all that information
that<00:02:03.509> goes<00:02:03.720> in<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.959> package<00:02:04.289> end<00:02:04.440> result<00:02:04.770> is

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
that goes in the package end result is

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.190 
that goes in the package end result is
the<00:02:05.280> data<00:02:05.580> that<00:02:05.759> we've<00:02:06.060> collected<00:02:06.090> along<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the data that we've collected along the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.020 
the data that we've collected along the
way<00:02:07.349> sometimes<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.369> drown<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
way sometimes you can get drown in the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.720 
way sometimes you can get drown in the
data<00:02:09.240> and<00:02:09.539> not<00:02:09.929> really<00:02:10.319> see<00:02:10.590> what<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.700> that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
data and not really see what is it that

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.790 
data and not really see what is it that
you're<00:02:12.000> analyzing<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.720> know<00:02:12.840> just<00:02:13.410> get<00:02:13.590> into

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
you're analyzing you know just get into

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.699 
you're analyzing you know just get into
the<00:02:13.920> math<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.550> it's<00:02:15.540> actually<00:02:15.780> data<00:02:16.410> from

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
the math of it it's actually data from

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.840 
the math of it it's actually data from
patients<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.640> we<00:02:17.819> are<00:02:17.910> looking<00:02:18.150> at

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
patients that we are looking at

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.070 
patients that we are looking at
at<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.030> end<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.300> day<00:02:21.420> we<00:02:21.570> want<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.930> make

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
at the end of the day we want to make

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.050 
at the end of the day we want to make
sure<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.470> we<00:02:22.620> are<00:02:22.740> doing<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.580> right<00:02:23.700> thing

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
sure that we are doing the right thing

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.670 
sure that we are doing the right thing
with<00:02:24.210> this<00:02:24.390> data<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.350> actually

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
with this data so that we can actually

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.440 
with this data so that we can actually
learn<00:02:25.890> more<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.520> how<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:26.970> treat<00:02:27.240> these

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
learn more and how to treat these

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.390 
learn more and how to treat these
patients<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:31.260> exciting<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.070> every

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
patients it's exciting and every

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.520 
patients it's exciting and every
molecule<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:33.150> even<00:02:33.600> more<00:02:33.780> exciting<00:02:34.080> than<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
molecule is even more exciting than the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.950 
molecule is even more exciting than the
last<00:02:34.740> one<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.820> think<00:02:35.880> it's<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.540> that

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
last one and I think it's that that

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.260 
last one and I think it's that that
keeps<00:02:37.320> us<00:02:37.560> here<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.040> keeps<00:02:38.250> us<00:02:38.460> driving

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
keeps us here and keeps us driving

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.320 
keeps us here and keeps us driving
