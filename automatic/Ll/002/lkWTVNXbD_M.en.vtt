00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:03.879
 passionate tate review smartphone lg optimus lamp 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.280
 Now I showed us two interesting 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.629
 programs for android smartphones 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:11.099
 so what do i do 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.059
 this is a program for that is and earlier 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.219
 multitouch device that is how many points 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.300
 however, it can simultaneously perceive 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.929
 screen 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.819
 do multitouch work correctly 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:24.509
 device is not the first search engine 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:25.779
 program 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.640
 here before he was on reproach and quadrant here 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.129
 and I did a review on these programs but 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.590
 now a little different now multitouch 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.990
 so program call sum read tester 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.370
 Cube of the program by the way for free on the market 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.010
 where is the list h 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.180
 but it means 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.210
 maximum 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.540
 our devices perceives exactly 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.540
 two touches no more let's make sure 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.600
 upgrades our console everyone works without 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.580
 of problems 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.660
 and by the way the first touch is indicated 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.610
 numbers 1 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.500
 the circle is exactly red and white 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.090
 second touch 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.340
 already for turquoise white 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.310
 and she notebooks tobacco 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.470
 touch 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.080
 so what 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.080
 and we already see what we read works for us 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.380
 not quite right 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.659
 it's called im sow version 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.370
 it goes the other way 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.830
 that is, we 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.010
 touch in one place 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.010
 determined by us in another 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.900
 it is of course spasmodic 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.210
 mistake 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.380
 no some additions can 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.650
 partially fix it but for now 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.040
 he 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.950
 users butt monsoon some 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.550
 other androids 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.550
 not very lucky with it 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.760
 such an inversion of the axes 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.670
 the project does not interfere with app scaling 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.630
 fleet and scaling in 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.620
 the browser 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.220
 web pages 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.850
 no difference 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.700
 so scale and so are the same thing 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.590
 here and here 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.000
 in some games and applications this account 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 all the same there are quite necessary things 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:11.919
 but we made sure we had 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:12.829
 let's 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.859
 try to take 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.859
 three touches 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.069
 3 does not recognize and again speak 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.419
 not worth 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:25.339
 this is how a multitouch program works 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:26.649
 tyson 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:29.649
 Now we are waiting for the next program 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.150
 and check how it will earn on 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.109
 her 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.049
 she called my read 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.049
 because I see a laser 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.699
 work teams about the same 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.049
 principle 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.810
 here but here 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.500
 not so much what else is shown but 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.169
 space works it on right 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:57.229
 lap too 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:58.499
 more and eib 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:00.939
 and generally like that 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.939
 not quite thomas 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:05.779
 Not all 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:06.819
 immediately understand 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.559
 run where's the first touch where the second 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.799
 all the same there is no more avenue 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.499
 first program 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:16.540
 but at the same time 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.540
 this program is able to determine the distance 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:23.639
 This we will provide an image please 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.539
 Attention 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.189
 as soon as we have two touches 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.189
 we are both alienating and bringing 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.599
 or letters distance 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.359
 here is a wave that is more comfortable for someone 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.980
 but still him 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.109
 more than multitouch 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.349
 the laser lay two courtyards so he thinks that 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.729
 clear 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:47.769
 Well this is not the only way 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.159
 programs that are villagers that is iran 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.239
 multitouch 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.599
 water and quite enough for that 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.019
 to determine how much 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.090
 touch can support our 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.169
 devices 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:00.699
 Well it was 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.919
 review then Astana 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.989
 multitouch we have a portfolio job to 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.269
 Swank and programs by the way and works with 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.279
 other android devices of all 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:10.279
 was kind of bye
