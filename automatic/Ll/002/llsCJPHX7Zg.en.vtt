light I want to go over a few things
about<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.260> mega<00:00:16.410> bar<00:00:16.650> RGB<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.300> first<00:00:18.300> off<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.720> is

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
about the mega bar RGB a first off it is

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.090 
about the mega bar RGB a first off it is
a<00:00:18.930> four<00:00:19.470> channel<00:00:20.840> LED<00:00:21.840> bar<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.650> means<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.949> has

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
a four channel LED bar that means it has

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.759 
a four channel LED bar that means it has
red<00:00:23.970> green<00:00:24.359> blue<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.689> amber<00:00:25.050> some<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.650> them

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
red green blue and amber some of them

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.040 
red green blue and amber some of them
have<00:00:26.010> red<00:00:26.880> green<00:00:27.090> blue<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.359> white<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:27.930> this

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
have red green blue and white but this

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.290 
have red green blue and white but this
one<00:00:28.199> has<00:00:28.349> amber<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.699> that's<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.000> little<00:00:30.090> bit

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
one has amber and so that's a little bit

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.490 
one has amber and so that's a little bit
different<00:00:30.630> than<00:00:30.720> normal<00:00:30.750> you're<00:00:31.170> gonna<00:00:31.260> have

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
different than normal you're gonna have

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.260 
different than normal you're gonna have
to<00:00:31.650> have<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> controller<00:00:32.489> with<00:00:32.669> at<00:00:32.759> least<00:00:32.940> four

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
to have a controller with at least four

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.200 
to have a controller with at least four
channels<00:00:33.690> hopefully<00:00:34.440> more<00:00:34.590> though<00:00:34.880> so<00:00:35.880> um

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
channels hopefully more though so um

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.990 
channels hopefully more though so um
when<00:00:36.930> setting<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.500> up<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:38.399> can<00:00:38.579> go<00:00:38.730> through

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
when setting this up you can go through

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.209 
when setting this up you can go through
and<00:00:39.180> find<00:00:39.270> different<00:00:39.840> channel<00:00:40.170> modes<00:00:40.350> for

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
and find different channel modes for

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.139 
and find different channel modes for
instance<00:00:42.680> it<00:00:43.680> has<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.370> four<00:00:44.640> channel<00:00:45.030> mode

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
instance it has the four channel mode

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.090 
instance it has the four channel mode
which<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.170> red<00:00:46.440> green<00:00:46.649> balloon<00:00:46.890> and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
which is just red green balloon and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.700 
which is just red green balloon and
amber<00:00:47.520> dimmers<00:00:47.879> six<00:00:48.750> channel<00:00:49.110> mode<00:00:49.260> has<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> few

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
amber dimmers six channel mode has a few

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.400 
amber dimmers six channel mode has a few
more<00:00:49.860> functions<00:00:50.420> but<00:00:51.420> I'm<00:00:51.539> running<00:00:51.660> mine<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
more functions but I'm running mine in a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.299 
more functions but I'm running mine in a
nine<00:00:52.710> Channel

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
nine Channel

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.200 
nine Channel
there's<00:00:53.430> also<00:00:53.579> seven<00:00:54.030> Channel<00:00:54.480> Kim<00:00:55.079> channel

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
there's also seven Channel Kim channel

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.689 
there's also seven Channel Kim channel
might<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.570> more<00:00:57.949> 18<00:00:58.949> channel<00:00:59.309> modes<00:00:59.460> but<00:00:59.579> I

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
might be one more 18 channel modes but I

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.360 
might be one more 18 channel modes but I
just<00:00:59.910> went<00:01:00.059> Monday<00:01:00.270> 9<00:01:00.449> gentleman<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.160> think

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
just went Monday 9 gentleman and I think

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.189 
just went Monday 9 gentleman and I think
that's<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> best<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.629> what<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.840> gives<00:01:04.049> you

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199

program speed and Channel six re is also
the<00:01:21.090> sound<00:01:21.270> active<00:01:21.630> mode<00:01:21.840> Channel<00:01:22.770> seven<00:01:23.070> is

the sound active mode Channel seven is

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.190 
the sound active mode Channel seven is
program<00:01:23.610> speed<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.210> some<00:01:24.540> sensitivity

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
program speed and some sensitivity

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.620 
program speed and some sensitivity
channel<00:01:25.830> 8<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.250> strobing<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.180> channel<00:01:27.540> 9

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
channel 8 is the strobing and channel 9

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.749 
channel 8 is the strobing and channel 9
is<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.900> master<00:01:28.229> dimmer<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:29.520> that

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
is the master dimmer and so I think that

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.690 
is the master dimmer and so I think that
this<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> most<00:01:31.070> what's<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> best<00:01:32.369> setting

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
this is the most what's the best setting

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.090 
this is the most what's the best setting
our<00:01:33.090> channel<00:01:33.390> mode<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.750> run<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> light<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.290> so

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
our channel mode to run the light on so

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.160 
our channel mode to run the light on so
um<00:01:35.570> sorry<00:01:36.570> about<00:01:36.720> them

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
um sorry about them

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.230 
um sorry about them
I<00:01:37.229> had<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.560> plug<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> light<00:01:38.130> I'm<00:01:39.090> not

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
I had to plug in the light I'm not

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.730 
I had to plug in the light I'm not
usually<00:01:39.420> important<00:01:39.960> alright<00:01:40.110> set<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.560> up

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
usually important alright set this up

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.160 
usually important alright set this up
we're<00:01:40.860> gonna<00:01:40.950> go<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.189> mode<00:01:41.840> until<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.930> get<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
we're gonna go to mode until you get to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.840 
we're gonna go to mode until you get to
a<00:01:43.200> channel<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.740> has<00:01:43.920> remained<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.579> setting

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
a channel that has remained a setting

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.730 
a channel that has remained a setting
that<00:01:44.939> has<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.390> D<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.170> it'll<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.560> some

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
that has the D and then it'll have some

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.800 
that has the D and then it'll have some
numbers<00:01:46.979> after<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.270> mine<00:01:48.450> set<00:01:48.750> to

at<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.460> master/slave<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:18.320> there<00:02:18.500> we<00:02:18.590> go

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
at the master/slave and there we go

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.510 
at the master/slave and there we go
DMX<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.540> now<00:02:20.720> after<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.410> address<00:02:21.770> it<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:21.950> one

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
DMX so now after you address it to one

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.430 
DMX so now after you address it to one
you're<00:02:22.940> gonna<00:02:23.030> go<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.210> setup<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:24.050> this<00:02:24.290> is

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
you're gonna go to setup and this is

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.110 
you're gonna go to setup and this is
where<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:24.650> pick<00:02:24.770> your<00:02:24.830> channel<00:02:25.280> mode<00:02:25.430> now

what's<00:02:26.300> kind<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.480> tricky<00:02:26.840> is<00:02:27.020> 9<00:02:27.980> channel<00:02:28.460> mode

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
what's kind of tricky is 9 channel mode

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.480 
what's kind of tricky is 9 channel mode
is<00:02:29.150> represented<00:02:29.750> by<00:02:29.780> channel<00:02:30.200> 4<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.830> channel<00:02:31.130> 1

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
is represented by channel 4 so channel 1

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.200 
is represented by channel 4 so channel 1
is<00:02:31.760> 4<00:02:32.270> channel<00:02:32.600> mode<00:02:32.750> 2<00:02:33.080> is<00:02:33.950> 6<00:02:34.730> channel<00:02:35.090> mode

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
is 4 channel mode 2 is 6 channel mode

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.510 
is 4 channel mode 2 is 6 channel mode
then<00:02:35.750> 7<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.440> 9<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.220> on

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
then 7 and 9 and so on

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.060 
then 7 and 9 and so on
so<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:37.970> set<00:02:38.240> mine<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.420> channel<00:02:38.840> 4<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:40.040> can

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
so I set mine to channel 4 and you can

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.100 
so I set mine to channel 4 and you can
just<00:02:40.310> adjust<00:02:40.430> this<00:02:40.700> by<00:02:40.880> up<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.180> down<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.960> so

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
just adjust this by up and down and so

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.530 
just adjust this by up and down and so
that<00:02:42.230> gives<00:02:42.320> me<00:02:42.470> 9<00:02:42.620> channel<00:02:42.980> mode<00:02:43.130> access<00:02:43.580> so

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
that gives me 9 channel mode access so

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.780 
that gives me 9 channel mode access so
then<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.780> just<00:02:44.810> hook<00:02:45.530> up<00:02:45.650> your<00:02:45.860> DMX<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.520> then

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
then you just hook up your DMX and then

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.370 
then you just hook up your DMX and then
we<00:02:47.150> will<00:02:47.270> continue<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.750> video<00:02:47.870> momentarily

in I'm running mine in 9 Channel moon so

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.320 
in I'm running mine in 9 Channel moon so
when<00:03:22.280> we<00:03:22.400> go<00:03:22.520> through<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:22.850> look<00:03:22.910> at<00:03:23.150> all<00:03:23.300> of

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
when we go through and look at all of

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.110 
when we go through and look at all of
the<00:03:23.570> different<00:03:23.870> channels<00:03:24.850> you'll<00:03:25.850> see<00:03:26.000> that

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
the different channels you'll see that

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.580 
the different channels you'll see that
channel<00:03:26.480> 9<00:03:26.600> is<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.840> master<00:03:27.170> dinner<00:03:27.350> so<00:03:27.530> I'm

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
channel 9 is the master dinner so I'm

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.710 
channel 9 is the master dinner so I'm
going<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:27.770> start<00:03:28.070> by<00:03:28.640> turning<00:03:28.700> channel<00:03:29.390> 9<00:03:29.510> all

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
going to start by turning channel 9 all

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.860 
going to start by turning channel 9 all
the<00:03:29.840> way<00:03:29.930> up<00:03:30.190> otherwise<00:03:31.190> nothing<00:03:31.550> will<00:03:31.820> work

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
the way up otherwise nothing will work

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.270 
the way up otherwise nothing will work
so<00:03:32.870> now<00:03:33.020> that<00:03:33.110> we<00:03:33.230> have<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:33.380> channel<00:03:33.620> 9<00:03:33.860> up<00:03:34.100> we

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
so now that we have a channel 9 up we

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.150 
so now that we have a channel 9 up we
can<00:03:34.430> go<00:03:34.520> back<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.060> first<00:03:35.270> page<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:36.160> channel

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
can go back to the first page of channel

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.180 
can go back to the first page of channel
9<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:39.520> see<00:03:40.520> that<00:03:40.730> channel<00:03:41.420> 1<00:03:41.660> is<00:03:41.930> red<00:03:42.320> to<00:03:42.890> green

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
9 and see that channel 1 is red to green

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.970 
9 and see that channel 1 is red to green
3<00:03:43.970> blue<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:44.390> for<00:03:44.570> amber<00:03:44.930> I'll<00:03:45.620> start<00:03:45.920> by

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
3 blue and for amber I'll start by

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.070 
3 blue and for amber I'll start by
bringing<00:03:46.160> channel<00:03:46.640> 1<00:03:46.820> up<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:47.209> you'll<00:03:47.810> notice

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
bringing channel 1 up and you'll notice

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.440 
bringing channel 1 up and you'll notice
that<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:48.410> light<00:03:48.890> illuminates<00:03:49.430> in<00:03:49.640> red<00:03:49.910> on<00:03:50.330> the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
that the light illuminates in red on the

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.550 
that the light illuminates in red on the
ceiling<00:03:51.160> channel<00:03:52.160> 2<00:03:52.660> is<00:03:53.660> green<00:03:54.110> kind<00:03:54.470> of

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
ceiling channel 2 is green kind of

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.520 
ceiling channel 2 is green kind of
creates<00:03:54.830> a<00:03:54.890> yellow<00:03:55.250> color<00:03:56.020> ok<00:03:57.020> I<00:03:57.050> turned<00:03:57.350> off

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
creates a yellow color ok I turned off

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.130 
creates a yellow color ok I turned off
the<00:03:57.560> red<00:03:57.920> turn<00:03:58.489> off<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.790> green<00:03:59.000> Channel<00:03:59.840> 3<00:04:00.050> is

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
the red turn off the green Channel 3 is

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.770 
the red turn off the green Channel 3 is
blue<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.910> then<00:04:02.030> I'll<00:04:02.120> turn<00:04:02.300> that<00:04:02.480> one<00:04:02.600> off<00:04:02.720> and

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
blue and then I'll turn that one off and

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.440 
blue and then I'll turn that one off and
channel<00:04:03.230> 4<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:03.739> Amber<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:04.970> it's<00:04:05.150> kind<00:04:05.300> of<00:04:05.330> like

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
channel 4 is Amber and it's kind of like

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.260 
channel 4 is Amber and it's kind of like
an<00:04:05.540> orange<00:04:05.780> II<00:04:05.959> color<00:04:06.430> can<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.489> so<00:04:07.670> that's<00:04:08.150> the

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
an orange II color can you so that's the

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.259 
an orange II color can you so that's the
basic<00:04:08.660> colors<00:04:09.400> after<00:04:10.400> that<00:04:10.550> we<00:04:10.700> have<00:04:10.910> color

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
basic colors after that we have color

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.360 
basic colors after that we have color
macro<00:04:11.720> so<00:04:12.110> as<00:04:12.860> I<00:04:13.070> start<00:04:13.370> sliding<00:04:14.800> channel<00:04:15.800> 5<00:04:16.100> up

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
macro so as I start sliding channel 5 up

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.719 
macro so as I start sliding channel 5 up
it<00:04:17.359> just<00:04:17.630> changes<00:04:18.080> as<00:04:18.350> I<00:04:18.590> slowly<00:04:20.500> move<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:21.729> move

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
it just changes as I slowly move it move

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.580 
it just changes as I slowly move it move
the<00:04:22.760> slider<00:04:23.090> so<00:04:23.570> that's<00:04:23.720> pretty<00:04:24.169> cool

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
the slider so that's pretty cool

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.460 
the slider so that's pretty cool
now<00:04:25.590> channel<00:04:25.890> 6<00:04:26.760> that<00:04:27.570> is<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.810> program<00:04:28.260> mode

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
now channel 6 that is the program mode

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.410 
now channel 6 that is the program mode
but<00:04:29.370> in<00:04:29.520> order<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:29.850> do<00:04:30.060> it

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
but in order to do it

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.560 
but in order to do it
channel<00:04:30.930> 7<00:04:31.170> is<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.620> program<00:04:31.980> speed<00:04:32.490> so<00:04:33.480> we're

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
channel 7 is the program speed so we're

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.180 
channel 7 is the program speed so we're
going<00:04:33.660> to<00:04:33.750> have<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.960> bring<00:04:34.110> up<00:04:34.290> channel<00:04:34.620> 7<00:04:35.040> all

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
going to have to bring up channel 7 all

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.610 
going to have to bring up channel 7 all
the<00:04:35.310> way<00:04:35.430> that's<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.270> fastest<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.560> I'll

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
the way that's the fastest and I'll

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.170 
the way that's the fastest and I'll
start<00:04:37.920> bringing<00:04:38.040> up<00:04:38.310> channel<00:04:38.640> 6<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.120> that

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
start bringing up channel 6 and that

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.210 
start bringing up channel 6 and that
just<00:04:39.360> runs<00:04:39.510> it<00:04:39.660> through<00:04:39.690> programs<00:04:40.200> you<00:04:41.070> can

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
just runs it through programs you can

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.800 
just runs it through programs you can
adjust<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.760> speed<00:04:42.090> of<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.300> program<00:04:42.630> by

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
adjust the speed of the program by

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.010 
adjust the speed of the program by
bringing<00:04:43.110> that<00:04:43.200> down<00:04:43.500> channel<00:04:44.220> 7

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
bringing that down channel 7

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.410 
bringing that down channel 7
so<00:04:46.020> all<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.290> way<00:04:46.380> back<00:04:46.530> up<00:04:46.760> slowing<00:04:47.760> it<00:04:48.060> down<00:04:48.090> a

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
so all the way back up slowing it down a

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.810 
so all the way back up slowing it down a
little<00:04:48.630> bit<00:04:49.070> so<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.160> can<00:04:50.190> just<00:04:50.370> kind<00:04:50.550> of<00:04:50.580> play

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
little bit so you can just kind of play

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.610 
little bit so you can just kind of play
with<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:51.150> settings<00:04:51.570> you<00:04:51.720> like<00:04:51.900> or<00:04:52.500> the

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
with the settings you like or the

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.510 
with the settings you like or the
programs<00:04:54.860> all<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.070> way<00:04:56.160> up<00:04:56.250> and<00:04:56.340> then<00:04:56.430> the

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
programs all the way up and then the

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.210 
programs all the way up and then the
very<00:04:56.730> top<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.150> sound<00:04:57.420> active<00:04:57.810> mode<00:04:58.020> so<00:04:58.950> if<00:04:59.100> I

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
very top is sound active mode so if I

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.590 
very top is sound active mode so if I
start<00:04:59.640> making<00:05:00.890> banging<00:05:01.890> on<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.100> table<00:05:02.600> it'll

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
start making banging on the table it'll

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.870 
start making banging on the table it'll
change<00:05:03.870> colors<00:05:04.410> so<00:05:05.190> I'm<00:05:05.250> gonna<00:05:05.370> bring<00:05:05.550> these

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
change colors so I'm gonna bring these

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.570 
change colors so I'm gonna bring these
two<00:05:06.090> back<00:05:06.420> in<00:05:07.100> so<00:05:08.100> I'm<00:05:08.160> gonna<00:05:08.250> bring<00:05:08.370> up<00:05:08.550> a

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
two back in so I'm gonna bring up a

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.280 
two back in so I'm gonna bring up a
white<00:05:09.030> color<00:05:09.300> which<00:05:09.510> is<00:05:09.630> all<00:05:09.840> of<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.170> colors

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
white color which is all of the colors

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.710 
white color which is all of the colors
combined<00:05:10.770> it<00:05:11.640> kind<00:05:11.850> of<00:05:11.910> registers<00:05:12.330> this<00:05:12.480> blue

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
combined it kind of registers this blue

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.880 
combined it kind of registers this blue
a<00:05:12.750> little<00:05:13.050> bit<00:05:13.170> on<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.350> camera<00:05:13.650> but<00:05:13.770> it's

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
a little bit on the camera but it's

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.550 
a little bit on the camera but it's
white<00:05:14.160> and<00:05:14.990> so<00:05:15.990> now<00:05:16.140> we're<00:05:16.260> gonna<00:05:16.350> go<00:05:16.500> to

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
white and so now we're gonna go to

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.530 
white and so now we're gonna go to
channel<00:05:16.920> eight<00:05:17.070> channel<00:05:17.730> a<00:05:17.790> just<00:05:17.970> a<00:05:18.060> strobing

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
channel eight channel a just a strobing

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.360 
channel eight channel a just a strobing
channel<00:05:19.080> so<00:05:19.380> I'll<00:05:19.500> bring<00:05:19.710> that<00:05:19.770> up<00:05:19.950> and<00:05:20.280> it

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
channel so I'll bring that up and it

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.120 
channel so I'll bring that up and it
makes<00:05:20.910> it<00:05:21.030> goes<00:05:21.180> off<00:05:21.530> then<00:05:22.530> as<00:05:22.650> we<00:05:22.770> bring<00:05:22.920> it<00:05:23.040> up

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
makes it goes off then as we bring it up

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.710 
makes it goes off then as we bring it up
more<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:24.000> flashing<00:05:24.720> will<00:05:24.840> increase<00:05:25.460> and

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
more the flashing will increase and

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.660 
more the flashing will increase and
that's<00:05:27.720> all<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:27.930> way<00:05:28.020> at<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.170> top<00:05:28.670> right

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
that's all the way at the top right

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.850 
that's all the way at the top right
there<00:05:29.880> and<00:05:30.420> that's<00:05:30.780> as<00:05:30.960> fast<00:05:31.110> as<00:05:31.290> it'll<00:05:31.530> go

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
there and that's as fast as it'll go

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.190 
there and that's as fast as it'll go
and<00:05:32.760> it's<00:05:32.940> really<00:05:33.090> strobing<00:05:33.600> here<00:05:33.810> it<00:05:33.870> doesn't

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
and it's really strobing here it doesn't

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.380 
and it's really strobing here it doesn't
really<00:05:34.320> register<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.950> camera<00:05:35.310> but<00:05:36.150> we<00:05:36.240> can

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
really register the camera but we can

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.940 
really register the camera but we can
bring<00:05:36.540> it<00:05:36.630> back<00:05:36.660> down<00:05:36.930> and<00:05:37.170> it's<00:05:37.320> just<00:05:37.530> a<00:05:37.620> solid

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
bring it back down and it's just a solid

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.700 
bring it back down and it's just a solid
again<00:05:38.190> and<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:40.020> that<00:05:40.170> takes<00:05:40.290> us<00:05:40.470> pretty<00:05:40.650> much

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
again and so that takes us pretty much

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.790 
again and so that takes us pretty much
through<00:05:41.010> all<00:05:41.130> of<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.370> settings<00:05:41.700> in<00:05:41.910> here<00:05:42.800> if
