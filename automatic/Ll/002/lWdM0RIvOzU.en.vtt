00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
that's a bit over running bit let's

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.789 
that's a bit over running bit let's
increase<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.979> size<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:43.020> 250

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
increase the size of this to and a 250

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.940 
increase the size of this to and a 250
there<00:01:44.450> okay<00:01:45.450> there<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.689> go<00:01:48.590> okay<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.649> that

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
there okay there we go okay so that

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.819 
there okay there we go okay so that
actually<00:01:50.899> come<00:01:51.899> looks<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> bit<00:01:52.229> messy<00:01:52.649> like

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
actually come looks a bit messy like

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.710 
actually come looks a bit messy like
that<00:01:53.040> let's<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.369> reduce<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:54.090> down<00:01:54.299> until

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
that let's just reduce that down until

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.910 
that let's just reduce that down until
looks<00:01:55.170> there

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
looks there

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.700 
looks there
220<00:01:58.920> okay<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.970> we<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.780> finally<00:02:02.060> let's

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
220 okay that we get and finally let's

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:20.350 
220 okay that we get and finally let's
give<00:02:04.759> our<00:02:05.759> lost<00:02:06.180> spacer<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:13.190> div<00:02:14.330> an<00:02:15.330> idea<00:02:15.660> of

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.259 

what<00:02:21.360> should<00:02:21.510> we<00:02:21.569> call<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:22.620> be

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
what should we call this can be

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:32.150 
what should we call this can be
copyright<00:02:30.230> okay<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.769> going<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.010> be

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
copyright okay and this is going to be

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.390 
copyright okay and this is going to be
pretty<00:02:32.910> much<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.180> same<00:02:33.630> size<00:02:34.049> as<00:02:34.410> our<00:02:34.709> nav<00:02:35.100> bar

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
pretty much the same size as our nav bar

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.190 
pretty much the same size as our nav bar
so<00:02:35.700> we<00:02:35.819> can<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.090> copy<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.420> paste<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:36.930> here

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
so we can just copy and paste this here

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:45.500 
so we can just copy and paste this here
and<00:02:38.840> just<00:02:40.130> change<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.880> copyright<00:02:44.510> okay

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
and just change this to copyright okay

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.710 
and just change this to copyright okay
now<00:02:45.690> we<00:02:45.750> go<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.049> copyright<00:02:46.350> thing<00:02:47.569> go<00:02:48.569> back

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
now we go to a copyright thing go back

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.860 
now we go to a copyright thing go back
to<00:02:48.870> here<00:02:49.430> now<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.970> make<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.239> copyright<00:02:51.660> sign

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
to here now to make the copyright sign

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.430 
to here now to make the copyright sign
you<00:02:52.019> just<00:02:52.200> have<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.470> use<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.040> copy<00:02:53.910> go<00:02:54.660> on<00:02:54.870> so

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
you just have to use and copy go on so

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.410 
you just have to use and copy go on so
that's<00:02:55.769> so<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.190> same<00:02:56.430> thing<00:02:56.730> as<00:02:56.910> this<00:02:57.120> here

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
that's so the same thing as this here

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.890 
that's so the same thing as this here
this<00:02:58.049> is<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> space<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.190> copy<00:02:59.430> sign<00:02:59.900> so

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
this is a space this is a copy sign so

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.110 
this is a space this is a copy sign so
