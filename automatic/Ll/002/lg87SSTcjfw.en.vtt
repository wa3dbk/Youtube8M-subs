 because I'm still in the ferrari 355 like a good taste 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.550
 surprises in quality still largely turned to garges scrambling not even 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.329
 sure people 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.469

 record gold income in iron bar 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.100
 it's really great to handle the transmission on the one hand and in a 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.219
 together aboard a ferrari 355 as alassane ouattara take it's in 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.810
 million 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.310
 it's my money but it's nothing compared to what many men 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.970
 current model to the one that replaced it is the Ferrari 458 italia 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.810
 which with the projections of the bass widely the 200 million bar of course 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.790
 the new ferrari fifteen years later you imagine well bb brunettes performing 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.750
 much more luxurious much more efficient and probably more power 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.890
 reliable but still in the atmosphere of the sensations the atmosphere 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.110
 of what it gives off pleasure must lead it is extraordinary so well 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.120
 sure south europe accelerator gasa to meet what 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.380
 particular point performance the new cars are incredibly 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.370
 more effective but hey even if he does not have too much candle we are a bit like that 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.600
 we must recognize that these cars brandone already a lot a lot 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.770
 a lot a lot 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.660
 for the good of the country I mean that those who are lucky to have a 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.540
 width debate these measures tremendous match of extraordinary go 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.160
 the detail that kills this week with a ferrari 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.310
 ferrari a ferrari 355 gps is it because worker is a guy like 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.779
 it 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:13.729
 so why not that of turkey today assured and tidy 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.699
 cars and shot on the bivouac 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.799
 we will say of occasion or collection even if it is relatively recent 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.540
 the lascars detail that today makes it squarely for complicity on a 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.959
 ferrari 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.749
 you already see sent this inside 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.659
 united remains to make them believe 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.670
 sarah it was for decades the signature of ferrari c 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.449
 tonight that's the spirit 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:39.150
 % steel gearbox goals with hiv 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.119
 sometimes the lung was still in neighboring pakistan 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:45.989
 % and the river of political sites absolutely sublime and in this 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.439
 generation either 355 and well inaugurated ferrari the box is made pippa 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.459
 air lee steering wheel 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.700
 and very quickly 80 to 90% of the buyers you prefer the other box so what 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.870
 is the country of the coup today well ferrari are almost more 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.450
 available with a traditional mechanical gearbox it's really a 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.819
 fraction of sales and some models he even offers more and yet 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.569
 I especially love it was yesterday it's of course it's much slower 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.040
 especially when it happens it's never very very fast I love this noise 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.090
 reissued bridge this year that clash and when we pass for 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.469
 change gear on the trolley with afp his brute force makes it tonight to 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.109
 paulhan of course it's not always very nice plugs but 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.210
 look it's still 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.160
 until the ific 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.100
 the following months anyway it's nostalgia place 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.760
 at any price I still find that his city to be moved before a 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.770
 month a report was almost carnal with the mechanics and it was still 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.019
 great and more is sublime 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.120
 in addition you see in this interior 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.090
 % of his cars that had noted years still and especially 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.890
 ferrari have come a long way in finishing but it's a very very good 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.560
 these cars overwhelm him more than ten years is still beautiful 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.450
 all were on the other hand a little less good it was first ferrari 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.730
 equipped with airbags and you see the steering wheel and and his uncle more than ever 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.070
 did ferrari but if really it was necessary to integrate verbal for all markets 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.299
 because today we can no longer straddle his work but for a hundred 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.099
 still had to be heard by others elsewhere but a few years ago 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.470
 later I progressed in this area it was ugly and that kills with 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.470
 the years we have encouraged cannes the ferrari 355 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.029
 the ap-hp did however Roman didier barret of the debate it's a debate there 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:15.900
 white laurent slipped 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.010
 of nerdy but I must admit that I will make this ferrari 355 bar 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.479
 andré hadjez adored happily madam that i traveled on circuit because 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.809
 I think that actually 6 to 7 8% 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:29.059
 in asadabad a bit of delay in the chassis brakes all that but 

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:33.330
 if not really what a pleasure to ride today 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.930
