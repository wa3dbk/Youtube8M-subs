go well I know that this is just dumb
but<00:00:17.789> I'm<00:00:17.910> really<00:00:18.119> curious<00:00:18.330> if<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:18.869> use<00:00:19.020> this

effectively<00:00:23.760> actually<00:00:24.210> type<00:00:25.340> so<00:00:26.340> I've<00:00:26.730> never

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
effectively actually type so I've never

played<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.359> before<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:27.960> got<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
played this before I just got it on the

played this before I just got it on the
steam<00:00:29.010> winter<00:00:29.550> sale<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.480> figured<00:00:30.720> that

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
steam winter sale and I figured that

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.749 
steam winter sale and I figured that
this<00:00:30.960> would<00:00:31.109> be<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> fun<00:00:31.380> demo<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.550> type<00:00:32.730> of

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
this would be a fun demo of the type of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.940 
this would be a fun demo of the type of
game<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.059> will<00:00:33.300> not<00:00:33.480> work<00:00:33.510> brains<00:00:34.320> okay<00:00:34.890> so

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
game that will not work brains okay so

let's see if we can turn off the pausing

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:47.740 
let's see if we can turn off the pausing
whenever<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.689> pause<00:01:40.400> video<00:01:41.400> settings

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150

controls<00:01:58.490> cursor<00:01:59.630> wait<00:02:00.630> why<00:02:00.780> are<00:02:01.020> there<00:02:01.229> I

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
controls cursor wait why are there I

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:17.810 
controls cursor wait why are there I
don't<00:02:04.170> know<00:02:04.680> what<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.890> even<00:02:05.010> means<00:02:15.740> fishs<00:02:16.820> so

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
don't know what that even means fishs so

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.800 
don't know what that even means fishs so
at<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.120> point<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.450> doesn't<00:02:18.600> make<00:02:18.750> sense

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
at this point it doesn't make sense

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.370 
at this point it doesn't make sense
because<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.300> like<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.480> great<00:02:24.780> way<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.020> just

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
because this is like a great way to just

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.370 
because this is like a great way to just
beat<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.800> game<00:02:28.610> actually<00:02:30.050> based<00:02:31.050> on<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.230> fact

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
beat the game actually based on the fact

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.960 
beat the game actually based on the fact
that<00:02:31.440> I'm<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:31.950> screwing<00:02:32.160> up<00:02:32.370> typing<00:02:32.820> by

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
that I'm just screwing up typing by

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.420 
that I'm just screwing up typing by
itself<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:34.590> might<00:02:34.770> be<00:02:34.890> fun<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.070> play<00:02:35.310> on

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
itself it might be fun to play on

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.330 
itself it might be fun to play on
hardcore<00:02:35.820> mode<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.410> mean<00:02:37.410> not<00:02:37.440> fun<00:02:37.980> because

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
hardcore mode I mean not fun because

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.160 
hardcore mode I mean not fun because
this<00:02:38.520> is<00:02:38.640> boring<00:02:41.630> yeah<00:02:42.630> I'm<00:02:42.750> surprised<00:02:43.080> to

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.860 
fun to play so let's I'm gonna see if
there's<00:03:22.290> any<00:03:22.560> options<00:03:23.519> that<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:23.760> can<00:03:24.000> change<00:03:24.659> if

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
there's any options that I can change if

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:35.020 
there's any options that I can change if
I<00:03:24.930> quit<00:03:25.109> out<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.290> here<00:03:26.690> yeah<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.720> want<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.049> quit

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.339 

okay<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:36.090> let's<00:03:36.329> turn<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.599> on<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:36.989> hardest

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
okay so let's turn it on to the hardest

00:03:37.349 --> 00:04:00.250 
okay so let's turn it on to the hardest
mode

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.760 

okay<00:04:02.900> if<00:04:03.900> this<00:04:04.080> is<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.290> only<00:04:06.200> video<00:04:07.200> setting

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
okay if this is the only video setting

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.890 
okay if this is the only video setting
that's<00:04:07.950> unfortunate<00:04:08.670> I'm<00:04:09.300> surprised<00:04:09.630> there's

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
that's unfortunate I'm surprised there's

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.660 
that's unfortunate I'm surprised there's
no<00:04:09.990> way<00:04:10.110> of<00:04:10.170> playing<00:04:10.380> this<00:04:10.560> in<00:04:10.740> windowed<00:04:11.490> mode

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
no way of playing this in windowed mode

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.700 
no way of playing this in windowed mode
I'm<00:04:12.150> sure<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.480> guys<00:04:12.570> can<00:04:12.630> come<00:04:12.810> up<00:04:13.140> with<00:04:13.320> a<00:04:13.500> way

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
I'm sure you guys can come up with a way

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.729 
I'm sure you guys can come up with a way
for<00:04:13.980> me<00:04:14.190> to<00:04:14.280> do<00:04:14.490> this<00:04:14.610> but<00:04:15.330> for<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.780> moment<00:04:15.930> it

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
for me to do this but for the moment it

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.890 
for me to do this but for the moment it
seems<00:04:16.980> like<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.640> typing<00:04:17.970> dead<00:04:18.150> is<00:04:18.300> actually

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
seems like the typing dead is actually

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.620 
seems like the typing dead is actually
too<00:04:19.170> easy<00:04:19.550> which<00:04:20.550> is<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.850> exact<00:04:21.150> opposite<00:04:21.540> of

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
too easy which is the exact opposite of

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.750 
too easy which is the exact opposite of
what<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.810> thought<00:04:21.989> because<00:04:22.290> I<00:04:22.320> can<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.770> click

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
what I thought because I can just click

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.000 
what I thought because I can just click
this<00:04:23.910> and<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.480> doesn't<00:04:24.900> continue<00:04:25.320> walking

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
this and it doesn't continue walking

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.040 
this and it doesn't continue walking
like<00:04:26.370> it<00:04:26.520> doesn't<00:04:26.790> get<00:04:26.940> harder<00:04:27.240> I<00:04:27.420> was<00:04:27.960> hoping

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
like it doesn't get harder I was hoping

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.540 
like it doesn't get harder I was hoping
that<00:04:28.320> that<00:04:28.470> would<00:04:28.590> be<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.740> work<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.400> other

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
that that would be the work the other

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.730 
that that would be the work the other
way<00:04:29.670> so<00:04:29.850> that<00:04:30.150> when<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:30.780> miss<00:04:31.200> type<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.620> would

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
way so that when I miss type it would

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.920 
way so that when I miss type it would
actually<00:04:32.130> be<00:04:32.490> an<00:04:32.670> issue<00:04:32.850> and<00:04:33.210> this<00:04:33.660> could<00:04:33.780> be<00:04:33.900> a

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
actually be an issue and this could be a

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.500 
actually be an issue and this could be a
really<00:04:34.140> good<00:04:34.320> test<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.950> how<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.490> type<00:04:35.790> but<00:04:36.390> it

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
really good test of how to type but it

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.150 
really good test of how to type but it
turns<00:04:36.660> out<00:04:36.810> this<00:04:36.930> is<00:04:37.110> just<00:04:37.290> a<00:04:37.410> really<00:04:37.590> easy<00:04:37.860> way

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
turns out this is just a really easy way

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.960 
turns out this is just a really easy way
to<00:04:38.220> beat<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.640> game<00:04:38.820> I<00:04:43.160> hope<00:04:44.160> you<00:04:44.340> enjoyed<00:04:44.820> this

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
to beat the game I hope you enjoyed this

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.330 
to beat the game I hope you enjoyed this
video<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.510> a<00:04:45.750> kind<00:04:46.260> of<00:04:46.320> ridiculous<00:04:46.620> game<00:04:47.100> to

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
video of a kind of ridiculous game to

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.130 
video of a kind of ridiculous game to
play<00:04:47.550> on<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:49.400> steam<00:04:50.400> controller<00:04:50.550> and<00:04:51.140> maybe

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
play on the steam controller and maybe

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.260 
play on the steam controller and maybe
it<00:04:52.290> gave<00:04:52.410> you<00:04:52.560> an<00:04:52.650> idea<00:04:52.980> of<00:04:53.040> how<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:53.580> type<00:04:54.150> on

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
it gave you an idea of how you type on

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.060 
it gave you an idea of how you type on
the<00:04:54.390> steam<00:04:54.570> controller<00:04:54.680> hopefully<00:04:55.680> that<00:04:55.890> will

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
the steam controller hopefully that will

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.860 
the steam controller hopefully that will
be<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.430> best<00:04:56.780> thing<00:04:57.780> that<00:04:57.930> we<00:04:57.960> can<00:04:58.200> do<00:04:58.920> on<00:04:59.250> this

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
be the best thing that we can do on this

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.320 
be the best thing that we can do on this
