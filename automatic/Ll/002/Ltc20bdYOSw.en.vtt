00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.130
 the entire festival demands what we see people we have not seen 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.519
 since a long time 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.769
 people I do not know I often find out what I have I stay a player 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:30.979
 concerts 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.280
 I discovered trio like that for example 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.070
 a little scared to people and then I report tops for musicians the 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.070
 technicians manage it was running and I have not seen these days 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.820
 Well it's the same I think so 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.730
 it may be a year 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.730
 no when we do a lot more people for example like the loads 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.950
 we are counting on the feast of humanity which has run from advanced to not how many 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.970
 people in front of 50000 people 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.730
 an accountant or dancing the crowd we are not happy with the number 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.310
 rurality and you feel for the first ranks 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.770
 and blast furnace knew carnacois must be known that he is fed up 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:05.680
 so two years ago 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.680
 the mount best memories seven senators out I believe 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.560
 more surprising it is true that it is that in the arenas of NÃ®mes 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.030
 he seemed brazil so far I saw I read I saw everything 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.240
 many times with this air will accept it remains a hobby 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.560
 I have to the sweetness of the lnah and no longer so socke 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.350
 his teammate falla the band is formed of my old drums and the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.900
 objects like at a pretty ear 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.810
 I liked 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.270
 I liked that 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.120
 I think that for 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.480
 I like the last record since I'm half Brazilian of web of 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.960
 belgium bertheaume 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.500
 I'll play it from the outset like that it's done 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.010
 because I like them but at the same time 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.790
 it's the thing that more will go through these days 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.930
 the driver their lonely game first 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.930
 like that is quickly building show after 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.120
 pieces of sheet metal 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.020
 not really chances his whole because we do not have time 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.130
 but I compose 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.280
 I have equine demotic ideas and words you have to indicate that a 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.599
 pass like that first of men of faith we try besides some species 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.720
 natives but for a moment I've seen the man never arrived earlier for 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.069
 the hole and water 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.980
 in our job two young people are complete I write articles of 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.689
 written journals or 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.969
 that's what I am we will follow cartoon senart has for example 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.400
 but it's easier because I write I keep going in the car 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.519
 in the train in the bust
