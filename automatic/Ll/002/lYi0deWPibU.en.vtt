00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.569
 ten-point plan for the efficient exploitation of a planet with free beer 

00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:21.569
 intelligent life forms 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.399
 the conquest of alien planets is basically a simple thing 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.940
 Kat submits the population and the title I pay attention 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.930
 that under the five percent hurdle only residents have failed 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.610
 will, however 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.970
 Some disadvantages most semi-intelligent creatures are lazy 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.450
 and no longer develop light work under compulsion 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.930
 Also, one has to constantly deal with annoying uprisings should be about lawsuits 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.860
 70 as a Target May the train comes that most of life forms among us 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.540
 are 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.049
 and were hardly worth evaluating and worth the effort 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.760
 especially in this day and age you should use your resources more effectively 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.720
 think about the future 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.720
 a planet as an investment 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.650
 I bring a planet to cool 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.230
 it is said yes it is 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.230
 cath 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.600
 is ensured that more and more of them need 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.160
 we enjoyed nothing will win - goals 9 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.130
 workaholic creatures who are the production and development ins 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.110
 Increase immeasurably 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.140
 they are so intent on their own benefit that they are not 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.480
 remember that shared Peter Parkes use Frankfurt had sent you the 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.229
 Control over the body language around and up to now much of the money 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.130
 they will conduct next to themselves and themselves 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.669
 he must voluntarily lay at his feet 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:25.199
 prompt 1 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.449
 the preparation 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:31.180
 Confidence gives the appearance and Geppert witnesses that coach 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.569
 use your tie 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.449
 still 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.669
 in fact 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.259
 the money 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:52.299
 the cornerstone of our concept 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.259
 a semi-intelligent life forms associated broom 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:01.049
 tend to specialize to meet their requirements 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:05.639
 what compels them were and services to each other 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.639
 trade and trade 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:24.889
 the 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.889
 from the problems these systems bring 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:34.549
 What 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.549
 he solves you with the introduction of money 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:44.929
 that is she can feel the benefits of the money 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:47.419
 it is 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:52.919
 a universal value knife easy to carry durable and then possible 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.349
 thereby preserving beards 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.349
 it makes you independent of acute need 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.349
 it was now the direct exchange of goods 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.619
 The new system will simplify and speed up the trade and become so 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:10.959
 not fast 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.589
 and 3 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:14.229
 the band 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:17.229
 the central power instrument 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.379
 Now money is needed for everything, which in turn causes problems 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.599
 who has a lot to fear for his fortune is who has little 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.080
 bb 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.610
 and to get money you need to do disk celebs in most cases 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.370
 and that can be one 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.370
 that's what you call it 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.680
 they do not know yet but there are also and I came 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.880
 They need someone to keep the money safe 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.840
 Money at such gives her a credit can 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.069
 It's that easy 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:59.020
 You only have to spend the money 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.800
 pass on
