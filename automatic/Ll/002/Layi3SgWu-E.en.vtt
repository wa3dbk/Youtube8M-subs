00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 
this tutorial so this is called the

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:07.280 
this tutorial so this is called the
sparkle<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.610> basically<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.299> sparkle<00:01:06.750> exists

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
sparkle and basically the sparkle exists

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.980 
sparkle and basically the sparkle exists
on<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.619> very<00:01:07.829> edge<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:08.999> you<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.450> so

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
on the very edge just like you see so

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.629 
on the very edge just like you see so
essentially<00:01:10.499> have<00:01:10.710> all<00:01:10.859> this<00:01:11.009> gorgeous<00:01:11.219> red

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:11.639 
essentially have all this gorgeous red

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:13.429 
essentially have all this gorgeous red
and<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.030> just<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.329> hint<00:01:12.539> of<00:01:12.659> sparkle<00:01:12.929> at<00:01:13.289> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and then just a hint of sparkle at the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.800 
and then just a hint of sparkle at the
end<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.249> as<00:01:14.609> I<00:01:14.850> pull<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.179> out<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.509> will<00:01:15.630> notice

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
end so as I pull it out you will notice

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.660 
end so as I pull it out you will notice
that<00:01:16.109> the<00:01:16.259> yarn<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.770> kind<00:01:17.039> of<00:01:17.100> spinning<00:01:17.369> you

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that the yarn is kind of spinning you

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.910 
that the yarn is kind of spinning you
see<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.329> and<00:01:18.569> this<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.229> why<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.380> want<00:01:19.709> you<00:01:19.829> to

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
see that and this is why I want you to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.739 
see that and this is why I want you to
pull<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.189> from<00:01:20.219> the<00:01:20.399> center<00:01:20.729> because<00:01:20.939> as<00:01:21.299> you

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:21.749 
pull it from the center because as you

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:23.359 
pull it from the center because as you
pull<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.289> start<00:01:22.590> working<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.159> in

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
pull and you start working on it in

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.370 
pull and you start working on it in
order<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.030> unspin<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.929> just<00:01:25.109> have<00:01:25.259> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
order to unspin that you just have to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.129 
order to unspin that you just have to
turn<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:25.709> ball<00:01:25.859> just<00:01:26.429> like<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.659> that's<00:01:28.020> a

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:28.139 
turn your ball just like so and that's a

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:30.349 
turn your ball just like so and that's a
lot<00:01:28.289> easier<00:01:28.499> than<00:01:29.219> taking<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.819> ball<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
lot easier than taking this ball and

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:31.910 
lot easier than taking this ball and
kind<00:01:30.569> of<00:01:30.659> flipping<00:01:30.959> it<00:01:31.020> all<00:01:31.200> around<00:01:31.469> if<00:01:31.740> you're

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
kind of flipping it all around if you're

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.999 
kind of flipping it all around if you're
going<00:01:32.369> from<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.639> outside<00:01:32.779> so<00:01:33.779> that<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.229> really

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
going from the outside so that is really

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.849 
going from the outside so that is really
a<00:01:35.369> tip<00:01:35.729> number<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.959> essentially<00:01:37.469> I<00:01:37.499> want

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
a tip number one so essentially I want

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:39.620 
a tip number one so essentially I want
you<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.369> grab<00:01:38.520> your<00:01:38.579> crochet<00:01:38.909> hook<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.450> we

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
you to grab your crochet hook and we

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.690 
you to grab your crochet hook and we
want<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.959> work<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:40.409> outside<00:01:40.829> edges<00:01:41.100> only

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
want to work on the outside edges only

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.239 
want to work on the outside edges only
so<00:01:42.270> I'm<00:01:42.450> gonna<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.929> come<00:01:43.109> over<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.859> it's<00:01:44.009> one

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
so I'm gonna just come over so it's one

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.550 
so I'm gonna just come over so it's one
in<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.049> I'm<00:01:46.170> going<00:01:46.289> to<00:01:46.319> come

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
in just like so and I'm going to come

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.879 
in just like so and I'm going to come
from<00:01:46.709> the<00:01:46.889> back<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.849> front<00:01:47.999> and

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:48.889 
from the back to the front and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:51.469 
from the back to the front and
essentially<00:01:49.889> I'm<00:01:50.069> gonna<00:01:50.249> skip<00:01:50.579> over<00:01:50.789> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
essentially I'm gonna skip over the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.419 
essentially I'm gonna skip over the
middle<00:01:51.719> one<00:01:51.869> here<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.380> go<00:01:52.859> to<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.009> next<00:01:53.249> one

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
middle one here and go to the next one

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.339 
middle one here and go to the next one
back<00:01:53.639> to<00:01:53.880> front<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.389> want<00:01:54.599> a<00:01:54.659> total<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:55.079> five

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:55.349 
back to front and I want a total of five

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.069 
back to front and I want a total of five
so<00:01:56.159> back<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.939> front<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.359> just<00:01:57.539> opening<00:01:57.959> it

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
so back to the front so just opening it

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.279 
so back to the front so just opening it
back<00:01:58.709> to<00:01:58.889> front<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.869> you<00:02:00.869> will<00:02:01.020> get<00:02:01.200> yourself

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
back to front and you will get yourself

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.349 
back to front and you will get yourself
into<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.009> rhythm<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.669> doing<00:02:03.029> this<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.240> I've

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
into the rhythm of doing this and I've

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.659 
into the rhythm of doing this and I've
already<00:02:03.479> lost<00:02:03.719> count<00:02:04.079> that's<00:02:04.380> how<00:02:05.340> well<00:02:05.549> my

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:05.669 
already lost count that's how well my

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:09.109 
already lost count that's how well my
rhythm<00:02:05.999> is<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.389> one<00:02:07.079> two<00:02:07.319> three<00:02:07.649> four<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.310> I

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
rhythm is and one two three four and I

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.960 
rhythm is and one two three four and I
have<00:02:09.270> five<00:02:09.959> now<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.580> now<00:02:11.760> what

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
have five now just like so so now what

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.819 
have five now just like so so now what
we're<00:02:12.090> gonna<00:02:12.180> do<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.659> from<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.049> front<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.799> the

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
we're gonna do is from the front to the

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.470 
we're gonna do is from the front to the
back<00:02:13.920> we're<00:02:14.640> just<00:02:14.760> going<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:14.939> put<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.209> onto<00:02:15.329> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
back we're just going to put it onto the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.630 
back we're just going to put it onto the
hook<00:02:15.689> and<00:02:16.319> we're<00:02:16.829> going<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.010> pinch

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
hook and we're going to pinch

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.580 
hook and we're going to pinch
all<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.850> this<00:02:18.000> stuff<00:02:18.270> together<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.380> see

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
all of this stuff together that you see

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.449 
all of this stuff together that you see
here<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.040> pull<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.790> through<00:02:21.980> like<00:02:22.980> that

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
here and pull that through like that

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.090 
here and pull that through like that
so<00:02:24.330> essentially<00:02:24.720> let's<00:02:25.080> begin<00:02:25.410> again<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:25.830> just

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
so essentially let's begin again so just

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.220 
so essentially let's begin again so just
gonna<00:02:26.250> start<00:02:26.520> in<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.730> next<00:02:26.970> loop<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.780> just

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
gonna start in the next loop so just

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.610 
gonna start in the next loop so just
back<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.530> front<00:02:29.150> for<00:02:30.150> one<00:02:30.360> back<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.959> front<00:02:31.200> to

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
back to front for one back to front to

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.210 
back to front for one back to front to
back<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.760> front<00:02:33.000> three<00:02:33.540> back<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.560> front<00:02:34.800> four

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
back to front three back to front four

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.780 
back to front three back to front four
back<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.209> front<00:02:36.450> five<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.200> now<00:02:37.830> four<00:02:38.340> back<00:02:38.760> to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
back to front five and now four back to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.570 
back to front five and now four back to
front<00:02:39.209> six

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
front six

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.370 
front six
sorry<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.820> was<00:02:41.940> front<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.300> back<00:02:42.480> six<00:02:43.110> and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
sorry that was front to back six and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.460 
sorry that was front to back six and
then<00:02:43.830> pull<00:02:44.070> through<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:45.450> like<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.320> let's

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
then pull through just like so so let's

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.840 
then pull through just like so so let's
do<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.680> accounting<00:02:47.250> one<00:02:47.370> more<00:02:47.520> time<00:02:47.670> maybe

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
do that accounting one more time maybe

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.520 
do that accounting one more time maybe
I'll<00:02:47.970> get<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.209> right<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.480> time<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:49.380> go

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
I'll get it right this time so we go

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
I'll get it right this time so we go
into<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.430> next<00:02:50.670> loop<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.120> back<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.720> front<00:02:51.959> one

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
into the next loop so back to front one

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.170 
into the next loop so back to front one
skip<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.700> next<00:02:53.910> one<00:02:54.060> back<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.570> front<00:02:54.780> two<00:02:56.180> and

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
skip the next one back to front two and

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.870 
skip the next one back to front two and
then<00:02:57.390> we<00:02:57.480> have<00:02:57.600> back<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.019> front<00:02:58.260> three<00:02:58.680> back<00:02:59.670> to

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
then we have back to front three back to

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.800 
then we have back to front three back to
front<00:03:00.090> four<00:03:00.590> back<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.620> front<00:03:02.040> five<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.750> like

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
front four back to front five just like

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.350 
front four back to front five just like
you<00:03:04.080> see<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.560> now<00:03:05.400> this<00:03:05.610> is<00:03:05.790> going<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:06.000> be<00:03:06.090> six

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
you see and now this is going to be six

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.960 
you see and now this is going to be six
so<00:03:06.480> we're<00:03:06.630> going<00:03:06.750> front<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.380> back<00:03:07.820> just<00:03:08.820> like

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
so we're going front to back just like

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.630 
so we're going front to back just like
so<00:03:09.150> we<00:03:09.660> pinch<00:03:09.989> what's<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.769> hook<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.489> we

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
so we pinch what's on the hook and we

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.220 
so we pinch what's on the hook and we
pull<00:03:11.670> through<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.300> essentially<00:03:13.050> we<00:03:13.200> just

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
pull through and essentially we just

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.020 
pull through and essentially we just
have<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.680> work<00:03:13.860> ourselves<00:03:14.040> down<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.760> entire

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
have to work ourselves down the entire

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.660 
have to work ourselves down the entire
ball<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.630> doing<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.019> method<00:03:16.440> and

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
ball of doing this method and

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.949 
ball of doing this method and
essentially<00:03:17.670> it's<00:03:18.000> all<00:03:18.209> just<00:03:18.600> going<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.780> work

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
essentially it's all just going to work

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.750 
essentially it's all just going to work
out<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:19.410> essentially<00:03:20.100> you're<00:03:20.310> working<00:03:20.640> on<00:03:20.700> a

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
out so essentially you're working on a

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.370 
out so essentially you're working on a
chain<00:03:21.090> as<00:03:21.330> you're<00:03:21.570> going<00:03:21.690> all<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.049> way<00:03:22.079> down

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
chain as you're going all the way down

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.860 
chain as you're going all the way down
so<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.100> is<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.489> sequent<00:03:23.910> version<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.570> of

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
so this is the sequent version of of

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.170 
so this is the sequent version of of
this<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:25.530> is<00:03:25.709> done<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.010> crochet<00:03:26.519> so<00:03:27.090> you

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
this and this is done in crochet so you

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.520 
this and this is done in crochet so you
can<00:03:27.329> see<00:03:27.540> as<00:03:27.690> you're<00:03:27.930> working<00:03:28.079> so<00:03:28.410> let's

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
can see as you're working so let's

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.289 
can see as you're working so let's
untwist<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.280> see<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.519> naturally<00:03:29.910> wants<00:03:30.030> to

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
untwist it see it naturally wants to

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.670 
untwist it see it naturally wants to
twist<00:03:30.510> up<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:30.989> don't<00:03:31.170> really<00:03:31.260> see<00:03:31.380> this

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
twist up so you don't really see this

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.410 
twist up so you don't really see this
line<00:03:31.980> but<00:03:32.549> essentially<00:03:33.030> all<00:03:33.209> you're<00:03:33.360> just

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
line but essentially all you're just

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.000 
line but essentially all you're just
doing<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.230> can<00:03:34.380> see<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:34.950> you

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
doing is that you can see that that you

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.860 
doing is that you can see that that you
can<00:03:35.400> have<00:03:35.610> everything<00:03:36.239> bunching<00:03:36.780> together

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
can have everything bunching together

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.470 
can have everything bunching together
all<00:03:37.350> up<00:03:37.650> with<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.610> these<00:03:38.790> chains<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.329> we're

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
all up with in these chains that we're

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.860 
all up with in these chains that we're
doing

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
doing

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.350 
doing
so<00:03:40.320> let's<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:40.709> review<00:03:41.070> one<00:03:41.250> more<00:03:41.280> time<00:03:41.640> so

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
so let's that review one more time so

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.530 
so let's that review one more time so
essentially<00:03:43.579> if<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:44.700> remember<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.180> go<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.360> the

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
essentially if you remember it go to the

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.500 
essentially if you remember it go to the
next<00:03:45.780> loop<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.560> back<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:46.799> front<00:03:47.220> one<00:03:47.549> skip<00:03:48.390> the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
next loop so back to front one skip the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.900 
next loop so back to front one skip the
next<00:03:48.810> back<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.230> front<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.799> skip<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.370> next<00:03:50.700> back

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
next back to front to skip the next back

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.199 
next back to front to skip the next back
to<00:03:51.120> front<00:03:51.299> three<00:03:51.750> back<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.799> front<00:03:53.040> four<00:03:53.459> back

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
to front three back to front four back

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.170 
to front three back to front four back
to<00:03:54.420> front<00:03:54.680> five<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:56.100> then<00:03:56.640> six<00:03:56.910> is<00:03:57.329> front

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
to front five and then six is front

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.860 
to front five and then six is front
pinch<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.769> and<00:04:01.769> pull<00:04:02.700> through<00:04:02.910> just<00:04:03.180> like<00:04:03.780> you

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
pinch and and pull through just like you

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.050 
pinch and and pull through just like you
see<00:04:04.290> so<00:04:04.829> at<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.040> very<00:04:05.280> end<00:04:05.489> when<00:04:05.880> you're

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
see so at the very end when you're

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.699 
see so at the very end when you're
finishing<00:04:06.450> off<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:06.900> project<00:04:07.140> all<00:04:07.560> you're

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
finishing off this project all you're

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.350 
finishing off this project all you're
just<00:04:07.950> going<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.130> do<00:04:08.310> is<00:04:08.519> that<00:04:09.120> you're<00:04:09.329> just

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
just going to do is that you're just

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.470 
just going to do is that you're just
going<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.720> just<00:04:10.350> cut<00:04:10.590> your<00:04:10.709> yarn<00:04:11.160> about<00:04:12.030> three

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
going to just cut your yarn about three

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.180 
going to just cut your yarn about three
to<00:04:12.570> four<00:04:12.750> inches<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.290> then<00:04:13.680> grab<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:13.980> entire

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
to four inches and then grab the entire

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.759 
to four inches and then grab the entire
yarn<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:14.970> pull<00:04:15.269> it<00:04:15.299> through<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:16.410> remainder

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
yarn and pull it through the remainder

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.740 
yarn and pull it through the remainder
loop<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.400> have<00:04:17.609> on<00:04:17.850> there<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.209> then

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
loop that you have on there and then

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.479 
loop that you have on there and then
just<00:04:18.780> tie<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.530> then<00:04:19.560> weave<00:04:19.919> off<00:04:20.190> the

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
just tie it and then weave off the

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.420 
just tie it and then weave off the
original<00:04:21.289> tail<00:04:22.289> that's<00:04:22.530> left<00:04:22.740> over<00:04:22.979> in<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.400> the

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
original tail that's left over in to the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.640 
original tail that's left over in to the
chain<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.390> you've<00:04:24.539> been<00:04:24.690> creating<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.260> then

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
chain that you've been creating and then

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.050 
chain that you've been creating and then
just<00:04:25.919> trim<00:04:26.160> off<00:04:26.190> too<00:04:26.580> far

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
just trim off too far

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.190 
just trim off too far
that's<00:04:27.630> how<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:27.840> crochet<00:04:28.050> with<00:04:28.770> sashay
