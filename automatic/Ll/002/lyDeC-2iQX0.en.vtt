guys my most popular video I think
really<00:01:58.890> think<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.159> guys<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.549> because

really think you guys for that because
as<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.750> think<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.020> eighty<00:02:01.439> thousand<00:02:01.950> views<00:02:02.100> I

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
as I think it eighty thousand views I

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.459 
as I think it eighty thousand views I
believe<00:02:02.490> now<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.110> incredible

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
believe now and that is just incredible

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.200 
believe now and that is just incredible
to<00:02:04.920> me

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
to me

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.840 
to me
so<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.080> seed<00:02:07.320> its<00:02:07.590> pretty<00:02:07.830> long<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:08.789> you

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
so this seed its pretty long so if you

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.340 
so this seed its pretty long so if you
need<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.090> pause<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.420> video<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.750> look<00:02:09.990> at<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.319> go

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
need to pause the video to look at it go

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.860 
need to pause the video to look at it go
ahead<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.450> I'm<00:02:12.450> going<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.690> read<00:02:12.780> it

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
ahead and do that I'm going to read it

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.199 
ahead and do that I'm going to read it
all<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.200> still<00:02:13.410> anyways<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.850> hopefully

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
all to you still anyways so hopefully

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:26.979 
all to you still anyways so hopefully
that<00:02:15.360> helps<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.040> seed<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.490> 8<00:02:19.400> 10<00:02:21.709> 17<00:02:23.630> 12<00:02:24.709> 1

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
that helps so the seed is 8 10 17 12 1

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:38.479 
that helps so the seed is 8 10 17 12 1
69<00:02:28.580> 68<00:02:31.819> 478<00:02:34.880> 407<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.319> support<00:02:37.709> it

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
69 68 478 407 so that is the support it

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.180

and look at the rest of the map and find

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.280 
and look at the rest of the map and find
out<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:38.940> i<00:03:39.150> coulda<00:03:39.600> made<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.750> bigger<00:03:39.989> cruise

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
out that i coulda made a bigger cruise

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.690 
out that i coulda made a bigger cruise
ship<00:03:40.500> because<00:03:40.860> there's<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.130> bigger<00:03:41.310> body<00:03:41.549> of

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
ship because there's a bigger body of

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.630 
ship because there's a bigger body of
water<00:03:41.880> on<00:03:42.239> this<00:03:42.420> map<00:03:42.890> so<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.250> sea<00:03:44.400> for<00:03:44.549> the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
water on this map so the sea for the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.099 
water on this map so the sea for the
cruise<00:03:44.850> ship<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.870> isn't<00:03:46.170> too<00:03:46.260> long<00:03:46.440> it's<00:03:47.989> 11

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:58.759 

290<00:03:55.010> 3447<00:03:56.540> so<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.049> cruise<00:03:58.320> ship<00:03:58.530> map

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
290 3447 so that is the cruise ship map

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.360 
290 3447 so that is the cruise ship map
where<00:03:59.370> I<00:03:59.430> made<00:03:59.640> as<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:01.260> as<00:04:01.560> far<00:04:01.859> as<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.040> know<00:04:02.100> the

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:58.339 

1479<00:04:53.389> 102<00:04:54.590> so<00:04:55.590> that<00:04:55.800> is<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.009> seed<00:04:56.370> for<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:57.349> a

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
1479 102 so that is the seed for a a

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.790 
1479 102 so that is the seed for a a
city<00:04:59.130> or<00:04:59.520> my<00:04:59.940> see<00:05:00.150> there<00:05:01.139> are<00:05:01.259> a<00:05:01.289> lot<00:05:01.500> of<00:05:01.530> hills

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
city or my see there are a lot of hills

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.219 
city or my see there are a lot of hills
and<00:05:02.039> mountains<00:05:02.190> into<00:05:02.580> that<00:05:02.699> map<00:05:02.990> but<00:05:03.990> the

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
and mountains into that map but the

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.529 
and mountains into that map but the
reason<00:05:04.320> ah<00:05:04.880> back<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:05.910> my<00:05:06.150> city<00:05:06.300> there<00:05:06.389> is

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
reason ah back to my city there is

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.600 
reason ah back to my city there is
because<00:05:06.750> we<00:05:07.050> cleared<00:05:07.349> out<00:05:07.470> a<00:05:07.500> lot<00:05:07.680> of<00:05:07.830> them<00:05:07.889> so

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
because we cleared out a lot of them so

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.189 
because we cleared out a lot of them so
it's<00:05:08.820> really<00:05:09.479> flat<00:05:09.840> now<00:05:10.729> so<00:05:11.729> this<00:05:12.150> map<00:05:12.360> I<00:05:12.630> I

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
it's really flat now so this map I I

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.230 
it's really flat now so this map I I
would<00:05:13.620> this<00:05:14.160> is<00:05:14.220> this<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:14.759> point<00:05:14.910> to<00:05:15.030> touro

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
would this is this the point to touro

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.390 
would this is this the point to touro
map<00:05:15.479> if<00:05:15.660> my<00:05:15.810> trouble<00:05:16.320> would<00:05:16.410> go<00:05:16.500> up<00:05:16.650> this<00:05:17.160> one

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
map if my trouble would go up this one

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.920 
map if my trouble would go up this one
is<00:05:17.550> just<00:05:17.580> a<00:05:17.759> point<00:05:17.970> tutorial<00:05:18.360> map<00:05:18.509> you<00:05:18.690> can<00:05:18.780> get

is just a point tutorial map you can get

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.100 
is just a point tutorial map you can get
it<00:05:19.050> from<00:05:19.949> starting<00:05:20.370> off<00:05:20.520> in<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.699> game<00:05:21.110> this

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
map i believe drownded too much and i

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.670 
map i believe drownded too much and i
haven't<00:05:27.539> been<00:05:27.599> on<00:05:27.720> in<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:27.990> while<00:05:28.020> so<00:05:28.470> i<00:05:28.530> don't

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
haven't been on in a while so i don't

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.370 
haven't been on in a while so i don't
remember<00:05:28.800> everything<00:05:29.430> about<00:05:29.669> it<00:05:30.000> but<00:05:30.990> t<00:05:31.229> it<00:05:31.260> is

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
remember everything about it but t it is

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:41.149 
remember everything about it but t it is
really<00:05:31.650> short<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:32.270> is<00:05:33.380> to<00:05:36.530> 120<00:05:38.930> 706<00:05:40.010> so<00:05:41.010> that's

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
really short it is to 120 706 so that's

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:42.740 
really short it is to 120 706 so that's
the<00:05:41.250> seat<00:05:41.460> where<00:05:42.060> I've<00:05:42.180> made<00:05:42.419> one<00:05:42.599> of<00:05:42.690> my
