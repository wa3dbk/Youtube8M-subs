00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.400
 perched on the Peruvian andes 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.400
 stands the ancient city of machu picciu 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.779
 his ruins escape any explanation 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.449
 who built it 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.449
 hey why his own 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.730
 pes provided with defensive walls 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.230
 it doesn't look like a fortress, on the contrary there are fountains 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.929
 small pools 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.700
 and strange altars in grains 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.490
 there is nothing that can explain how a people did not 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.550
 iron and wheel tools 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.710
 to create this masterpiece 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.710
 and above all why 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.359
 google translator new search 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.810
 wants to solve the mystery 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.230
 perhaps the explanation lies in the bones of majo's beaks 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.550
 pigeon 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.360
 this stone wound was certainly caused by a closet 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.620
 probably during a fight 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.710
 clues are found around the city 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.710
 and below it 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.720
 but also in the stories of real mummies 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.480
 these discoveries will allow the ghosts of machu picciu to finally rest 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.710
 in peace
