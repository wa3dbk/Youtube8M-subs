welcome<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:01.050> is<00:00:01.110> mechanic<00:00:01.709> at<00:00:01.829> our<00:00:01.949> h2o

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
welcome this is mechanic at our h2o

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.830 
welcome this is mechanic at our h2o
Mecca<00:00:02.639> just<00:00:02.939> doing<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.300> little<00:00:03.389> bit<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.570> elastic

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
Mecca just doing a little bit of elastic

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.050 
Mecca just doing a little bit of elastic
material<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:05.040> point<00:00:05.339> of<00:00:05.430> last<00:00:05.670> inning<00:00:05.790> is<00:00:06.029> to

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
material the point of last inning is to

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.880 
material the point of last inning is to
get<00:00:06.330> as<00:00:06.480> much<00:00:06.629> gold<00:00:06.690> while<00:00:07.200> not<00:00:07.440> pushing<00:00:07.680> your

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
get as much gold while not pushing your

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.530 
get as much gold while not pushing your
lane<00:00:08.040> too<00:00:08.280> much<00:00:08.550> because<00:00:08.760> pushing<00:00:09.269> your<00:00:09.389> lane

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
lane too much because pushing your lane

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.169 
lane too much because pushing your lane
with<00:00:09.840> which<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.139> add<00:00:10.320> risk<00:00:10.710> so<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.849> idea<00:00:11.940> is

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
with which you add risk so the idea is

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.079 
with which you add risk so the idea is
to<00:00:12.360> only<00:00:12.750> attack<00:00:13.230> when<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:14.280> are<00:00:14.429> sure<00:00:15.059> that

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
to only attack when you are sure that

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.029 
to only attack when you are sure that
the<00:00:15.330> creep<00:00:15.599> will<00:00:15.780> die<00:00:15.929> in<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.379> attack<00:00:16.740> and

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the creep will die in that attack and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.370 
the creep will die in that attack and
the<00:00:17.850> best<00:00:18.000> way<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.150> do<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.779> stop

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
the best way to do this is to stop

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.200 
the best way to do this is to stop
yourself<00:00:19.590> from<00:00:19.859> 0<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.430> thank<00:00:20.699> completely

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
yourself from 0 to thank completely

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.580 
yourself from 0 to thank completely
which<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.600> do<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.050> dancing<00:00:22.560> around

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
which I do but just dancing around

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.800 
which I do but just dancing around
moving<00:00:23.340> back<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.670> front<00:00:23.910> making<00:00:24.269> sure<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.750> have

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
moving back in front making sure I have

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.900 
moving back in front making sure I have
perfect<00:00:25.470> hit<00:00:27.859> now<00:00:28.859> an<00:00:29.099> important<00:00:29.609> thing<00:00:29.789> about

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
perfect hit now an important thing about

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.450 
perfect hit now an important thing about
last<00:00:30.330> hitting<00:00:30.630> or<00:00:30.929> lane<00:00:31.320> control<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:32.040> just

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
last hitting or lane control is just

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.360 
last hitting or lane control is just
knowing<00:00:32.669> where<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.899> fight<00:00:34.190> right<00:00:35.190> now

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
knowing where you can fight right now

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.620 
knowing where you can fight right now
the<00:00:35.430> lane<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.880> quite<00:00:36.090> pushed<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.570> I'm

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
the lane is quite pushed and I'm

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.990 
the lane is quite pushed and I'm
completely<00:00:36.899> vulnerable<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:38.370> attacks<00:00:38.850> from

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
completely vulnerable to attacks from

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.869 
completely vulnerable to attacks from
either<00:00:39.660> size<00:00:40.070> so<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> very<00:00:41.489> risky

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
either size so this is a very risky

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.580 
either size so this is a very risky
position<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.629> case<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.079> will<00:00:43.170> probably<00:00:43.469> be

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
position in this case I will probably be

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.100 
position in this case I will probably be
best<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.489> either<00:00:44.760> pay<00:00:45.210> really<00:00:45.629> much<00:00:45.809> tension

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
best to either pay really much tension

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.029 
best to either pay really much tension
or<00:00:46.440> go<00:00:46.680> back<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:48.660> wait<00:00:48.809> till<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.500> creeps<00:00:49.710> are

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
or go back and wait till the creeps are

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.040 
or go back and wait till the creeps are
getting<00:00:50.219> killed<00:00:50.430> by<00:00:50.789> deters

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
getting killed by deters

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.720 
getting killed by deters
when<00:00:54.050> you<00:00:54.649> are<00:00:54.769> trying<00:00:54.949> to<00:00:55.070> do<00:00:55.219> lane<00:00:55.489> control

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
when you are trying to do lane control

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.700 
when you are trying to do lane control
and<00:00:56.090> getting<00:00:56.420> as<00:00:56.510> much<00:00:56.660> gold<00:00:56.960> from<00:00:57.199> last<00:00:57.440> hits

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
and getting as much gold from last hits

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.950 
and getting as much gold from last hits
as<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.100> are<00:00:58.250> there<00:00:58.910> is<00:00:59.059> something<00:00:59.449> important

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
as you are there is something important

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.139 
as you are there is something important
you<00:01:00.019> need<00:01:00.199> to<00:01:00.320> take<00:01:00.680> care<00:01:01.160> of<00:01:01.219> I<00:01:01.430> mean<00:01:01.610> right

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
you need to take care of I mean right

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.490 
you need to take care of I mean right
now<00:01:02.210> this<00:01:02.539> looks<00:01:02.719> like<00:01:02.870> a<00:01:02.930> very<00:01:03.199> dangerous

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
now this looks like a very dangerous

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.920 
now this looks like a very dangerous
position<00:01:03.860> but<00:01:04.400> if<00:01:04.519> i<00:01:04.640> push<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.119> creepiest<00:01:05.720> bit

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
position but if i push the creepiest bit

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.910 
position but if i push the creepiest bit
further<00:01:06.229> I'm<00:01:07.100> actually<00:01:08.080> making<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:09.409> really

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
further I'm actually making it really

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.609 
further I'm actually making it really
difficult<00:01:10.670> for<00:01:11.270> my<00:01:11.390> opponents<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:12.110> last<00:01:12.320> hit

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
difficult for my opponents the last hit

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.440 
difficult for my opponents the last hit
the<00:01:12.920> creeps<00:01:13.190> because<00:01:13.580> they<00:01:13.729> will<00:01:13.940> be<00:01:14.119> getting

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
the creeps because they will be getting

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.539 
the creeps because they will be getting
attacked<00:01:14.750> by<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:15.020> turrets<00:01:15.409> now<00:01:15.979> I'm<00:01:16.490> not

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
attacked by the turrets now I'm not

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.609 
attacked by the turrets now I'm not
getting<00:01:17.060> attacked<00:01:17.149> by<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.450> turrets<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.229> can

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
getting attacked by the turrets so I can

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.620 
getting attacked by the turrets so I can
just<00:01:18.830> keep<00:01:18.979> trying<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.670> last<00:01:19.850> hit<00:01:20.090> but<00:01:20.330> as<00:01:20.420> long

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
just keep trying to last hit but as long

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.510 
just keep trying to last hit but as long
as<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.049> creature<00:01:21.259> getting<00:01:21.649> night<00:01:21.890> he<00:01:22.310> does

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
as the creature getting night he does

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.580 
as the creature getting night he does
not<00:01:22.670> get<00:01:22.850> goals<00:01:23.170> places<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.259> want<00:01:24.440> to<00:01:24.500> be

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
not get goals places you want to be

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.960 
not get goals places you want to be
fighting<00:01:24.830> when<00:01:25.220> you're<00:01:25.340> trying<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.670> do<00:01:25.759> lane

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
fighting when you're trying to do lane

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.779 
fighting when you're trying to do lane
control<00:01:26.149> is<00:01:26.539> either<00:01:26.750> right<00:01:27.560> here<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:28.550> can

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
control is either right here so you can

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.700 
control is either right here so you can
safely<00:01:29.119> back<00:01:29.479> away<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:29.840> your<00:01:30.229> own<00:01:30.320> towards

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
safely back away to your own towards

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.279 
safely back away to your own towards
getting<00:01:31.130> attacked<00:01:31.460> or<00:01:31.840> right<00:01:32.840> under<00:01:33.170> the

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
getting attacked or right under the

getting attacked or right under the
enemy<00:01:33.590> turrets<00:01:33.920> because<00:01:34.280> then<00:01:34.460> you're

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
enemy turrets because then you're

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.399 
enemy turrets because then you're
denying<00:01:34.909> in<00:01:35.149> gold<00:01:35.390> if<00:01:35.630> you're<00:01:35.899> finding<00:01:36.080> under

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
denying in gold if you're finding under

denying in gold if you're finding under
your<00:01:36.560> own<00:01:36.679> turds<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.429> will<00:01:37.580> lose<00:01:37.759> a<00:01:38.060> lot<00:01:38.090> of

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
your own turds you will lose a lot of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.410 
your own turds you will lose a lot of
creep<00:01:39.020> kills<00:01:39.259> which<00:01:39.619> is<00:01:39.770> bad<00:01:40.159> because<00:01:40.490> you

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
creep kills which is bad because you

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.230 
creep kills which is bad because you
want<00:01:41.600> two<00:01:41.690> goals<00:01:41.899> it's<00:01:42.350> much<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:42.740> can<00:01:43.240> now

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
want two goals it's much you can now

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.880 
want two goals it's much you can now
remember<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:45.310> last<00:01:46.310> hitting<00:01:46.580> is<00:01:46.850> very

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
remember that last hitting is very

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.350 
remember that last hitting is very
difficult<00:01:48.890> if<00:01:49.429> you're<00:01:49.610> just<00:01:49.640> starting<00:01:49.880> it<00:01:50.179> and

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
difficult if you're just starting it and

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.779 
difficult if you're just starting it and
it's<00:01:50.869> a<00:01:50.929> lot<00:01:51.080> building<00:01:51.619> of<00:01:51.740> feeling<00:01:52.130> too<00:01:52.369> when

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
it's a lot building of feeling too when

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.330 
it's a lot building of feeling too when
is<00:01:53.420> my<00:01:53.479> projectile<00:01:54.140> going<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.500> hit<00:01:54.740> when<00:01:55.159> it's

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
is my projectile going to hit when it's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.070 
is my projectile going to hit when it's
mine<00:01:55.789> damage<00:01:56.210> going<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.479> be<00:01:56.569> sufficient<00:01:57.050> to

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
mine damage going to be sufficient to

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.930 
mine damage going to be sufficient to
kill<00:01:57.289> and<00:01:57.530> this<00:01:57.979> is<00:01:58.069> something<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.489> will<00:01:58.640> need

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
kill and this is something you will need

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.330 
kill and this is something you will need
to<00:01:59.030> practice<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.569> loss<00:01:59.750> you<00:02:00.649> don't<00:02:00.830> get<00:02:00.979> just

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
to practice and loss you don't get just

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.210 
to practice and loss you don't get just
get<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:01.640> right<00:02:01.819> in<00:02:02.000> one<00:02:02.179> go<00:02:02.590> now<00:02:03.590> in<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:03.979> early

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
get it right in one go now in the early

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.550 
get it right in one go now in the early
game<00:02:04.340> stage<00:02:04.640> you<00:02:04.879> want<00:02:05.179> to<00:02:05.360> try<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.020> get<00:02:06.170> to

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
game stage you want to try and get to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.070 
game stage you want to try and get to
the<00:02:06.830> enemy<00:02:07.489> turrets<00:02:07.879> if<00:02:08.179> that's<00:02:08.450> possible<00:02:08.660> if

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
the enemy turrets if that's possible if

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.110 
the enemy turrets if that's possible if
there's<00:02:09.289> no<00:02:09.440> enemy<00:02:09.860> jungler<00:02:10.280> threatening<00:02:10.970> you

there's no enemy jungler threatening you

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.360 
there's no enemy jungler threatening you

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
or potentially going to gank you you

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.550 
or potentially going to gank you you
might<00:02:13.580> want<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.849> just<00:02:13.970> consider<00:02:14.330> pushing<00:02:15.200> bit

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
might want to just consider pushing bit

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.770 
might want to just consider pushing bit
harder<00:02:16.040> into<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.849> enemy<00:02:17.120> turrets<00:02:17.450> because

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
harder into the enemy turrets because

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.559 
harder into the enemy turrets because
this<00:02:17.959> will<00:02:18.200> ensure<00:02:19.129> that<00:02:19.489> his<00:02:19.940> last<00:02:20.239> hitting

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
this will ensure that his last hitting

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.640 
this will ensure that his last hitting
becomes<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.230> lot<00:02:21.530> more<00:02:21.590> difficult<00:02:22.310> now<00:02:26.650> lost

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
becomes a lot more difficult now lost

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.839 
becomes a lot more difficult now lost
hitting<00:02:27.950> on<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.129> tour<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.459> one<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.760> the

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
hitting on the tour is one of the

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.940 
hitting on the tour is one of the
hardest<00:02:29.180> things<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.569> do<00:02:29.780> but<00:02:29.989> i'll<00:02:30.230> try<00:02:30.800> and

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
hardest things to do but i'll try and

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.460 
hardest things to do but i'll try and
display<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.580> bit<00:02:31.970> i<00:02:32.150> can<00:02:32.629> do<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:32.840> anyways<00:02:33.170> and

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
display a bit i can do it anyways and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.369 
display a bit i can do it anyways and
that's<00:02:33.890> by<00:02:34.330> trying<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.420> watch<00:02:35.870> what<00:02:36.290> the

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
that's by trying to watch what the

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.500 
that's by trying to watch what the
turret<00:02:36.620> is<00:02:36.860> attacking<00:02:37.430> if<00:02:37.580> you<00:02:38.000> are<00:02:38.300> just

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
turret is attacking if you are just

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.800 
turret is attacking if you are just
keeping<00:02:39.050> track<00:02:39.980> what<00:02:40.370> turret<00:02:40.670> is<00:02:40.819> tacking<00:02:41.209> you

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
keeping track what turret is tacking you

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.690 
keeping track what turret is tacking you
might<00:02:42.019> be<00:02:42.170> able<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.530> kill<00:02:42.920> most<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.400> millions

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
might be able to kill most the millions
