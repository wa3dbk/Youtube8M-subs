got the right length there and then make
your<00:03:03.440> cut<00:03:04.239> if<00:03:05.239> you<00:03:05.360> use<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.480> knife<00:03:05.690> you'll<00:03:05.959> want

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
your cut if you use a knife you'll want

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.540 
your cut if you use a knife you'll want
to<00:03:06.170> score<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.709> bend<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:06.920> back<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.310> forth

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
to score it and bend it back and forth

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.699 
to score it and bend it back and forth
and<00:03:07.970> it'll<00:03:08.090> snap<00:03:08.360> off<00:03:08.630> or<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.019> can<00:03:09.170> use<00:03:09.410> like<00:03:09.680> a

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
and it'll snap off or you can use like a

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.600 
and it'll snap off or you can use like a
pair<00:03:10.130> of<00:03:10.180> pruning<00:03:11.180> shears<00:03:11.600> or<00:03:11.989> snips<00:03:12.800> cuts<00:03:13.430> off

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
pair of pruning shears or snips cuts off

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.360 
pair of pruning shears or snips cuts off
real<00:03:13.820> well<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.180> way<00:03:14.330> too<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.040> break<00:03:16.220> it

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
real well that way too so you break it

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.310 
real well that way too so you break it
off<00:03:16.489> to<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.120> right<00:03:17.239> length<00:03:17.480> or<00:03:17.900> on<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.170> other

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
off to the right length or on the other

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.790 
off to the right length or on the other
side<00:03:18.650> of<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:20.019> wheel<00:03:21.019> weight<00:03:21.260> clip<00:03:21.560> right<00:03:21.739> now

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
side of the wheel weight clip right now

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.560 
side of the wheel weight clip right now
so<00:03:22.340> we're<00:03:22.519> going<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:22.760> what's<00:03:22.970> happening<00:03:23.390> is

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
so we're going to what's happening is

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.240 
so we're going to what's happening is
the<00:03:23.750> height<00:03:24.140> of<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.350> track<00:03:24.620> is<00:03:24.830> about<00:03:24.950> the

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
the height of the track is about the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.830 
the height of the track is about the
height<00:03:25.430> of<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:26.060> clip<00:03:26.420> of<00:03:27.080> a<00:03:27.170> wheel<00:03:27.380> weight

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.790 

okay<00:03:30.840> we're<00:03:30.990> going<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.170> do<00:03:31.260> one<00:03:31.440> final<00:03:31.620> check

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
okay we're going to do one final check

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.500 
okay we're going to do one final check
to<00:03:32.010> make<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.250> sure<00:03:32.490> it's<00:03:32.670> on<00:03:32.790> there<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.270> way<00:03:33.390> we

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
to make it sure it's on there the way we

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.570 
to make it sure it's on there the way we
want<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.780> nice<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:33.960> round<00:03:34.350> this<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.280> point

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
want it nice and round this is a point

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.570 
want it nice and round this is a point
where<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.850> can<00:03:36.090> pick<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.540> up<00:03:36.660> gently<00:03:37.170> and

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
where you can pick it up gently and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.130 
where you can pick it up gently and
since<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:38.670> hasn't<00:03:38.820> been<00:03:38.970> tacked<00:03:39.300> down<00:03:39.540> all<00:03:39.960> the

since it hasn't been tacked down all the

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.480 
since it hasn't been tacked down all the
way<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.320> can<00:03:40.590> kind<00:03:40.770> of<00:03:40.800> pick<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.010> back<00:03:41.190> up<00:03:41.250> a

way you can kind of pick it back up a

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.920 
way you can kind of pick it back up a
little<00:03:41.610> bit<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:41.940> reposition<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.780> make

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
little bit and reposition it to make

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.410 
little bit and reposition it to make
sure<00:03:42.960> it's<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.920> way<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.070> want<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.430> we're<00:03:45.300> now
