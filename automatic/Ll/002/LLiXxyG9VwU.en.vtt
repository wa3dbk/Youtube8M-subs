00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.820
 Y 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.650
 and good a new way and we're good 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.590
 very funny part since it is like a 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.800
 wrestler something so it's called that spin 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.519
 that ciro mac and well then let's see what 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.820
 that makes me open this move from 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.820
 to turn off 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.250
 he already lowered the volume a little bit of that 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.250
 because they will not let hear anything 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.989
 and well look what you do 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.340
 and well in a moment 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.520
 if from a wrestling communicator I do not know 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.520
 what will it be but good and what you do 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.719
 what it does is take a moment of fury 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.300
 as you can see and measuring so it gets 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.640
 all good is basically the mod just 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.350
 I thought it was very funny and you're good 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.450
 one of the only ones that good one of the 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.290
 few that we have not done and that is for 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.240
 1.2 point 4 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.060
 and well it also has a way of a 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.620
 kick but I could not know how is the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.690
 super kick that sends him to talk but 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.830
 good if you know how to put in the 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.140
 comments so that others also 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.680
 know that I am trying with all 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.680
 keys but not 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.729
 no no no 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.360
 but spend a lot of what is the only 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:43.030
 problem that I see problem why 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.780
 it is normal portico 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.930
 but good 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.030
 and they have to obviously have not had 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.030
 in the hand nothing to get the 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.600
 fury that I want to be called the subject 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.600
 it is legal 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.830
 you leave right click a sunken god 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.160
 so that I can recharge so 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.160
 say it 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.490
 so they can have the power of rotation and 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.310
 as you can see it also breaks any 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.160
 anything that not only kills but 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.160
 it also breaks anything 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
 bit 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.560
 from a quick way down today 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.690
 very quickly to the movement of the 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.730
 egg that I made a moment 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.290
 but as I say, it's just that they have 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.439
 food 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.270
 in hand because if they are not going to give 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:50.900
 very fast look 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.300
 but it seems to me and I hope that I have 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.360
 already we went to how to install it and 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.920
 it is also very easy to install 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.350
 Sorry for not having made video before 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.750
 but well I've had exams and 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.840
 all that but already there out of 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.450

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.470
 it would still be a lot the play is going to 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.470
 see if they have thought 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.620

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.069

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.879

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:17.819
 because that's why 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.370
 then we take and open the world the 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:23.310

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.440
 thigh 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.930

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.070
 and he would like 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.610
 we open it appear two folders results 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.020
 that we are going to put it right now in another 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:54.979
 part and open the engine 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.650
 These two folders are the put to 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:00.310
 those that drag 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:04.060
 of accepting they become open this which is 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.350
 that there are symptoms that doctor wilbert and 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:10.220

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.230
 ready to accept that's all and we're going to 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.210
 stop 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.710
 to the folder that lacks the 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.230
 resolution 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.470
 and that's why we have to go back to 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.470
 wine 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.960

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.009
 ok most current setting in everything 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:32.259
 that and it's just that we make them 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:34.169
 we think and ok but I already tell me that 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:36.900
 is 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.270
 and that are already because I had installed it 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.310
 and well that's all it's very easy to 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.410
 install as in any other mod 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.940
 all are very easy and well I hope that 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.449
