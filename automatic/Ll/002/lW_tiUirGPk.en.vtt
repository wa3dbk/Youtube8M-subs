00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.660 
there's no shiny mark around the face of
the<00:00:35.460> valve<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.510> decided<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> take<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.350> out

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
the valve so I decided to take it out

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.080 
the valve so I decided to take it out
and<00:00:40.430> I'll<00:00:41.430> end<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:41.850> doing<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.420> myself<00:00:42.690> I

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
bought a new way seat cutter

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.760 
bought a new way seat cutter
it's<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.950> manual<00:00:50.489> uses<00:00:50.850> carbide<00:00:51.500> tips<00:00:52.500> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it's just manual uses carbide tips to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:01.300 
it's just manual uses carbide tips to
cut<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> seat<00:00:55.010> this<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.399> right<00:00:56.670> here

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.010 

these<00:01:01.910> are<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.180> cutter<00:01:02.450> heads<00:01:04.810> that<00:01:05.810> right

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
these are the cutter heads that right

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:14.530 
these are the cutter heads that right
there<00:01:06.260> is<00:01:06.380> a<00:01:06.410> 60-degree<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:09.970> this<00:01:10.970> one<00:01:11.560> is<00:01:13.540> 45

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
there is a 60-degree and this one is 45

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.240 
there is a 60-degree and this one is 45
on<00:01:15.080> this<00:01:15.920> side<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.870> 15<00:01:17.870> degrees<00:01:18.050> on<00:01:18.530> this<00:01:18.740> side

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.220 

so<00:01:22.250> first<00:01:23.150> thing<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:23.420> do<00:01:23.570> is<00:01:23.720> you<00:01:23.840> go<00:01:23.960> in<00:01:24.110> with

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
so first thing you do is you go in with

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.550 
so first thing you do is you go in with
the<00:01:24.290> 60-degree<00:01:25.150> and<00:01:26.150> make<00:01:26.690> a<00:01:26.720> cut<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:27.260> clean

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
the 60-degree and make a cut and clean

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.400 
the 60-degree and make a cut and clean
it<00:01:27.680> up<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:31.310> then<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:31.610> use<00:01:31.790> this<00:01:32.030> one<00:01:32.330> and<00:01:33.200> you

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
it up and then you use this one and you

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.980 
it up and then you use this one and you
go<00:01:33.619> in<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:35.979> you<00:01:36.979> cut<00:01:37.310> your<00:01:37.550> 15<00:01:38.240> degree<00:01:38.630> which

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
go in and you cut your 15 degree which

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.810 
go in and you cut your 15 degree which
is<00:01:39.290> this<00:01:39.619> side<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:42.080> then<00:01:42.740> lastly<00:01:43.400> you<00:01:43.610> take

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
is this side and then lastly you take

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.870 
is this side and then lastly you take
the<00:01:44.000> 45<00:01:44.390> which<00:01:44.869> is<00:01:45.020> your<00:01:45.170> final<00:01:45.380> angle<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.790> you

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
the 45 which is your final angle and you

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.780 
the 45 which is your final angle and you
go<00:01:47.060> in<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.540> you<00:01:47.600> cut<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:48.979> cut<00:01:49.280> it<00:01:49.310> until

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
go in and you cut and you cut it until

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.730 
go in and you cut and you cut it until
you<00:01:49.940> get<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.440> 75,000<00:01:51.440> Swit<00:01:51.759> of<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:52.940> seat<00:01:53.590> and

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.340

out here they're about 1/4 inch thick
and<00:04:25.570> then<00:04:26.570> they<00:04:26.690> drop<00:04:26.930> down<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.290> hole<00:04:27.470> about<00:04:27.680> a

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
and then they drop down the hole about a

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.880 
and then they drop down the hole about a
quarter<00:04:28.160> of<00:04:28.250> an<00:04:28.370> inch

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
quarter of an inch

starting on number five first you can

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.040 
starting on number five first you can
see<00:04:44.810> in<00:04:44.990> there<00:04:45.169> it's<00:04:45.350> just<00:04:45.530> starting<00:04:45.980> to<00:04:46.010> cut

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
see in there it's just starting to cut

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.730 
see in there it's just starting to cut
for<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.140> shim<00:04:49.330> this<00:04:50.330> is<00:04:50.540> number<00:04:50.750> six<00:04:51.230> it's

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
for the shim this is number six it's

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.800 
for the shim this is number six it's
really<00:04:52.130> bad<00:04:52.370> right<00:04:52.790> around<00:04:53.030> in<00:04:53.300> here<00:04:53.330> it's

really bad right around in here it's

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.090 
really bad right around in here it's
dropped<00:04:54.310> several<00:04:55.310> thousands<00:04:56.890> anyway<00:04:57.890> if<00:04:58.040> you

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
dropped several thousands anyway if you

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.530 
dropped several thousands anyway if you
can't<00:04:58.400> get<00:04:58.580> a<00:04:58.610> good<00:04:59.320> tight<00:05:00.320> pinch<00:05:00.800> on<00:05:01.540> the

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
liner from the head that's what happens

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.090 
liner from the head that's what happens
it'll<00:05:07.070> blow<00:05:07.220> the<00:05:07.250> head<00:05:07.490> gasket
