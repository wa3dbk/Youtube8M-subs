00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the new members that was a perfect

the new members that was a perfect

example of that now teammate this is a

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.760 
example of that now teammate this is a
dangerous<00:02:27.330> plate<00:02:27.720> if<00:02:27.900> they<00:02:28.170> got<00:02:28.350> spotted<00:02:28.620> out

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
dangerous plate if they got spotted out

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.740

course that'll be difficult team solomid
has<00:07:55.580> to<00:07:55.730> go<00:07:55.820> 0<00:07:55.850> and<00:07:56.150> 3<00:07:56.450> then<00:07:57.380> they'll<00:07:57.560> have<00:07:57.590> a

has to go 0 and 3 then they'll have a

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.170 
has to go 0 and 3 then they'll have a
tiebreaker<00:07:57.860> that's<00:07:58.460> that's<00:07:58.820> the<00:07:59.000> only

00:07:59.170 --> 00:07:59.180 
tiebreaker that's that's the only

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.030 
tiebreaker that's that's the only
possibility<00:07:59.630> otherwise<00:07:59.930> though<00:08:00.200> only<00:08:00.560> three

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:01.040 
possibility otherwise though only three

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.680 
possibility otherwise though only three
games<00:08:01.220> to<00:08:01.370> play<00:08:01.520> and<00:08:01.820> teammates<00:08:02.180> it's<00:08:02.390> one

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:02.690 
games to play and teammates it's one

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.690 
games to play and teammates it's one
game<00:08:02.960> above<00:08:03.200> cloud<00:08:03.470> nine<00:08:03.740> and<00:08:03.980> I<00:08:04.040> believe<00:08:04.370> two

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:04.700 
game above cloud nine and I believe two

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.530 
game above cloud nine and I believe two
games<00:08:04.940> above<00:08:05.120> enemy<00:08:05.420> eSports<00:08:05.840> so<00:08:06.770> this<00:08:06.950> is

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:07.540 
games above enemy eSports so this is

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.600 
games above enemy eSports so this is
looking<00:08:08.540> maybe<00:08:08.840> a<00:08:09.050> bit<00:08:09.440> hopeful<00:08:10.040> for<00:08:10.220> teammate

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:10.610 
looking maybe a bit hopeful for teammate

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.970 
looking maybe a bit hopeful for teammate
