 today we are going to make cookies 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.340
 but everyone probably tore this situation 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.590
 when you want to eat charge 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.289
 refrigerator and there is nothing special and 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.109
 the store go lazy and therefore the expense go 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.359
 all the products that you find at home here 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.669
 I have now exactly the same situation I 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.540
 I want to drain the cookies but specifically to 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.489
 this was not prepared 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.870
 so all that stands before me on 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.010
 table all to use for 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.530
 cooking cookies it can be said 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.870
 there is at any average 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.450
 like to cook healthy snacks and 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.030
 so actually what we have here is 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.870
 oatmeal lesson 5 will not go cookies 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.110
 solid part i'm gonna wrap in flour 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.460
 offended kefir biobalance eggs 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.989
 certainly lingonberry 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.420
 sweetener and not as steam 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.840
 school supplements vanilla cinnamon 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.270
 do not know baking powder and gelatin 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.760
 Why did I take gelatin but I'm interested 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.740
 pull out to see what is out of it 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.979
 it turns out so let's get started and 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.040
 the first step is to create 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.750
 oatmeal flour 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.840
 here and so with the help of a cap from 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.440
 protein is very convenient to die off 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.030
 amount of oatmeal loaves of forests 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.720
 according to my calculations in one scoop 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.000
 breaks 30 grams again change of sam 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.790
 the flour I did while I was doing came 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.360
 very interesting idea to add more 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.550
 slightly and instant coffee in our 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.910
 cocktail 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:55.020
 just as an experiment 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.520
 then I add 1 egg and 2 egg whites 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.420
 I pour a little kefir and add 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.310
 powder mixture 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.660
 now some whole oatmeal and 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.880
 completes combination frozen 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.420
 lingonberry that before us are two options 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.240
 the first can be made from berries in a blender 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.860
 and such things and add on songs when 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.500
 run to the video nor women 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:24.400
 I choose the second option add purpose 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.780
 berries and pick already able and now 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.160
 how to mix and we will 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.340
 spread on baking sheet 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.630

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.630
 Aluminum foil is still scary 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.340
 a little metallic taste 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.340
 cookies don't hurt 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.820
 Well, that's all I threw cookies in 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.800
 oven for 20 minutes at 180 degrees but 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.040
 this time is not exactly why I will 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.560
 look at their condition and maybe a little 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.290
 a little earlier or a little later got them out 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.220
