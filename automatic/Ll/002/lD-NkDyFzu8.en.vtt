00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.539 
even realize that i was already out of
all<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.600> my<00:01:54.869> false<00:01:55.320> lashes<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.100> i<00:01:56.130> picked<00:01:56.430> up

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
all of my false lashes so i picked up

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.660 
all of my false lashes so i picked up
this<00:01:56.909> pack<00:01:57.329> from<00:01:57.689> salon<00:01:58.290> perfect<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.189> these

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.080 
this pack from salon perfect and these
are<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> number<00:02:00.360> 110<00:02:01.460> which<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.640> think<00:02:02.850> these

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
are the number 110 which I think these

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.480 
are the number 110 which I think these
are<00:02:03.149> pretty<00:02:03.810> much<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.380> more<00:02:04.740> natural<00:02:04.979> side

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
are pretty much on the more natural side
