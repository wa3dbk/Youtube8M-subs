00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240 

clearly<00:00:00.390> several<00:00:01.319> Hollies<00:00:01.680> were<00:00:01.860> removed

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
clearly several Hollies were removed

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.730 
clearly several Hollies were removed
almost<00:00:02.490> 3040<00:00:03.480> yards<00:00:03.629> from<00:00:04.410> their<00:00:04.589> foundations

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
almost 3040 yards from their foundations

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.980 
almost 3040 yards from their foundations
so<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.430> would<00:00:05.580> imagine<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.270> wave<00:00:06.450> came<00:00:06.779> in

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
so I would imagine that the wave came in

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.900 
so I would imagine that the wave came in
basically<00:00:07.830> picked<00:00:08.160> up<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.429> building<00:00:08.820> and

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
basically picked up the building and

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.270 
basically picked up the building and
moved<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.469> place<00:00:10.710> where<00:00:10.950> either<00:00:11.099> was

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
moved it to a place where either was

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.370 
moved it to a place where either was
stopped<00:00:11.519> by<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> tree<00:00:12.059> or<00:00:12.330> just<00:00:12.389> basically

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
stopped by a tree or just basically

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.770 
stopped by a tree or just basically
settled<00:00:13.710> down<00:00:13.889> but<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.460> was<00:00:14.580> clearly<00:00:14.849> lifted

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
settled down but it was clearly lifted

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.090 
settled down but it was clearly lifted
up<00:00:15.900> off<00:00:16.020> its<00:00:16.260> foundation<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.890> moved

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
up off its foundation and moved

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.880 
up off its foundation and moved
dramatically<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.940> another<00:00:18.210> location<00:00:18.890> well

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
dramatically to another location well

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.230 
dramatically to another location well
unfortunately<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.490> seems<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:21.000> took<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
unfortunately it seems like we took the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.300 
unfortunately it seems like we took the
brunt<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.779> tsunami<00:00:22.199> wave<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:23.160> had

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
brunt of the tsunami wave we had

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.150 
brunt of the tsunami wave we had
significant<00:00:23.910> damage<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.600> about<00:00:24.930> 16<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.769> 20<00:00:26.070> of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
significant damage to about 16 to 20 of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.800 
significant damage to about 16 to 20 of
our<00:00:26.250> Hollies<00:00:26.609> we're<00:00:26.789> still<00:00:27.029> analyzing<00:00:27.539> all

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
our Hollies we're still analyzing all

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.320 
our Hollies we're still analyzing all
that<00:00:28.160> major<00:00:29.160> structural<00:00:29.640> damage<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.150> those
