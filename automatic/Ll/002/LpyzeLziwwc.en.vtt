00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.160
 good is the same as yesterday only 

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:09.630
 now with common water from the spout 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.540
 here's passing 1111 feet and I've got three 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.620
 3 volts flights with this cell here one 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.480
 point walk 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.619
 so you have a gas production so 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.119
 cute 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.670
 this is the production of gas more or less 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.300
 a great one because a 2-1 to 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.920
 3 volts more or less a great death 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.680
 here are the gases appeared in the balls 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.730
 Apparently more spending appeared than 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:38.940
 than in the water intended for sale now 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:41.700
 changed the container I put the meter 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.290
 temperature thermometer here is the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.090
 same thing with a larger screen button and 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.399
 I put resistance in there now, I'm going to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.230
 water temperature is less than 30 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.539
 degrees and eight degrees ambient temperature 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.190
 and now I'm going to turn on that heater that 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.800
 is simply a resistance to 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.920
 existence the hot ass here in the outlet 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.709
 will start to heat the water 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:12.240
 the hope is that there will be an increase in 

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:16.759
 of production with the same current one on foot 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.759
 now down to 2 3 volts 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.340
 well we have boiling water almost 98 ° 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.740
 cheated less so that I put the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.209
 thermometer almost without degree is very 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.179
 busy 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:32.909
 It's 22 volts 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.909
 Also on the skin now I'll turn off the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.590
 heat source resistance 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.609
 I arrived and will increase a little bit 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.609
 political cell attention 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:49.609
 there you see the production now with two 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.810
 points 6 volts 1.2 amps 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.529
 I truly believe you commented a lot 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.439
 the production yes 

00:01:54.529 --> 00:02:02.630
 2.7 volts 1,311 perez 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.630
 this is the production of gas with water 98 ° 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.859
 2.73 volts 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.439
 at the moment more than this is the 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:14.060
 cell limitation 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:14.060
 2.7 current 1.4 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:24.070
 2.70 the bajaki 2 with 68 1.2 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.890
 or certainly increased production 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.480
 of gas 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.940
 simply by adding heat that is 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:37.150
 I can not get over 90 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.680
 degrees with some reason perhaps 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:45.880
 limit of this resistance to water 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.160
 of the interesting spout that he noted 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.390
 seeing your brown dirt 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.040
 I do not see this generates a clean water 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:02.320
 accumulated the mouth tied in water of the 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:05.670
 It was you who compared the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:10.600
 with the cold water here is now 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:13.650
 94 ° again now friend or use 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.030
 a little bit of water from the spout better 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.560
 maybe I'll do an experiment now with 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.560
 water with a little bit of caustic soda
