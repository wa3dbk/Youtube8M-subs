concept<00:00:17.800> Emmanuel's<00:00:18.369> is<00:00:18.580> getting<00:00:18.910> locked<00:00:19.150> in

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
concept Emmanuel's is getting locked in

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.339 
concept Emmanuel's is getting locked in
and<00:00:20.080> what<00:00:20.560> I<00:00:20.590> mean<00:00:20.770> by<00:00:20.830> getting<00:00:21.250> locked<00:00:21.430> in<00:00:21.610> is

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
and what I mean by getting locked in is

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.690 
and what I mean by getting locked in is
basically<00:00:23.349> your<00:00:23.470> balance<00:00:23.860> is<00:00:23.950> so<00:00:24.160> perfect

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
that you don't even have to move so you

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.359 
that you don't even have to move so you
can<00:00:27.400> just<00:00:27.430> relax<00:00:28.439> think<00:00:29.439> you<00:00:29.950> know<00:00:30.070> you<00:00:30.130> can

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
getting used to just jumping off the

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.450 
getting used to just jumping off the
back<00:00:43.390> you're<00:00:43.540> going<00:00:43.719> so<00:00:44.050> at<00:00:44.980> first<00:00:45.039> you<00:00:45.399> just

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
you can until you feel your balance game

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.810 
you can until you feel your balance game
throwing<00:00:53.530> off<00:00:53.710> and<00:00:54.039> you'll<00:00:54.219> feel<00:00:54.429> that<00:00:54.609> in

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
your back and you just want to hop off

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.009 
your back and you just want to hop off
just<00:00:57.699> push<00:00:57.879> off<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.059> pail<00:00:58.300> just<00:00:58.480> hop<00:00:58.629> on<00:00:58.809> and

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
just push off the pail just hop on and

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.869 
just push off the pail just hop on and
just<00:00:59.800> practice<00:01:00.039> that<00:01:00.370> for<00:01:00.519> a<00:01:00.550> couple<00:01:00.760> minutes

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
just practice that for a couple minutes

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.389 
just practice that for a couple minutes
and<00:01:01.120> after<00:01:01.510> you<00:01:01.719> got<00:01:01.870> that<00:01:02.050> then<00:01:02.980> you<00:01:03.159> want<00:01:03.280> to

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
and after you got that then you want to

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.420 
and after you got that then you want to
start<00:01:03.550> moving<00:01:04.260> I'd<00:01:05.260> say<00:01:05.500> go<00:01:05.710> about<00:01:05.920> medium

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
start moving I'd say go about medium

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.320 
start moving I'd say go about medium
speed<00:01:06.730> because<00:01:07.300> if<00:01:07.570> you<00:01:07.659> go<00:01:07.780> too<00:01:07.840> slow<00:01:07.990> it's

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
speed because if you go too slow it's

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.399 
speed because if you go too slow it's
hard<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:10.480> keep<00:01:10.630> your<00:01:10.810> balance<00:01:10.870> you're<00:01:11.260> going

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
hard to keep your balance you're going

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.680 
hard to keep your balance you're going
to<00:01:11.470> probably<00:01:11.650> fall<00:01:11.980> back<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.280> lot<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.820> if<00:01:13.630> you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
to probably fall back a lot and if you

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.570 
to probably fall back a lot and if you
go<00:01:13.810> too<00:01:13.870> fast<00:01:14.290> it's<00:01:14.650> going<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:14.860> be<00:01:15.010> hard<00:01:15.250> to<00:01:15.310> pop

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
go too fast it's going to be hard to pop

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.210 
go too fast it's going to be hard to pop
up<00:01:15.610> your<00:01:15.909> front<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:17.380> just<00:01:17.560> go<00:01:17.649> out<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:17.799> medium

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
up your front so just go out a medium

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.200 
up your front so just go out a medium
speed<00:01:18.520> but<00:01:19.000> comfortable<00:01:19.420> speed<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:21.090> once<00:01:22.090> you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
speed but comfortable speed and once you

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.469 
speed but comfortable speed and once you
find<00:01:23.040> there's<00:01:24.040> going<00:01:24.369> to<00:01:24.430> be<00:01:24.460> two<00:01:24.759> points<00:01:25.299> and

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
find there's going to be two points and

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.719 
find there's going to be two points and
it's<00:01:25.570> going<00:01:25.720> to<00:01:25.810> be<00:01:25.899> between<00:01:26.520> these<00:01:27.520> two

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
it's going to be between these two

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.130 
it's going to be between these two
points<00:01:27.759> where<00:01:28.210> your<00:01:28.329> balance<00:01:28.659> is<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.899> best

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
points where your balance is the best

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.679 
points where your balance is the best
and<00:01:29.909> basically<00:01:30.909> all<00:01:31.119> you're<00:01:31.240> doing<00:01:31.540> is<00:01:31.659> just

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
and basically all you're doing is just

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.359 
and basically all you're doing is just
fighting<00:01:32.110> to<00:01:32.170> stay<00:01:32.350> at<00:01:32.439> that<00:01:32.560> point<00:01:32.799> so<00:01:33.130> you

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
fighting to stay at that point so you

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.620 
fighting to stay at that point so you
just<00:01:34.240> lead<00:01:35.079> back<00:01:35.350> so<00:01:35.770> if<00:01:35.979> you're<00:01:36.130> going<00:01:36.630> too

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
just lead back so if you're going too

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.899 
just lead back so if you're going too
far<00:01:37.840> back<00:01:38.079> you<00:01:38.500> just<00:01:38.530> lean<00:01:38.890> forward<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.640> if

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
far back you just lean forward and if

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.760 
far back you just lean forward and if
you're<00:01:40.030> going<00:01:40.180> down<00:01:40.570> you<00:01:40.960> just<00:01:41.049> lean<00:01:41.320> back<00:01:41.350> and

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
you're going down you just lean back and

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.190 
you're going down you just lean back and
you<00:01:41.860> just<00:01:42.009> use<00:01:42.310> your<00:01:42.340> knees<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.000> your<00:01:43.659> legs<00:01:43.930> to

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
you just use your knees and your legs to

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.929 
you just use your knees and your legs to
just<00:01:44.380> keep<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.310> between<00:01:45.340> those<00:01:45.759> two<00:01:45.909> points

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
just keep it between those two points

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.130 
just keep it between those two points
and<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.649> best<00:01:47.920> place<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:49.210> practice<00:01:49.479> manuals

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
and the best place to practice manuals

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.279 
and the best place to practice manuals
is<00:01:50.409> in<00:01:50.979> parking<00:01:51.399> lots<00:01:51.579> and<00:01:52.000> that's<00:01:52.509> because<00:01:52.750> a

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
is in parking lots and that's because a

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.099 
is in parking lots and that's because a
lot<00:01:54.189> of<00:01:54.219> people<00:01:54.340> find<00:01:55.210> manuals<00:01:55.689> including<00:01:56.049> me

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
lot of people find manuals including me

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:57.660 
lot of people find manuals including me
I<00:01:56.140> found<00:01:56.469> it<00:01:56.619> easier<00:01:56.920> when<00:01:57.039> I<00:01:57.100> was<00:01:57.219> learning<00:01:57.340> to

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
I found it easier when I was learning to

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.490
