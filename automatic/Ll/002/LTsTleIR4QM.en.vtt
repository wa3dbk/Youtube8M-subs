very<00:00:10.410> much<00:00:10.620> using<00:00:10.830> difficult<00:00:11.759> rom<00:00:11.940> hacks<00:00:12.980> you

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
very much using difficult rom hacks you

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.519 
very much using difficult rom hacks you
can<00:00:14.130> jump<00:00:14.370> off<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.809> the<00:00:15.809> spring<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.440> spring

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
can jump off of the spring in the spring

can jump off of the spring in the spring
platform<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.279> midair<00:00:20.990> Ryan<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.380> switch<00:00:22.710> to

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
platform in midair Ryan I just switch to

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.790 
platform in midair Ryan I just switch to
the<00:00:22.920> fire<00:00:23.130> flower<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.850> can<00:00:24.000> see<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
the fire flower so that you can see that

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.700 
the fire flower so that you can see that
well<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.039> don't<00:00:26.789> know<00:00:26.880> whatever<00:00:27.599> ah<00:00:30.529> good<00:00:31.529> times

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
well I don't know whatever ah good times

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.450 
well I don't know whatever ah good times
good<00:00:32.700> times<00:00:32.759> had<00:00:33.059> by<00:00:33.180> all

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
good times had by all

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.650 
good times had by all
let's<00:00:35.460> see<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.790> guess<00:00:36.239> they<00:00:36.329> don't<00:00:36.420> need<00:00:36.540> to

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
let's see I guess they don't need to

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.190 
let's see I guess they don't need to
stop<00:00:36.870> it

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
stop it

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.220 
stop it
because<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.649> stopped<00:00:37.890> itself<00:00:38.960> let's<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.079> what

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
because it stopped itself let's see what

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.200 
because it stopped itself let's see what
our<00:00:40.320> smother<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:41.399> actually<00:00:41.730> almost<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
our smother it's actually almost the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.150 
our smother it's actually almost the
last<00:00:42.329> glitch<00:00:47.989> which<00:00:48.989> ones<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.500> one<00:00:49.680> oh<00:00:49.800> oh

last glitch which ones this one oh oh
this<00:00:50.460> one's<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> weird<00:00:50.910> glitch<00:00:51.059> how<00:00:51.719> does<00:00:51.870> it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
this one's a weird glitch how does it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.510 
this one's a weird glitch how does it
work<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.430> it<00:00:53.449> doesn't<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:54.629> make<00:00:54.809> any<00:00:55.020> sense

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
work in it doesn't really make any sense

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.930 
work in it doesn't really make any sense
okay<00:00:59.539> basically<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.350> eat<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> blue<00:01:01.890> oh<00:01:02.340> if

and then land on them and start flying
the<00:01:12.119> second<00:01:12.689> UI<00:01:13.520> it's<00:01:14.520> not<00:01:14.640> gonna<00:01:14.790> work<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.060> I

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
the second UI it's not gonna work as I

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.370 
the second UI it's not gonna work as I
touch<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.509> ground<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.869> can't<00:01:16.049> touch<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
touch the ground you can't touch the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.050 
touch the ground you can't touch the
ground<00:01:16.409> either<00:01:22.520> there<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:23.670> let's<00:01:23.880> see<00:01:24.000> if

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
ground either there we go let's see if

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.010 
ground either there we go let's see if
it<00:01:24.150> worked<00:01:24.830> nope

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.060 

I<00:01:31.229> don't<00:01:32.229> know<00:01:32.320> how<00:01:32.409> I<00:01:32.470> did<00:01:32.649> this<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:32.890> easily

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
I don't know how I did this so easily

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.910 
I don't know how I did this so easily
before<00:01:33.340> I<00:01:33.729> was<00:01:33.939> doing<00:01:34.060> it<00:01:34.210> pretty<00:01:36.810> hairy<00:01:37.810> oh

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
before I was doing it pretty hairy oh

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.600 
before I was doing it pretty hairy oh
let's<00:01:38.920> see<00:01:39.040> if<00:01:39.100> this<00:01:39.250> works

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
let's see if this works

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.090 
let's see if this works
see<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.930> it<00:01:41.530> makes<00:01:41.770> you<00:01:42.039> invincible<00:01:43.770> nope

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
see like it makes you invincible nope

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.010 
see like it makes you invincible nope
it<00:01:45.340> also<00:01:45.820> only<00:01:46.090> lasts<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.479> certain<00:01:46.750> amount<00:01:46.899> of

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
it also only lasts a certain amount of

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.320 
it also only lasts a certain amount of
time<00:01:47.200> it's<00:01:47.830> really<00:01:48.009> weird<00:01:48.310> though<00:01:48.520> I<00:01:48.759> don't

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
time it's really weird though I don't

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.419 
time it's really weird though I don't
quite<00:01:49.450> understand<00:01:49.960> it<00:01:50.250> maybe<00:01:51.250> it<00:01:51.340> has

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
quite understand it maybe it has

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:52.590 
quite understand it maybe it has
something<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:51.729> do<00:01:51.939> with<00:01:51.970> it<00:01:52.240> thinks<00:01:52.509> you're

and I think you have to be going from

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.510 
and I think you have to be going from
left<00:03:54.050> to<00:03:54.170> right<00:03:54.380> it<00:03:54.590> doesn't<00:03:54.770> work<00:03:55.010> any<00:03:55.430> other

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
left to right it doesn't work any other

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.780 
left to right it doesn't work any other
way<00:03:56.290> you're<00:03:57.290> you<00:03:57.590> like<00:03:57.709> guarantee<00:03:58.310> yourself

definitely needed TAS to do that
well<00:04:43.400> not<00:04:43.729> ask<00:04:44.360> just<00:04:44.840> tool<00:04:45.020> assisted<00:04:45.850> there's

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850
