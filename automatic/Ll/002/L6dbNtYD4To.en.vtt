show<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> notch<00:00:48.090> system<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.539> might<00:00:48.690> even

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
show you the notch system you might even

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.040 
show you the notch system you might even
be<00:00:48.930> able<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.260> hear<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.940> clips<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.090> there<00:00:51.270> but

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
setting the drag is really simple just

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.180 
setting the drag is really simple just
turning<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.510> dial<00:00:54.719> back<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.350> forth<00:00:55.559> for

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
turning this dial back and forth for

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.670 
turning this dial back and forth for
more<00:00:56.370> or<00:00:56.460> less<00:00:56.489> drag<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.480> white<00:00:57.660> dot<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:58.530> here

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
more or less drag the white dot up here

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.689 
more or less drag the white dot up here
indicates<00:00:59.399> strike<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.539> then<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.140> course<00:01:01.699> you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
indicates strike and then of course you

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.850 
indicates strike and then of course you
can<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.300> more<00:01:03.629> more<00:01:04.290> room<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.589> go

so<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.390> know<00:01:39.479> 300<00:01:39.840> yards<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.200> 50<00:01:40.530> maybe<00:01:41.400> 300

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
so you know 300 yards of 50 maybe 300

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.240 
so you know 300 yards of 50 maybe 300
yards<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.659> 65<00:01:43.079> pound<00:01:43.320> braid<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.619> using<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.009> one

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
yards of 65 pound braid if using a one

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.999 
yards of 65 pound braid if using a one
of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.399> newer<00:01:44.579> thinner<00:01:44.909> braids<00:01:45.590> 22<00:01:46.590> pounds<00:01:46.920> of
