00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
possible the EBA is also cord out so you

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.870 
possible the EBA is also cord out so you
can<00:01:39.259> see<00:01:39.439> right<00:01:39.469> into<00:01:39.709> the<00:01:40.280> upper<00:01:40.700> material

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
can see right into the upper material

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.630 
can see right into the upper material
right<00:01:41.750> below<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.020> so<00:01:42.799> not<00:01:43.099> only<00:01:43.130> looking<00:01:43.549> at

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
right below it so not only looking at

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.339 
right below it so not only looking at
lightweight<00:01:44.000> materials<00:01:44.509> but<00:01:44.810> also<00:01:44.990> how<00:01:45.319> we

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
lightweight materials but also how we

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:47.349 
lightweight materials but also how we
actually<00:01:45.829> make<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.130> shoe<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.969> making<00:01:47.240> sure

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
actually make the shoe and making sure

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.209 
actually make the shoe and making sure
that<00:01:47.420> our<00:01:47.630> construction<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:48.289> as<00:01:48.439> minimal<00:01:48.829> and

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
that our construction is as minimal and

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.209 
that our construction is as minimal and
as<00:01:49.490> lightweight<00:01:49.759> as<00:01:49.939> possible<00:01:50.860> this<00:01:51.860> is<00:01:52.039> five

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
as lightweight as possible this is five

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.440 
as lightweight as possible this is five
and<00:01:52.399> a<00:01:52.429> half<00:01:52.459> millimeters<00:01:53.060> all<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.360> way

and a half millimeters all the way

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.229

across<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:53.780> VBA<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:55.369> upper<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:55.819> really<00:01:56.090> just

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:56.239 
across the VBA the upper is really just

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:57.690 
across the VBA the upper is really just
two<00:01:56.450> materials<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:57.110> are<00:01:57.200> welded<00:01:57.500> together

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
very thin tongue as well the she weighs

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.609 
very thin tongue as well the she weighs
four<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:01.789> half<00:02:01.819> ounces<00:02:02.299> which<00:02:03.259> is<00:02:03.439> about

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
four and a half ounces which is about

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.499 
four and a half ounces which is about
three<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:04.009> half<00:02:04.039> ounces<00:02:04.939> like<00:02:05.209> three<00:02:05.479> hours

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
three and a half ounces like three hours

that's<00:02:07.429> awesome<00:02:07.549> so<00:02:07.909> how<00:02:08.030> do<00:02:08.090> they<00:02:08.179> compare<00:02:08.450> to

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
that's awesome so how do they compare to

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.470 
that's awesome so how do they compare to
the<00:02:08.899> b-room<00:02:09.140> my<00:02:09.560> fingers<00:02:10.060> they're<00:02:11.060> much

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
the b-room my fingers they're much

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.309 
the b-room my fingers they're much
better<00:02:13.540> what's<00:02:14.540> different<00:02:14.660> is<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.200> view

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
better what's different is that the view

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.839 
better what's different is that the view
from<00:02:15.379> five<00:02:15.620> fingers<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.579> do<00:02:16.700> have<00:02:16.819> the

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
from five fingers you do have the

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.789 
from five fingers you do have the
articulated<00:02:17.480> toes<00:02:17.629> it's<00:02:18.440> going<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.590> give<00:02:18.709> you

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
articulated toes it's going to give you

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.920 
articulated toes it's going to give you
a<00:02:18.859> much<00:02:19.099> different<00:02:19.430> feel<00:02:19.940> than<00:02:19.970> having<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.599> full

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
a much different feel than having a full

some<00:02:24.049> of<00:02:24.079> the<00:02:24.230> five<00:02:24.470> fingers<00:02:24.680> are<00:02:24.950> going<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.130> be

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
some of the five fingers are going to be

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.039 
some of the five fingers are going to be
that<00:02:25.340> much<00:02:25.370> lower<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:25.880> ground<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:26.480> our

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
that much lower to the ground so our

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.990 
that much lower to the ground so our
positioning<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.650> bed<00:02:27.829> is<00:02:27.950> then<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.370> still

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
positioning this bed is then that still

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.640 
positioning this bed is then that still
want<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.209> show<00:02:29.389> you<00:02:30.019> want<00:02:30.200> that<00:02:30.440> barefoot

if<00:02:47.320> you're<00:02:47.500> looking<00:02:47.710> to<00:02:47.800> transition<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.430> would

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
if you're looking to transition I would

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.730 
if you're looking to transition I would
say<00:02:48.730> go<00:02:48.940> slow<00:02:49.210> think<00:02:50.110> about<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.440> do<00:02:50.590> your

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
say go slow think about it do your

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.290 
say go slow think about it do your
research<00:02:51.040> make<00:02:51.310> sure<00:02:51.460> that<00:02:51.640> you're<00:02:51.760> taking<00:02:52.270> a

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
research make sure that you're taking a

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.810 
research make sure that you're taking a
smart<00:02:52.540> approach<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:53.770> 110<00:02:54.190> would<00:02:54.400> actually<00:02:54.700> be

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
smart approach the 110 would actually be

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.700 
smart approach the 110 would actually be
a<00:02:54.850> good<00:02:55.150> transition<00:02:55.570> shoe<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.560> have

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
a good transition shoe and that you have

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.800 
a good transition shoe and that you have
thicker<00:02:57.010> overall<00:02:57.550> Heights<00:02:57.820> here<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.660> have

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
thicker overall Heights here you have

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.260 
thicker overall Heights here you have
more<00:02:59.290> kind<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.680> shoe<00:02:59.860> more<00:03:00.130> support<00:03:00.580> but<00:03:01.120> you

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
more kind of shoe more support but you

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.180 
more kind of shoe more support but you
are<00:03:01.450> putting<00:03:01.870> your<00:03:02.110> heel<00:03:02.350> that<00:03:02.650> much<00:03:02.830> lower<00:03:03.040> to

are putting your heel that much lower to
the<00:03:03.220> ground<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:04.480> might<00:03:04.660> be<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.810> good<00:03:05.020> shoe<00:03:05.260> to

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
the ground this might be a good shoe to

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.710 
the ground this might be a good shoe to
use<00:03:05.590> before<00:03:06.190> going<00:03:07.030> into<00:03:07.240> a<00:03:07.360> shoe<00:03:07.540> like<00:03:07.690> this

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
use before going into a shoe like this

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.150 
use before going into a shoe like this
which<00:03:08.140> is<00:03:08.260> going<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.440> be<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.680> further<00:03:08.950> down

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
which is going to be that further down

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.190 
which is going to be that further down
the<00:03:09.280> spectrum<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.850> it's<00:03:10.390> going<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.570> be<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.690> real
