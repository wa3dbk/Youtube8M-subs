and in each of the other ships so the
front<00:00:31.919> one<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.669> put<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.210> pointer

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
front one here we can put the pointer

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.200 
front one here we can put the pointer
compass<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.050> center<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.620> draw<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> circle

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.889 

that's<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.420> circle<00:00:43.309> inside<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.670> front<00:00:45.210> square

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that's a circle inside that front square

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.430 
that's a circle inside that front square
surface<00:00:47.809> this<00:00:48.949> side<00:00:49.949> here<00:00:50.339> is<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
surface this side here is a

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.430 
surface this side here is a
quadrilateral<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.899> square<00:00:54.899> so

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
quadrilateral but it's not square so

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.729 
quadrilateral but it's not square so
it's<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.339> to<00:00:56.399> be<00:00:56.519> an<00:00:56.609> oval<00:00:56.969> shape<00:00:57.239> if<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:58.350> use

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
it's going to be an oval shape if I use

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.919 
it's going to be an oval shape if I use
the<00:00:58.949> circle<00:00:59.519> here<00:00:59.699> it's<00:01:00.149> going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> go<00:01:00.569> outside

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
the circle here it's going to go outside

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.850 
the circle here it's going to go outside
of<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:02.539> core<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.960> can't<00:01:04.229> be<00:01:04.320> done<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
of the core so it can't be done with the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.190 
of the core so it can't be done with the
compass<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.300> circle<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.050> we

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
compass to get the circle in here we

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.070 
compass to get the circle in here we
have<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.650> use<00:01:08.070> points<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.330> core<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
have to use points on the core of and a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.830 
have to use points on the core of and a
freehand<00:01:10.470> curve<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.670> point<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
freehand curve so this point here is a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.750 
freehand curve so this point here is a
point<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.460> circle<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:16.040> there<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
point on the circle and there on the

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.120 
point on the circle and there on the
diagonals<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.820> if<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.930> draw<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.230> diagonal<00:01:22.680> in

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
diagonals so if we draw the diagonal in

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.480 
diagonals so if we draw the diagonal in
the<00:01:23.670> quadrilateral<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:26.660> and<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:29.130> other<00:01:29.250> day

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the quadrilateral here and the other day

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.550 
the quadrilateral here and the other day
I<00:01:29.520> got<00:01:31.160> and<00:01:33.140> then<00:01:34.140> find<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.840> four<00:01:36.840> points<00:01:37.380> on

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
I got and then find the four points on

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.650 
I got and then find the four points on
those<00:01:38.360> diagonals<00:01:40.640> this<00:01:41.640> point<00:01:41.970> here<00:01:42.270> has<00:01:42.510> to

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
those diagonals this point here has to

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.080 
those diagonals this point here has to
be<00:01:42.810> transferred<00:01:43.740> over<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.570> new<00:01:45.570> diagonal

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
be transferred over to the new diagonal

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.150 
be transferred over to the new diagonal
so<00:01:48.090> draw<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:48.930> horizontal<00:01:49.230> line<00:01:51.800> to<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.920> corner

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
so draw a horizontal line to the corner

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.460 
so draw a horizontal line to the corner
layer<00:01:53.580> and<00:01:53.850> from<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.750> corner

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
layer and from that corner

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.010 
layer and from that corner
go<00:01:56.220> back<00:01:56.430> at<00:01:56.640> 45<00:01:57.210> degrees<00:01:58.370> and<00:01:59.600> where<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.750> cuts

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
go back at 45 degrees and where it cuts

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.100 
go back at 45 degrees and where it cuts
the<00:02:02.000> diagonal<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.270> gives<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.660> point<00:02:03.960> on

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the diagonal that gives you a point on

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.100 
the diagonal that gives you a point on
the<00:02:04.230> curve<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.920> point<00:02:05.160> on<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.370> core<00:02:05.550> there

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
the curve and a point on the core there

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.050 
the curve and a point on the core there
to<00:02:07.110> get<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.470> lower<00:02:07.980> ones<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.819> same

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:34.000 

and<00:03:25.400> then<00:03:26.060> across<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.870> top<00:03:27.290> at<00:03:27.560> 45<00:03:28.490> degrees

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:46.040 

that<00:03:35.010> gets<00:03:35.310> 8<00:03:35.519> points<00:03:36.180> on<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.540> curve

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.350 

again<00:03:47.050> just<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.100> free<00:03:48.340> hand<00:03:48.610> core<00:03:48.880> of<00:03:49.000> true

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
again just a free hand core of true

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:59.830 
again just a free hand core of true
those<00:03:49.660> points

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.430 

so<00:04:00.470> it's<00:04:00.650> free<00:04:01.010> hunt<00:04:01.280> curve<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.060> walk<00:04:03.020> lightly

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
so it's free hunt curve and walk lightly

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.270 
so it's free hunt curve and walk lightly
first<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.360> then<00:04:05.620> when<00:04:06.620> you<00:04:06.739> have<00:04:06.890> it<00:04:07.040> lightly

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
first and then when you have it lightly

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.160 
first and then when you have it lightly
drawn<00:04:07.790> and<00:04:08.180> you<00:04:08.900> can<00:04:09.080> see<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.500> shape<00:04:09.770> forming

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
drawn and you can see the shape forming

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.030 
drawn and you can see the shape forming
just<00:04:12.170> go<00:04:12.440> round<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:13.120> with<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.270> pencil<00:04:14.780> and

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
just go round it with the pencil and

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:23.110 
just go round it with the pencil and
line<00:04:16.040> in<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:17.150> curve<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:21.070> that's<00:04:22.120> your

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
line in the curve and that's your

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.790 
line in the curve and that's your
circles<00:04:24.050> in<00:04:24.320> oblique<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:26.139> now<00:04:27.139> add<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.530> little

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
circles in oblique and now add a little

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.690 
circles in oblique and now add a little
bit<00:04:27.980> of<00:04:28.070> color<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:29.200> that's<00:04:30.200> the<00:04:30.440> ship<00:04:30.710> colored

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
bit of color and that's the ship colored

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.810 
bit of color and that's the ship colored
in<00:04:31.850> there<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.590> that's<00:04:33.590> oblique<00:04:34.130> drawing<00:04:34.460> five

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
in there and that's oblique drawing five

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:42.119 
in there and that's oblique drawing five
complete

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:42.129 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.189
