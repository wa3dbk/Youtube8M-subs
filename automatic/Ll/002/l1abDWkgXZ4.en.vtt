of<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> buckles<00:01:35.790> I'll<00:01:35.939> make<00:01:36.060> some<00:01:36.240> other<00:01:36.360> pads

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
of the buckles I'll make some other pads

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.840 
of the buckles I'll make some other pads
in<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.869> past<00:01:37.430> basically<00:01:38.430> what<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.579> does<00:01:38.820> is

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
in the past basically what that does is

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.249 
in the past basically what that does is
when<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.150> drop<00:01:39.390> into<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> butterfly<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.170> is

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
when you drop into the butterfly this is

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.210 
when you drop into the butterfly this is
going<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.439> move<00:01:40.530> out<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> way<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.130> your

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
going to move out of the way of your

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.950 
going to move out of the way of your
pants<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.270> prevent<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> pad

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
pants and it's going to prevent the pad

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.039 
pants and it's going to prevent the pad
from<00:01:43.079> under<00:01:43.350> rotating<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.930> conjunction<00:01:45.930> with

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
from under rotating in conjunction with

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.960 
from under rotating in conjunction with
the<00:01:46.290> nylon<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.860> knee<00:01:47.009> definitely<00:01:47.850> going

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the nylon and the knee definitely going

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.280 
the nylon and the knee definitely going
to<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.119> some<00:01:48.299> good<00:01:48.420> rotation<00:01:48.600> when

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
to have some good rotation when

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.020 
to have some good rotation when
transitioning<00:01:49.680> from<00:01:50.009> stats<00:01:50.520> down<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.000> a

leg pad as well similar to the story on
the<00:01:58.290> knee<00:01:58.469> it's<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:59.040> going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.219> help<00:01:59.340> that

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
the knee it's really going to help that

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.600 
the knee it's really going to help that
rotation<00:02:00.060> when<00:02:00.210> trends

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610

the other pieces I talked about in the
knee<00:02:37.540> it's<00:02:37.750> really<00:02:38.020> going<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.170> help<00:02:38.410> in<00:02:38.950> the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
knee it's really going to help in the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.770 
knee it's really going to help in the
butterfly<00:02:39.520> prevent<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.209> under<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.690> over

right the path is going to stay in place
a<00:02:47.100> couple<00:02:48.100> asset<00:02:48.489> if<00:02:48.580> it's<00:02:48.730> on<00:02:48.850> this<00:02:48.940> pad<00:02:49.150> we<00:02:49.570> do

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
a couple asset if it's on this pad we do

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.680 
a couple asset if it's on this pad we do
have<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.870> race<00:02:50.110> digard<00:02:50.620> as<00:02:51.489> found<00:02:51.880> on<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.090> 7900

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
have a race digard as found on the 7900

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.930 
have a race digard as found on the 7900
as<00:02:52.810> well<00:02:52.989> that<00:02:53.830> does<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.040> couple<00:02:54.190> things<00:02:54.310> it

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
as well that does a couple things it

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.370 
as well that does a couple things it
keeps<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.300> puck<00:02:55.510> away<00:02:55.750> from<00:02:56.110> your<00:02:56.230> knee

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
keeps the puck away from your knee

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.050 
keeps the puck away from your knee
instead<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.100> puck<00:02:57.280> hitting<00:02:57.489> directly<00:02:57.970> on

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
instead of the puck hitting directly on

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.250 
instead of the puck hitting directly on
your<00:02:58.150> thigh<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.660> transferring<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.200> energy

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
your thigh and transferring the energy

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.650 
your thigh and transferring the energy
to<00:02:59.650> me<00:02:59.770> protecting<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.540> actually

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
to me protecting it and it actually

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.240 
to me protecting it and it actually
brings<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.080> away<00:03:02.260> from<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.650> landing<00:03:02.950> gear<00:03:03.100> as

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
brings it away from the landing gear as

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.640 
brings it away from the landing gear as
well<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:04.330> creates<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.660> nice<00:03:04.810> fluid<00:03:05.140> motion

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
well just creates a nice fluid motion

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.370 
well just creates a nice fluid motion
when<00:03:05.830> dropping<00:03:06.100> down<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.610> butterfly

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
when dropping down to the butterfly

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
v4 is these military-grade buckles that

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.220 
v4 is these military-grade buckles that
Vaughn<00:03:12.610> introduced<00:03:13.000> last<00:03:13.150> year<00:03:13.330> these<00:03:14.080> have

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
Vaughn introduced last year these have

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.449 
Vaughn introduced last year these have
twice<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.650> tends<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:14.860> strength<00:03:15.130> as<00:03:15.250> most

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
twice it tends to strength as most

buckles<00:03:16.450> on<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.630> market<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.110> again<00:03:17.739> they're

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
mounted behind this Pat so you still get
