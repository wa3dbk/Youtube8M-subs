00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
noticed right off the bat pulling it out

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.020 
noticed right off the bat pulling it out
of<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.720> box<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.650> definitely<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.490> weighted

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
of the box it is definitely a weighted

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.880 
of the box it is definitely a weighted
cat<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.259> see<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:16.500> all<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> weight

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
cat so you can see like all the weight

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.130 
cat so you can see like all the weight
is<00:01:17.070> down<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.479> reason<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.900> is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
is down here and the reason for that is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.289 
is down here and the reason for that is
because<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.860> made<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.070> flax<00:01:20.759> seeds<00:01:21.030> which

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
because it is made with flax seeds which

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.580 
because it is made with flax seeds which
is<00:01:21.570> very<00:01:22.170> cool

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
is very cool

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.609 
is very cool
so<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.490> looks<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.750> top<00:01:24.960> it's

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
so it looks like this on the top it's

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.620 
so it looks like this on the top it's
like<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.920> shape<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.220> flower<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:27.390> here

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
like in a shape of a flower and in here

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.719 
like in a shape of a flower and in here
are<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:28.110> flax<00:01:28.740> seeds<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:29.159> pockets<00:01:29.430> of

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
are like flax seeds there pockets of

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.999 
are like flax seeds there pockets of
flax<00:01:30.030> seeds<00:01:30.270> which<00:01:30.659> hold<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.409> heat<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.920> you

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
flax seeds which hold the heat so you

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.770 
flax seeds which hold the heat so you
have<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> center<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
have the one in the center and then the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.230 
have the one in the center and then the
petals<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.619> flowers<00:01:35.070> contain<00:01:35.520> flax<00:01:36.030> seeds

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
petals of the flowers contain flax seeds

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.060 
petals of the flowers contain flax seeds
and<00:01:36.299> they<00:01:36.420> go<00:01:36.540> all<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> way<00:01:36.930> down<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> edge

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and they go all the way down to the edge

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.289 
and they go all the way down to the edge
just<00:01:38.780> like<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:41.070> also<00:01:41.280> has<00:01:41.670> an<00:01:41.880> elastic

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
just like that it also has an elastic

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.370 
just like that it also has an elastic
band<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:44.340> stretch<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.610> out<00:01:45.380> alright

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
band so you can stretch it out alright

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.200 
band so you can stretch it out alright
and<00:01:47.180> here<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.360> their<00:01:48.840> tag<00:01:49.439> label<00:01:50.180> right<00:01:51.180> there

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and here is their tag label right there

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.749 
and here is their tag label right there
I<00:01:51.600> don't<00:01:51.810> know<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:51.960> y'all<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.229> see<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.759> both

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
I don't know if y'all can see that both

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.639 
I don't know if y'all can see that both
side<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> hot<00:01:54.329> head<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.780> made<00:01:55.140> from<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.619> a

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
side of the hot head is made from like a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.740 
side of the hot head is made from like a
terry<00:01:56.009> cloth<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.030> like<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.329> feels<00:01:57.479> kind

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
terry cloth so it's like it feels kind

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.719 
terry cloth so it's like it feels kind
of<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.899> towel<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.500> then<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.040> inside<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.700> made

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
of a towel and then the inside is made

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.990 
of a towel and then the inside is made
from<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.540> different<00:02:01.079> cotton<00:02:01.380> material<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.820> it's

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
from a different cotton material so it's

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.800 
from a different cotton material so it's
not<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.390> as<00:02:03.570> thick<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:05.600> personally<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.780> to

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
not like as thick I personally like to

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.490 
not like as thick I personally like to
use<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.409> flits<00:02:08.869> with<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> pattern<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
use it flits with the pattern on the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.589 
use it flits with the pattern on the
inside<00:02:10.560> me<00:02:11.370> personally<00:02:11.879> i<00:02:11.910> find<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.330> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
inside me personally i find that the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.869 
inside me personally i find that the
terry<00:02:12.840> cloth<00:02:12.900> side

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
terry cloth side

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.330 
terry cloth side
seems<00:02:14.239> to<00:02:14.390> get<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.569> little<00:02:14.959> bit<00:02:15.170> warmer<00:02:15.680> on<00:02:16.069> like

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
seems to get a little bit warmer on like

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.030 
seems to get a little bit warmer on like
atop<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.879> crown<00:02:17.090> area<00:02:17.390> versus<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.499> pattern

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
atop the crown area versus the pattern

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.550 
atop the crown area versus the pattern
side<00:02:19.219> again<00:02:19.700> this<00:02:19.879> is<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.260> microwaveable<00:02:21.260> heat

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
side again this is a microwaveable heat

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.860 
side again this is a microwaveable heat
cap<00:02:21.799> so<00:02:22.219> you<00:02:22.249> pop<00:02:22.519> it<00:02:22.639> in<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.760> microwave<00:02:23.030> on

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
cap so you pop it in the microwave on

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.569 
cap so you pop it in the microwave on
each<00:02:24.019> side<00:02:24.290> no<00:02:24.620> like<00:02:24.829> a<00:02:24.859> minute<00:02:25.159> or<00:02:25.249> so<00:02:25.370> on<00:02:25.489> each

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
each side no like a minute or so on each

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.569 
each side no like a minute or so on each
side<00:02:25.849> and<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:27.019> flat<00:02:27.260> seeds<00:02:27.499> inside<00:02:27.799> hold<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
side and the flat seeds inside hold the

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.190 
side and the flat seeds inside hold the
heat<00:02:28.760> for<00:02:29.150> your<00:02:29.299> deep<00:02:29.450> conditioning<00:02:29.840> session

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
heat for your deep conditioning session

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.289 
heat for your deep conditioning session
so<00:02:30.590> on<00:02:31.129> the<00:02:31.250> directions<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:31.819> says<00:02:31.849> that<00:02:32.209> the

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
so on the directions it says that the

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.970 
so on the directions it says that the
heat<00:02:32.480> should<00:02:32.689> last<00:02:32.840> between<00:02:32.989> 30<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.620> 45

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
heat should last between 30 and 45

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.339 
heat should last between 30 and 45
minutes<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.609> it's<00:02:34.969> not<00:02:35.150> going<00:02:35.329> to<00:02:35.450> be<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.719> hot

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
minutes and it's not going to be a hot

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.379 
minutes and it's not going to be a hot
heat<00:02:36.739> it's<00:02:36.920> going<00:02:37.069> to<00:02:37.159> be<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.430> gentle<00:02:37.939> boys<00:02:38.180> heat

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
heat it's going to be a gentle boys heat

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.059 
heat it's going to be a gentle boys heat
that's<00:02:38.659> what<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.870> says<00:02:39.019> so<00:02:39.530> for<00:02:39.739> me<00:02:39.859> personally

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
that's what it says so for me personally

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.490 
that's what it says so for me personally
I<00:02:40.489> find<00:02:40.819> that<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.150> get<00:02:41.299> about<00:02:41.659> twenty<00:02:42.139> to<00:02:42.230> thirty

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
I find that I get about twenty to thirty

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.409 
I find that I get about twenty to thirty
minutes<00:02:42.590> of<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.069> gentle<00:02:43.639> voice<00:02:43.669> heat<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.359> it

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:44.419 
minutes of the gentle voice heat so it

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.599 
minutes of the gentle voice heat so it
kind<00:02:44.629> of<00:02:44.659> reminds<00:02:44.930> me<00:02:45.049> of<00:02:45.139> like<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:46.129> shower

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
kind of reminds me of like the shower

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.330 
kind of reminds me of like the shower
heat<00:02:47.060> seemed<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.750> get<00:02:48.019> along<00:02:48.469> with<00:02:48.709> my<00:02:48.980> soft

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
heat seemed I get along with my soft

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.619 
heat seemed I get along with my soft
bonnet<00:02:49.669> dryer<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.090> kind<00:02:50.269> of<00:02:50.329> mixed<00:02:50.540> all

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
bonnet dryer so kind of mixed all

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.119 
bonnet dryer so kind of mixed all
together<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.260> that's<00:02:51.680> what<00:02:51.799> it<00:02:51.859> reminds<00:02:52.040> me

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
together and that's what it reminds me

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.580 
together and that's what it reminds me
of<00:02:52.219> I<00:02:52.489> also<00:02:52.939> find<00:02:53.299> that<00:02:53.389> because<00:02:53.840> most<00:02:54.349> of<00:02:54.500> the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
of I also find that because most of the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.439 
of I also find that because most of the
flak<00:02:54.769> seats<00:02:54.980> are<00:02:55.129> here<00:02:55.459> in<00:02:55.579> the<00:02:55.639> center<00:02:55.969> that's

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:56.449 
flak seats are here in the center that's

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.689 
flak seats are here in the center that's
where<00:02:56.629> most<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.439> the<00:02:57.560> heat<00:02:57.799> is<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.489> then<00:02:58.609> it

00:02:58.689 --> 00:02:58.699 
where most of the heat is and then it

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.159 
where most of the heat is and then it
kind<00:02:58.879> of<00:02:58.939> trickles<00:02:59.299> down<00:02:59.329> all<00:02:59.689> over<00:02:59.719> my<00:02:59.989> head

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
kind of trickles down all over my head

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.140 
kind of trickles down all over my head
so<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.859> being<00:03:01.040> said<00:03:01.129> when<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.519> first<00:03:01.549> tried<00:03:01.969> it

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
so that being said when I first tried it

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.670 
so that being said when I first tried it
out<00:03:02.239> I<00:03:02.419> wasn't<00:03:02.689> sure<00:03:02.959> how<00:03:02.989> effective<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.620> was

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
out I wasn't sure how effective it was

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.319 
out I wasn't sure how effective it was
gonna<00:03:03.829> be<00:03:04.010> because<00:03:04.340> I<00:03:04.519> thought<00:03:04.849> that<00:03:04.909> maybe

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
gonna be because I thought that maybe

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:06.879 
gonna be because I thought that maybe
just<00:03:05.510> one<00:03:05.750> part<00:03:05.959> of<00:03:06.019> my<00:03:06.109> hair<00:03:06.319> was<00:03:06.500> gonna<00:03:06.650> get

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
just one part of my hair was gonna get

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.250 
just one part of my hair was gonna get
deep<00:03:07.310> conditioned<00:03:07.790> but<00:03:08.299> to<00:03:08.569> my<00:03:08.659> surprise<00:03:08.989> it

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
deep conditioned but to my surprise it

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.379 
deep conditioned but to my surprise it
