00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
phone and I will be super happy if they

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.990 
phone and I will be super happy if they
updated<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.620> former<00:03:02.129> to<00:03:02.549> improve<00:03:02.879> the

updated the former to improve the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.119 
updated the former to improve the
quality<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.780> camera<00:03:03.959> button<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.859> don't

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
quality of the camera button I don't

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.849 
quality of the camera button I don't
think<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.400> they<00:03:05.879> will<00:03:06.150> update<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:07.170> camera

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
think that they will update the camera

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.390 
think that they will update the camera
on<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.819> phone<00:03:09.060> because<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.870> usually<00:03:10.440> budget

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
on that phone because of usually budget

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.910 
on that phone because of usually budget
smartphones<00:03:11.879> own<00:03:12.180> get<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:13.470> much<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.829> a

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
smartphones own get that much of a

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.220 
smartphones own get that much of a
pretty<00:03:14.129> fast<00:03:14.340> update<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:15.209> just<00:03:15.510> remove<00:03:16.170> a

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
pretty fast update to just remove a

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.979 
pretty fast update to just remove a
minor<00:03:16.590> bug<00:03:16.920> because<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.760> know<00:03:17.989> the

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
minor bug because you know the

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.170 
minor bug because you know the
cyanogenmod<00:03:19.769> is<00:03:20.069> following<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.579> Eureka

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
cyanogenmod is following the Eureka

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.729 
cyanogenmod is following the Eureka
because<00:03:21.450> it's<00:03:21.599> usually<00:03:22.049> going<00:03:22.169> to<00:03:22.290> get<00:03:22.560> much

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
because it's usually going to get much

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.250 
because it's usually going to get much
more<00:03:22.980> faster<00:03:23.310> updates<00:03:23.609> than<00:03:24.090> this<00:03:24.389> one<00:03:24.660> so

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
more faster updates than this one so

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.390 
more faster updates than this one so
what<00:03:25.440> about<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.709> performance<00:03:25.980> of<00:03:26.250> these

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
what about the performance of these

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.670 
what about the performance of these

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
phony cos we have remy node and you

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.129 
phony cos we have remy node and you
you're<00:03:28.919> a<00:03:29.010> cactus<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.579> which<00:03:30.090> are<00:03:30.269> all<00:03:30.510> sitting

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
you're a cactus I which are all sitting

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.159 
you're a cactus I which are all sitting
in<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.440> same<00:03:31.650> price<00:03:31.980> bracket<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:33.569> the

handling<00:03:37.019> games<00:03:37.680> as<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.099> expect<00:03:38.639> it's<00:03:39.180> just

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
handling games as you expect it's just

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.900 
handling games as you expect it's just
because<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.349> Molly<00:03:40.769> 450<00:03:41.370> inside<00:03:41.639> of<00:03:41.760> it

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
because of the Molly 450 inside of it

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.460 
because of the Molly 450 inside of it
because<00:03:42.150> it's<00:03:42.329> in<00:03:42.690> one<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.109> powerful

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
because it's in one of the powerful

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.339 
because it's in one of the powerful
parts<00:03:44.130> inside<00:03:44.669> this<00:03:44.910> phone<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:45.780> that's<00:03:46.109> no

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349
