00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.330
 of sky then 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.450
 a little trick 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.650
 a little a little 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.910
 I had two or three questions on it 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.460
 how we could find some 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.710
 armor that against we can not 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.840
 necessarily buy then low all 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.230
 we're just going to get the 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.280
 the armor of the supports so there I mounted 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.080
 but kate beckett to normally have 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.290
 the possibility of having the armor sigh 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:44.270
 so how does it go then we get 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.650
 located in the coast of the bloody tide 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.640
 1 you can get there directly 1 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.290
 since from the lion's ark 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.180
 you take the point the waypoint 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.129
 at the time of the lion tac tac you go out there 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.269
 a gateway darchen and you 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.170
 go straight into phase so this is 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.940
 very simple it is the first point of 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.710
 Powder competence in front of the docks 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.290
 so for those that it may interest 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.030
 also for those who make their their 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.220
 card at 100% of times it misses a 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.440
 point and we complained precisely 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.810
 which one is then I will show you 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.479
 right now how how to access 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.530
 this last point 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:20.630
 and for those who wish to have 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.500
 the armor of sighs precisely you 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.869
 show the place 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.719
 so you go to the khl in Bern 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.729
 here in the cellar and there is a portal 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.290
 you take this portal is it you 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.170
 lets go to the chapel of secrets 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.700
 So here to go to the chapel 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.090
 his features must be part of the order 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.090
 sighs 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.240
 of course you're part of 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:48.040
 the order of the sighs so it's pretty much 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.750
 close from the level I raised the 30 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.480
 basically 2 kg is if I remember correctly 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.030
 to have the opportunity to have this 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.550
 army then I wonder if I have enough 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.080
 of poor enough and I believe I believe 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:07.930
 that they have moments there you have a 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.100
 gate so the map hop here you 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.990
 have a point for the pair early this is 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.130
 just this training and so here you are 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.910
 ask you talk to the guys you 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.230
 get to the support but what is 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.840
 find support and well everything 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.770
 simply you have agents there 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.330
 really you can talk to them it's 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.459
 not that then it is those who are there 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.890
 down it can be a little bit of everywhere 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:39.190
 and you will be able to buy buy 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:42.310
 art moore one of the supports I know more 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.440
 which is on the other hand we will find 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.690
 so you can buy a weapon and we 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.930
 knows one of the agents who will be there there 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.290
 no two sellers 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.400
 the seller has titled we will say where there is 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.810
 marked well mark sellers normally 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.320
 so it takes a little bit to all 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:10.510
 all the people you can meet 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:13.180
 oddly he sees the blue coast one 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:19.510
 still complaining I was trying to 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:22.600
 to say weird anyway creator 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:31.780
 maybe there creator agents 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:35.560
 bearers wear it does not mean so we're going 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.030
 continue yes it's still a 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.280
 place that has it's nice enough to 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.560
 to visit minden here is then we 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.310
 can talk to someone to have this 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.310
 famous to 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:56.610
 not for very much at the beginning it makes me 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.920
 it allows me to do a little bit 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.920
 a little bit visited the places in passing 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.670
 it's weird it's there it's 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.540
 normally it's just weird 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.540
 that we can not access it 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:32.520
 particular justice be really very 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:33.750
 weird without limit not normal no 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.980
 so that's it maybe it's all 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:46.100
 just because I'm not enough 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:48.240
 advanced but I do not think I see it there 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.100
 for those who have it you could have me 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.930
 to say it before so we found the weapons 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.460
 support weapons so for example 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.200
 me who needs dagg game I already 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.600
 show you the spas do not have no and 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.260
 kienkÃ© quins support point that not 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:10.230
 naughty and and the idea with dag dag dag dag 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:12.450
 dag here here is the dagger that has a little 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.790
 the same style as the sword so we already have 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.400
 found for weapons 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:21.420
 now have to find for soaps 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:25.190
 that's why we came so we went 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.190
 found the armor 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.900
 it's weird who's not from the seller 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.900
 weapon 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:06:00.830
 I thank because geslin quite 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:06:04.220
 weird all that huh 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:09.320
 finally finally I learn to open my eyes 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:12.710
 excuse me here then you have armor 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.350
 heavy light armor and armor and 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:21.260
 intermediate armor so it's basically 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:23.240
 between a pea a theo and support for 90 years 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.360
 between a country with twenty- one countries where 90 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.860
 to buy good bah I will you the 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.440
 show for example for the for the 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:34.789
 value no so I find that I 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:37.190
 not bad so that's it 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:39.410
 the valuable armor of sighing the 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.690
 mouths then after you to you from 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.900
 transmute if you if you 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:47.260
 wish good then to me it's a wall 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.510
 that pretty break I find 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.910
 so that was a small video 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.669
 for you show you show everything 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.349
 just this armor and for for 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.729
 those who were looking for what father 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:00.020
 thomas the last point he could 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:01.820
 may miss them if there was 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.560
 not if I had not thought 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.080
 that's okay listening and I hope that you 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.500
 will have a better game at all and see you later 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.500
 chacha
