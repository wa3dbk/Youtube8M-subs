00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
diffuse your edges a whole lot maybe

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.420 
diffuse your edges a whole lot maybe
more<00:02:27.420> than<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.750> want<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.650> if<00:02:29.160> that's

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
more than you want it to and if that's

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.460 
more than you want it to and if that's
the<00:02:29.730> case<00:02:29.940> then<00:02:30.750> use<00:02:31.110> real<00:02:31.740> paint<00:02:32.100> not<00:02:33.470> cloned

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
the case then use real paint not cloned

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.370 
the case then use real paint not cloned
color<00:02:34.890> paint<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.840> exaggerate<00:02:36.840> your<00:02:37.080> color

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380

for<00:02:37.980> instance<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:38.940> push<00:02:39.900> my<00:02:40.200> color

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
for instance I can push my color

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.650 
for instance I can push my color
brighter<00:02:41.990> in<00:02:43.160> my<00:02:44.160> flowers<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.940> make<00:02:45.420> that

my option key to pick up color I can use
a<00:03:16.830> blender<00:03:17.370> then<00:03:18.410> let's<00:03:19.410> try<00:03:19.650> this<00:03:19.769> one<00:03:20.160> real

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
a blender then let's try this one real

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.259 
a blender then let's try this one real
tapered<00:03:20.970> bristle<00:03:21.450> blender<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:23.040> can<00:03:23.310> use

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
tapered bristle blender and I can use

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.380 
tapered bristle blender and I can use
that<00:03:24.300> blender<00:03:25.250> which<00:03:26.250> has<00:03:26.519> color<00:03:26.910> by<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.209> way

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
that blender which has color by the way

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.040 
that blender which has color by the way
this<00:03:27.720> blender<00:03:28.230> does<00:03:28.470> not<00:03:29.450> just<00:03:30.450> blend<00:03:30.750> what's

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
this blender does not just blend what's

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.750 
this blender does not just blend what's
there<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.560> has<00:03:31.769> color<00:03:32.070> of<00:03:32.340> its<00:03:32.550> own<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.370> can

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
there it has color of its own so I can

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.380 
there it has color of its own so I can
blend

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390

I<00:03:36.480> can<00:03:36.870> move<00:03:37.140> pixels<00:03:37.769> around<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.580> can<00:03:39.209> make<00:03:39.390> it

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
I can move pixels around I can make it

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.680 
I can move pixels around I can make it
as<00:03:39.690> pretty<00:03:39.989> as<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.500> want<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:40.950> be<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:42.450> can

as pretty as I want it to be and I can

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.870 
as pretty as I want it to be and I can
make<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:42.989> as<00:03:43.110> sharp<00:03:43.440> or<00:03:43.620> as<00:03:43.769> soft<00:03:44.070> as<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.519> want<00:03:44.760> it

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880

to<00:03:44.910> be<00:03:45.239> and<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:46.350> can<00:03:46.530> see<00:03:46.769> there<00:03:47.010> where<00:03:47.250> I

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
to be and you can see there where I

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.920 
to be and you can see there where I
picked<00:03:47.910> up<00:03:48.060> color<00:03:48.360> from<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.780> background

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
picked up color from the background

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.460 
picked up color from the background
because<00:03:49.440> my<00:03:49.590> edge<00:03:49.860> is<00:03:50.190> too<00:03:50.430> messy<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.230> I<00:03:52.230> can

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
because my edge is too messy and I can

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.949 
because my edge is too messy and I can
just<00:03:52.739> play<00:03:53.130> with<00:03:53.459> anything<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.420> want<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.750> play
