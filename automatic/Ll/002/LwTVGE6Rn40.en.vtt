it's<00:00:09.750> going<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.019> be<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> little<00:00:10.290> bit<00:00:10.440> different

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
it's going to be a little bit different

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.280 
it's going to be a little bit different
since<00:00:11.160> this<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> basically<00:00:12.630> all<00:00:12.840> tier<00:00:13.080> 10

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290

since this is a basically all tier 10
match<00:00:13.500> but<00:00:13.980> i'll<00:00:14.219> be<00:00:14.370> able<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:15.230> go<00:00:16.230> over<00:00:16.529> how

german tanks that are being released
this<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.250> pretty<00:00:23.460> mobile<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.529> it<00:00:25.529> really

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
this is pretty mobile and it really

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.460 
this is pretty mobile and it really
spins<00:00:26.220> around<00:00:26.400> very<00:00:26.820> good<00:00:27.060> both<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.840> hole<00:00:28.080> and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
spins around very good both the hole and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.030 
spins around very good both the hole and
the<00:00:28.740> turret<00:00:29.580> turned<00:00:29.880> very<00:00:30.090> quickly<00:00:30.740> it's<00:00:31.740> gun

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the turret turned very quickly it's gun

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.440 
the turret turned very quickly it's gun
is<00:00:32.480> somewhat<00:00:33.480> similar<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.910> m26<00:00:35.910> pershing

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
is somewhat similar to the m26 pershing

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.049 
is somewhat similar to the m26 pershing
but<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.809> has<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> better<00:00:37.230> rate<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.590> fire<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.190> have

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
but it has a better rate of fire I have

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.030 
but it has a better rate of fire I have
to<00:00:39.239> roll<00:00:39.480> around<00:00:40.879> armor<00:00:41.879> wise<00:00:42.320> it's<00:00:43.320> not<00:00:43.770> too

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
to roll around armor wise it's not too

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.000 
to roll around armor wise it's not too
great<00:00:44.280> at<00:00:44.489> all<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.120> holes<00:00:45.390> week<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.350> even

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
great at all the holes week and even

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.340 
great at all the holes week and even
though<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.730> tart<00:00:48.030> looks<00:00:48.300> similar<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
though it the tart looks similar to the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.590 
though it the tart looks similar to the
low<00:00:50.070> premium<00:00:51.030> Terry<00:00:51.390> Evie<00:00:51.780> technique<00:00:52.079> oops

low premium Terry Evie technique oops

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.029 
low premium Terry Evie technique oops
guess<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.899> should<00:00:55.050> look<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> weirdo<00:00:55.649> really

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
guess I should look the weirdo really

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.700 
guess I should look the weirdo really
even<00:00:56.910> though<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.210> similar<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.660> low<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
even though it's similar to low the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.450 
even though it's similar to low the
turret<00:00:59.370> welcome<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.750> very<00:01:00.989> weak<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.739> you

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
turret welcome it's very weak it you

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.880 
turret welcome it's very weak it you
don't<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:02.879> expect<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.750> stop<00:01:04.409> many<00:01:04.619> shots

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
don't really expect to stop many shots

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.010 
don't really expect to stop many shots
without<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.280> teary<00:01:05.670> they'll<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.659> go<00:01:06.810> right

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
without a teary they'll just go right

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.319 
without a teary they'll just go right
through

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
through

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:12.200 
through
basically<00:01:10.329> what<00:01:10.479> this<00:01:10.630> tank<00:01:10.899> is<00:01:11.049> good<00:01:11.290> at<00:01:11.439> is

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
basically what this tank is good at is

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.190 
basically what this tank is good at is
moving<00:01:13.210> around<00:01:13.390> where<00:01:13.750> it<00:01:13.869> needs<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.320> be<00:01:14.409> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
moving around where it needs to be and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.980 
moving around where it needs to be and
basically<00:01:17.220> supporting<00:01:18.220> from<00:01:18.640> it<00:01:18.850> range<00:01:19.539> since

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
basically supporting from it range since

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.620 
basically supporting from it range since
you<00:01:20.140> don't<00:01:20.320> have<00:01:20.439> much<00:01:20.649> armor<00:01:21.159> or<00:01:21.340> HP<00:01:22.030> since

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
you don't have much armor or HP since

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:30.550 
you don't have much armor or HP since
1300<00:01:23.530> is<00:01:23.619> pretty<00:01:23.829> low

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.050 

you<00:01:31.100> also<00:01:31.280> are<00:01:31.909> pretty<00:01:32.509> tall<00:01:33.460> you're<00:01:34.460> not<00:01:34.909> that

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
you also are pretty tall you're not that

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.810 
you also are pretty tall you're not that
big<00:01:35.360> hole<00:01:35.630> lies<00:01:35.930> but<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.500> tart<00:01:36.799> sticks<00:01:37.610> out

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
big hole lies but the tart sticks out

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.889 
big hole lies but the tart sticks out
like<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:38.090> sore<00:01:38.119> thumb<00:01:39.820> basically<00:01:40.820> you're<00:01:41.780> gonna

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
like a sore thumb basically you're gonna

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:50.340 
like a sore thumb basically you're gonna
be<00:01:42.140> seen<00:01:42.890> pretty<00:01:43.250> easily

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:02:00.600 

definitely<00:01:50.950> do<00:01:51.070> not<00:01:51.220> want<00:01:51.430> to<00:01:51.490> be<00:01:51.580> shot<00:01:51.790> by<00:01:52.030> him

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.520 

we<00:02:01.610> didn't<00:02:01.970> even<00:02:02.030> scratch<00:02:02.540> him

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
we didn't even scratch him

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.949 
we didn't even scratch him
they<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.220> me<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.430> start<00:02:05.729> using<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.540> PC<00:02:06.930> are<00:02:08.959> the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
they get me to start using a PC are the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.890 
they get me to start using a PC are the
pens<00:02:10.229> not<00:02:10.470> too<00:02:10.709> great<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.900> especially

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
pens not too great on this especially

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.500 
pens not too great on this especially
against<00:02:13.140> tier<00:02:13.380> tens<00:02:13.670> it's<00:02:14.670> sufficient<00:02:15.300> for

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
against tier tens it's sufficient for

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.199 
against tier tens it's sufficient for
dealing<00:02:15.930> with<00:02:16.260> teary<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.370> most<00:02:17.730> tier<00:02:18.030> nine

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
dealing with teary and most tier nine

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.890 
dealing with teary and most tier nine
tanks<00:02:18.720> but<00:02:18.959> tier<00:02:19.290> 10<00:02:19.910> early<00:02:20.910> start<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.720> notice

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
tanks but tier 10 early start to notice

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.900 
tanks but tier 10 early start to notice
the<00:02:22.319> AP<00:02:22.650> shells<00:02:22.920> lack<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.400> penetration

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
the AP shells lack of penetration

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:35.500 
the AP shells lack of penetration
against<00:02:24.300> them<00:02:33.380> so<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.440> can<00:02:34.560> see<00:02:34.709> what<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:35.010> town

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
against them so you can see what in town

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.120 
against them so you can see what in town
nothing<00:02:36.510> special<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.019> it's<00:02:37.620> high<00:02:38.100> enough

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
nothing special but it's high enough

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:49.880 
nothing special but it's high enough
that<00:02:38.459> it's<00:02:38.790> not<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:40.670> big<00:02:41.670> issue

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890

see why for being in a match like that I

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.330 
see why for being in a match like that I
