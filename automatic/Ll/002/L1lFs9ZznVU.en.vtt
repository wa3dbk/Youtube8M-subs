so<00:00:03.629> that<00:00:03.780> was<00:00:03.899> Universal<00:00:04.380> Studios<00:00:04.740> Florida

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
so that was Universal Studios Florida

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.400

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
which makes sense because Florida is

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.749 
which makes sense because Florida is
inside<00:00:09.389> Orlando<00:00:09.929> so<00:00:10.769> just<00:00:11.010> what<00:00:11.219> did<00:00:11.460> they<00:00:11.610> add

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
inside Orlando so just what did they add

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.759
