00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.150 

parallel<00:00:31.280> to<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:31.940> bike<00:00:32.119> so<00:00:32.840> what<00:00:33.650> we<00:00:33.890> want<00:00:34.100> to

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
parallel to the bike so what we want to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.760 
parallel to the bike so what we want to
do<00:00:34.430> here<00:00:34.460> is<00:00:34.880> that<00:00:35.150> vibration<00:00:36.050> needs<00:00:36.500> to

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
do here is that vibration needs to

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.930 
do here is that vibration needs to
travel<00:00:37.100> very<00:00:37.340> far<00:00:37.910> in<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:38.750> frame<00:00:39.670> that's<00:00:40.670> what

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
travel very far in the frame that's what

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.600 
travel very far in the frame that's what
makes<00:00:41.210> it<00:00:41.450> very<00:00:41.930> very<00:00:42.170> smooth<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:43.100> it<00:00:43.489> is

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
makes it very very smooth and it is

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.420 
makes it very very smooth and it is
renowned<00:00:43.970> for<00:00:44.060> that<00:00:44.360> quality<00:00:44.900> now<00:00:45.710> you<00:00:46.250> don't

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
renowned for that quality now you don't

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.090 
renowned for that quality now you don't
want<00:00:46.580> to<00:00:46.700> lose<00:00:46.820> any<00:00:47.300> lateral<00:00:47.629> stiffness<00:00:48.260> you

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
want to lose any lateral stiffness you

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.590 
want to lose any lateral stiffness you
make<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:49.280> high<00:00:49.489> schooler<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:52.030> from<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.180> back<00:00:53.360> of

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
make a high schooler so from the back of

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.880 
make a high schooler so from the back of
the<00:00:53.720> bike

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the bike

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.150 
the bike
you're<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.700> to<00:00:56.790> see<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.809> days<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.950> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
you're going to see that this days are a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.960 
you're going to see that this days are a
bit<00:00:59.460> wider<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.200> in<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.980> this

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
bit wider like that in here and this

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.180 
bit wider like that in here and this
part<00:01:03.300> down<00:01:03.900> here<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.440> going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.800> laminated

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
part down here is going to be laminated

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.719 
part down here is going to be laminated
with<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:06.270> stiffer<00:01:07.020> fiber<00:01:07.409> which<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.520> see

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
with a stiffer fiber which you can see

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.930 
with a stiffer fiber which you can see
so<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.050> a<00:01:10.080> bike<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.650> when<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.400> stand<00:01:11.760> up

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
so this is a bike that when you stand up

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.109 
so this is a bike that when you stand up
this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.900> very<00:01:13.080> punchy<00:01:13.710> very<00:01:14.040> fast<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.850> you

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
this is very punchy very fast and you

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.120 
this is very punchy very fast and you
should<00:01:15.330> win<00:01:15.570> your<00:01:15.990> local<00:01:16.320> crib<00:01:16.650> when<00:01:17.040> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
should win your local crib when you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.270 
should win your local crib when you
sprint<00:01:17.630> but<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.080> sit<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> saddle

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
sprint but when you sit on the saddle

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.420 
sprint but when you sit on the saddle
it's<00:01:20.940> going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.300> super<00:01:21.659> soft<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.500> smooth

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
it's going to be super soft and smooth

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.540 
it's going to be super soft and smooth
so<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.150> fast<00:01:24.450> turning<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:26.190> going<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.430> make

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
so for fast turning it's going to make

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.270 
so for fast turning it's going to make
it<00:01:26.729> very<00:01:26.909> very<00:01:27.180> good<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.649> sprint<00:01:29.070> out

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
it very very good and if you sprint out

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.300 
it very very good and if you sprint out
of<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.550> curve<00:01:29.869> your<00:01:30.869> will<00:01:31.200> should<00:01:31.710> not<00:01:31.890> skip

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
of a curve your will should not skip

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.400 
of a curve your will should not skip
when<00:01:32.910> you<00:01:33.030> push<00:01:33.270> really<00:01:33.539> hard<00:01:33.630> out<00:01:34.050> of<00:01:34.289> the

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
when you push really hard out of the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.820 
when you push really hard out of the
saddle<00:01:34.649> because<00:01:35.039> of<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.210> adapted<00:01:36.780> state<00:01:37.110> if

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
saddle because of the adapted state if

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.430 
saddle because of the adapted state if
you<00:01:38.009> want<00:01:38.160> to<00:01:38.250> come<00:01:38.369> closer

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
you want to come closer

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.590 
you want to come closer
you're<00:01:41.010> going<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.190> see<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.910> tastes<00:01:42.300> are

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
you're going to see that this tastes are

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.280 
you're going to see that this tastes are
connected<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:43.770> top<00:01:44.010> two<00:01:44.250> ok<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.780> Alps

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
connected to the top two ok so this Alps

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.070 
connected to the top two ok so this Alps
the<00:01:47.040> vibration<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.790> travel<00:01:48.240> very<00:01:48.270> far<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
the vibration to travel very far in the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.000 
the vibration to travel very far in the
frame<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.830> said<00:01:49.890> previously<00:01:50.750> now<00:01:51.800> five<00:01:52.800> is

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
frame as I said previously now five is

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.210 
frame as I said previously now five is
equipped<00:01:53.400> with<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:54.750> BB<00:01:55.110> 30<00:01:55.530> bottom<00:01:56.190> bracket

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
equipped with the BB 30 bottom bracket

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.350 
equipped with the BB 30 bottom bracket
shell<00:01:56.580> so<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:58.500> size<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.190> diameter<00:01:59.910> of<00:02:00.120> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
shell so the size the diameter of the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.250 
shell so the size the diameter of the
shell<00:02:00.630> here<00:02:00.870> is<00:02:00.990> about<00:02:01.230> that<00:02:01.440> big<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:04.230> a

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
shell here is about that big so with a

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.620 
shell here is about that big so with a
bigger<00:02:04.590> tube<00:02:04.980> you<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.280> much<00:02:05.970> more<00:02:06.000> stiffness

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
bigger tube you can much more stiffness

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.460 
bigger tube you can much more stiffness
and<00:02:07.320> you're<00:02:07.980> able<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.399> have<00:02:08.490> a<00:02:08.580> bigger<00:02:08.820> axle<00:02:09.690> so

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and you're able to have a bigger axle so

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.760 
and you're able to have a bigger axle so
that's<00:02:11.100> what<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.640> BB<00:02:11.910> 30<00:02:12.180> stands<00:02:12.630> for<00:02:12.900> with<00:02:13.740> a

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that's what the BB 30 stands for with a

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 
that's what the BB 30 stands for with a
bigger<00:02:14.040> axle<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.390> impossible<00:02:16.080> to

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
bigger axle this is impossible to
