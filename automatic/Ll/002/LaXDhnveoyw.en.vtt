00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:03.479 
but the gun is adequate if you swap
between<00:02:53.950> normal<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.849> a<00:02:54.970> period<00:03:02.489> thank

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
between normal and a period thank

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.289 
between normal and a period thank
especially<00:03:03.670> for<00:03:04.150> long<00:03:04.330> range<00:03:04.599> i<00:03:05.049> like<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.409> use

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
especially for long range i like to use

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.259 
especially for long range i like to use
premium<00:03:07.299> rounds<00:03:08.049> I<00:03:08.730> don't<00:03:09.730> really<00:03:09.849> like<00:03:09.970> to

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
premium rounds I don't really like to

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:20.970 
premium rounds I don't really like to
chant<00:03:10.569> it<00:03:15.030> ok<00:03:16.799> don't<00:03:17.799> want<00:03:18.069> to<00:03:18.129> hit<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:20.829> I

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
chant it ok don't want to hit and I

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.220 
chant it ok don't want to hit and I
missed

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.960 

it's<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.470> accuracy<00:03:28.010> on<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.670> can<00:03:28.790> see

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
it's like the accuracy on you can see

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.490 
it's like the accuracy on you can see
it's<00:03:29.240> okay<00:03:30.200> but<00:03:31.480> from<00:03:32.480> long<00:03:32.690> range<00:03:32.720> like<00:03:33.290> this

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
it's okay but from long range like this

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.830 
it's okay but from long range like this
it's<00:03:33.800> not<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.580> best<00:03:34.790> that's<00:03:35.180> night

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
it's not the best that's night

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.949 
it's not the best that's night
here's<00:03:37.379> a<00:03:37.470> church<00:03:37.800> here<00:03:38.040> on<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.310> death

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:55.740 

not<00:03:41.959> too<00:03:42.170> concerned<00:03:42.379> about<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:42.950> Cromwell

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.690 

basically<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:56.770> can<00:03:56.920> angle<00:03:57.130> this<00:03:57.430> tank

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
basically you can angle this tank

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.970 
basically you can angle this tank
slightly<00:03:58.270> any<00:03:59.020> one<00:03:59.230> angle<00:04:00.960> roughly<00:04:01.960> 10<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.530> 15

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
slightly any one angle roughly 10 to 15

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.460 
slightly any one angle roughly 10 to 15
degrees<00:04:03.130> because<00:04:03.640> your<00:04:03.970> sides<00:04:04.720> are<00:04:04.960> so<00:04:05.170> weak

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
degrees because your sides are so weak

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.850 
degrees because your sides are so weak
you<00:04:06.460> want<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.700> keep<00:04:06.910> them<00:04:07.170> an<00:04:08.170> auto<00:04:08.560> mount

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
you want to keep them an auto mount

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:19.190 
you want to keep them an auto mount
range

I<00:05:18.780> know<00:05:18.870> where's<00:05:19.470> that<00:05:19.850> prototype

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.160 

yeah<00:05:28.400> take<00:05:28.700> a<00:05:28.730> chance<00:05:29.030> I've<00:05:29.300> had<00:05:29.330> prototypes

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
yeah take a chance I've had prototypes

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:51.080 
yeah take a chance I've had prototypes
