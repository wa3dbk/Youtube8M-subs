things<00:06:28.680> because<00:06:29.370> I<00:06:29.580> think<00:06:30.300> this<00:06:30.630> will<00:06:30.810> snap

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
things because I think this will snap

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.260 
things because I think this will snap
out<00:06:31.409> because<00:06:32.039> this<00:06:32.279> doesn't<00:06:32.940> seem<00:06:33.180> to<00:06:33.360> be<00:06:33.479> free

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.440 
out because this doesn't seem to be free
a<00:06:34.300> good<00:06:35.080> quality<00:06:35.530> because<00:06:36.070> I<00:06:36.310> think<00:06:37.240> it<00:06:37.330> will

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450 
a good quality because I think it will

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:42.690 
a good quality because I think it will
be<00:06:37.630> it<00:06:37.870> will<00:06:37.930> slap<00:06:38.410> out<00:06:38.590> so<00:06:40.470> that's<00:06:41.470> it<00:06:41.710> if<00:06:42.460> you

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
be it will slap out so that's it if you

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.370 
be it will slap out so that's it if you
can<00:06:42.910> attach<00:06:43.270> it<00:06:43.420> anywhere<00:06:43.750> you<00:06:43.780> like<00:06:44.050> because

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
can attach it anywhere you like because

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:52.830 
can attach it anywhere you like because
it<00:06:44.620> has<00:06:44.830> those<00:06:46.380> turnable<00:06:48.270> joints<00:06:49.950> so<00:06:51.840> yeah
