00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
to run in 24 7 and it was kind of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.200 
to run in 24 7 and it was kind of
upsetting<00:00:16.770> because<00:00:17.340> when<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.760> went<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.090> there

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
upsetting because when I went in there

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.460 
upsetting because when I went in there
you<00:00:18.270> see<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.420> duration<00:00:18.869> was<00:00:18.960> only<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.260> one

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
you see the duration was only in one

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.330 
you see the duration was only in one
minute<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.949> 54<00:00:20.910> seconds<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.830> so<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.859> thought

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
minute and 54 seconds and so I thought

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.200 
minute and 54 seconds and so I thought
that<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.750> didn't<00:00:25.109> capture<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:26.580> whole<00:00:26.760> game

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
that it didn't capture the whole game

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.620 
that it didn't capture the whole game
and<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.869> got<00:00:28.019> super<00:00:28.320> pissed<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.630> figured

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and I got super pissed but I I figured

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.780 
and I got super pissed but I I figured
we<00:00:30.750> had<00:00:31.050> watch<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.650> anyways<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.489> turns<00:00:32.669> out

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
we had watch it anyways and it turns out

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.080 
we had watch it anyways and it turns out
it's<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.149> an<00:00:33.300> extremely<00:00:33.989> fast<00:00:34.260> game<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:35.579> one

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
it's just an extremely fast game of one

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.729 
it's just an extremely fast game of one
in<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> chamber<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.200> do<00:00:37.260> pretty<00:00:37.500> well<00:00:37.680> in

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
in the chamber and I do pretty well in

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.290 
in the chamber and I do pretty well in
it<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.340> think<00:00:38.460> my<00:00:38.760> second<00:00:39.210> time

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
it this is I think my second time

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.000 
it this is I think my second time
actually<00:00:39.510> playing<00:00:40.079> one<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> chamber<00:00:40.829> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
actually playing one of the chamber and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.920 
actually playing one of the chamber and
I<00:00:41.579> almost<00:00:41.969> failed<00:00:42.180> there<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.510> knife<00:00:42.660> but

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
I almost failed there with the knife but

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.799 
I almost failed there with the knife but
recovered<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.420> pretty<00:00:45.600> fun<00:00:45.780> game

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
recovered and it's a pretty fun game

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.319 
recovered and it's a pretty fun game
type<00:00:46.320> when<00:00:46.620> when<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.340> well<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.149> guess

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
type when when you do well but I guess

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.350 
type when when you do well but I guess
that's<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.629> all<00:00:48.719> games<00:00:48.989> right<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:50.370> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
that's with all games right like you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.180 
that's with all games right like you
only<00:00:51.480> have<00:00:51.690> three<00:00:51.960> lives<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.590> game<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.100> if

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
only have three lives in this game so if

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.170 
only have three lives in this game so if
you're<00:00:53.340> not<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.550> if<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.879> an<00:00:53.940> app<00:00:54.030> or

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
you're not you if you have an app or

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.970 
you're not you if you have an app or

a bad spawn or something like that

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.299
