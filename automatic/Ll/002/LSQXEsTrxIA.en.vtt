00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.299
 wolfram is here we are one more day and 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.299
 we are in pokemon generation site 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:21.680
 if I'm in pokÃ©mon generation 'if I'm 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.779
 but it's not an update feeling it 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.449
 much the pokemon generation project 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.160
 it has been canceled entering is a video 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.720
 I do not just want to announce for 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.879
 all those those who are waiting 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.969
 a new video of pokemon generation 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:37.520
 Like me, you can also say 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.320
 comment it directly on the project 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.300
 it has been canceled what a 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.460
 19 year old boy by the way 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.210
 and he had to cancel it because no no 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.340
 he could not and he has left and he is no longer going 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.629
 to be updated more is more if you try 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.590
 open the launcher to me at least not 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.370
 let me not open it 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.829
 you have to do it directly and then 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.269
 nothing really was just a shortie video 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.850
 I wanted to make a short video explaining 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.420
 reasons especially that he is 19 years old that 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.860
 can not that they were not helping anyone 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.409
 well he asked for help to the truth for 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.110
 animators but no no no helped her to the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.210
 necessary people and the project has 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.490
 canceled but he has canceled to 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.460
 always is , I think it will not return 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.450
 never though I think he has a university 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.450
 and those things and it's logical that 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.229
 I go to college and those things 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.200
 I see it logical and canceled it is 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.080
 more is that he has not given more explanations 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.110
 chosen out there by the forum and such 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.490
 it will not come back from the last 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.030
 December update I have not 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.350
 worked I try to do more things but 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.000
 but I do not change today it's going to change the 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.970
 character that was going to be super cool 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.010
 the capture animations and all that 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.870
 but no but no but no but it's not a 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.970
 news quite sad because to me 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.940
 I really like the game and the game this one 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.070
 has had a lot of potential but 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.590
 well do not close a door but it 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.250
 open a window as they say and there is another 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.250
 game of 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.150
 of similar programming that looks like 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.720
 called pokemon journey within very 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:20.250
 little you will have video in the channel about 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.950
 about the game the truth I understand 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.430
 here to cancel and I hope that this 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.980
 again do not cancel it I'll upload it I'll upload it 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.750
 when I can because he has some 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.459
 little problem with windows 8 and I have 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.739
 windows 8 is a pretty touching move 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.430
 but I'm not here to talk about 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:42.450
 about windows 8 problems but for 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.819
 say what then that closes a one a 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.250
 pretty toxic project I had 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.379
 quite important that it was this that I 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.930
 It is very sad that I feel very sorry but that 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.329
 is going to do can not do anything 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.740
 If you have decided to finish it will be because it will be 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.810
 something so 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.970
 so nothing a 3 minute hard video 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.140
 I just wanted to explain that because there 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.670
 people who were waiting for him 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.860
 true videos of this so I'm sorry 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.150
 much see you at the next one is 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.150
