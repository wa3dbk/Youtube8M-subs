00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.440
 well we are talking today about a topic that 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.860
 Really 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.209
 it is quite frequent within what 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.900
 are the regrouping procedures 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:21.329
 family members of Spanish citizens in 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.210
 this case we talk about the requirement of 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:27.239
 live to live in charge when you want 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.390
 real du parc to the parents of a 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.890
 Spanish citizen in community scheme 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.110
 it's not exactly regrouping 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.780
 we talk about obtaining a visa 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.030
 regrouping of the community scheme or 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.309
 a community card in the case of 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.309
 that family member is already in 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.710
 Spain 'well when a Spanish is shuffled 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.929
 the possibility that his parents come 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.210
 to Spain because they depend on it is very 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.039
 important to keep in mind that both the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.979
 consulate if the request is necessary 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.510
 of this visa as in Spain to 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.719
 request the corresponding card 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.879
 Community are going to demand that in 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.040
 these two moments are going to demand that 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.020
 we prove the existence of that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.170
 economic dependence of the citizen 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.950
 foreign with respect to his relative 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.340
 Spanish and it is very important to prove 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.759
 reliably mind this dependence 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.399
 this requirement of living in charge well 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.500
 this is not so simple, it is not so 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.009
 simple because many times we do not take 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.100
 the precaution of collecting those 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.469
 evidence of economic dependence on 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.259
 live in charge that then we will do 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.420
 missing to make this visa 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.950
 family reunification or 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.189
 community card 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.890
 Once the family is already in Spain 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.069
 very important that for example when 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.630
 we make these money transfers for 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.909
 that our our father or our 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.750
 mother can be kept in her country 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.280
 or when even living in Spain 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.189
 we keep our 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.810
 family members we always need to have the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.789
 caution that that those acts of 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.310
 maintenance of economic support 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.950
 have a documentary reflection we can 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.790
 then have the documentary evidence that 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.430
 allow us to prove that this requirement of 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.680
 live 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.510
 we always recommend that 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.209
 money transfers are made by part 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.870
 of espanyol to their families in a way 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.379
 direct 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.269
 through the bank through companies 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.099
 as western union as money gram 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.480
 etcetera but that they are carried out in a 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.209
 direct that they are made in a 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.620
 periodically not to family members a 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.599
 brothers to friends 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.000
 ok because if we do not we will not have a 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.090
 then prove that all this 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.250
 we keep that yes if we want 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.140
 perform to several relatives or by 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.900
 example to the two parents because these 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.489
 We send money to both or 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.370
 that both are holders of the same 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.739
 realize that we transfer those 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.780
 amounts every month and so on 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.700
 this way when we have to request 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.170
 the visa and when we have to 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.359
 request it with Spain the card 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.760
 Community will not be much much more 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.159
 simple to prove that dependence 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.829
 economic and this requirement to live 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.379
 charge without which it is impossible neither 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.829
 get the visa or get the 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.359
 community card in these cases of 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.769
 ascendants of Spaniards or also in 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:28.489
 the case of the descendants of 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.349
 Spaniards over 21 years of age or already 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.950
 I recommend you always have very in 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.440
 count this face 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.480
 to future procedures and preparing 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.209
 well the documentation so that then it's 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.370
 simple to prove that situation of 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.500
 economic dependence with respect to 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.330
 family member in the case as 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.470
 I say of parents and children 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.470
 over 21 years old
