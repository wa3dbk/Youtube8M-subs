00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.710 
I mix some of her foundation with an
even<00:02:20.920> darker<00:02:21.100> foundation<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.180> just<00:02:22.420> stripe

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
even darker foundation and I just stripe

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.260 
even darker foundation and I just stripe
it<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:22.990> her<00:02:23.200> face<00:02:24.010> underneath<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.700> cheekbones

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
it on her face underneath the cheekbones

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.020 
it on her face underneath the cheekbones
just<00:02:25.600> using<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.080> concealer<00:02:26.500> brush<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.100> then<00:02:28.000> I

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
just using a concealer brush and then I

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.600 
just using a concealer brush and then I
blended<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.690> out<00:02:28.840> with<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.410> same<00:02:29.650> sponge<00:02:30.400> that

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
blended it out with the same sponge that

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.280 
blended it out with the same sponge that
I<00:02:30.670> was<00:02:30.790> using<00:02:31.000> before<00:02:31.150> she<00:02:31.900> doesn't<00:02:32.110> really

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
I was using before she doesn't really

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.540 
I was using before she doesn't really
need<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:32.680> because<00:02:32.860> she's<00:02:33.130> got<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> very

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
need this because she's got a very

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.900 
need this because she's got a very
sculpted<00:02:34.300> bone<00:02:35.290> structure<00:02:35.920> anyway<00:02:36.340> but<00:02:36.670> it

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
sculpted bone structure anyway but it

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.670 
sculpted bone structure anyway but it
just<00:02:37.090> does<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.300> bit<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.570> dimension<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.440> face

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
just does a bit of dimension to the face

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.830 
just does a bit of dimension to the face
and<00:02:38.790> prevents<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.880> from<00:02:40.000> being<00:02:40.240> like<00:02:40.330> all<00:02:40.630> the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
and prevents it from being like all the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.920 
and prevents it from being like all the
one<00:02:41.050> color<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.100> guess<00:02:42.220> from<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:43.360> foundation

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
one color I guess from the foundation

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.020 
one color I guess from the foundation
now<00:02:44.470> I'm<00:02:44.590> using<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.980> cream<00:02:45.340> highlighter<00:02:45.910> just
