so Coral Sea there's two carriers that
are<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:12.540> two<00:00:12.750> carriers<00:00:13.170> with<00:00:13.380> planes<00:00:13.620> of

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
are just two carriers with planes of

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.369 
are just two carriers with planes of
spawning<00:00:14.299> instantaneously<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.870> map<00:00:16.139> is

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
spawning instantaneously this map is

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.400 
spawning instantaneously this map is
brought<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.830> because<00:00:17.310> people<00:00:18.020> could<00:00:19.020> not<00:00:19.260> get

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
brought in because people could not get

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.500 
brought in because people could not get
enough<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.740> planes<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:20.910> put<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.150> there

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
enough of planes and was put out there

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.900 
enough of planes and was put out there
to<00:00:21.689> kind<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.050> satisfy<00:00:22.320> those<00:00:22.920> urges<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.640> get<00:00:23.820> in

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
to kind of satisfy those urges to get in

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.000 
to kind of satisfy those urges to get in
the<00:00:24.000> fucking<00:00:24.420> nearest<00:00:25.170> plane<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.590> crash<00:00:25.769> it

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
the fucking nearest plane and crash it

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.040 
the fucking nearest plane and crash it
into<00:00:26.130> something<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.539> idea<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.019> just

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
into something so the idea is you just

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.960 
into something so the idea is you just
want<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.410> destroy<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> carrier<00:00:29.279> right<00:00:29.519> but

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
want to destroy the carrier right but

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.540 
want to destroy the carrier right but
this<00:00:30.090> map<00:00:30.330> has<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> huge<00:00:31.470> fucking<00:00:31.800> exploit<00:00:32.520> that

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
this map has a huge fucking exploit that

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.910 
this map has a huge fucking exploit that
I<00:00:32.790> figured<00:00:33.210> out<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.360> long<00:00:33.600> time<00:00:33.660> ago<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.649> that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
I figured out a long time ago and that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.770 
I figured out a long time ago and that
is<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.280> any<00:00:35.520> server<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.059> doesn't<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> lot

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
is on any server that doesn't have a lot

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.990 
is on any server that doesn't have a lot
of<00:00:37.050> friendly<00:00:37.410> fire<00:00:38.600> you<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.780> land<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
of friendly fire you can land in the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.760 
of friendly fire you can land in the
explain<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.390> can<00:00:45.989> sit<00:00:46.289> there<00:00:46.320> fucking

explain and you can sit there fucking

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.500 
explain and you can sit there fucking
planes<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.579> drop<00:00:47.820> bombs<00:00:48.059> right<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
planes and just drop bombs right on the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.840 
planes and just drop bombs right on the
fucking<00:00:48.899> carrier<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.100> damaged<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
fucking carrier so you damaged the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.029 
fucking carrier so you damaged the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
serve as like five percent friendly fire

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.000 
serve as like five percent friendly fire
so<00:01:06.780> every<00:01:06.900> time<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.110> drop<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> while<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:07.830> hurt
