00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello and welcome to this news 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.790
 ortho video and nico today I 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.430
 will show you how to use the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.100
 doble game frame that I create for the 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.830
 site so the first step 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.960
 it's going to be creating your list of 57 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.900
 words that you want to put in 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.009
 your game then you will open the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.949
 frame with inkscape software here 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.579
 as you see in eight cards on 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.250
 the same page so to start you 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.450
 go go on word 1 click on 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.670
 tab the text edit button 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.650
 and you will be able to change the word 1 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.030
 to put the word you want 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.780
 put in your card for example 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.060
 apple as you can see on the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.500
 other cards the word apple was 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.310
 automatically updated 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.850
 that's on the first eight cards you 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.460
 go supplemented that way the 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.890
 57 words of 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.930
 your list on this page number one 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:16.369
 so for example modeuses would be 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:21.110
 strawberry the word 3 it would be a pineapple the 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:25.310
 word also it would be banana etc etc so 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.869
 you complete the 57 me once 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.140
 you have completed all that it is possible 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.360
 that you have two words long one beside 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.369
 on the other hand, we'll have to move a 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.840
 little bit the words on each card for 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.280
 we will click on the small arrow 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.050
 the selection tool 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.110
 and then just you go 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.170
 able to walk your calves move a 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.179
 little bit as you wish and from 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.869
 the same way we go the ways and 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:53.390
 check on all other cards 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.149
 so the remaining 49 cards that were 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.640
 automatically complete with your words 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.409
 we were just going to check at the level of 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.350
 the layout that is not of 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.649
 overlap one word on the other so 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.399
 to access these other cards while 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.769
 just go there down there 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.739
 just his little slider the little go 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.640
 eye is the one that can hide 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.049
 or to display the different layers 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.739
 so what I used a system of 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.049
 layers to generate our pages him 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.920
 games so every page and on a layer 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:33.739
 so the rest of our work is fine 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.390
 to be a cache game and a layer for 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.519
 to display another one otherwise we would have 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.000
 all that would be super posed one by 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.970
 on top of each other 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.680
 So there you go hide layer that 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.090
 corresponds to page number one and in 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.030
 the drop down menu right next one 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.280
 choose page 2 and display the page 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.840
 So as you can see here 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.489
 has some words that have been completed 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.160
 for example word strawberries which was my 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.799
 word number 2 or the word pineapple that was 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.290
 in number 3 and the others did not 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.799
 not changed since I was not reading 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.630
 completed on page one so there the 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.100
 work it's just going to be checking at 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.410
 level of the layout that is not of 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.609
 overlap and otherwise there is nothing to 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.500
 make 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.380
 in the same way in cash 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.410
 we choose page 3 we display the page 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:25.210
 3 et cetera et cetera for each page 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.940
 from page 2 to 8 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.500
 after that you just have to print 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.110
 our game because you have recorded our 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.840
 card game for that we'll go back 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.680
 on the call which page numbers numbers 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.380
 have the plug 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.840
 here we go will the exported files 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.739
 in bitmap the exported area is our 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.480
 page and in the file names so 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.550
 you choose one where you want 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.970
 save and we'll save it in 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:57.140
 noting page one we click on export 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.850
 so he creates us an image file with 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.660
 page one ie the eight 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.600
 first cards 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.760
 then we will go down and click on 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.709
 the ion hides the case that from the page a 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:14.540
 we display page 2 we change here the 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:16.519
 file name apache 2 on exports and of 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.479
 the same way I hide my page 2 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.820
 display page 3 I change the name of the 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.160
 file I export is how we go 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.430
 export the eight pages of our 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.610
 document then you have more than 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.890
 print the eight images or so if 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.320
 you want to create a pdf document by 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.150
 example I advise you to use the 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.890
 free software office with the tool of 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.010
 drawing could create a document 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.940
 multipage m on each page one of 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.050
 imagery 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:51.190
 and then generate an easily small pdf 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.720
 trick for those who would like to change 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.360
 things at the layout level 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.280
 so if you want to change things 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.270
 about the color of the words the police 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.550
 use etc 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:06.560
 always put yourself on the page 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:09.880
 one so we go back to page one here 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.760
 here you will be able to modify 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.710
 whatever 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.030
 in terms of policies or in terms of 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.580
 colors on them 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.770
 fifty seven first words attention 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.830
 and your apples is our number one word 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.160
 it is only this one that is needed 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.590
 switch 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.230
 so let's say we will exchange the word 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.430
 apple on all our cards 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.930
 we're just going to 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.280
 select you can change his 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.560
 color for example wanted it to be 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.360
 in pink see I clicked on rose hop 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.610
 they are all gone in gold to the games can 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.710
 put back in black he passes all in black 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.900
 and in the same way they will have 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.820
 changed on whenever they 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.510
 appear in other neighborhoods the 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.030
 other pages 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.680
 if I want to change the font for example 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:56.420
 of bananas I think it's too much 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.300
 wide validating text and font text and 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.540
 here I changed my font for example 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:06.440
 and so he has changed here if we want 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:11.300
 check on page 2 dalmau banana which 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:14.180
 appears is normally at no it is 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.730
 not on the tarpaulin of it was not the word 2 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:20.740
 it was 6 sails and sailboats what that 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:23.150
 does six years cache not right the pages 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:28.630
 our word banana so that was the word 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:31.760
 number how much does this word banana or less 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:35.390
 well played he says here he appears here 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.370
 and so he has changed the font on 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.730
 all the cards we can go back on 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.080
 the page 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:45.440
 a and so that's how you can 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.950
 change the font size 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.200
 the color and then 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.640
 the type of police knowing that at each 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.770
 times when you change on the page 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.300
 number one 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:07:00.530
 the change is reflected 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:02.210
 automatically on all other words 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.660
 identical on the other cards 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.850
 that's okay listening and I hope this 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.850
 little quick this little video will have you 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.830
 helped to understand how works 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:15.440
 this game frame and then I you 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:18.530
 wish for good creation and I will 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.800
 see you soon on ortho inc au au 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.800
 meet again
