which makes white Harbor very unique I
will<00:00:19.710> very<00:00:19.949> fortunately<00:00:20.550> here<00:00:20.760> where<00:00:20.939> we<00:00:21.060> have

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
will very fortunately here where we have

you<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.809> see<00:00:48.989> we've<00:00:49.200> had<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.710> lot<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.100> these<00:00:50.250> big

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
you can see we've had a lot of these big

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.200 
you can see we've had a lot of these big
six<00:00:50.820> wheel<00:00:50.969> drive<00:00:51.270> trucks<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:51.989> we've<00:00:52.829> moved

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
six wheel drive trucks here we've moved

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.650 
six wheel drive trucks here we've moved
probably<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.510> hundred<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:56.660> seventy-five

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
probably a hundred and seventy-five

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.860 
probably a hundred and seventy-five
thousand<00:00:58.379> truck<00:00:58.620> loads<00:00:59.120> from<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.239> base<00:01:00.600> in

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
thousand truck loads from the base in

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.080 
thousand truck loads from the base in
here<00:01:02.809> basically<00:01:03.809> hoop<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:04.470> all<00:01:04.710> road<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.790> could

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
here basically hoop up all road it could

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.940 
here basically hoop up all road it could
all<00:01:06.270> go<00:01:06.299> get<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.780> golf<00:01:07.049> course<00:01:07.320> two<00:01:07.619> creeks

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
all go get to the golf course two creeks

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.429 
all go get to the golf course two creeks
and<00:01:08.130> elevations<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.880> golf<00:01:09.119> course<00:01:09.439> so

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
and elevations on the golf course so

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.410 
and elevations on the golf course so
that's<00:01:10.619> how<00:01:10.860> all<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.220> dirt<00:01:11.460> parking<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.299> that

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
that's how all the dirt parking and that

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.359 
that's how all the dirt parking and that
took<00:01:12.570> about<00:01:12.720> three<00:01:13.110> years<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.369> we've

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
took about three years so we've

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.660 
took about three years so we've
increased<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.570> area<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.799> will<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.310> fish

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
increased the area if you will of fish

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.570 
increased the area if you will of fish
habitat<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.450> really<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.080> lake<00:01:22.290> simcoe<00:01:22.580> by

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
habitat and really of lake simcoe by

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.240 
habitat and really of lake simcoe by
over<00:01:24.240> three<00:01:24.540> times

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
over three times

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.110 
over three times
so<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:27.690> yeah<00:01:28.140> we've<00:01:28.320> expanded<00:01:28.710> lake<00:01:29.100> simcoe<00:01:29.370> by

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
so we yeah we've expanded lake simcoe by

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.000 
so we yeah we've expanded lake simcoe by
about<00:01:31.790> okay<00:01:33.080> we<00:01:34.080> are<00:01:34.200> improving<00:01:34.440> what<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:34.830> call

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
about okay we are improving what we call

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.740 
about okay we are improving what we call
the<00:01:35.160> function<00:01:35.370> of<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.180> it'll<00:01:36.480> be<00:01:37.160> really

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
the function of this so it'll be really

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.410 
the function of this so it'll be really
desirable<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:40.560> fish<00:01:41.040> to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
desirable for fish to

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.260 
desirable for fish to
to<00:01:43.020> spawn<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:44.310> hear<00:01:44.549> their<00:01:44.759> young<00:01:44.970> hair

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
to spawn here to hear their young hair

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.230 
to spawn here to hear their young hair
and<00:01:45.600> tonight<00:01:46.020> here<00:01:46.400> so<00:01:47.400> as<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:48.060> right

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
and tonight here so as you can see right

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.620 
and tonight here so as you can see right
now<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.540> Mirena<00:01:49.170> floor<00:01:49.700> is<00:01:50.700> almost<00:01:51.240> finished

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
now the Mirena floor is almost finished

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.499 
now the Mirena floor is almost finished
that<00:01:51.750> fish<00:01:52.049> habitat<00:01:52.649> has<00:01:52.920> been<00:01:52.950> created<00:01:53.640> at

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
that fish habitat has been created at

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.749 
that fish habitat has been created at
the<00:01:54.750> other<00:01:54.869> end<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.380> where<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.950> dam<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.460> which

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
the other end is where the dam is which

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.870 
the other end is where the dam is which
is<00:01:56.880> holding<00:01:57.210> back<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.570> water<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.990> Lake<00:01:58.170> Simcoe

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
is holding back the water of Lake Simcoe

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.180 
is holding back the water of Lake Simcoe
water<00:01:59.880> will<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.330> coming<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> marina<00:02:01.950> in

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
water will be coming in to the marina in

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.260 
water will be coming in to the marina in
a<00:02:02.399> slow<00:02:02.670> pace<00:02:03.590> with<00:02:04.590> control<00:02:05.340> mechanism<00:02:06.000> it's

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
a slow pace with control mechanism it's

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.359 
a slow pace with control mechanism it's
not<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> pumping<00:02:06.899> system<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.039> gravity

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
not a pumping system it's a gravity

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.420 
not a pumping system it's a gravity
system<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.390> we're<00:02:10.319> cooperating<00:02:11.130> with<00:02:11.220> all
