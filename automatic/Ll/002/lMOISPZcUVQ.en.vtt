00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.480

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.850
 guzmán in study tutorials we will teach 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.330
 how to increase the speed of your 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:13.990
 minecraft or also increase the ram of 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.749
 its my craft and we started good first thing 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.359
 what we are going to do is go to the panel 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:22.929
 control you know they go to the box 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.190
 start and right click and you 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.280
 they will give 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.070
 the control panel those who have 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.010
 windows 7 already know that it goes to the beginning and 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.680
 here you get a screen and here by 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.840
 this side is going to be a tab that was 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.200
 good control panel once it is 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.070
 opened the control panel up here in 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.190
 the search will put java 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.079
 and this tab of java will come out 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.559
 one click 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.320
 and they will wait for it to open as it consists 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:01.929
 this if you have 2 gb will do this 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:05.729
 will put 1024 or 1024 if you 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.729
 they have 4 gigabytes they will put 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.409
 2048 if you have 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.210
 six gigabytes will put three thousand 72 and if 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.300
 they have eight gigabytes and you will put 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.900
 four thousand 96 if you have four 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.810
 gigabytes of recommendable that they put 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:31.340
 2048 since if they are passed they can cause 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:35.030
 an error when removing the launcher and you know 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:39.350
 only when they put this they have to 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:44.660
 put forces ion uppercase x m in 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:48.590
 lowercase and 2048 m in uppercase so that 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.910
 grab the ram memory this is for 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.600
 the java executable and they will accept 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:59.660
 and apply and again accept good 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.700
 we will open the launcher remember that if 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.479
 they want them to go faster close the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.149
 Internet 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.640
 close any tab that they have 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.739
 open here below and here already 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.800
 they will put their name and here where it says 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:17.130
 edith profile and we will crush once 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.780
 we will look here we will select this 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:25.080
 tab that says jvm arguments and you 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.060
 we will give colombia not to appear as well as 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.830
 a leader if you want to put two 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.710
 gigas then just change the number 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.650
 for the gigas you want, you know that if 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.160
 they have two gigabytes they correspond one 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.320
 if you have each other they have four 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.530
 they correspond two if they have eight 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.390
 they correspond four and so on 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.290
 I'll put two because I have four and 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.590
 they will give you know and I already told you in two 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.170
 gigabytes remember that the last one should 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.590
 to be capitalized and they know 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.650
 profile 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.450
 and now we are going to give play you know 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.230
 that if you have a very memory 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.550
 small as a gigabyte 512 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.349
 megabytes should not change what 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.050
 they should leave the same because if they can not 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.239
 cause an error on your computer or 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.879
