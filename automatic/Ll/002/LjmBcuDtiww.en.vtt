00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:12.050

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:14.840
 home look like this I did and this 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.630
 I did two to play but more without 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.819
 weapons because of it will be heavier 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.819
 Look, observe, I'm going to put the camera 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.260
 to try to understand 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.260
 while there are thanks 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.469
 Y 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:51.579
 you saw but well I'm very look at that 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:57.809
 Well what I was going to say is that the 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.809
 materials a layer of iron 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:06.100
 any piece of plastic that they see 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.330
 as a weapon for example it can be a 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.370
 bullet of a toy 16 this this is a 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.030
 bullet of a doll that he had from a 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.220
 pistol but hey this a doll of 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.500
 clay 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.260
 that you are a clear ninja but they are the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.090
 half of the doll and no arms good the 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:32.250
 first step is this put the gun in 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:36.430
 the arms of the doll that is long like this 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.450
 the doll with arms will be like that 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.450
 of the weapon now 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.909
 next step 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:58.640
 we're also going to need play dough and 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:00.890
 a this good screw is going through 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.750
 in screws the plasticine so that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.750
 look like a beyblade like that look 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:14.920
 nothing else that is not going to turn 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:18.050

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.010

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.670

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.800
