this is at the preliminary stage for
cutting<00:01:16.610> slices<00:01:17.090> off<00:01:17.240> here

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.650 

is<00:01:21.820> a<00:01:21.880> very<00:01:22.210> dense<00:01:22.600> rye<00:01:22.960> bread

if<00:01:26.660> you<00:01:26.780> like<00:01:26.930> this<00:01:27.080> sort<00:01:27.290> of<00:01:27.410> thing<00:01:27.560> it's

if you like this sort of thing it's

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.270 
if you like this sort of thing it's
absolutely<00:01:28.250> wonderful<00:01:29.650> now<00:01:30.650> I'll<00:01:30.800> cut<00:01:31.010> again

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
absolutely wonderful now I'll cut again

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.900 
absolutely wonderful now I'll cut again
like<00:01:31.640> this<00:01:33.010> with<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.100> dense<00:01:34.280> rye<00:01:34.490> bread<00:01:34.730> like

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
like this with the dense rye bread like

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.490 
like this with the dense rye bread like
this<00:01:34.940> you<00:01:35.300> normally<00:01:35.660> cut<00:01:35.810> it<00:01:35.930> pretty<00:01:36.170> thinly

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
this you normally cut it pretty thinly

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.539 
this you normally cut it pretty thinly
what<00:01:37.130> I'm<00:01:37.220> doing

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.950 

the<00:01:42.060> angle<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> cut<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.170> made<00:01:43.409> originally

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
the angle of the cut you made originally

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.120 
the angle of the cut you made originally
determines<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> length<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> slice<00:01:46.890> of

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
determines the length of the slice of

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.670 
determines the length of the slice of
red<00:01:47.340> you're<00:01:47.520> going<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:48.350> if<00:01:49.350> I'd<00:01:49.500> had<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
red you're going to have if I'd had a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:58.160 
red you're going to have if I'd had a
more<00:01:49.950> acute<00:01:50.790> cut<00:01:51.090> we'd<00:01:51.689> have<00:01:51.840> shorter<00:01:52.170> slices

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.020 

what's<00:01:58.770> neat<00:01:59.280> about<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.940> you're

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
what's neat about this and you're

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.800 
what's neat about this and you're
getting<00:02:00.120> larger<00:02:00.690> slices<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.970> pretty

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
getting larger slices and pretty

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.120 
getting larger slices and pretty
consistent<00:02:04.530> slices<00:02:05.840> again<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:07.050> good<00:02:07.950> knife

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
consistent slices again a good knife

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.550 
consistent slices again a good knife
