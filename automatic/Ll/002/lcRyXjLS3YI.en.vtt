now<00:00:10.230> it's<00:00:10.440> time<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.710> install<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.519> antenna

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
now it's time to install the antenna

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.730 
now it's time to install the antenna
straw<00:00:12.179> but<00:00:12.509> before<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:12.840> do<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.080> have<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.410> tell<00:00:13.620> you

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
straw but before I do I have to tell you

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.680 
straw but before I do I have to tell you
this<00:00:14.009> wire<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.549> little<00:00:14.820> bit<00:00:14.969> longer<00:00:15.240> than<00:00:15.540> it

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
this wire is a little bit longer than it

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.540 
this wire is a little bit longer than it
usually<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:16.049> because<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.680> replaced<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.220> a

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
usually is because I replaced it with a

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.480 
usually is because I replaced it with a
longer<00:00:17.760> wire<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.990> with<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> extra<00:00:19.800> wire<00:00:20.189> I

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
longer wire so with the extra wire I

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.670 
longer wire so with the extra wire I
just<00:00:20.730> bunched<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.180> up<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.689> put<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.230> down<00:00:22.350> with

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
just bunched it up and put it down with

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.029 
just bunched it up and put it down with
the<00:00:22.830> wire<00:00:23.039> tie<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.420> all<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.080> do<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.619> beat

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
the wire tie so all I have to do is beat

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.120 
the wire tie so all I have to do is beat
this<00:00:26.279> through<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.670> tube<00:00:27.470> then<00:00:28.470> once<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.010> goes

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
this through the tube then once it goes

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.589 
this through the tube then once it goes
through<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.429> other<00:00:29.609> end<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.090> could<00:00:30.240> just<00:00:30.390> pull

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
through the other end I could just pull

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.830 
through the other end I could just pull
it<00:00:30.720> out<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.990> rest<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.410> way<00:00:31.759> this<00:00:32.759> sits<00:00:33.600> in

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
it out the rest of the way this sits in

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.880 
it out the rest of the way this sits in
that<00:00:33.960> little<00:00:34.290> groove<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:34.950> there<00:00:36.620> then<00:00:37.620> we

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
that little groove right there then we

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.850 
that little groove right there then we
have<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.250> interesting<00:00:38.640> little<00:00:39.030> nut<00:00:39.860> that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
have this interesting little nut that

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.049 
have this interesting little nut that
you<00:00:41.190> feed<00:00:41.989> antenna<00:00:42.989> straw<00:00:43.350> through<00:00:43.789> and<00:00:44.789> this

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
you feed antenna straw through and this

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.139 
you feed antenna straw through and this
is<00:00:45.450> what<00:00:45.629> holds<00:00:46.020> down<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.559> antenna<00:00:46.980> now<00:00:47.309> when

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
is what holds down the antenna now when

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.970 
is what holds down the antenna now when
you<00:00:48.239> buy<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> /<00:00:48.840> Brad<00:00:49.200> nail<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.649> gives<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
you buy a / Brad nail it gives you a

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.340 
you buy a / Brad nail it gives you a
little<00:00:50.190> tool<00:00:50.460> for<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> use<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.110> find

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
little tool for you to use but I find

little tool for you to use but I find
you<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.590> tighten<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:53.969> much<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.180> you

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
you can tighten this just as much as you

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.740 
you can tighten this just as much as you
need<00:00:54.570> to

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
need to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.630 
need to

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
by hand now I'm gonna flip it to the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.639 
by hand now I'm gonna flip it to the
other<00:00:56.730> side<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.870> I'm<00:00:58.020> gonna<00:00:58.140> do<00:00:58.350> something

is going to sit out a little bit more

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.740 
is going to sit out a little bit more
than<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.190> rear<00:02:19.400> wheel<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.090> what<00:02:20.240> I'm<00:02:20.330> gonna<00:02:20.420> do

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.840 
than the rear wheel so what I'm gonna do
is<00:02:21.050> I'm<00:02:21.230> gonna<00:02:21.320> switch<00:02:21.770> out<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.280> wheel<00:02:22.490> hex

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850

to<00:02:27.620> make<00:02:27.770> sure<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.460> tire<00:02:28.700> sits<00:02:29.150> straight

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
to make sure that the tire sits straight

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.340 
to make sure that the tire sits straight
from<00:02:29.780> each<00:02:29.900> other

from each other

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.500 
from each other
so<00:02:31.010> this<00:02:31.130> is<00:02:31.310> gonna<00:02:31.430> be<00:02:31.640> really<00:02:31.820> easy<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.300> just
