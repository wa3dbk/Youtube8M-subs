magnet<00:00:37.720> just<00:00:38.720> clearly<00:00:39.260> on<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.530> two-inch

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:49.590 

okay<00:00:43.649> my<00:00:44.649> paint<00:00:44.890> was<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.100> little<00:00:45.399> wet<00:00:45.610> here<00:00:48.600> this

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
okay my paint was a little wet here this

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.680 
okay my paint was a little wet here this
is<00:00:49.750> what<00:00:49.899> I<00:00:49.930> came<00:00:50.050> up<00:00:50.379> with<00:00:50.410> because<00:00:51.309> I<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
is what I came up with because I the

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.009 
is what I came up with because I the
bearing<00:00:53.110> does<00:00:53.290> have<00:00:54.090> some<00:00:55.090> self<00:00:55.329> aligning<00:00:55.690> so

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
bearing does have some self aligning so

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.360 
bearing does have some self aligning so
that<00:00:56.170> if<00:00:56.290> your<00:00:56.440> wings<00:00:56.620> aren't<00:00:56.829> perfect<00:00:57.250> this

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
that if your wings aren't perfect this

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.399 
that if your wings aren't perfect this
can<00:00:57.579> be<00:00:57.730> off<00:00:58.480> now<00:00:58.750> with<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:59.019> counter<00:00:59.260> rotating

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
can be off now with the counter rotating

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.670 
can be off now with the counter rotating
either<00:00:59.980> way<00:01:00.100> adjust<00:01:00.430> that<00:01:01.110> so<00:01:02.110> what<00:01:02.230> I<00:01:02.260> did<00:01:02.409> is

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
either way adjust that so what I did is

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.590 
either way adjust that so what I did is
I<00:01:02.829> tapped<00:01:03.129> holes<00:01:03.519> in<00:01:03.730> the<00:01:03.820> quarter<00:01:04.149> inch<00:01:04.300> disc

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
I tapped holes in the quarter inch disc

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.040 
I tapped holes in the quarter inch disc
here<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:06.280> I<00:01:06.490> can<00:01:06.670> move<00:01:06.790> these<00:01:07.000> nuts<00:01:07.630> up<00:01:07.869> or

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
here and I can move these nuts up or

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.580 
here and I can move these nuts up or
down<00:01:08.170> and<00:01:08.380> lock<00:01:08.560> them<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:10.600> shift<00:01:10.869> that<00:01:11.050> disk<00:01:11.380> if

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
down and lock them to shift that disk if

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:19.230 
down and lock them to shift that disk if
I<00:01:11.710> need<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:15.240> once<00:01:16.240> it's<00:01:16.450> up

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.690 

the<00:01:20.240> stator<00:01:20.510> I'll<00:01:20.690> have<00:01:20.810> adjustment<00:01:21.320> on<00:01:21.409> -

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
the stator I'll have adjustment on -

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.120 
the stator I'll have adjustment on -
just<00:01:22.700> like<00:01:22.909> yourself

I'm<00:01:42.950> lucky<00:01:43.250> enough<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.550> have<00:01:43.729> a<00:01:43.790> lathe<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:44.479> I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
I'm lucky enough to have a lathe so I

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.359 
I'm lucky enough to have a lathe so I
just<00:01:45.890> turn<00:01:46.100> it<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.460> dimension<00:01:46.850> I<00:01:47.270> need

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
just turn it to the dimension I need

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.130 
just turn it to the dimension I need
these<00:01:49.369> are<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.550> new<00:01:49.790> rotors<00:01:50.150> now<00:01:50.330> I've<00:01:50.509> got<00:01:53.140> 16

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
these are the new rotors now I've got 16

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.200 
these are the new rotors now I've got 16
magnets<00:01:54.619> four<00:01:54.860> discs<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.930> each<00:01:57.110> disc<00:01:57.440> now

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
magnets four discs and each disc now

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.810 
magnets four discs and each disc now
for<00:01:59.840> headache<00:02:01.720> so

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.700 
for headache so
hopefully<00:02:04.630> when<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:04.780> get<00:02:04.990> this<00:02:05.140> thing<00:02:05.200> up<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.680> a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
hopefully when I get this thing up it a

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.530 
hopefully when I get this thing up it a
lot<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.340> little<00:02:06.760> better<00:02:06.909> than<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.210> last<00:02:07.390> one
