00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.629
 that if this pejÃ´ works with the key 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:08.850
 that is when the right key does not 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:14.130
 is working because it is the case that goes 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:19.430
 Turning on the flash goes but the right key does not 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.430
