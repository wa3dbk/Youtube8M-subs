actually a very good material and it's
very<00:00:42.300> durable<00:00:42.600> feels<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.410> lot<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.800> real

trigger group and your bolt carrier

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.810 
trigger group and your bolt carrier
everything<00:01:16.200> cuz<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.220> found<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.670> they've

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
everything cuz what I found is they've

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.429 
everything cuz what I found is they've
tried<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.180> put<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> factory<00:01:18.869> grease<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.409> it

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
tried to put a factory grease on it

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.609 
tried to put a factory grease on it
that's<00:01:19.710> really<00:01:20.040> crappy<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.700> sludgy<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
that's really crappy and sludgy and the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.380 
that's really crappy and sludgy and the
residue<00:01:22.950> left<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.460> slowed<00:01:23.729> down<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> action

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
residue left just slowed down the action

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.840 
residue left just slowed down the action
of<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.570> gun<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.259> yeah<00:01:26.040> what<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> did<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.670> just

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
of the gun so yeah what I did is just

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.850 
of the gun so yeah what I did is just
wiped<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.240> down<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.659> after<00:01:28.200> reading<00:01:28.409> online<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
wiped it down and after reading online I

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.520 
wiped it down and after reading online I
figured<00:01:29.579> out<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.140> honestly<00:01:31.140> using

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
figured out that honestly using

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.230 
figured out that honestly using
synthetic<00:01:31.860> gun<00:01:32.159> oil<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.610> probably<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> way

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
synthetic gun oil is probably the way

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.170 
synthetic gun oil is probably the way
ahead<00:01:33.479> over<00:01:33.659> silicone<00:01:34.530> because<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.189> tried

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
ahead over silicone because I tried

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.240 
ahead over silicone because I tried
using<00:01:36.360> silicone<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.229> while<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.829> my<00:01:37.950> friend

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
using silicone for a while for my friend

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.280 
using silicone for a while for my friend
and<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.759> don't<00:01:39.540> know<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.720> eventually

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and I don't know I just eventually

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.649 
and I don't know I just eventually
leaves<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.890> weird<00:01:41.130> residue<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.759> again<00:01:42.180> kind

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
leaves a weird residue that again kind

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.980 
leaves a weird residue that again kind
of<00:01:42.780> slowed<00:01:42.990> down<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> action<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> gun

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
of slowed down the action of the gun

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.389 
of slowed down the action of the gun
yeah<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.200> works<00:01:46.350> great<00:01:46.619> though<00:01:46.829> ever<00:01:47.100> since<00:01:47.310> I

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
yeah it works great though ever since I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.789 
yeah it works great though ever since I
put<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> gun<00:01:47.880> oil<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> no<00:01:48.509> problems<00:01:49.049> I've

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
put the gun oil on it no problems I've

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.039 
put the gun oil on it no problems I've
probably<00:01:50.430> only<00:01:50.729> put<00:01:51.170> I'd<00:01:52.170> say<00:01:53.899> 400<00:01:54.899> rounds

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
probably only put I'd say 400 rounds

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.880 
probably only put I'd say 400 rounds

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.480 
except for the fact that he got a bit of
a<00:05:57.400> lemon<00:05:57.610> because<00:05:58.139> his<00:05:59.139> gun<00:05:59.590> the<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:02.650> roller

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
a lemon because his gun the the roller

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.879 
a lemon because his gun the the roller
which<00:06:04.330> goes<00:06:04.539> on<00:06:04.630> top<00:06:04.840> of<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.050> hammer<00:06:05.319> inside

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
which goes on top of the hammer inside

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.580 
which goes on top of the hammer inside
the<00:06:06.460> pen<00:06:06.789> that<00:06:07.000> held<00:06:07.210> it<00:06:07.389> in<00:06:07.509> actual<00:06:08.349> is<00:06:08.440> a<00:06:08.469> bit

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
the pen that held it in actual is a bit

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.080 
the pen that held it in actual is a bit
too<00:06:08.710> loose<00:06:08.979> when<00:06:09.190> he<00:06:09.219> got<00:06:09.400> it<00:06:09.550> over<00:06:09.639> the<00:06:09.759> cement

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
too loose when he got it over the cement

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.459 
too loose when he got it over the cement
was<00:06:10.240> loose<00:06:10.419> or<00:06:10.569> something<00:06:10.690> and<00:06:10.990> it<00:06:11.050> fell<00:06:11.289> out

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:11.469 
was loose or something and it fell out

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.279 
was loose or something and it fell out
so<00:06:12.099> we<00:06:12.370> had<00:06:12.520> to<00:06:12.669> return<00:06:13.449> for<00:06:13.690> that<00:06:13.810> found<00:06:14.110> it

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
so we had to return for that found it

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.439 
so we had to return for that found it
and<00:06:14.440> we<00:06:15.310> ended<00:06:15.490> up<00:06:15.520> putting<00:06:15.669> a<00:06:15.789> roll<00:06:16.029> pin<00:06:16.270> in

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
and we ended up putting a roll pin in

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.510 
and we ended up putting a roll pin in
there<00:06:16.599> instead<00:06:17.020> so<00:06:17.409> it<00:06:17.590> would<00:06:18.130> be<00:06:18.250> really

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
there instead so it would be really

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.309 
there instead so it would be really
stiff<00:06:18.849> and<00:06:19.029> you<00:06:19.180> know<00:06:19.300> it's<00:06:19.449> better<00:06:19.630> now<00:06:19.840> mine

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 
stiff and you know it's better now mine

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.519 
stiff and you know it's better now mine
just<00:06:21.310> as<00:06:21.460> a<00:06:21.490> precursor<00:06:22.360> to<00:06:22.569> that<00:06:22.659> in<00:06:23.050> case<00:06:23.319> that

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:23.529 
just as a precursor to that in case that

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:25.110 
just as a precursor to that in case that
it<00:06:23.590> was<00:06:23.680> didn't<00:06:24.340> wanted<00:06:24.520> to<00:06:24.580> break<00:06:24.849> you<00:06:25.029> know

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
it was didn't wanted to break you know

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.450 
it was didn't wanted to break you know
so<00:06:25.840> when<00:06:25.960> I<00:06:25.990> got<00:06:26.259> it<00:06:26.409> I<00:06:26.500> just<00:06:26.529> put<00:06:26.800> Loctite<00:06:27.430> on

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
so when I got it I just put Loctite on

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.969 
so when I got it I just put Loctite on
that<00:06:27.759> thing<00:06:28.060> is<00:06:28.210> don't<00:06:28.659> a<00:06:28.810> little<00:06:28.930> nut<00:06:29.229> inside

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979 
that thing is don't a little nut inside

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:31.560 
that thing is don't a little nut inside
there<00:06:30.279> to<00:06:30.460> hold<00:06:30.610> it<00:06:30.789> still<00:06:31.029> as<00:06:31.210> long<00:06:31.330> as<00:06:31.449> the

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
there to hold it still as long as the

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.830 
there to hold it still as long as the
roll

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
roll

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.200 
roll
