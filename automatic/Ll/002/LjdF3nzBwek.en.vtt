00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
covered in there was the RIPD L which I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.880 
covered in there was the RIPD L which I
call<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.420> right<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.289> showed<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.770> the

call it right and I showed you the
importance<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.730> hip<00:00:48.300> hinge<00:00:48.539> all<00:00:49.079> right

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
importance of the hip hinge all right

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.889 
importance of the hip hinge all right
when<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.440> hinge<00:00:49.739> our<00:00:49.980> hips<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.239> hinge

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
when we hinge our hips we can hinge

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.760 
when we hinge our hips we can hinge
straight<00:00:52.379> down<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.960> here<00:00:54.960> or<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.739> can

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
straight down like that here or we can

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.520 
straight down like that here or we can
hinge<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> backward<00:00:57.260> movement<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
hinge with a backward movement of the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.130 
hinge with a backward movement of the
hips<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:58.890> well<00:00:59.059> that's<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.210> critical<00:01:00.660> point<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
hips as well that's a critical point and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.160 
hips as well that's a critical point and
I<00:01:01.260> think<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.949> much<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.460> then<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> thought<00:01:03.570> why

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
I think so much so then I thought why

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.630 
I think so much so then I thought why

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.530 
basically just take it around put it
right<00:01:45.899> inside<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.470> itself<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:47.210> that<00:01:48.210> it's

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
right inside of itself like that it's

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.170 
right inside of itself like that it's
anchored<00:01:48.869> around<00:01:49.409> now<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.340> take<00:01:50.640> both<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.909> them

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
anchored around now we take both of them

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.179 
anchored around now we take both of them
and<00:01:51.479> we're<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.290> step<00:01:52.439> inside<00:01:53.030> like<00:01:54.030> this

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
and we're going to step inside like this

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.179 
and we're going to step inside like this
put<00:01:56.189> them<00:01:56.250> around<00:01:56.369> our<00:01:56.700> hips<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.619> then<00:01:58.619> kneel

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
put them around our hips and then kneel

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.580 
put them around our hips and then kneel
on<00:01:59.399> something<00:01:59.850> that's<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.110> tolerate<00:02:01.259> up

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
on something that's going to tolerate up

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.880 
on something that's going to tolerate up
you<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.799> our<00:02:02.070> knees<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:03.229> basically<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
you know our knees so basically the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.160 
you know our knees so basically the
importance<00:02:05.430> here<00:02:05.520> guys<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.180> two<00:02:06.750> things

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
importance here guys is two things

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.469 
importance here guys is two things
number<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.280> want<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.550> feel<00:02:08.879> what<00:02:09.330> it's

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
like to hinge at the hip with the back

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.699 
like to hinge at the hip with the back
your<00:02:12.849> movement<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.599> hips<00:02:13.810> like<00:02:14.319> I<00:02:14.470> showed

your movement of the hips like I showed
you<00:02:14.769> in<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.010> second<00:02:15.459> demonstration<00:02:16.030> so

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
you in that second demonstration so

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
we talked about in another video the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.000 
we talked about in another video the
second<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.790> most<00:03:10.030> important<00:03:10.540> thing<00:03:10.690> here<00:03:10.959> is

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
second the most important thing here is

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.339 
second the most important thing here is
glute<00:03:12.010> activation<00:03:12.569> that's<00:03:13.569> so<00:03:13.900> important<00:03:14.319> to

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
glute activation that's so important to

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.839 
glute activation that's so important to
everything<00:03:14.769> we<00:03:14.980> do<00:03:15.099> it<00:03:15.160> I'll<00:03:15.250> demonstrate<00:03:15.489> as

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
everything we do it I'll demonstrate as

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:16.789 
everything we do it I'll demonstrate as
soon<00:03:16.000> as<00:03:16.090> we're<00:03:16.209> done<00:03:16.239> here

soon as we're done here

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.640 
soon as we're done here
after<00:03:17.799> I<00:03:17.859> let<00:03:18.099> it<00:03:18.220> go<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.880> exercise<00:03:19.450> is

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
after I let it go the exercise is

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.589 
after I let it go the exercise is
contract<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.769> glutes<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.730> squeeze<00:03:22.150> your<00:03:22.389> hips

forward and again with two of these

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.580 
forward and again with two of these
bands<00:03:25.000> in<00:03:25.239> here<00:03:25.480> that's<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:25.959> lot<00:03:26.139> of<00:03:26.290> resistance

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
bands in here that's a lot of resistance

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.370 
bands in here that's a lot of resistance
wanting<00:03:27.069> to<00:03:27.160> pull<00:03:27.370> me<00:03:27.519> back<00:03:27.959> down<00:03:28.959> here

have glute amnesia which we talk about

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.949 
have glute amnesia which we talk about
all<00:03:47.889> the<00:03:47.980> time<00:03:48.040> under<00:03:49.000> active<00:03:49.299> gluts<00:03:49.569> lead<00:03:49.810> to

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
all the time under active gluts lead to

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.259 
all the time under active gluts lead to
a<00:03:49.989> whole<00:03:50.290> mess<00:03:50.590> of<00:03:51.090> biomechanical<00:03:52.090> issues

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
a whole mess of biomechanical issues

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.379 
a whole mess of biomechanical issues
between<00:03:53.019> how<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.290> hips<00:03:53.709> function<00:03:54.700> from<00:03:55.209> our

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
between how the hips function from our

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.710 
between how the hips function from our
feet<00:03:55.750> up<00:03:55.959> through<00:03:56.859> our<00:03:57.040> hips<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.730> our<00:03:57.849> arms<00:03:58.239> so

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
today that's what it's all about here

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.680 
today that's what it's all about here
and<00:06:28.280> I<00:06:28.430> think<00:06:28.700> hit<00:06:28.850> the<00:06:28.940> core<00:06:29.210> of<00:06:29.240> it<00:06:29.360> all<00:06:29.450> is

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
and I think hit the core of it all is

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.170 
and I think hit the core of it all is
learning<00:06:30.410> the<00:06:30.650> principles<00:06:30.860> of<00:06:31.400> training<00:06:32.090> like

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
learning the principles of training like

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.180 
learning the principles of training like
an<00:06:32.300> athlete<00:06:32.390> that<00:06:33.080> you<00:06:33.230> can<00:06:33.410> apply<00:06:33.650> to<00:06:34.100> your
