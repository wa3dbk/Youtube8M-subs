00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.400
 the picture quality 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.950
 the picture quality of the sony alpha 99 is 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.690
 Overall, very good until iso 800 is up 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.010
 the pictures themselves greatly enlarged no 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.650
 texture loss or image noise 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.670
 to perceive even the finest details 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.160
 reproduced 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.380
 it sets very high standards is off 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.190
 iso 1600 a hint of picture noise 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.470
 recognizable 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.329
 the picture continues to lie but on 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.489
 a very high level 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.159
 the high resolution and the very good 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.409
 detail playback starts from iso 3.200 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.750
 easy to sink 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.879
 from iso 6,400, the typical 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.420
 Image noise are the detail resolution 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:56.500
 Visible only from iso 12.800 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.500
 compromise 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.610
 even in the dark 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.650
 sony alpha 99 very good from to iso 1600 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.710
 the detail rendering is very high 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.720
 Image noise is barely visible 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.710
 starting at ISO 3,200, the image continues to drop 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.310
 more clearly 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.540
 an iso value of 25,600 should only be left 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.540
 be used for emergencies 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.409
 an interactive comparison of here 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.180
 you can find the picture sections shown here 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.780
 the camera point de 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.340
 was in this way 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.440
 now you have the possibility the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.220
 shown image sections interactively too 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.260
 to compare 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.360
 here you can compare the cameras 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.220
 specify if available an objective 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.130
 choose and the pictures in different 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.380
 compare situations 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.539
 These include the daylight conditions 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.000
 night or lightning the image format jpeg 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.430
 or if available as well as the iso 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.320
 sensitivity 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.210
 in addition to different camera models 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.530
 You can also do a certain 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.500
 model with different 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.270
 compare settings 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.900
 In this example we show the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.900
 Cutouts of a camera at iso 800 iso 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.900
 6400 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.569
 in the second comparison we present the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.569
 Recordings by day and night
