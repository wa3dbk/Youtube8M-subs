00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.170
 so they would see my channel again and 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.549
 this is the last video of the special 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.350
 valentine several people already 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.180
 had told me not to make recipes with 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.949
 oven then let's vary a little bit 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.990
 the recipe that I will share with you today 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.189
 ferrero chocolates are the truth we 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.350
 have to do because they are very very 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.730
 rich and apart they are very very easy to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.769
 make these chocolates can be made 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.240
 with hazelnuts or almonds if I 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.830
 They find Viana can do it with 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.480
 seriously speaking the nicas in because 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.770
 they are very very rich good before 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.210
 I do not want to thank all of you 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.129
 people who take the time to 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.079
 comment on the videos and I like that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.840
 right now they are a very good comments 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.640
 wave and there's pure good vibes and aside that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.110
 take the time to watch the videos and 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.110
 well let's start with the tutorial 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.470
 and these are the ingredients that 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.470
 we need a non-cloth boat 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.590
 a cup of chocolate to melt 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.960
 a quarter cup of chopped hazelnut 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.350
 and half a cup of hazelnuts or those 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.350
 are you going to use 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.090
 we will also use half a cup of 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.490
 waffle molina 3 boats 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.079
 we will previously apply the nutella to 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.490
 that is more solid 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.210
 let's start by taking with a 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.210
 spoon a little 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.310
 then we are going to insert in the middle a 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.310
 hazelnut 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.050
 let's take another spoon so 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.050
 circular let's wrap the hazelnut 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.470
 until it's chocolate it takes a 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.360
 circular shape 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.170
 let's repeat the step with all 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.170
 our little balls 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.740
 then we will refrigerate for 15 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.740
 minutes 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.880
 now it's time for extra retirement 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.620
 chocolate let's put it in the microwave 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.620
 for 30 seconds three times 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.290
 remember not to spend the 30 seconds because 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.060
 if you can not burn 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.329
 this is the consistency that should 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.329
 to have 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.390
 now let's record our whale 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.860
 chopped chocolate 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.860
 let's mix it very well 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.080
 now we are going to put our little balls 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.280
 in the ground wafer and then we're going 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.280
 to give the circular form 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.549
 remember to do it with your hands well 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.549
 clean 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.740
 after they have the circular shape 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.560
 We are going to bathe them in chocolate with 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.630
 hazelnuts 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.830
 and so you have left in the end we're going to 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.830
 refrigerate for 15 minutes 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.060
 Now it's time to build our 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.270
 boxes you can download the design from 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.620
 the information box 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.790
 we are also going to use scissors 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.790
 and glue in bar 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.819
 you're going to start by cutting out all the 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.819
 design in the white part 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.860
 so you'll be left at the end after 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.520
 let's start doing the folds 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.520
 required 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.430
 we will also double the lashes that go 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.430
 to go glued 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.110
 once everything is well folded what 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.110
 you are going to put glue and you are going to seal it 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.890
 and when your box is well attached you are going 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.510
 to make some cuts in this part and in 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.470
 this part of the heart this is so that 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.470
 can join at the end 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.810
 and at the end that's how our little houses are 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.349
 now it's time to put the chocolates 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.349
 order 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.280
