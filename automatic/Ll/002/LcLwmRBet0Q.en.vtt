the<00:03:25.189> color<00:03:25.489> here<00:03:25.849> on<00:03:25.939> the<00:03:26.030> end<00:03:26.209> that<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.569> used<00:03:28.209> in

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
the color here on the end that I used in

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.509 
the color here on the end that I used in
my<00:03:29.269> crease<00:03:29.930> whoop<00:03:30.290> geez<00:03:30.799> don't<00:03:31.069> pay<00:03:31.400> attention

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
my crease whoop geez don't pay attention

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:39.220 
my crease whoop geez don't pay attention
in<00:03:32.060> my<00:03:32.870> crease<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:37.400> my<00:03:38.120> look<00:03:38.659> that<00:03:38.900> I<00:03:38.930> did

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
in my crease and my look that I did

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:58.070 
in my crease and my look that I did
today<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:41.980> then<00:03:42.980> let<00:03:43.939> me<00:03:44.060> get<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.329> last<00:03:44.569> two

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.380 

so<00:03:58.650> these<00:03:58.860> are<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.160> two<00:03:59.400> colors<00:03:59.610> that<00:03:59.940> I<00:04:00.060> used

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
so these are the two colors that I used

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.690 
so these are the two colors that I used
in<00:04:00.780> today's<00:04:00.930> look<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.620> use<00:04:01.800> this<00:04:02.070> one<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.670> that

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
in today's look I use this one and that

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.700 
in today's look I use this one and that
one<00:04:03.390> in<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.810> crease<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:06.080> so<00:04:07.080> those<00:04:07.410> are<00:04:07.680> the

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
one in the crease and so those are the

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.990 
one in the crease and so those are the
swatches<00:04:08.190> of<00:04:08.490> this<00:04:09.030> palette<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:13.610> size<00:04:14.610> of<00:04:14.880> the

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
swatches of this palette the size of the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.900 
swatches of this palette the size of the
eyeshadows<00:04:15.750> look<00:04:16.470> like<00:04:16.680> they're<00:04:16.920> comparable

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
eyeshadows look like they're comparable

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.990 
eyeshadows look like they're comparable
these<00:04:18.269> are<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.540> little<00:04:20.570> wider<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:22.580> The<00:04:23.580> Naked

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
these are a little wider and The Naked

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.450 
these are a little wider and The Naked
palette<00:04:24.210> they<00:04:25.080> are<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.440> little<00:04:26.690> narrower<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:28.460> I

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
palette they are a little narrower and I

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.630 
palette they are a little narrower and I
haven't<00:04:30.060> researched<00:04:30.530> how<00:04:31.530> much<00:04:31.740> actually<00:04:32.430> is

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
haven't researched how much actually is

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:42.620 
haven't researched how much actually is
in<00:04:33.150> each<00:04:35.360> little<00:04:36.360> individual<00:04:37.050> pan<00:04:41.630> especially

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
in each little individual pan especially

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.260 
in each little individual pan especially
if<00:04:43.170> you're<00:04:43.470> considering<00:04:44.130> getting<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.880> one

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
if you're considering getting the one

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.780 
if you're considering getting the one
from<00:04:45.480> forever<00:04:45.780> 21<00:04:46.050> at<00:04:46.620> six<00:04:46.860> dollars<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.460> fifty

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
from forever 21 at six dollars and fifty

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.670 
from forever 21 at six dollars and fifty
cents<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.450> so<00:04:48.630> it's<00:04:48.840> not<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:49.020> huge<00:04:49.290> investment

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
cents and so it's not a huge investment

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.060 
cents and so it's not a huge investment
and<00:04:50.420> like<00:04:51.420> I<00:04:51.570> say<00:04:51.810> I'm<00:04:52.050> very<00:04:52.080> impressed<00:04:52.470> with

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
and like I say I'm very impressed with

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.940 
and like I say I'm very impressed with

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:05.620 
them let's see I have one to two three

half-baked a lot of the colors in the
Naked<00:05:10.290> palette<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:11.100> original<00:05:11.580> one<00:05:11.760> tend<00:05:12.570> to

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
Naked palette the original one tend to

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.790 
Naked palette the original one tend to
be<00:05:12.840> a<00:05:12.870> little<00:05:13.230> warm<00:05:13.710> for<00:05:13.830> me<00:05:14.900> so<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:16.260> lot<00:05:16.500> of<00:05:16.530> them

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.070 
be a little warm for me so a lot of them
I<00:05:16.860> usually<00:05:17.640> don't<00:05:17.790> use<00:05:20.150> so<00:05:21.150> I<00:05:21.180> had<00:05:21.540> considered

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
I usually don't use so I had considered

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.010 
I usually don't use so I had considered
purchasing<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:24.330> naked<00:05:24.960> too<00:05:25.580> but<00:05:27.020> sanika

purchasing the naked too but sanika

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.520 
purchasing the naked too but sanika
tyrion<00:05:28.470> how<00:05:28.830> so<00:05:29.820> many<00:05:29.970> of<00:05:30.120> those<00:05:30.450> were<00:05:31.230> very

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
tyrion how so many of those were very

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.900 
tyrion how so many of those were very
light<00:05:32.040> and<00:05:32.520> it<00:05:32.970> I<00:05:33.120> like<00:05:33.540> a<00:05:33.840> nice<00:05:34.800> palette<00:05:35.730> with

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
light and it I like a nice palette with

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.750 
light and it I like a nice palette with
dark<00:05:36.210> colors<00:05:36.600> for<00:05:36.960> my<00:05:37.530> smokey<00:05:38.070> eyes<00:05:39.110> so<00:05:40.760> naked

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
dark colors for my smokey eyes so naked

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.290 
dark colors for my smokey eyes so naked
though<00:05:41.970> is<00:05:42.210> a<00:05:42.510> really<00:05:43.140> nice<00:05:43.370> crease<00:05:44.370> color<00:05:44.729> if

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
though is a really nice crease color if

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.960 
though is a really nice crease color if
you're<00:05:45.990> doing<00:05:46.320> a<00:05:46.470> smoky<00:05:46.950> eye<00:05:46.979> and<00:05:47.400> you<00:05:47.490> want<00:05:47.700> to

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
you're doing a smoky eye and you want to

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.290 
you're doing a smoky eye and you want to
soften<00:05:48.750> out<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:49.260> crease<00:05:49.560> a<00:05:49.590> little<00:05:49.800> bit<00:05:50.300> so

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
soften out the crease a little bit so

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.690 
soften out the crease a little bit so
here's<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.870> difference<00:05:52.110> between<00:05:52.890> the<00:05:53.100> two<00:05:53.370> so

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
here's the difference between the two so

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.460 
here's the difference between the two so
this<00:05:53.880> is<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.300> Naked<00:05:55.260> palette<00:05:55.520> here<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:57.470> here

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
this is the Naked palette here and here

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.150 
this is the Naked palette here and here
is<00:05:58.680> the<00:05:59.070> forever<00:05:59.580> 21<00:05:59.880> and<00:06:00.600> you<00:06:01.290> can<00:06:01.530> see<00:06:01.860> that

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
is the forever 21 and you can see that

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.360 
is the forever 21 and you can see that
the<00:06:02.490> naked<00:06:02.970> is<00:06:03.210> much<00:06:03.510> warmer<00:06:04.040> most<00:06:05.040> of<00:06:05.250> the

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
the naked is much warmer most of the

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.390 
the naked is much warmer most of the
colors<00:06:05.580> are<00:06:06.120> as<00:06:07.250> opposed<00:06:08.250> to<00:06:08.700> the<00:06:09.000> forever<00:06:09.539> 21

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
colors are as opposed to the forever 21

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.119 
colors are as opposed to the forever 21
where<00:06:11.400> the<00:06:11.610> color

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
where the color

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:15.809 
where the color
are<00:06:12.279> much<00:06:12.759> cooler<00:06:13.199> so<00:06:14.199> for<00:06:14.770> me<00:06:14.919> I<00:06:14.949> find<00:06:15.459> that

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:15.819 
are much cooler so for me I find that

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:20.189 
are much cooler so for me I find that
the<00:06:16.619> the<00:06:17.619> forever<00:06:17.919> 21<00:06:18.159> palette<00:06:19.029> is<00:06:19.270> more

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
the the forever 21 palette is more

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:23.369 
the the forever 21 palette is more
wearable<00:06:20.529> just<00:06:21.219> because<00:06:21.519> of<00:06:21.669> my<00:06:21.789> coloring<00:06:22.389> and

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:23.379 
wearable just because of my coloring and

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:27.589 
wearable just because of my coloring and
I<00:06:24.189> would<00:06:24.699> say<00:06:25.080> you<00:06:26.080> know<00:06:26.199> the<00:06:26.439> shadows<00:06:27.039> aren't

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 
I would say you know the shadows aren't

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.850 
I would say you know the shadows aren't
equal<00:06:28.599> in<00:06:28.779> quality<00:06:29.309> obviously<00:06:30.309> but<00:06:31.179> I<00:06:31.860> have

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
equal in quality obviously but I have

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.979 
equal in quality obviously but I have
enjoyed<00:06:33.039> them<00:06:33.550> I<00:06:33.819> have<00:06:33.999> found<00:06:34.239> them<00:06:34.509> very<00:06:34.539> easy

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:34.989 
enjoyed them I have found them very easy

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:38.519 
enjoyed them I have found them very easy
to<00:06:35.259> work<00:06:35.409> with<00:06:35.469> and<00:06:36.029> I<00:06:37.029> get<00:06:37.689> fallout<00:06:38.110> from<00:06:38.289> both

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:38.529 
to work with and I get fallout from both

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:41.429
