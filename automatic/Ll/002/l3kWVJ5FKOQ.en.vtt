size can be a little bit tricky but

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.109 
size can be a little bit tricky but

these<00:02:08.910> days<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.239> think<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.020> HD<00:02:10.520> 720p<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.670> a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
these days I think that HD 720p is a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.050 
these days I think that HD 720p is a
pretty<00:02:12.030> safe<00:02:12.270> bet

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
pretty safe bet

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.660 
pretty safe bet

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
the moment which means that anyone with

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.740 
the moment which means that anyone with
the<00:02:18.830> link<00:02:19.040> would<00:02:19.490> be<00:02:19.670> able<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.000> see<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.540> but

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
the link would be able to see it but

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.050 
the link would be able to see it but
that<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.560> wouldn't<00:02:21.830> show<00:02:22.010> up<00:02:22.040> in<00:02:22.370> any<00:02:22.520> YouTube

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
that it wouldn't show up in any YouTube

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.040 
that it wouldn't show up in any YouTube
or<00:02:23.330> web<00:02:23.750> searches<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:26.300> once<00:02:26.510> I've<00:02:26.660> got<00:02:26.840> this

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
and the process begins it may take a

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.760 
and the process begins it may take a
while<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.360> export<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.080> then<00:02:33.260> upload<00:02:33.740> the

movie so I want to make sure that I
don't<00:02:35.720> start<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.410> process<00:02:36.620> until<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.220> know<00:02:37.340> I

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
don't start the process until I know I

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.300 
don't start the process until I know I
have<00:02:37.880> time<00:02:38.209> enough<00:02:39.110> power<00:02:39.410> on<00:02:39.620> my<00:02:39.739> battery<00:02:40.130> and
