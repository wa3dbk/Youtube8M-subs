this you want to get people in the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.039 
this you want to get people in the
center<00:01:24.549> obviously<00:01:24.969> but<00:01:25.119> its<00:01:25.240> cover<00:01:25.450> is<00:01:25.659> a<00:01:25.689> nice

center obviously but its cover is a nice
range<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.640> then<00:01:27.789> I<00:01:27.880> use<00:01:28.060> electrocute<00:01:29.020> that<00:01:29.229> I

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
range and then I use electrocute that I

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.580 
range and then I use electrocute that I
electrocute<00:01:30.990> electrocute<00:01:31.990> is<00:01:32.079> good<00:01:32.259> you<00:01:32.469> can

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
electrocute electrocute is good you can

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.859 
electrocute electrocute is good you can
also<00:01:32.710> use<00:01:33.039> mortars<00:01:33.579> strike<00:01:33.880> it's<00:01:34.090> not<00:01:34.270> bad

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
also use mortars strike it's not bad

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.010 
also use mortars strike it's not bad
mortar<00:01:35.380> strikes<00:01:35.649> harder<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.070> pull<00:01:36.250> off<00:01:36.399> in<00:01:36.430> PvP

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
mortar strikes harder to pull off in PvP

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.880 
mortar strikes harder to pull off in PvP
simply<00:01:38.020> because<00:01:38.229> you<00:01:38.350> need<00:01:38.530> people<00:01:38.770> in<00:01:38.799> the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
simply because you need people in the

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.289 
simply because you need people in the
center<00:01:39.219> of<00:01:39.280> it<00:01:39.399> but<00:01:39.549> it<00:01:39.640> does<00:01:39.789> more<00:01:39.969> burst

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
center of it but it does more burst

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.730 
center of it but it does more burst
damage<00:01:40.600> if<00:01:40.990> you're<00:01:41.140> into<00:01:41.409> that<00:01:41.530> kind<00:01:41.590> of<00:01:41.829> PvP

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
damage if you're into that kind of PvP

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.740 
damage if you're into that kind of PvP
next<00:01:44.740> we<00:01:44.859> have<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.009> stun<00:01:45.399> which<00:01:46.329> is<00:01:46.479> an<00:01:46.600> obvious

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
next we have a stun which is an obvious

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.679 
next we have a stun which is an obvious
obviously<00:01:47.530> must<00:01:47.829> have<00:01:47.950> stun<00:01:48.759> data<00:01:49.030> sense<00:01:49.509> five

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
obviously must have stun data sense five

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.749 
obviously must have stun data sense five
people<00:01:50.109> are<00:01:50.770> up<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:50.979> five<00:01:51.159> people<00:01:51.369> I<00:01:51.520> guess<00:01:51.640> if
