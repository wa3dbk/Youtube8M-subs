00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

the<00:00:00.900> next<00:00:01.110> letter<00:00:01.319> we're<00:00:01.620> going<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.829> look<00:00:01.890> at

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
the next letter we're going to look at

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.769 
the next letter we're going to look at
in<00:00:02.370> our<00:00:02.580> capital<00:00:02.909> series<00:00:03.570> is<00:00:04.100> the<00:00:05.100> letter<00:00:05.779> K

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
in our capital series is the letter K

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.060 
in our capital series is the letter K
now<00:00:07.109> this<00:00:07.379> letter<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.890> quite<00:00:08.220> simple<00:00:09.030> in<00:00:09.269> its

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
now this letter is quite simple in its

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.810 
now this letter is quite simple in its
student<00:00:11.509> forum<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.780> composed<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.450> one<00:00:15.450> and

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
student forum is composed of a one and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.230 
student forum is composed of a one and
then<00:00:18.020> it's<00:00:19.020> composed<00:00:19.500> either<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.460> very

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
then it's composed either of a very

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.589 
then it's composed either of a very
straightforward<00:00:24.949> loop<00:00:25.949> like<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.599> that's

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
straightforward loop like that that's

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.529 
straightforward loop like that that's
sort<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.320> imagine<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.740> capital<00:00:29.279> R

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
sort of if you imagine the capital R

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.930 
sort of if you imagine the capital R
there's<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.630> capital<00:00:31.080> R<00:00:31.669> just<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
there's a capital R just like the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.660 
there's a capital R just like the
capital<00:00:33.300> R<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.840> part<00:00:34.170> missing<00:00:34.670> so

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
capital R with this part missing so

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.340 
capital R with this part missing so
let's<00:00:36.450> try<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.780> again<00:00:37.160> there's<00:00:38.160> our<00:00:38.340> one

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
let's try this again there's our one

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.110 
let's try this again there's our one
then<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.530> come<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.040> we<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:41.940> make<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
then we can come in and we can make a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.240 
then we can come in and we can make a
loop<00:00:42.390> here<00:00:44.120> like<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.629> our<00:00:45.890> get<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> que

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
loop here like so this is our get a que

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.590 
loop here like so this is our get a que
using<00:00:48.090> two<00:00:48.329> strokes<00:00:50.210> it<00:00:51.210> could<00:00:51.360> also<00:00:51.480> be

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
using two strokes it could also be

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.450 
using two strokes it could also be
formed<00:00:52.020> with<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.199> loop<00:00:52.440> at<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.860> front<00:00:53.100> like

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
formed with a loop at the front like

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.729 
formed with a loop at the front like
that<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.829> then<00:00:59.449> AK<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.320> want<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.649> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
that and then AK and if you want to you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.399 
that and then AK and if you want to you
can<00:01:01.859> add<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.039> little<00:01:02.250> loop<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.149> well

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
can add a little loop here as well

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.420 
can add a little loop here as well
that's<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.979> other<00:01:08.100> way<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.400> doing

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
that's up to you the other way of doing

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.320 
that's up to you the other way of doing
this<00:01:08.640> letter<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.650> as<00:01:11.119> one<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
this letter is to do it as one a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.530 
this letter is to do it as one a
one-stroke<00:01:12.990> letter<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:14.180> it's<00:01:15.180> done<00:01:15.390> as

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
one-stroke letter and it's done as

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.649 
one-stroke letter and it's done as
follows<00:01:15.900> start<00:01:16.860> here<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:18.150> come<00:01:18.390> down

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
follows start here you come down

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.340 
follows start here you come down
straight<00:01:19.790> just<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.090> would<00:01:21.299> then<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.110> come

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
straight just as you would then you come

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.899 
straight just as you would then you come
up<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.920> an<00:01:23.130> angle<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.990> come<00:01:25.229> back<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.909> touch

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
up on an angle you come back in touch

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.140 
up on an angle you come back in touch
the<00:01:27.180> letter<00:01:27.799> and<00:01:29.240> away<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.509> that's<00:01:31.170> our<00:01:32.150> k

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
the letter and away and that's our k

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.899 
the letter and away and that's our k
it's<00:01:33.810> got<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.290> similarity<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.250> H<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.759> saw

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
it's got a similarity to the H we saw

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.170 
it's got a similarity to the H we saw
before<00:01:36.060> here's<00:01:36.509> our<00:01:36.659> H<00:01:37.700> which<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.850> made<00:01:39.000> for

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
before here's our H which is made for

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.630 
before here's our H which is made for
one<00:01:39.299> stroke<00:01:40.549> so<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.880> got<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:43.079> same<00:01:43.579> kind<00:01:44.579> of

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
one stroke so it's got the same kind of

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.609 
one stroke so it's got the same kind of
thing<00:01:44.820> going<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.149> except<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:46.350> when<00:01:46.530> you

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
thing going on except that when you

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.210 
thing going on except that when you
reach<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.950> point<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.430> letter<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.509> come<00:01:48.810> in

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
reach this point a letter you come in

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.580 
reach this point a letter you come in
turn<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.700> away<00:01:52.040> here's<00:01:53.040> our<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.700> our<00:01:53.850> lines

let's do this in the lines so you can

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.920 
let's do this in the lines so you can
see<00:01:58.649> what's<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:58.920> on
