00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.759

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.800
 person who is called enrique kings good

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.660
 pretty good the price of 899 but here 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.550
 I'm going to tell you more or less what 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.809
 include I'm telling you in case 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.280
 you like to buy I 'm not going to 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.930
 leave we are here in the description it 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.879
 It made me quite cheap because I wanted to 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.120
 buy but they sold me several things 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.760
 used and as 600 pesos nothing else were 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.470
 like two and it went too expensive then 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.400
 I started looking and against this and it 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:00.519
 he did quite good is a counterpart arm 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.900
 to make a float for the pool a 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.390
 bra to put it in vision 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.979
 motorcycle in a construction bra 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.900
 for cars they are taken outside 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.490
 if you would like any shot is 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.049
 so I'm going to give you an example 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.640
 also example in the comments if not 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.450
 is that you 're already leaving one here 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.009
 in a wristband to control a 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.189
 pivot rotation is simply a 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.750
 arm to score the 157 degrees one 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.189
 chest to be able to do activities and 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.869
 formentera in the chest I out there 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.560
 I will try to do some activity like 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.400
 karate with with this with that kind of 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.340
 accessory and good because it brings 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.250
 also the arm or the end to be able 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.230
 make shots from far away very well the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.200
 first accessory is 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.120
 it's like a spider-shaped tripod this 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.260
 the purchase part is seen in the kit but 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.970
 It made me quite interesting too 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.000
 so then for example to do 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.620
 you take in a bucket in a tree or what 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.960
 we can hook it and we can 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.740
 do it and put with an accessory that is 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.660
 this with this accessory and this one 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.490
 just placed here for 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.160
 can take it to the lake but it is removed 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.350
 this part of here that's one of the most 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.390
 interesting about those that for me more 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.910
 they are going to serve to make shots that is a 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.380
 common suction coupon and I'm going to 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.990
 use for when I'm in the 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.640
 car or there before you can use it and 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.640
 I hope you serve me well enough 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.100
 very good is this 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.410
 and well we could here adjust no 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.110
 we could loosen it to get up 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.400
 the movement and then several little things 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.590
 good another accessory is the already famous 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.110
 good as not to be the end too 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.690
 It comes with another accessory that is igualito 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.670
 to ald the tripod and it would be put here 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.380
 because nothing else is stretched is like 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.070
 make movement be take from afar 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.750
 of ajeros the end of several things comes 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.910
 with this arm where we can put the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.830
 camera on this side and we can do well 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.270
 goes the movement of modes the movement 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.950
 for here and then apart we can that 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.780
 movement for here we can see it as 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.000
 an extensible or simply to 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.350
 place it in the in the car or any 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.200
 where we want to record 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.750
 it also comes with what I think this one 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.300
 2 is 180 degrees which is not style 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.190
 of the motorcycle and although save the 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.990
 feet that are going to lose this is 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.620
 for the motorcycle for the bike where 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.150
 we are simply going to place it for 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.370
 place the camera where where 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.170
 corresponds in this case here and 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.610
 we would put the bike to make the shots 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.310
 when we are falling when we go the 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.010
 true 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.739
 I do not have bikes but only the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.630
 mystic also sent me two pouches 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.280
 to store the accessories so that they do not 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.739
 they lost me because I am very given to 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.739
 other things that are lost here 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.599
 we have is like floats there is not only 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.280
 many pools but I think that 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.630
 must serve them in some way 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.760
 first because you just have to 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.319
 place it and then nothing starts to 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.510
 float and start recording over water 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.849
 I do not usually go to the pools much 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.890
 ways but but hey you never know 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.640
 truth and the most interesting things 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.019
 of the belt for control and then 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.060
 simply what I was most interested in 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.950
 was that but here comes also this is 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.060
 for the helmet I think to wear it to the 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.000
 head 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.319
 I will try to make some shots 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.640
 following for the head will be successful 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.660
 it's like underneath it can also be like 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.829
 You still can not use it as a diaper 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.840
 interesting 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.470
 as a diaper 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.150
 and good is the bib that is also what 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.320
 what interests me most to be able to get 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.389
 logos and then on the date and do 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.100
 some activity all accessories 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.080
 Well, if not, I'm leaving him

 some views of how to listen to each 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.419
 one then finally down here in the 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.560
