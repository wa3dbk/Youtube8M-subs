00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.670
 now again the work of adaptive 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.179
 full cruise control 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.060
 stop in this case is possible 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.510
 we will not stop completely 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:17.650
 and so turn it on the steering wheel appear 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.650
 the value we need 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:26.220
 set the speed a little higher 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.220
 here and remove the leg crushing 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.070
 here it is all removed 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.580
 so the machine is fully controlled with 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.580
 control 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.830
 as you can see speed at the same time and on a cruise 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.110
 control is somewhat higher than the current 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.540
 car speed is due to the fact that 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.290
 there is an obstacle ahead as soon as typed 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.830
 the speed will be the same as it should be 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.830
 70 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.930
 the distance is approximately the given 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.160
 which we put is regulated it 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.160
 buttons here on the steering wheel 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.720
 me ahead of red and now we will see 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.720
 how will he stop 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.310
 car slows down 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.550
 this is done cruise control and 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.700
 speeds below 30 km per hour where it 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.390
 activated showing that this 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.390
 speed already with
