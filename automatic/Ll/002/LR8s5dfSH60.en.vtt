demolition as you know at way you spawn

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.969 
demolition as you know at way you spawn
so<00:01:22.939> let's<00:01:23.119> say<00:01:23.270> told<00:01:23.600> there's<00:01:23.960> 61<00:01:24.439> points<00:01:24.680> and

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
so let's say told there's 61 points and

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.719 
so let's say told there's 61 points and
one<00:01:25.700> on<00:01:25.820> yours<00:01:26.000> one<00:01:26.479> spoon<00:01:27.350> what<00:01:28.039> one<00:01:28.310> set<00:01:28.640> of

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
one on yours one spoon what one set of

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.120 
one on yours one spoon what one set of
spawn<00:01:29.060> points<00:01:29.479> on<00:01:29.600> your<00:01:29.869> side<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:30.380> another

set<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.609> spawn<00:01:31.850> points<00:01:32.240> on<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:33.229> opponent's

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
set of spawn points on the opponent's

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.779 
set of spawn points on the opponent's
side<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.189> three<00:01:35.060> three<00:01:35.420> on<00:01:35.450> each<00:01:35.659> side<00:01:35.689> and

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
side and three three on each side and

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.090 
side and three three on each side and
basically<00:01:37.789> you<00:01:38.719> know<00:01:38.869> this<00:01:39.530> is<00:01:39.560> one<00:01:39.829> of<00:01:39.859> them

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
basically you know this is one of them

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.899 
basically you know this is one of them
and<00:01:40.280> I<00:01:41.240> will<00:01:42.109> strongly<00:01:42.350> suggest<00:01:42.859> you<00:01:42.979> try<00:01:43.850> to

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
and I will strongly suggest you try to

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:44.950 
and I will strongly suggest you try to
start<00:01:44.179> I<00:01:44.359> don't<00:01:44.509> know<00:01:44.570> if<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:44.719> could<00:01:44.840> do<00:01:44.929> it

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
start I don't know if you could do it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.810 
start I don't know if you could do it
other<00:01:45.170> side<00:01:45.500> but<00:01:46.039> depends<00:01:46.520> but<00:01:46.579> I<00:01:46.640> think

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
other side but depends but I think

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.459 
other side but depends but I think
that's<00:01:46.969> the<00:01:47.030> best<00:01:47.210> place<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.929> hide<00:01:48.140> because

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
that's the best place to hide because

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.410 
that's the best place to hide because
they'll<00:01:49.310> have<00:01:49.490> no<00:01:49.640> clue<00:01:49.820> unless<00:01:50.030> they<00:01:50.179> look<00:01:50.329> at

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
they'll have no clue unless they look at

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.539 
they'll have no clue unless they look at
a<00:01:50.450> killcam<00:01:50.929> but<00:01:51.200> no<00:01:51.710> dough<00:01:51.950> they<00:01:52.340> probably

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
a killcam but no dough they probably

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.029 
a killcam but no dough they probably
back<00:01:52.820> home<00:01:52.850> for<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.359> but<00:01:53.630> usually<00:01:54.439> demolition

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
back home for you but usually demolition

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.279 
back home for you but usually demolition
people<00:01:55.189> usual<00:01:55.640> it's<00:01:55.909> all<00:01:56.030> action<00:01:56.479> packed<00:01:57.079> and

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
people usual it's all action packed and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.499 
people usual it's all action packed and
people<00:01:57.530> don't<00:01:57.679> really<00:01:58.219> look<00:01:58.700> at<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:58.909> killcam<00:01:59.359> as

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
people don't really look at a killcam as

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:00.669 
people don't really look at a killcam as

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.910 
this is your choice I'm just sharing
this<00:03:05.630> out<00:03:05.810> I'm<00:03:06.050> pretty<00:03:06.350> sure<00:03:06.500> than<00:03:06.740> other

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
this out I'm pretty sure than other

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.830 
this out I'm pretty sure than other
other<00:03:07.640> ways<00:03:07.850> but<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.150> think<00:03:08.360> that's<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.600> best

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
other ways but I think that's the best

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.320 
other ways but I think that's the best
way<00:03:09.020> to<00:03:09.170> do<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.500> safely<00:03:09.740> without<00:03:10.580> any<00:03:10.820> problems

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
way to do it safely without any problems

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.370 
way to do it safely without any problems
now<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:12.460> do<00:03:13.460> not<00:03:13.580> want<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:13.880> advertise<00:03:14.380> camping
