00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.980
 all right 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.330
 we are sitting in one of the best 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.730
 four-seater market and 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.410
 over it has just been renovated with new 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.750
 headlights and pilots new designs 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.120
 interiors and new materials in addition to 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.129
 improvements in the engines 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.559
 on the outside the front is 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.210
 completely redesigned and resembles the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.879
 new family air from the rest of 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.219
 models highlight the new groups 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.800
 rear optics whose diode lights 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.329
 luminous and fiber optic reproduce the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.020
 stylistic elements of the headlights 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.180
 front 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.010
 Inside, it is worth highlighting the 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.500
 instruments with spheres on white background 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.560
 and the trapezoidal screen with technology 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.240
 full color tc an analog clock 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.850
 between the new central diffusers of 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.100
 ventilation puts the finishing touch 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.170
 if after seeing this we still doubt if 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.119
 we are facing the 2013 version or the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.400
 earlier there is a detail that we 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.799
 will quickly unlock the lever 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.900
 changes is now located in the column 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.090
 of the address 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.730
 a highlight of the new change of 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.470
 the class is the soundproof hood with 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.620
 high quality acoustic insulation 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.510
 and formed by three layers the hood is 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.100
 suitable without restrictions for tunnels 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.470
 washed and can be opened and closed 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.300
 during the march up to a speed of 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.370
 40 kilometers per hour 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.980
 we can order it in dark brown black 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.200
 navy blue and red without additional cost 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.260
 to better combine the paint of the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.180
 body and leather seats 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.100
 to enjoy greater comfort at 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.380
 driving to the open is offered as 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.530
 option the innovative system ay caps x 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.640
 980 euros this serves to reduce both 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.750
 the air turbulence in the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.040
 interior as aerodynamic noise 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.080
 the rear headrests and the 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.820
 windshield located between them alone 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.950
 they work if there are passengers sitting in 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.690
 the rear seats is a good idea 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.930
 ask us especially if we think that 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.030
 we are going to travel often four occupants 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.010
 we are testing the 250 cdi version that 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.050
 It has four cylinders and 204 horses 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.970
 they have greatly improved the engine to 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.290
 get very low consumptions but 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.930
 still does not meet the standard 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.180
 Euro 6 anti-pollution on the other hand 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.890
 If they do not tell us it's 4 cylinders or 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.690
 we believe it for its softness and 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.610
 elasticity you will agree with 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.370
 us in that the power never left over 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.070
 but we can opt for the 220 cdi version 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.350
 which has 170 horses which is a 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:48.240
 enough power and save us five 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.240
 thousand euros that we can spend on options 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.840
 and is that Mercedes proposes a 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.790
 very high standard equipment but 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.320
 then there are technical solutions that 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.750
 prevent access to equipment 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.420
 optional economically 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.030
 reasonable for example to ask for the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.190
 heated steering wheel that costs 360 euros 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.320
 we are obliged to ask for the 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.720
 electric seats and the regulation of 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.270
 electric steering wheel because this one carries the 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.270
 Cable installed heating and 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.640
 also costs 1,800 euros and if we want 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.360
 The irish card forces us to ask for the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.360
 auto switch 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.610
 so good we can always 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.310
 buy us leather gloves and a 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.230
 scarf despite everything we have to say that a 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.220
 the car controls the feeling of 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.180
 comfort quality and softness is very high 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.310
 It's worth that we like to go 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.920
 descapotados and that's why we almost went through 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.750
 any situation but not today one day 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.640
 sunny about ten or twelve degrees 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.770
 temperature and with the heating in the 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.990
 seats the air is kart that expels 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.700
 hot air in the neck and the 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.440
 heating temperature a little 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.690
 high we can make a trip 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.400
 quietly and very comfortable 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.770
 we have to say that at the controls of 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.190
 car the feeling of comfort softness and 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.750
 quality are very high as we said the 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.630
 engine is a prodigy of push 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.690
 elasticity and low consumption 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.840
 accelerates from 0 to 100 in 77 seconds and 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.910
 allows a maximum speed of almost 250 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.799
 kilometers per hour and average consumption 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.629
 approved from only 48 liters to 100 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.389
 and that is that we can choose options 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:26.099
 gasoline of more than 400 horses but if 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.500
 we think we enjoy the change many 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:31.390
 kilometers a year better a diesel 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.640
 they have good behavior has the 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.330
 Curve car for nothing is just a 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.330
 car ride 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.580
 the rear seats is not that they are 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.020
 spectacularly large and a detail 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.990
 that we do not want to let go is the 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.540
 trunk has a capacity of 390 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.910
 liters with the hood on and 300 with 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.960
 she removed is not bad for a trip 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.960
 short of four people 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.030
 we just need to turn it off so that 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.000
 enjoy the open sky with this car 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.450
 be a children's game for adults with 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.450
