00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 look for a site that sells credits for 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.970
 all consoles that are fast secure 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.890
 Economic with fifa coins is what 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.160
 discretion stops for you 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.750
 additional 5 percent discount to guys 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.839
 are flowing welcome back to a new one 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.010
 video as you know I really like it 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.380
 lots of calcium murray above all 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.060
 in the series as you can also see 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.800
 my location is obviously 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.380
 juventino and I say it for those who still me 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.099
 knows and what there will ever be a 21 with a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.260
 video of the milan 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.170
 well i have to say i'm a romantic of 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.300
 soccer and I'm sorry to see inter milano 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.399
 also many other teams like it 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.450
 same parma that is failing in this 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.340
 difficult situation 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.350
 so i thought how can i join the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.840
 soccer fifa I wanted to create this 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.100
 heading because I like to talk too 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.440
 of other teams that are not 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.750
 movements and try to understand how 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.219
 should play with which men with 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.289
 which schemes with which indications 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.050
 tactics decided to start mine 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.160
 because his story can't afford 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.140
 such a mess 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.809
 I've already written something on my blog 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.390
 inherent in nuraghi and I'm not repeating myself 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.650
 but they have me a moment to see how 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.820
 should play milan with men 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.060
 which has available 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.210
 I decided to opt for this 4 2 3 1 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.729
 because I think they are the right men 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.070
 in the right place for this milan 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.780
 the thing that most catches my eye in the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.729
 milan of 2014 thousand and therefore there is the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.070
 shortage of two midfielders bodies 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.690
 obviously less bad is de jong 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.670
 I say this because Montolivo is good 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.950
 I do not consider it a pure median 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.479
 the race has quality is a player 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.260
 really very strong that I like 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.760
 so much 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.500
 the second one is much better 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.200
 wide on the left the rearguard 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.150
 4 course diego lopez does not matter 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.340
 you can do without my headstock 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.229
 perhaps the couple of central holders of the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.270
 milan maybe those two are a little more 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.160
 strong just arrived alex i was 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.380
 convinced he could take the place from 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.300
 owner but seeing the course of the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.040
 maybe mexes season is above him 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.240
 then alex and place it in the stands e 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.800
 mexes on the bench 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.990
 poles also end up on the bench 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.440
 the only one of the midfielders probably 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.690
 stronger than any other type being 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.410
 mount the van ginkel but below the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.390
 also montolivo 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.979
 moreover, poles are not what they can do 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.259
 just the median fails to do the 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.670
 double phase already montolivo makes effort el 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.890
 shaarawy is another player 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.690
 I thought it might be his year but 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.700
 has shown that this is not so and de 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.560
 another great example of honda 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.630
 he had a good start but if he lost crazy 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.700
 poor fellow first saw himself leapfrog from 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.590
 mena last 9 then by right and does not play 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.840
 never these however are players who 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.330
 they cannot be part of Milan 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.760
 no antonelli abate are two beautiful fullbacks 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.560
 even if you probably ignored abbot and 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.880
 mattia de sciglio could be given the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.090
 change now I'm doing one 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.579
 training without assessing accidents or 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.140
 contractual situations related as already 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.970
 said bonaventura you should play wide 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.350
 on the left and on the right we look for each other 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.780
 two players with their feet inverted 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.030
 despite not often going to the shooting 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.650
 or at least bonaventura of the two in the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.329
 ideas should be looked for what 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.670
 but more the shot though many times 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.410
 it is not so often you look for it does not play 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.500
 right right menez are the couple 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.180
 strikers in this 4 while 14 42 a 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.130
 strange thing is a module too 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.840
 chameleon because as I see it myself 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.910
 it could spread tenant 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.540
 left to play slightly behind 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.640
 right mattia 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.989
 cerci could go on to do the third 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.270
 attached together with these two e 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.710
 bonaventura is that glue then come back 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.510
 so much so that they make you double phase both 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.430
 offensive phase and then being able to come to 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.810
 playing in midfield could take 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.400
 the place of antonelli as a fullback 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.200
 left if the latter should rise 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.950
 too here is really good luck 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.600
 tactical key 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.370
 I think it should focus on 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.380
 zain but let's go immediately to make a 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.300
 game to see how this works 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.310
 milan, in fact, the key man 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.230
 we had said should be good luck 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.420
 and here he is immediately presenting himself with a 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.760
 no in the heating we found the 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.560
 sampdoria of ferrero against a team 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.510
 that this year his is playing 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.980
 cards is a game that should not have 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.680
 prove nothing to anyone and now it is 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.650
 there, fighting for Europe that counts 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.810
 oh god the shot behind world palo 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.910
 attention eto'o to the edge of the area the 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.110
 shooting diego lopez the nimble abbot parade 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.390
 watch what he is doing 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.670
 abate what wrong diego lopez there 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.200
 save served muriel pointing to his 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.720
 opponent jumps antonelli is gone 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.130
 inside and you branch branches the shot from 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.080
 out said diego lopez won the 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.700
 Milanese counter-attack menez seeks to 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.620
 get on the ball succeeds 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.480
 contrast de silvestri and then heel 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.230
 serves montolivo and has proposed some 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.790
 they have inside 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.920
 Milan and I midfielder absent 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.440
 I love the cap to look for and menez menez 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.390
 call montolivo for the restart action 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.100
 fast sampdoria now with i 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.810
 to abate is able to intercept the ball 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.270
 and clean with a big game of heel 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.580
 unmarked dogfish can advance him 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.530
 palombo drew out of europe you can 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.060
 starting the counterattack pulls from his home 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.470
 with once however diego lopez this 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.130
 once the challenges of surprise the mind 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.840
 in the corner kick 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.250
 here ends the first time 0 to 0 between 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.220
 milan and sampdoria no but we will have time 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.780
 fought the Milan suffered a lot 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.460
 in this first half but the second 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.860
 it should be another story 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.310
 to hell seven seas later holding the 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.490
 muriel eto'o tradition ball throws epo 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.669
 and finally manages to pierce diego lopez 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.500
 after many shots in the first half 1 0 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.810
 for the sampdoria this milan is 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.310
 asleep also intimate 15 well sure 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.500
 maybe it's a bit it's my fault 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.000
 inside for right of first right has 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.860
 took the defender time also came out 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.240
 the right goalkeeper with an empty goal 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.580
 right the crossbar 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.440
 menez can't close it inside 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.150
 abbot for right right in area of 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.370
 right penalty the shot from the right viviano 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.140
 we also right and this time after the 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.900
 Cross managed Right mattia 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.060
 assigned 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.580
 the equal 1 1 goal between santoro and milan 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.740
 julianne moore and muriel's shooting but 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.440
 full of diego lópez attention ball 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.930
 important recovered right to found 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.259
 Milan's counter-attack can take a 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.520
 moment to the other right serves menez 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.560
 players able to turn on the light 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.690
 Menez inside for right behind 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.430
 mesbah right with the physical succeeds in 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.820
 keep the ball and it will also serve cerci 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.870
 cerci can point sees finds de jong al 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.710
 area limit 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.690
 there is no one who can serve 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.820
 of the empire then try to enlarge the 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.740
 play on the bonaventura go antonelli 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.930
 is on the bottom again and league can cross 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.610
 his left foot is not there 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.070
 arrives montolivo palombo from 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.590
 flag for muriel muriel 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.570
 backwards for attention 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.720
 Tabby Tabby attention in the area 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.850
 Tabby shot of the goal to 83rd as 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.680
 if it was the real milan but to get them 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.880
 goal of 2 1 for the opponents 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.710
 incredible incredible at 83rd good 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.930
 impromptu attacker invoked inside 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.030
 for right tension it can make cerci go 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.010
 right you look in the penalty area look for the 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.849
 mind behind the right to shoot the goal 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.610
 empty 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:32.560
 22 of the hope of mattia right to the 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.680
 ninetieth the Milan manages to create 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.150
 this bad right situation succeeds 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.039
 with the tap in as a true striker a 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.840
 bring mine to the 2 2 great result 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:42.880
 here the sampdoria ends here 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.830
 game 22 a great comeback of the Milan 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.050
 that comeback twice the goal of the 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.820
 sampdoria before eto'o and then of 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.240
 soriano thanks to the mattia brace 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.090
 right 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.800
 let's say that this year the sampdoria is yes 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.370
 stronger limina has shown for everything 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.770
 the championship 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.449
 is a result that I believe the Milan 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.639
 could hold on to reality 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:02.169
 well serious guys you want this column 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:03.729

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.530
 your team write me below 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.820
 which you want to see in the next video e 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.990
 I will take it into consideration 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.310
 if the video you liked must 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.570
 allow a thumb punch and the 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.949
 channel segment that did not have it 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.300

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:16.770
