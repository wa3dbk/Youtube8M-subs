five six seven eight
now<00:02:34.560> same<00:02:35.560> thing<00:02:35.890> but<00:02:36.160> with<00:02:36.310> doubles<00:02:36.870> no<00:02:37.870> is

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
now same thing but with doubles no is

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.610 
now same thing but with doubles no is

actually easier at a single because if

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.020 
actually easier at a single because if
you<00:02:41.739> have<00:02:42.010> your<00:02:42.220> single<00:02:44.489> it's<00:02:45.489> just<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.820> same

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
you have your single it's just the same

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.620 
you have your single it's just the same

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
thing you just it's one more spot see

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.820 
thing you just it's one more spot see
this<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:49.989> double<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:52.140> just<00:02:53.140> one<00:02:53.320> more<00:02:53.530> spot

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
this is a double and just one more spot

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.360 
this is a double and just one more spot
so<00:02:54.670> it's<00:02:54.790> going<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:54.970> go<00:02:55.150> 5<00:02:56.050> 6<00:02:56.560> 7<00:02:57.190> 8<00:02:57.340> 1<00:02:57.640> 2<00:02:58.270> 3<00:02:58.450> 4<00:02:59.020> 5<00:02:59.860> 6

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
so it's going to go 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.580 
so it's going to go 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6
