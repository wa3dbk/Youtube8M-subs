I<00:00:08.250> my<00:00:08.760> hands<00:00:09.059> are<00:00:09.150> sort<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.389> covered<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:09.840> them

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
I my hands are sort of covered in them

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.180 
I my hands are sort of covered in them
pen<00:00:11.509> and<00:00:12.509> this<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.290> because<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.710> find<00:00:14.009> for

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
pen and this is because I find for

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.160 
pen and this is because I find for
studying<00:00:14.610> just<00:00:14.940> for<00:00:15.150> like<00:00:15.269> learning<00:00:15.630> facts<00:00:16.080> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
studying just for like learning facts a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.140 
studying just for like learning facts a
good<00:00:16.320> thing<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.710> just<00:00:16.890> put<00:00:17.070> sort<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.369> vague

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
good thing is to just put sort of vague

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.359 
good thing is to just put sort of vague
words<00:00:18.630> like<00:00:18.869> I've<00:00:19.020> got<00:00:19.170> Falcons<00:00:19.680> here<00:00:20.010> because

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
words like I've got Falcons here because

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.279 
words like I've got Falcons here because
I've<00:00:20.760> got<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.970> vague<00:00:21.150> relation<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.720> effects

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
I've got a vague relation to effects

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.300 
I've got a vague relation to effects
that<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.470> need<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.710> learn<00:00:22.830> about<00:00:22.920> rich<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.250> a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
that I need to learn about rich in a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.800 
that I need to learn about rich in a
second<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.269> find<00:00:24.480> putting<00:00:24.660> like

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
second so I just find putting like

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.450 
second so I just find putting like
little<00:00:25.140> things<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.740> then<00:00:25.830> like<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.189> look<00:00:26.340> at

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
little things and then like you look at

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.500 
little things and then like you look at
them<00:00:26.580> all<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.699> time<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.180> reminds

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
them all the time and it reminds

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.849 
them all the time and it reminds
yourself<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.930> then<00:00:28.019> just<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> few<00:00:28.710> times

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
yourself and then just like a few times

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.589 
yourself and then just like a few times
you<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.160> sort<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.490> go<00:00:29.640> through<00:00:29.670> all<00:00:29.910> them<00:00:30.449> and

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
you just sort of go through all them and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.110 
you just sort of go through all them and
see<00:00:30.750> what<00:00:31.740> they<00:00:31.859> are<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.340> find<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.880> quite

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
see what they are I find that quite

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.350 
see what they are I find that quite
useful<00:00:33.480> but<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:35.070> main<00:00:35.430> thing<00:00:35.640> about<00:00:35.700> revision

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
useful but the main thing about revision

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.840 
useful but the main thing about revision
techniques<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.840> everyone<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.290> different<00:00:37.850> yeah

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
techniques is everyone is different yeah

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.030 
techniques is everyone is different yeah
I<00:00:39.239> just<00:00:39.570> finished<00:00:39.840> my<00:00:39.989> final<00:00:40.350> year<00:00:40.500> exams<00:00:40.530> I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
I just finished my final year exams I

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.979 
I just finished my final year exams I
spent<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> last<00:00:41.460> few<00:00:41.910> months<00:00:41.969> kind<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.660> tried

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
spent the last few months kind of tried

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.630 
spent the last few months kind of tried
to<00:00:43.020> battle<00:00:43.500> with<00:00:43.620> finding<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.460> perfect

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
to battle with finding the perfect

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.729 
to battle with finding the perfect
revision<00:00:45.180> technique<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.660> me<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.960> never<00:00:46.379> really

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
revision technique for me I never really

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.650 
revision technique for me I never really
found<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.280> think<00:00:47.579> my<00:00:48.000> tutor<00:00:48.300> gave<00:00:48.420> me<00:00:48.539> some

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
found it I think my tutor gave me some

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.500 
found it I think my tutor gave me some
quite<00:00:48.840> good<00:00:49.020> advices<00:00:49.350> basically<00:00:50.510> you're

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
quite good advices basically you're

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.869 
quite good advices basically you're
unlikely<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.020> find<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.739> technique<00:00:53.160> which<00:00:53.760> is

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
unlikely to find one technique which is

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.260 
unlikely to find one technique which is
going<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> see<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.539> all<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> time<00:00:55.170> which

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
going to see you all at the time which

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.400 
going to see you all at the time which
you're<00:00:57.270> not<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.690> bored<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.260> it's

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
you're not going to get bored of so it's

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.770 
you're not going to get bored of so it's
quite<00:00:58.559> nice<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.370> try<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.449> many<00:01:00.600> different

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
quite nice to just try as many different

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.639 
quite nice to just try as many different
things<00:01:00.930> as<00:01:01.140> possible

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
things as possible

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.719 
things as possible
I<00:01:02.340> find<00:01:03.059> things<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.719> terrifying<00:01:04.729> but

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
I find things like that terrifying but

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.820 
I find things like that terrifying but
so<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:06.990> wash<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.320> off<00:01:07.409> before<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
so if you do this wash it off before the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.789 
so if you do this wash it off before the
exam<00:01:08.130> yes

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.130 

ie<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.549> think<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> main<00:01:15.390> thing<00:01:15.420> boy<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> learnt

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
ie I think the main thing boy I learnt

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.510 
ie I think the main thing boy I learnt
over<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.380> last<00:01:16.500> few<00:01:16.680> years<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.400> as

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
over the last few years is just do as

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.929 
over the last few years is just do as
many<00:01:18.770> practice<00:01:19.770> exam<00:01:20.040> papers<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.520> possible

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
many practice exam papers as possible

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.749 
many practice exam papers as possible
because<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.500> annoying<00:01:23.280> thing<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.610> some

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
because the annoying thing with some

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.580 
because the annoying thing with some
examples<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.299> people<00:01:24.600> know<00:01:25.020> lots<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.470> lots

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
examples that people know lots and lots

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.800 
examples that people know lots and lots
of<00:01:25.680> information<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.520> know<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> lot<00:01:27.479> about<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
of information and know a lot about the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.289 
of information and know a lot about the
subject<00:01:28.340> but<00:01:29.340> might<00:01:29.549> not<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.790> very<00:01:29.939> good<00:01:30.060> at

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
subject but might not be very good at

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.149 
subject but might not be very good at
expressing<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.409> quite<00:01:31.920> arbitrary

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
expressing that in the quite arbitrary

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.300 
expressing that in the quite arbitrary
way<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.299> exams<00:01:33.630> work<00:01:34.189> so<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.220> think

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
way that exams work so I think

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.700 
way that exams work so I think
practising<00:01:36.060> exam<00:01:36.689> technique<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.259> quite<00:01:37.439> good

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
practising exam technique is quite good

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.859 
practising exam technique is quite good
nothing<00:01:38.040> gained<00:01:38.640> information<00:01:39.119> into<00:01:39.570> anyway

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
nothing gained information into anyway

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
nothing gained information into anyway
like<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.159> history<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.549> ethics<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.909> just

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
like for like history and ethics I just

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.789 
like for like history and ethics I just
get<00:01:42.240> used<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.540> thinking<00:01:42.960> about<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> questions

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
get used to thinking about the questions

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.429 
get used to thinking about the questions
before<00:01:44.220> planning<00:01:44.909> them<00:01:45.180> if<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.259> get

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
before planning them if you just get

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.780 
before planning them if you just get
into<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.799> habit<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.130> being<00:01:47.250> able<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.520> do<00:01:47.670> that

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
into the habit of being able to do that

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.139 
into the habit of being able to do that
quite<00:01:48.030> quickly<00:01:48.180> then<00:01:48.540> that's<00:01:49.369> often<00:01:50.369> useful

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
quite quickly then that's often useful

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.889 
quite quickly then that's often useful
thank<00:01:51.450> you

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
thank you

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.980 
thank you
learning<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.350> write<00:01:52.500> within<00:01:52.710> an<00:01:52.890> hour<00:01:53.040> and

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
learning to write within an hour and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.760 
learning to write within an hour and
whilst<00:01:54.990> having<00:01:55.320> all<00:01:55.409> your<00:01:55.590> information

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
whilst having all your information

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.800 
whilst having all your information
locked<00:01:56.280> away<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.729> me<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.360> sort<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.600> stuff

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
locked away for me that sort of stuff

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.499 
locked away for me that sort of stuff
and<00:01:58.680> one<00:01:59.189> thing<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.460> find<00:01:59.670> quite<00:01:59.880> useful<00:01:59.909> and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and one thing I find quite useful and

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.260 
and one thing I find quite useful and
take<00:02:00.810> me<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.110> Sciences<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:01.619> well<00:02:01.649> if<00:02:02.270> you've

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
take me for Sciences as well if you've

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.609 
take me for Sciences as well if you've
got<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.450> come<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.600> grips<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:04.110> quite<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> few

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
got to come to grips with quite a few

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.340 
got to come to grips with quite a few
tricky<00:02:05.100> concepts<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.880> sometimes<00:02:06.689> talking<00:02:07.229> it

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
tricky concepts so sometimes talking it

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.960 
tricky concepts so sometimes talking it
through<00:02:07.380> with<00:02:07.590> someone<00:02:08.190> either<00:02:08.580> somebody

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
through with someone either somebody

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.010 
through with someone either somebody
does<00:02:09.149> your<00:02:09.270> subject<00:02:09.660> or

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
does your subject or

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.320 
does your subject or
someone<00:02:10.320> different<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.700> trying<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.090> explain

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
someone different and trying to explain

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.300 
someone different and trying to explain
that<00:02:12.540> concept<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:13.140> them<00:02:13.320> can<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.040> good<00:02:14.190> way

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
that concept to them can be a good way

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.550 
that concept to them can be a good way
of<00:02:14.340> making<00:02:15.330> sure<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.900> know<00:02:15.930> what<00:02:16.440> you're

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
of making sure that you know what you're

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.350 
of making sure that you know what you're
talking<00:02:16.890> about<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.220> your<00:02:17.250> head<00:02:17.490> if<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.150> can

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
talking about in your head if you can

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.660 
talking about in your head if you can
teach<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.810> then<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.080> know<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:20.340> if<00:02:20.400> someone

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
teach it then you know it so if someone

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.400 
teach it then you know it so if someone
asked<00:02:20.940> do<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.180> take<00:02:21.390> make<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.750> journal<00:02:22.050> xers

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
asked do you take make the journal xers

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.350 
asked do you take make the journal xers
apparently<00:02:23.040> their<00:02:23.190> cousin<00:02:23.580> went<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.000> LSE

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
apparently their cousin went to the LSE

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.610 
apparently their cousin went to the LSE
it<00:02:24.540> was<00:02:24.660> told<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.960> listen<00:02:25.320> while<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
it was told to listen while the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.500 
it was told to listen while the
mechanics<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.550> lecturers<00:02:26.880> emailed<00:02:27.330> out

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
mechanics and the lecturers emailed out

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.350 
mechanics and the lecturers emailed out
relevant<00:02:28.050> notes<00:02:28.970> yeah<00:02:29.970> it's<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> bit<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.330> a

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
relevant notes yeah it's a bit of a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.480 
relevant notes yeah it's a bit of a
tricky<00:02:30.720> one<00:02:30.980> but<00:02:33.230> obviously<00:02:34.230> every<00:02:35.010> lecture

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
tricky one but obviously every lecture

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.250 
tricky one but obviously every lecture
is<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.670> slightly<00:02:35.940> different<00:02:36.060> style<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.960> some

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
is a slightly different style and some

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.040 
is a slightly different style and some
do<00:02:37.500> prefer<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.070> give<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.820> out<00:02:38.970> powerpoints<00:02:39.930> or

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
do prefer to give you out powerpoints or

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.480 
do prefer to give you out powerpoints or
to<00:02:40.230> give<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.650> notes<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.160> have<00:02:41.370> to

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
to give you the notes that you have to

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.140 
to give you the notes that you have to
make<00:02:41.640> less<00:02:41.910> but<00:02:43.250> yeah<00:02:44.250> it's<00:02:44.430> up<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:45.030> I

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
make less but yeah it's up to you if I

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.510 
make less but yeah it's up to you if I
think<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.630> find<00:02:45.900> what<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.440> find<00:02:47.250> most<00:02:47.400> useful

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
think to find what you find most useful

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.580 
think to find what you find most useful
yeah<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.630> feel<00:02:48.990> funny

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
yeah like I feel funny

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.580 
yeah like I feel funny
because<00:02:50.160> we<00:02:50.910> as<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.780> art<00:02:51.990> students<00:02:52.410> tend<00:02:52.560> to

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
because we as the art students tend to

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.050 
because we as the art students tend to
get<00:02:52.740> less<00:02:52.920> lectures<00:02:53.610> than<00:02:53.790> with<00:02:53.970> the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
get less lectures than with the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.440 
get less lectures than with the
scientists<00:02:54.690> but<00:02:55.680> I've<00:02:55.800> found<00:02:56.160> if<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.610> I've

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
scientists but I've found if you I've

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.180 
scientists but I've found if you I've
asked<00:02:57.930> some<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.380> lecturers<00:02:58.740> if<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.980> can

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
asked some of the lecturers if I can

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.700 
asked some of the lecturers if I can
just<00:02:59.310> record<00:02:59.700> the<00:03:00.450> lecture<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.380> then<00:03:01.500> write

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
just record the lecture and then write

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.080 
just record the lecture and then write
down<00:03:01.740> because<00:03:02.130> sometimes<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.760> don't<00:03:02.880> have

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
down because sometimes you don't have

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.520 
down because sometimes you don't have
facts<00:03:03.390> or<00:03:03.690> something<00:03:04.020> and<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.200> just<00:03:04.230> want<00:03:04.470> to

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
facts or something and you just want to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.220 
facts or something and you just want to
get<00:03:04.620> them<00:03:04.800> down<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.610> can<00:03:05.880> just<00:03:06.060> um<00:03:06.300> yeah<00:03:06.930> do

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
get them down so you can just um yeah do

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.390 
get them down so you can just um yeah do
that

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
that

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.900 
that
for<00:03:09.240> biology<00:03:09.750> we<00:03:10.710> always<00:03:11.310> get<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.460> lecture<00:03:11.640> hand

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
for biology we always get a lecture hand

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.640 
for biology we always get a lecture hand
up<00:03:12.060> with<00:03:12.510> all<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.750> PowerPoint<00:03:13.140> slides<00:03:13.440> on<00:03:13.620> it

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
up with all the PowerPoint slides on it

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.490 
up with all the PowerPoint slides on it
and<00:03:14.400> then<00:03:14.580> we<00:03:14.820> generally<00:03:15.180> just<00:03:15.209> annotate<00:03:15.780> as

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
and then we generally just annotate as

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.640 
and then we generally just annotate as
we<00:03:16.740> listen<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.940> lecture<00:03:18.300> some<00:03:19.260> people

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
we listen to the lecture some people

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.980 
we listen to the lecture some people
some<00:03:20.250> people<00:03:20.280> record<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:21.030> some<00:03:21.480> people<00:03:21.750> sit

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
some people record it some people sit

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.380 
some people record it some people sit
back<00:03:22.020> and<00:03:22.170> just<00:03:22.500> absorb<00:03:22.970> just<00:03:23.970> whatever<00:03:24.120> words

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
back and just absorb just whatever words

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.810 
back and just absorb just whatever words
mean<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.660> really
