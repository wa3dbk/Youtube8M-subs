domination get yourself the Goliath and

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.890 
domination get yourself the Goliath and
pretty<00:00:58.640> much<00:00:58.759> when<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.210> next<00:00:59.360> round<00:00:59.540> begins

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
pretty much when the next round begins

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.719

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
just call it in and then when it is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.100 
just call it in and then when it is
called<00:01:02.030> in<00:01:02.180> what<00:01:02.360> you<00:01:02.420> were<00:01:02.509> going<00:01:02.689> to<00:01:02.750> do<00:01:02.930> is

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
called in what you were going to do is

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.380 
called in what you were going to do is
pretty<00:01:03.259> much<00:01:03.379> go<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.769> just<00:01:04.189> grab<00:01:04.400> it<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:05.269> when

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
pretty much go to just grab it and when

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.460 
pretty much go to just grab it and when
it<00:01:05.479> gets<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:05.689> capturing<00:01:06.049> all<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.290> way<00:01:06.409> you

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
it gets the capturing all the way you

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.020 
it gets the capturing all the way you
just<00:01:06.680> want<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:06.890> change<00:01:07.009> class<00:01:07.340> three<00:01:07.670> times

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
just want to change class three times

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.940 
just want to change class three times
and<00:01:08.360> then<00:01:08.689> what<00:01:08.869> it<00:01:08.960> will<00:01:09.049> do<00:01:09.290> is<00:01:09.530> actually

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
and then what it will do is actually

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.920 
and then what it will do is actually
keep<00:01:10.340> you<00:01:10.520> in<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.820> Goliath<00:01:11.299> and<00:01:11.479> you<00:01:11.810> will
