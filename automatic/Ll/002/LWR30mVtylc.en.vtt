what<00:00:53.019> makes<00:00:53.229> this<00:00:53.499> braid<00:00:53.800> different<00:00:54.219> than<00:00:54.309> a

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
what makes this braid different than a

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.189 
what makes this braid different than a
regular<00:00:54.399> French<00:00:54.940> braid<00:00:55.030> it's<00:00:55.809> just<00:00:56.019> how<00:00:56.170> you

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
regular French braid it's just how you

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.590 
regular French braid it's just how you
angle<00:00:56.739> it<00:00:56.829> wherever<00:00:57.489> you<00:00:57.729> lay<00:00:57.940> your<00:00:58.120> hands

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
angle it wherever you lay your hands

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.349 
angle it wherever you lay your hands
pretty<00:00:59.079> much<00:00:59.289> where<00:00:59.620> the<00:01:00.219> braid<00:01:00.489> is<00:01:00.789> going<00:01:00.999> to

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
pretty much where the braid is going to

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.059 
pretty much where the braid is going to
be<00:01:01.539> so<00:01:02.260> what<00:01:02.409> you're<00:01:02.530> trying<00:01:02.649> to<00:01:02.800> accomplish

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:06.969 
here is creating a braid that wraps

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:10.200 
here is creating a braid that wraps
around<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.570> head<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:09.310> create<00:01:09.579> sort<00:01:10.060> of<00:01:10.119> a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
around the head to create sort of a

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.880 
around the head to create sort of a
crown<00:01:10.479> once<00:01:11.079> you<00:01:11.200> braid<00:01:11.409> it<00:01:11.560> all<00:01:11.649> the<00:01:11.770> way<00:01:11.860> down

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
crown once you braid it all the way down

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.130 
crown once you braid it all the way down
you're<00:01:12.369> gonna<00:01:12.460> secure<00:01:13.119> it<00:01:13.240> with<00:01:13.360> them<00:01:13.540> elastic

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
you're gonna secure it with them elastic

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.319 
you're gonna secure it with them elastic
and<00:01:14.409> that's<00:01:15.189> just<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.610> hole<00:01:15.790> that's<00:01:16.000> placed

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
and that's just the hole that's placed

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.450 
and that's just the hole that's placed
until<00:01:16.719> you<00:01:17.259> are<00:01:17.590> finished<00:01:17.829> with<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.310> other

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
pieces cross over like a regular braid

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.319 
pieces cross over like a regular braid
braiding<00:01:29.590> all<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.860> way<00:01:29.950> back<00:01:30.159> until<00:01:30.939> you<00:01:31.210> get

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
braiding all the way back until you get

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.870

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
to the center and you want to angle your

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.910 
to the center and you want to angle your
body<00:01:34.030> in<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.630> directions<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.560> braid<00:01:35.770> is

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
body in the directions the braid is

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.279

gonna cross them over each other and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.980 
gonna cross them over each other and
then<00:01:47.770> pin<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.070> up<00:01:48.189> this<00:01:48.369> way<00:01:48.579> before<00:01:49.240> you<00:01:49.600> do<00:01:49.780> so

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990
