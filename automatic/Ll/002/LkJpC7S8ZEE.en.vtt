Kickstarter project they originally
started<00:00:13.950> out<00:00:14.190> asking<00:00:14.400> for<00:00:15.059> $5,000<00:00:16.049> ended<00:00:16.770> up

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
started out asking for $5,000 ended up

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.580 
started out asking for $5,000 ended up
with<00:00:17.130> 200k<00:00:17.759> so<00:00:18.570> let's<00:00:18.750> dive<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.289> see<00:00:19.500> if

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
with 200k so let's dive in and see if

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.490 
with 200k so let's dive in and see if
it's<00:00:19.710> worth<00:00:19.859> our<00:00:20.070> time

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.530

now the cool thing about them is let's
say<00:02:01.080> you<00:02:01.230> run<00:02:01.470> into<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> same<00:02:01.920> event<00:02:02.280> well<00:02:02.520> you

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
say you run into the same event well you

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.670 
say you run into the same event well you
have<00:02:02.730> the<00:02:02.850> power<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.480> change<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.320> depending

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
have the power to change that depending

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.469 
have the power to change that depending
on what<00:02:04.950> you've<00:02:05.130> done<00:02:05.400> let's<00:02:06.060> say<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.240> pick

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
on what you've done let's say you pick

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.330 
on what you've done let's say you pick
up<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.720> crew<00:02:06.960> member<00:02:07.080> along<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.620> way<00:02:07.800> or<00:02:08.250> maybe

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
up a crew member along the way or maybe

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.669 
up a crew member along the way or maybe
you<00:02:08.520> run<00:02:08.670> into<00:02:08.790> a<00:02:08.910> weapon<00:02:09.119> well<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:10.020> choice<00:02:10.410> will

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
you run into a weapon well a choice will

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.860 
you run into a weapon well a choice will
be<00:02:10.770> highlighted<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.459> blue<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:12.510> just<00:02:12.720> means

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
be highlighted in blue that just means

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.110 
be highlighted in blue that just means
that<00:02:13.080> each<00:02:13.440> play<00:02:13.890> session<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.820> want<00:02:15.030> to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
that each play session you want to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.120 
that each play session you want to
change<00:02:15.330> up<00:02:15.510> your<00:02:15.540> strategies<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.530> don't<00:02:16.830> want

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
change up your strategies you don't want

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.670 
change up your strategies you don't want
to<00:02:17.220> build<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.610> same<00:02:17.850> way<00:02:18.090> every<00:02:18.690> time<00:02:18.720> FTL

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
to build the same way every time FTL

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.350 
to build the same way every time FTL
works<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.160> well<00:02:20.190> because<00:02:20.550> it's<00:02:20.850> about<00:02:21.060> how<00:02:21.300> you

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
works so well because it's about how you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.030 
works so well because it's about how you
manage<00:02:21.840> what<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.110> game<00:02:22.290> throws<00:02:22.620> at<00:02:22.830> you
