00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:22.230
 and at the moment the best platformer 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.840
 our console is little 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.640
 big planet and deservedly at first 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.320
 It was a bit scary for the project because 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.390
 that the game was created by development teams 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.489
 which was not involving creation 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.739
 original parts but in the end media 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.660
 molecule surpassed themselves and the light 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.219
 born one of the few games which 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.870
 can really compete with 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.059
 older versions and in some ways even 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.129
 transcend their plot of the game is spinning 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.410
 around the carnival to the planets of joy and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.600
 magic enslaved by the villain by name 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.670
 a puppeteer who can suck the whole 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.530
 joy and lands the main character as in 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.480
 original parts stands c 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.820
 just in the game we have to go 5 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.860
 locations and about 40 story levels 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.350
 the game also features mini games olya 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.540
 Tetris and racing competitive levels and 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.939
 5 arcade each level in its own way 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.100
 unique and interesting so the game can 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.170
 delay you for one night well 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.030
 truly make the game endless so this 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.649
 community level that are created 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.390
 every day well for really 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.760
 unique levels developers even 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.500
 selected a separate planet characters 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.630
 who we will meet on the way to the monastery 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.670
 the puppeteer is well spelled memorable 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.530
 much better than adult versions to 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.659
 the same if you buy a game in Russia 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.820
 then you will be pleasantly surprised by the translation and voice acting 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.860
 which is performed at the highest level 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.570
 if you prefer english 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.760
 who as in the case of little big planet 2 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.369
 Steven Fry attended 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.140
 famous actor writer and playwright what 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.000
 concerns the editor then he will transfer 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.040
 virtually unchanged a process 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.420
 creating levels has become much more convenient 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.220
 thanks to technical capabilities 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.140
 console is also worth noting 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.790
 interaction with objects where with 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.619
 using the back and the front you 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.869
 be able to manipulate objects in the game 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.710
 what to diversify gameplay and impressions 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.930
 about the game as a whole 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.490
 the highlight of the game is multiplayer so 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.229
 what if you have a couple of friends and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.240
 good internet connections you don't 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.850
 regret buying the price of the game in 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.830
 playstation store is 1400 rubles 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.439
 but also have to fork out for another 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.629
 345 for which the password is purchased for 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:15.120
 online games price in stores on average 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.370
 1800 rubles password to play on the network is 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.409
 Included price as usual bites 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.800
 we think it should be worth so much 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.920
 similar game 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.920
 I 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.200
 October 30, 2012 was published 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.060
 assassin's creed 3 liberation with 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.620
 original assassin's creed 3 players 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.730
 for the first time in the history of the series presented 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.700
 take on the role of the female character 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.360
 that was a bold enough story 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.340
 unfolding in the New Orleans sample 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.180
 1765 between the end 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.099
 the french indian war and the middle 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.709
 american revolution main character 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.630
 games assassin avellino who respects and 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.819
 loves in his hometown being his daughter 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.680
 nato french black slave 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.660
 who gave her freedom Avellino 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.519
 find a common language as mobile attacks 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.650
 noble persons in the game we have to 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.230
 join against the slave system 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.880
 the Spaniards and the Templars where do without them in 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.680
 In general, for fans of the plot series 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.239
 does not seem interesting and predictable 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.130
 and the characters themselves are lethargic and not 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.170
 memorable but on console game 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.940
 looks quite nice and ride on 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.799
 the roofs and hunt down the victims as before 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.200
 interesting is one of the main features of the game 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.819
 dressing appeals so that outfit 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.470
 to our liking we can only pick 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.540
 at the end of chapters a most of the time 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.519
 we will have to wake up in a secular manner 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.500
 ladies worth noting that every clothes 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.120
 there are pros and cons so in slave 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.100
 rags are easier to perform parkour and 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.660
 get lost in the crowd and in a magnificent dress 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.639
 You can bribe the guards and get on 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.590
 prohibited territory also each 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.120
 clothes her search scale and so she 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.609
 diminished will have to kill and 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.260
 rob and bribe third-party missions like 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.180
 however, and the plot they are very different 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.430
 apart and it usually comes down to 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.739
 kill bring plus to all bring give 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.780
 pennies making it difficult to buy new things 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.980
 in the store of course there is a family 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.989
 enterprise where you need to get 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.030
 ships load their supplies 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.950
 sell them in ports but again all 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.750
 it looks very boring and fast 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.850
 bored in the game is present and online 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.799
 mode but don't be in a hurry to rejoice all 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.630
 the gameplay is built around the globe and points on 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.729
 the map you need to take 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.740
 graphically, battles are not displayed 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.450
 automatically counted another 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.070
 big minus is the number of bugs 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.750
 which have shrunk somewhat after 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.160
 last update but still possible 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.500
 meet with such common 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.449
 problems like falling fps getting into 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.400
 textures and fancy poses true 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.050
 overall, the game looks better than the same 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.490
 there was a blind but obviously not using 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.960
 playstation vita potential 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.059
 which does not interfere with enjoy 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.889
 Assassin daily duties 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:49.259
 the price tag of the games in the playstation store as in 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.259
 stores 1799 rubles
