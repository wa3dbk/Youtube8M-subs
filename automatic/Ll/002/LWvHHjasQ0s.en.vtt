 To give a little hope, even a man 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.070
 I can live comfortably. 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.800
 Sit still and compliment my brother 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.230
 That's the role of a hard mother. 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.570
 In consideration of the fact that Su is now ending and my sister 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.800
 Looking at

 Lost in voice 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.640
 I'm responding.

 He has lost his attachment 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.719
 It does not mean that you can not talk. 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.240
 Do not walk in the kiln. 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.540
 I can not be a child's mother because I lost my voice. 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.640
 Not. 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.780

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.050
 If the photo is any education, that means the closure, the mouth has closed its mouth 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.880
 I have a heart that continues to hurt 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.590
 It's not pink, I'm coming out. 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.030
 Approach 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.229
 Is it possible to approach it as a human being? 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.510
 Somebody. 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.620
 I interpreted it as a reasonable character. 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.080
 I do not have a grade this year. 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.360
 There are also some excuses when I get the face. 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.189
 Kim Jang Soo 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.189
 When you're in a situation, the person,

 Many characters of the Industrial Bank 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.450
 I think it's implied. 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.990
 I'm a little faded without an answer.

 To live well without forgiveness of oneself 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.390
 Then maybe you'll be more careful and not guaranteed 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.670
 Or is it Olympic billion 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.000
 3. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 It's the common point that they offered it. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.560
 I'm a little bit 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.050
 It looks like you have it. 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.260
 I am a part of them, 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.450
 I think it's making. 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.759
 I have heard from the elementary school that I have a reputation for being a saint blizzard 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.810
 I got a business license. 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.500
 Support for incentives up to a large amount of requirements 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.050
 Seriously. 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.480
 It's not too shaky then, 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.059
 Is that true? 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:17.049
 You were very opposed to it. 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.029
 So I fight harmoniously with Bashatta

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.339
 I told my parents. 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.129
 The character Jeon Hyun 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.560
 A lot of bishops 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.729
 He said he was investigated. 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:40.059
 I meet an actor who matches the picture you are thinking about. 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.219
 He said he could not. 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.809
 The director of photography 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.739
 Try to compete with other competitors. 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.500
 There's an actress I met in 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.639
 If yes 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.699
 It's been done to me, and I'm in the office. 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.900
 The moment I met with the feeling that I wanted to meet with emotion 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:02:59.350
 The bishop 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.659
 The area already has 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:01.599
 It's not Park Si-yeon. 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.799
 We have a book feast open 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.799
 Because you have an idea 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:08.779
 First meeting 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.779
 me so six times 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:16.479
 In the case of me, it is said that the character who took charge that Keita weather 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:17.799
 Finding executives 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.549
 Imagine many people about% and behavior 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.629
 It is not. 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:24.459
 Iraq 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.490
 In the aig script there is also the personality that character receives 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.449
 As much as possible 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.010
 I think that's what I said. 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.379
 D I understand. 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.549
 If you are deep in your heart, 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.439
 First of all 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.289
 I'm trying to get ready. 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:45.479
 I've been living in my house ever since I've been alive 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:49.949
 Considering the team's winning team is excellent and the price is high. 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.949
 I did a lot of trying to find a voice without 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:57.049
 There was a sound that this did not ring. 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.049
 So I was listening to the sound. 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.239
 I have already 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.409
 My mom is vista. 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.949
 I am practicing the shooting scenarios and in this process, 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.619
 I found a similar tax. 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:11.739
 As a result, my voice 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.309
 I did it. 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:16.870
 I am most worried about how I will be seen by you. 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.609
 Worried 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.389
 Is the most curious 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.389
 It is expected and this scene is ending 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.289
 Many times that 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.200
 And 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.110
 I was a little frightened. 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.600
 - Hold your heart. 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.600
 A full sheet 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.319
 A lot of human body 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.919
 how 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.919
 I think you can feel it. 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.309
 Really 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:50.309
 No, I'm not really good at walking the road. 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:51.840
 Kierina 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.490
 If so, 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.279
 Any article related to the character, or 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.090
 Something like this 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.419
 March Drama homepage The book with Taean 

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:06.209
 The one who left it was impressed by the word, 

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:08.099
 I want to be in poetry. 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.779
 exciting 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:10.240
 It's 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.240
 It is the actor who can give such a trust. 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:16.189
 If you aim to 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:17.289
 Already 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.970
 Take your feelings. 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.139
 If you read the article that made you fear 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.259
 When I change my mind, 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:29.529
 A feeling of crisis 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.190
 If the court 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.289
 A full-time 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.289
 The respect and the manners are really good 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.819
 To the actors 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.960
 The purpose is when you come to the point where you are lacking 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.940
 I will never make a loud noise, 

00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:49.150
 I have returned home 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.770

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.770
 He's taking care of a very small part. 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.100
 I have a very human part when I work. 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.180
 And as a bishop, 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.020
 An actor 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.009
 I can heal too much. 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:06.919
 So much changed, stocks 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:08.559
 That trust 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:10.499

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:12.289
 He showed. 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.289
 The problem is already there 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:17.150
 Due to the Justice Department, the saliva rises

 Yes hello 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.740
 It's not only true that it will be released on August 12th. 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.309
 I denied it. 

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:30.330

 Yes, as much as you have done and supported me 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.120
 I wonder
