00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
okay my first day having a look at the

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.369 
okay my first day having a look at the
cars<00:00:05.190> in<00:00:05.279> Bahrain<00:00:05.790> what<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.270> brilliant<00:00:06.899> day

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
cars in Bahrain what a brilliant day

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.040 
cars in Bahrain what a brilliant day
there<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.189> corner<00:00:08.639> here<00:00:08.910> which<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.420> not<00:00:09.690> only

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
there is a corner here which is not only

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.720 
there is a corner here which is not only
the<00:00:10.349> best<00:00:10.530> corner<00:00:10.830> on<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:10.980> Bahrain<00:00:11.280> circuit

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
the best corner on the Bahrain circuit

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.940 
the best corner on the Bahrain circuit
but<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.179> my<00:00:12.360> view<00:00:12.440> probably<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.559> best<00:00:13.799> place

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
but in my view probably the best place

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.490 
but in my view probably the best place
to<00:00:14.250> watch<00:00:14.460> Formula<00:00:14.849> one<00:00:15.089> cars<00:00:15.350> anywhere<00:00:16.350> in

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
to watch Formula one cars anywhere in

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.189 
to watch Formula one cars anywhere in
the<00:00:16.560> world<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:16.949> got<00:00:17.100> everything<00:00:17.630> just<00:00:18.630> let's

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
the world it's got everything just let's

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.990 
the world it's got everything just let's
have<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> look<00:00:19.560> on<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.859> my<00:00:20.400> computer<00:00:20.580> here

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
have a look on the my computer here

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.880 
have a look on the my computer here
that's<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.109> corner<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.529> not<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> great

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
that's the corner it's not a great

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.070 
that's the corner it's not a great
picture<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.180> what<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.900> actually

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
picture of it but what is actually

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.570 
picture of it but what is actually
happening<00:00:25.289> here<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:25.980> they're<00:00:26.279> coming

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
happening here is that they're coming

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.189 
happening here is that they're coming
through<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> very<00:00:27.150> quick<00:00:27.449> section<00:00:27.869> here<00:00:28.080> which

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
through a very quick section here which

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.339 
through a very quick section here which
is<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> kink<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.550> road<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.990> down<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
is a kink the road is going down the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.930 
is a kink the road is going down the
gradients<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:31.920> down<00:00:32.130> they're<00:00:32.759> coming

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
gradients going down they're coming

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.490 
gradients going down they're coming
through<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.329> fast<00:00:33.630> King<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.079> then<00:00:34.170> breaking

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
through this fast King and then breaking

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.620 
through this fast King and then breaking
hard<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.309> down<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> second<00:00:36.120> gear<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.510> this

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
hard in down the second gear to this

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.760 
hard in down the second gear to this
left<00:00:36.840> hand<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.170> then<00:00:37.290> there's<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> long

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
left hand and then there's a long

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.069 
left hand and then there's a long
straight<00:00:38.250> afterwards<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.180> there<00:00:39.780> are<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.899> lot

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
straight afterwards so there are a lot

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.180 
straight afterwards so there are a lot
of<00:00:40.110> elements<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.620> there's<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.950> fast

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
of elements here there's the fast

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.779 
of elements here there's the fast
approach<00:00:41.670> there's<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.600> breaking<00:00:43.520> to<00:00:44.520> very

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
approach there's the breaking to very

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.450 
approach there's the breaking to very
slow<00:00:45.120> speed<00:00:45.200> whilst<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.469> car<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.860> loaded<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
slow speed whilst the car is loaded and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.420 
slow speed whilst the car is loaded and
it's<00:00:48.329> going<00:00:48.629> downhill<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.350> then<00:00:49.410> there's<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
it's going downhill and then there's the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.639 
it's going downhill and then there's the
long<00:00:50.610> straight<00:00:50.850> afterwards<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.600> every<00:00:52.170> slight

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
long straight afterwards so every slight

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.020 
long straight afterwards so every slight
mistake<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.129> penalized<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.850> brilliant

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
mistake is penalized it's a brilliant

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.479 
mistake is penalized it's a brilliant
place<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.449> watch<00:00:54.629> nobody<00:00:55.530> there<00:00:55.739> today<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:56.340> all

good anyway it was fabulous to watch
their<00:01:02.280> first<00:01:02.789> point<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.359> general

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
their first point just general

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
their first point just general
observations<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.710> cars<00:01:04.949> as<00:01:05.159> they<00:01:05.189> accelerate

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
observations the cars as they accelerate

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.480 
observations the cars as they accelerate
away<00:01:05.939> down<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.720> long<00:01:06.900> straight<00:01:07.380> which<00:01:08.340> is

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
away down that long straight which is

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.250 
away down that long straight which is
parallel<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.299> mains<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> pit

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
parallel to the mains to the pit

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.679 
parallel to the mains to the pit
straight<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:11.280> fascinating<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.390> see<00:01:12.510> how

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
straight it's fascinating to see how

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.929 
straight it's fascinating to see how
different<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.409> gear<00:01:13.590> ratios<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.310> already

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
different the gear ratios are already

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.429 
different the gear ratios are already
what<00:01:15.360> already<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.380> that

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
what already it's going to be like that

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.740 
what already it's going to be like that
all<00:01:16.680> year<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.670> they've<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.180> different

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
all year but they've got the different

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.730 
all year but they've got the different
ratios<00:01:19.189> at<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.340> point<00:01:20.780> pre-season<00:01:21.780> even

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
ratios at this point pre-season even

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.399 
ratios at this point pre-season even
amongst<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:24.390> groupings<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> engine

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
amongst the groupings of the engine

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.899 
amongst the groupings of the engine
manufacturers<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.280> take<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:26.820> example

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
manufacturers so if you take for example

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.640 
manufacturers so if you take for example
about<00:01:27.240> Terry<00:01:27.509> botas<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.170> Williams<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
about Terry botas in the Williams you

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.230 
about Terry botas in the Williams you
see<00:01:28.799> him<00:01:28.920> accelerate<00:01:29.460> out<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.820> second

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
see him accelerate out of this second

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.420 
see him accelerate out of this second
gear<00:01:30.390> left-hander<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.170> he<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:32.159> gets

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
gear left-hander and he just gets

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.730 
gear left-hander and he just gets
seventh<00:01:32.759> gear<00:01:33.030> before<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:34.439> end<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
seventh gear before the end of the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.890 
seventh gear before the end of the
straight<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.060> has<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.360> break<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
straight as and has to break for the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.300 
straight as and has to break for the
next<00:01:37.020> left-hander<00:01:37.560> which<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> quick<00:01:38.040> corner

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
next left-hander which is a quick corner

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.109 
next left-hander which is a quick corner
of<00:01:38.369> fourth<00:01:38.579> gear<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.820> think<00:01:40.369> Sergio<00:01:41.369> Perez<00:01:41.820> in

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
of fourth gear I think Sergio Perez in

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.630 
of fourth gear I think Sergio Perez in
the<00:01:42.390> Mercedes<00:01:42.840> powered<00:01:43.350> Force<00:01:43.619> India<00:01:43.979> same<00:01:44.460> as

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the Mercedes powered Force India same as

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.520 
the Mercedes powered Force India same as

the William same Mercedes power is in

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.840 
the William same Mercedes power is in
fifth<00:01:46.799> gear<00:01:47.009> at<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.220> end<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.490> straight<00:01:47.670> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
fifth gear at the end of the straight a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.940 
fifth gear at the end of the straight a
much<00:01:48.240> longer<00:01:48.540> fourth<00:01:48.960> gear<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.350> much<00:01:49.680> longer

much longer fourth gear a much longer

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.920 
much longer fourth gear a much longer
fifth<00:01:50.340> gear<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.540> me<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.720> fascinating

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
fifth gear and that to me is fascinating

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.069 
fifth gear and that to me is fascinating
so<00:01:52.560> well<00:01:53.430> Terry<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:54.420> get<00:01:54.570> eight<00:01:54.689> gear

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
so well Terry can get eight gear

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.510 
so well Terry can get eight gear

the straight now that in my mind can

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.140 
the straight now that in my mind can
only<00:02:09.030> be<00:02:09.300> because<00:02:09.479> Force<00:02:10.080> India<00:02:10.530> are<00:02:10.770> gearing

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150

from monza downwards they're thinking

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.759 
from monza downwards they're thinking
DRS<00:02:15.209> monza<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.319> what<00:02:16.470> we're<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:16.709> to

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
DRS monza this is what we're going to

where's<00:02:21.900> everybody<00:02:22.230> else<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.590> think<00:02:22.650> is

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
where's everybody else I think is

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.979 
where's everybody else I think is
thinking<00:02:23.640> well<00:02:24.360> we<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.599> had<00:02:24.750> lots<00:02:24.840> of

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
thinking well we just had lots of

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.690 
thinking well we just had lots of
clothes<00:02:25.140> ratios<00:02:25.590> before<00:02:25.890> we'll<00:02:26.069> just<00:02:26.220> go<00:02:26.430> for

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
clothes ratios before we'll just go for

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.300 
clothes ratios before we'll just go for
it<00:02:26.760> again<00:02:26.909> and<00:02:27.269> basically<00:02:28.260> replicate<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:29.040> you

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
it again and basically replicate and you

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.740 
it again and basically replicate and you
notice<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.790> actually<00:02:30.120> coming<00:02:30.329> out<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.569> this

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
notice it actually coming out of this

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.110 
notice it actually coming out of this
second<00:02:31.200> year<00:02:31.349> left-hander<00:02:31.890> botas<00:02:32.609> a<00:02:32.640> couple

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
second year left-hander botas a couple

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.849 
second year left-hander botas a couple
of<00:02:33.209> times<00:02:33.390> was<00:02:33.689> getting<00:02:33.900> wheel<00:02:34.079> spins<00:02:34.439> second

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
of times was getting wheel spins second

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.729 
of times was getting wheel spins second
third<00:02:34.980> fourth<00:02:35.159> fifth<00:02:35.510> gear<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.439> say<00:02:37.709> that

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
third fourth fifth gear and I say that

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.440 
third fourth fifth gear and I say that
because<00:02:38.129> you<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.489> see<00:02:38.609> a<00:02:38.640> red<00:02:38.879> light<00:02:39.060> coming

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
because you can see a red light coming

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.599 
because you can see a red light coming
on<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.840> we<00:02:39.920> think<00:02:40.920> I've<00:02:41.159> talked<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.459> few

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
on and we think I've talked a few

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:42.849 
on and we think I've talked a few
engineers<00:02:41.849> about<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.359> under<00:02:42.599> acceleration

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
engineers about this under acceleration

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.649 
engineers about this under acceleration
although<00:02:43.859> in<00:02:44.250> theory<00:02:44.849> that<00:02:45.000> red<00:02:45.269> light<00:02:45.450> comes

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
although in theory that red light comes

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.180 
although in theory that red light comes
on<00:02:45.870> when<00:02:45.989> is<00:02:46.079> a<00:02:46.139> talk<00:02:46.319> production<00:02:46.859> taking

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
on when is a talk production taking

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.490 
on when is a talk production taking
place<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:48.000> other<00:02:48.180> words<00:02:48.389> in<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.720> braking<00:02:49.170> area

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
place in other words in a braking area

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.920 
place in other words in a braking area
when<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.709> driver<00:02:50.069> is<00:02:50.599> taking<00:02:51.599> everything<00:02:51.780> out

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
when the driver is taking everything out

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.509 
when the driver is taking everything out
of<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.200> car<00:02:52.379> to<00:02:52.409> warm<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.980> guy<00:02:53.010> behind<00:02:53.310> him

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
of the car to warm the guy behind him

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:54.680 
of the car to warm the guy behind him
that<00:02:53.700> he<00:02:53.760> might<00:02:53.940> be<00:02:54.060> getting<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.269> bit<00:02:54.389> slower

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
that he might be getting a bit slower

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.250 
that he might be getting a bit slower
it's<00:02:55.650> also<00:02:55.889> coming<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.840> spasmodically<00:02:57.840> under

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
it's also coming on spasmodically under

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.960 
it's also coming on spasmodically under
acceleration<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:59.099> most<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.609> engineers

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
acceleration and most of the engineers

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.420 
acceleration and most of the engineers
think<00:03:00.269> this<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.720> when<00:03:01.069> actually<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.250> rear

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
think this is when actually the rear

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.250 
think this is when actually the rear
wheels<00:03:02.609> are<00:03:02.760> breaking<00:03:03.030> traction<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.629> just

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
wheels are breaking traction and just

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.539 
wheels are breaking traction and just
momentarily<00:03:04.889> and<00:03:05.069> that's<00:03:05.220> why<00:03:05.340> we're<00:03:05.489> seeing

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
momentarily and that's why we're seeing

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.160 
momentarily and that's why we're seeing
those<00:03:05.700> red<00:03:05.909> lights<00:03:06.090> coming<00:03:06.389> on<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.019> see

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
those red lights coming on and you see

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.929 
those red lights coming on and you see
it<00:03:07.290> quite<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.500> lot<00:03:07.560> on<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.129> Williams<00:03:08.489> Mercedes

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
it quite a lot on that Williams Mercedes

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.809 
it quite a lot on that Williams Mercedes
the<00:03:09.689> the<00:03:10.379> interesting<00:03:10.739> thing<00:03:10.859> is<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.280> drivers

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
the the interesting thing is the drivers

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.059 
the the interesting thing is the drivers
in<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.180> cars<00:03:12.480> chatting<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.409> them<00:03:13.590> are

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
in the cars chatting to them are

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.800 
in the cars chatting to them are
listening<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.760> thing<00:03:14.939> they<00:03:15.090> hear<00:03:15.329> most<00:03:15.569> is

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
listening the thing they hear most is

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.080 
listening the thing they hear most is
the<00:03:15.840> turbo<00:03:16.319> not<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.769> engine<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.910> they're

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
the turbo not the engine and so they're

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.710 
the turbo not the engine and so they're
not<00:03:18.239> actually<00:03:18.449> as<00:03:19.079> aware<00:03:19.970> perhaps<00:03:20.970> as<00:03:21.329> a

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
not actually as aware perhaps as a

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.930 
not actually as aware perhaps as a
classic<00:03:22.560> racing<00:03:22.739> driver<00:03:23.129> from<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.459> 60s<00:03:23.819> 70s

that<00:03:59.370> we're<00:03:59.489> having<00:03:59.579> in<00:04:00.389> April<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:01.769> me<00:04:01.889> it's<00:04:02.040> a

that we're having in April to me it's a

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.920 
that we're having in April to me it's a
bit<00:04:02.220> surprising<00:04:02.639> that<00:04:02.940> they<00:04:03.060> haven't<00:04:03.299> allowed

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
bit surprising that they haven't allowed

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.589 
bit surprising that they haven't allowed
one<00:04:04.349> of<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.620> days<00:04:04.799> of<00:04:04.979> testing<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.579> extend<00:04:06.030> to

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
one of the days of testing to extend to

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.569 
one of the days of testing to extend to
start<00:04:06.900> later<00:04:07.139> and<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.769> extend<00:04:07.949> into<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.400> night

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
start later and to extend into the night

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.789 
start later and to extend into the night
just<00:04:08.909> to<00:04:09.030> give<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.750> circuit<00:04:10.139> and<00:04:10.169> the<00:04:10.379> drivers

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
just to give the circuit and the drivers

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.649 
just to give the circuit and the drivers
one<00:04:11.069> a<00:04:11.340> couple<00:04:11.879> of<00:04:11.970> hours<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.329> running<00:04:12.479> at

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
one a couple of hours of running at

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.869 
one a couple of hours of running at
night<00:04:12.690> under<00:04:13.139> lights<00:04:13.530> but<00:04:13.889> I<00:04:14.069> guess<00:04:14.639> they

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
night under lights but I guess they

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.789 
night under lights but I guess they
haven't<00:04:15.090> done<00:04:15.269> that<00:04:15.449> nobody<00:04:16.440> really<00:04:16.650> knows

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
haven't done that nobody really knows

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.140 
haven't done that nobody really knows
why<00:04:16.979> they<00:04:17.159> haven't<00:04:17.310> done<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.519> when<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.000> talk

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
why they haven't done that when you talk

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.670 
why they haven't done that when you talk
about<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.479> they<00:04:18.570> think<00:04:18.780> maybe<00:04:19.289> it's<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.500> quite<00:04:19.650> a

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
about it they think maybe it's a quite a

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.469 
about it they think maybe it's a quite a
good<00:04:19.829> idea<00:04:20.070> but<00:04:20.250> I<00:04:20.459> think<00:04:20.639> the<00:04:21.120> reason<00:04:21.299> that

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
good idea but I think the reason that

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.230 
good idea but I think the reason that
didn't<00:04:21.870> come<00:04:22.019> up<00:04:22.079> at<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.469> time

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
didn't come up at the time

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.629 
didn't come up at the time
was<00:04:23.810> because<00:04:24.289> everyone<00:04:24.919> was<00:04:25.039> just<00:04:25.250> thinking

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
was because everyone was just thinking

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.070 
was because everyone was just thinking
we've<00:04:25.849> got<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.120> get<00:04:26.210> out<00:04:26.330> of<00:04:26.360> Europe<00:04:26.750> we<00:04:26.870> gotta

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
we've got to get out of Europe we gotta

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.020 
we've got to get out of Europe we gotta
run<00:04:27.319> hot<00:04:27.560> we<00:04:28.099> got<00:04:28.280> to<00:04:28.400> get<00:04:28.490> into<00:04:28.669> these<00:04:28.789> hot

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
run hot we got to get into these hot

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.029 
run hot we got to get into these hot
ambient<00:04:29.449> temperatures<00:04:29.780> of<00:04:29.930> Bahrain<00:04:30.259> and<00:04:30.440> so

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
ambient temperatures of Bahrain and so

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.860 
ambient temperatures of Bahrain and so
nobody<00:04:31.370> was<00:04:31.520> thinking<00:04:31.639> of<00:04:31.970> cooler<00:04:32.509> night

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
nobody was thinking of cooler night

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.420 
nobody was thinking of cooler night
temperatures<00:04:33.380> when<00:04:33.560> all<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:33.830> was<00:04:34.009> scheduled

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
temperatures when all this was scheduled

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.279 
temperatures when all this was scheduled
a<00:04:34.789> bit<00:04:35.060> of<00:04:35.150> a<00:04:35.210> shame<00:04:35.389> I<00:04:35.569> think<00:04:35.780> because<00:04:36.139> the

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
a bit of a shame I think because the

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.600 
a bit of a shame I think because the
lights<00:04:36.530> are<00:04:36.710> there<00:04:36.830> ready<00:04:37.009> to<00:04:37.069> be<00:04:37.250> used<00:04:37.400> and

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
lights are there ready to be used and

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.800 
lights are there ready to be used and
I'd<00:04:37.699> love<00:04:37.849> to<00:04:38.030> see<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.300> circuit<00:04:38.599> at<00:04:38.690> night

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
I'd love to see the circuit at night

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.409 
I'd love to see the circuit at night
little<00:04:39.380> look<00:04:39.500> absolutely<00:04:39.860> superb<00:04:40.550> anyway

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
little look absolutely superb anyway

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.450 
little look absolutely superb anyway
those<00:04:41.960> are<00:04:41.990> general<00:04:42.440> observations<00:04:42.949> watching

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
those are general observations watching

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.790 
those are general observations watching
from<00:04:43.819> what<00:04:44.569> is<00:04:44.690> effectively<00:04:44.930> turned<00:04:45.500> nine<00:04:45.770> and

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
from what is effectively turned nine and

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.170 
from what is effectively turned nine and
a<00:04:46.039> half<00:04:46.069> I<00:04:46.430> think<00:04:46.460> I'm<00:04:46.789> not<00:04:46.880> sure<00:04:47.030> it<00:04:47.120> actually

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
a half I think I'm not sure it actually

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.960 
a half I think I'm not sure it actually
has<00:04:47.419> a<00:04:47.449> turn<00:04:47.660> number<00:04:47.870> here<00:04:48.169> because<00:04:48.889> it's<00:04:49.069> two

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
has a turn number here because it's two
