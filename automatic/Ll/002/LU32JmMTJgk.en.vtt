00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.679 
I'm knew it the whole idea so I'm used
to<00:01:53.040> building<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.640> actual<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.390> just

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
to building like actual like just

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.719 
to building like actual like just
structures<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.350> air<00:01:55.590> or<00:01:55.829> whatever<00:01:56.100> like

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
we can go but still looks really good

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.080 
we can go but still looks really good
for<00:03:34.180> what<00:03:34.330> it<00:03:34.360> is<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.840> little<00:03:35.110> room<00:03:35.410> for<00:03:35.440> the
