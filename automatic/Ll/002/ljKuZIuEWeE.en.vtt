this dialog that's prompting you to do
something<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.000> don't<00:00:30.210> know<00:00:30.599> quite<00:00:31.260> what

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
something but you don't know quite what

something but you don't know quite what
to<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:32.189> yet<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.910> make<00:00:33.329> things<00:00:33.540> feel<00:00:33.780> a

to do just yet can make things feel a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.720 
to do just yet can make things feel a
little<00:00:34.110> confusing<00:00:34.500> well<00:00:35.280> you've<00:00:35.399> come<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
little confusing well you've come to the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.030 
little confusing well you've come to the
right<00:00:35.940> place<00:00:36.090> because<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:37.140> PEC<00:00:37.500> sketch<00:00:37.860> is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
right place because a PEC sketch is

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.250 
right place because a PEC sketch is
really<00:00:38.370> very<00:00:38.489> easy<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.969> use<00:00:39.239> but<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:39.960> any

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
really very easy to use but like any

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.869 
really very easy to use but like any
program<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.129> takes<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:41.730> practice

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
program it just takes a little practice

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.240 
program it just takes a little practice
but<00:00:42.360> mostly<00:00:43.050> some<00:00:43.530> understanding<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
but mostly some understanding of the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.779 
but mostly some understanding of the
basics<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.570> basic<00:00:45.899> concepts<00:00:46.440> are<00:00:46.789> defined

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
basics the basic concepts are defined

and<00:00:50.539> draw<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.600> area<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.739> will<00:00:52.890> go<00:00:53.039> into<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.340> lot

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and draw the area we will go into a lot

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.279 
and draw the area we will go into a lot
more<00:00:53.699> detail<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.809> these<00:00:54.930> basic

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
more detail in all of these basic

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.290 
more detail in all of these basic
concepts<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.890> future<00:00:56.160> videos<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:56.910> right<00:00:57.120> now

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
concepts in future videos but right now

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.209 
concepts in future videos but right now
we<00:00:57.690> want<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.020> through<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.739> basics

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
we want to get through just the basics

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.299 
we want to get through just the basics
of<00:00:59.370> defining<00:01:00.359> an<00:01:00.570> area<00:01:00.829> establish<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> point<00:01:02.219> of

you want a calculation for it you have

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.330 
you want a calculation for it you have

that you have for that area so I'll take

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
calculation and place it as well and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.180 
calculation and place it as well and
that<00:03:06.180> completes<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:07.110> three<00:03:07.380> basic<00:03:07.769> concepts

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
that completes the three basic concepts

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.090

now again in future videos we will

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.460 
now again in future videos we will
expand<00:03:11.760> upon<00:03:12.030> these<00:03:12.239> basic<00:03:12.600> concepts<00:03:13.050> in<00:03:13.230> much

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
expand upon these basic concepts in much

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.590 
expand upon these basic concepts in much
more<00:03:13.680> detail<00:03:14.190> but<00:03:14.760> what<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:14.970> wanted<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.360> show

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
more detail but what I wanted to show

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.199 
more detail but what I wanted to show
you<00:03:15.630> here<00:03:16.110> was<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.860> without<00:03:17.459> clicking<00:03:18.000> a

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
you here was that without clicking a

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.420 
you here was that without clicking a
whole<00:03:18.390> lot<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:18.720> things<00:03:18.989> on<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.680> interface

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
whole lot of things on the interface

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.449 
whole lot of things on the interface
itself<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.570> can<00:03:21.750> get<00:03:21.870> started<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.590> complete

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
itself you can get started and complete

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.449 
itself you can get started and complete
your<00:03:23.730> areas<00:03:24.390> in<00:03:24.570> no<00:03:25.019> time<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.680> you'll<00:03:26.220> start

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
your areas in no time and you'll start

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.070 
your areas in no time and you'll start
to<00:03:26.610> realize<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.390> user<00:03:27.570> interface<00:03:28.050> that

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
to realize that the user interface that

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.229 
to realize that the user interface that
you<00:03:28.350> see<00:03:28.560> here<00:03:28.800> is<00:03:28.980> really<00:03:29.459> more<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.820> matter<00:03:30.090> of

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
you see here is really more a matter of

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.020 
you see here is really more a matter of
convenience<00:03:30.720> than<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.860> an<00:03:32.070> indication<00:03:32.790> of

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
convenience than it is an indication of

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.350 
convenience than it is an indication of
