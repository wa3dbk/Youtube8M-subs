00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.060
 and 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.670
 today, in contrast , we do not want 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.500
 miss the chance to talk to joao 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.120
 Barros the Portuguese driver who is one of 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.860
 the privileged in the peninsula 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 Iberian in being one of the first in 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.210
 try this r5 I imagine I do that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.370
 the sensations behind the wheel here in this 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.380
 rally and from viana do castelo are being 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.500
 at least different from what we are 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.770
 accustomed yes it was very different and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.170
 I am very happy and a fantastic car 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.900
 it's a thing of the other world I come from 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.080
 a car from a super club does not feel 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.290
 that there is a good car but I'm going to 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.350
 take it forward to change 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.510
 for the 42 drivers try to get closer 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.510
 to be next year's national champion 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.950
 i 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.570
 it's being one of the most cars 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.369
 desired at the level of the entire planet in 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.840
 Spain there are already several units that many 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.490
 pilots are going to use both the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.070
 championship of Spain and possibly in 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.690
 Galician, I imagine you're 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:22.570
 enjoying a lot and you only recommend 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:25.060
 to anybody yes no doubt it's a little 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.760
 expensive but worth it is a car 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.670
 new generation the classic to replace 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.580
 the remains of the 2000 so force 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.730
 It is not there to waste time and 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.700
 it makes things pretty serious and it's a 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.910
 evolution of 1600 turbo that give more is 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.260
 an exit of the cards went well very 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.790
 well you have to have a good 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.020
 budget but in any case a lot 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.730
 less like the perform if I'm going to apply 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.250
 that is same as the classroom words 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.720
 of a world rally car is for I think 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.420
 more by official teams 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.880
 it's like a way one that the whole engine 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.300
 the changes is all very different and that 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.400
 it is expensive to buy and to replace 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.110
 there is so much imported no it is not possible 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.860
 buy an egg to make that was not 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.690
 wet 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.960
 to make her reside is not so vulgar 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.850
 people who are national then 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.970
 I decided to buy the best and the best is 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.590
 best party over there and also 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.020
 other very good cars like the center 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.930
 in the weight but I think I'm 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.610
 better served when it was good a 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.440
 little differences between the super 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.790
 2000 and the world rally car with respect to 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.220
 this car that looks like it's going to come to 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.230
 replace those powerful if the great 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.620
 difference for a study without a doubt that 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.250
 is the engine the engine is a 1600 engine 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.800
 turbo as to this is a 2000 engine 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.890
 atoms federico which is an engine that is 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.230
 slower slower 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.350
 to rise of army of voting in 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.380
 about 1600 turbo that hits very nevertheless 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.300
 it's better to come out the shorts 16 is the 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.520
 big difference from one car to another 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.890
 He also assured that this new solution 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.100
 of cars has a new chassis more 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.430
 modern that a styling are 45 years old 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.760
 they are already a level of love sweats of 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.890
 jazz and own brakes so is a 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.750
 little later what do I know 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.670
 good and you think maybe that little bit 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.530
 cheaper than the world rally car can 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.510
 encourage other pilots to take over the 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.220
 maintenance is also cheaper and 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.360
 also equal to the brands that now 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.590
 brands have left a bit of the world of 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.820
 the rallies well to understand that 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.820
 come back there yes 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.080
 5 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.810
 many 30 of the fia the party for 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.050
 get to get us to have a 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:48.070
 car equal to citroÃ«n ford escort 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.440
 mobs or maybe vokswagen in that state 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.480
 they have to have exchange house of 5 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.030
 speed the engine has to have a 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.730
 32 writer there are quite a few things that 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.860
 are districts for changes not to be 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.990
 quite expensive and be more or less 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.510
 homogeneous price and it is very long 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.250
 in different and sure that this is more 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.620
 easy for a private pilot like me 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.480
 buy a car and I feel like I'm 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.310
 always updated and that there are no big 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.729
 changes of two months of motor chayo no 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.889
 it's like this we put a rival will be changed 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.449
 finally here, in reality, you are no longer 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.789
 as a zero car but I imagine that already 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.879
 thinking about the 2014 season that you're going to 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.740
 make music season tours too 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:30.259
 The main objective is the championship 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.330
 Portuguese national I'm sure I'll 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:34.430
 do also what Portuguese speaking goes 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.089
 to integrate that his the championship of 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.089
 radical world and with much pride and I 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:40.089
 I go 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.379
 visiting 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.219
 Well, you know that we are waiting for you with 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:56.930
 Open arms thank you very much 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:06:00.339
 for attending us and especially for giving 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.339
 show of this car
