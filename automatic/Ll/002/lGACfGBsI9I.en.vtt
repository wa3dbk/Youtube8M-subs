00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
not that good in coding although I

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
not that good in coding although I
studied<00:02:40.960> it<00:02:41.020> in<00:02:41.140> school<00:02:41.700> but<00:02:43.140> I'll<00:02:44.140> keep<00:02:44.380> my

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
checked them I can know it so don't

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.900

blame<00:02:52.930> me<00:02:53.290> for<00:02:53.320> that<00:02:53.620> guys<00:02:54.040> if<00:02:54.490> you<00:02:54.610> would<00:02:54.730> like

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
blame me for that guys if you would like

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.930 
blame me for that guys if you would like
to<00:02:54.940> check<00:02:55.270> them<00:02:55.420> out<00:02:55.570> just<00:02:56.410> go<00:02:56.620> ahead<00:02:56.740> but<00:02:57.190> make

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
to check them out just go ahead but make

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.500 
to check them out just go ahead but make
sure<00:02:58.200> actually<00:02:59.200> not<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.530> fuck<00:02:59.770> up<00:02:59.920> anything

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
sure actually not to fuck up anything

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.060 
sure actually not to fuck up anything
then<00:03:01.510> what<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:01.930> would<00:03:02.050> like<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.290> do<00:03:02.440> is<00:03:02.680> to

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
then what you would like to do is to

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.100 
then what you would like to do is to
open<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:03.460> iw<00:03:04.270> 5mp<00:03:05.140> underscore<00:03:05.620> server<00:03:05.920> and

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
open the iw 5mp underscore server and

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.260 
open the iw 5mp underscore server and
this<00:03:08.110> will<00:03:08.290> actually<00:03:09.420> enable<00:03:10.420> your<00:03:10.780> open<00:03:11.650> your

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
this will actually enable your open your

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.380 
this will actually enable your open your
yeah<00:03:13.270> your<00:03:13.780> dedicated<00:03:14.380> server<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:16.120> first

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
yeah your dedicated server the first

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.870 
yeah your dedicated server the first
thing<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:16.750> would<00:03:16.810> like<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.140> type<00:03:17.500> in<00:03:17.920> is<00:03:18.130> SV

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
thing you would like to type in is SV

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.530 
thing you would like to type in is SV
map<00:03:19.210> rotation<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.080> this<00:03:21.070> will<00:03:21.540> actually

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
map rotation and this will actually

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.810 
map rotation and this will actually
enable<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.350> map<00:03:23.530> rotation<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:24.280> then<00:03:24.550> you

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
enable the map rotation and then you

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.750 
enable the map rotation and then you
should<00:03:24.880> start<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.630> by<00:03:25.870> predation<00:03:26.290> by

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
should start the by predation by

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.590 
should start the by predation by
inserting<00:03:28.050> start<00:03:29.050> bone<00:03:29.970> underscore<00:03:32.550> map

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
inserting start bone underscore map

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.770 
inserting start bone underscore map
underscore<00:03:34.600> rotate<00:03:36.330> this<00:03:37.330> will<00:03:37.510> actually

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
underscore rotate this will actually

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.630 
underscore rotate this will actually
make<00:03:37.990> your<00:03:38.140> server<00:03:38.410> go<00:03:38.770> and<00:03:39.010> rotate<00:03:39.550> start<00:03:40.480> the

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
make your server go and rotate start the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.820 
make your server go and rotate start the
rotation<00:03:42.870> if<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:44.050> would<00:03:44.170> like<00:03:44.320> to<00:03:44.470> check<00:03:44.650> your

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
rotation if you would like to check your

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.480 
rotation if you would like to check your
hostname<00:03:45.190> just<00:03:45.610> type<00:03:45.790> in<00:03:46.000> sv<00:03:46.600> underscore

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
hostname just type in sv underscore

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.820 
hostname just type in sv underscore
hostname<00:03:48.490> and<00:03:48.750> as<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:49.840> can<00:03:49.930> see<00:03:49.990> export

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
hostname and as you can see export

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.670 
hostname and as you can see export
servers<00:03:51.250> but<00:03:51.520> you<00:03:51.670> can<00:03:51.790> also<00:03:52.030> edit<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.630> here<00:03:52.959> by

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
servers but you can also edit it here by

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.910 
servers but you can also edit it here by
doing<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.190> set<00:03:55.440> sv<00:03:57.180> underscore<00:03:58.180> hostname<00:03:58.920> like

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
doing a set sv underscore hostname like

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.620 
doing a set sv underscore hostname like
just<00:04:00.880> randomly<00:04:01.660> exports<00:04:03.240> okay<00:04:04.240> there<00:04:04.480> we<00:04:04.600> go

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
just randomly exports okay there we go

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.290 
just randomly exports okay there we go
if<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:05.560> want<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:05.800> check<00:04:06.250> if<00:04:06.430> it's<00:04:06.580> done

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
if you want to check if it's done

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.560 
if you want to check if it's done
correctly<00:04:07.680> type<00:04:08.680> in<00:04:09.010> sv<00:04:09.550> underscore<00:04:10.060> hostname

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
correctly type in sv underscore hostname

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.910 
correctly type in sv underscore hostname
and<00:04:11.020> there<00:04:11.740> it<00:04:11.860> is<00:04:11.950> exports<00:04:13.260> now<00:04:14.260> if<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:14.830> would

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920

I don't know which one this is but let's

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.409 
I don't know which one this is but let's
go<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:35.990> alpha<00:04:36.560> guess<00:04:37.040> I<00:04:37.370> know<00:04:37.520> which<00:04:37.970> this<00:04:38.210> one

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
go to alpha guess I know which this one

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.750 
go to alpha guess I know which this one
is<00:04:38.450> it's<00:04:38.780> lockdown<00:04:39.940> so<00:04:41.410> spawning<00:04:42.410> map<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:43.100> be

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
is it's lockdown so spawning map and be

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.490 
is it's lockdown so spawning map and be
alpha<00:04:44.389> now<00:04:45.290> let's<00:04:46.010> go<00:04:46.639> open<00:04:47.600> my<00:04:47.630> game<00:04:48.050> as<00:04:48.260> you

alpha now let's go open my game as you

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.220 
alpha now let's go open my game as you
can<00:04:48.620> see<00:04:48.800> there<00:04:49.010> isn't<00:04:49.220> any<00:04:49.550> kind<00:04:49.820> of<00:04:50.230> server

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
can see there isn't any kind of server

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.590 
can see there isn't any kind of server
here<00:04:51.680> so<00:04:51.950> let's<00:04:52.190> go<00:04:52.340> to<00:04:52.400> options<00:04:52.850> I<00:04:53.030> get<00:04:53.240> server
