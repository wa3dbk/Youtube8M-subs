00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.410
 a Kondo is 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.410
 It's a shuttle 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:23.820
 Oh, this car is different from the initial type of bezel 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:26.210
 It is to say that either would do copper ride by amplitude sensitive warm pants 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.210
 It is after maturing 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.210
 Hmm 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:38.950
 Well then this so-called perfect so-called 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:45.200
 Well in the countryside after a high water supply construction work 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:48.530
 I think that picking up normally Well clattering clattering with respect to step 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:56.739
 I wonder what a woman is this this 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.739
 I think the place I mean become to whether the number play is suppressed in the uncomfortable level 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.020
 I wonder how 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.020
 I thought I was changing more 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.750
 I Te won N'that normally won 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.180
 Say you ne 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.180
 How is this ? 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.680
 What used to 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.680
 It would lose only a little 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.180
 How about 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.780
 Well tires 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.780
 8 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:47.289
 So-called difficult save that 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:51.250
 I'm not lost in the blue I do not know how great 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.250
 What is it? 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.299
 Oh What about Do Well 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.860
 Is the size of the tire the same 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.860
 It is a 16 inch wheel 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.020
 I said something good saying 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.330
 Naa I thought the kana really to say 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.330
 Is it because after taking the regent 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.360
 It is also normal that it is normal 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.360
 I think Kotonan that the bezel was usually 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.520
 While the road is normally picked up by men normally, Yayoi also min 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.500
 This is 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.500
 I'm sorry I said the same thing over and over again 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.340
 I think it's an offensive level or something normal 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.110
 Good even Oh 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.110
 It may be because of a little mind 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.330
 that 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.540
 Of course compared with the bezel initial type 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.740
 this 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:19.080
 Feeling that gear goes up 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:22.360
 After all it becomes quite smooth 8 my own now Yu Ishii also the latest thing 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:27.070
 You'd have your rack by update 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.000
 Even so, there are times when it will be effective on the way 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:33.660
 Oh dear 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.660
 I 'm just going around the dealer right now and I can't say 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.129
 Maybe not 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.740
 It 's exterior 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.740
 After all recent Honda this 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.610
 Plasticy patient 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.610
 Well, it's still the same 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.620
 Over there is the texture I do not might be better of the bezel 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.560
 Oh 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.560
 It feels like a good version of Lafitte 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.970
 that's all
