00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.090
 this is important it is very important 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.049
 abba abacha because people 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.880
 think it's a babble 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.490
 buys a dojo but if it takes some 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.990
 place as long as we have shows it takes 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.580
 the height place why because 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.080
 the cat is in the center of the pyramid 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.990
 had told himself that there was as much 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.430
 from predators to seduce that 2 3 so 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.199
 for that reason he's going to want to be the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.050
 higher in height to be able to 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.420
 see the most his environment a 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.680
 monitored either to counter the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.899
 predators who are coming where for 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.020
 sporting 3 that would come so that's 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.219
 really important to have the height and 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.360
 it's even more important when 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.489
 we have several shows like that 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.840
 when it just happened 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.700
 it's so rare that it happens here it's 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.190
 that my dominant territorial who and 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.140
 keira wanted to have the treat then she 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.460
 make it clear to you who I think 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.379
 that seen but I did not intervene 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.940
 that's very important to the president 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.309
 people at home with this kind of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.290
 situation there is doing shows well 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.850
 to serve in big battle is different 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.409
 thing but at this game the little shots of 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.000
 bins tomorrow why do not you 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.799
 intervene because it's a genre 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.490
 of contract that things are in the process 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.439
 to settle 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.450
 she is saying ah yes that 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.600
 this is my tablet at this moment of the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.240
 day in this room there and the more 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.850
 control a clear between shows - goes 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.500
 to have arguments we can do the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.720
 link with just abrasion because 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.409
 the warmer tree the higher it is the higher 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.390
 normally 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.450
 the show that is important to him 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.310
 to be tall will want to have the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.909
 bigger height but if we do not have 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.960
 enough height 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.250
 what happens to me is that the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.520
 camels sign themselves to have it's 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.170
 total so having a lot of as much 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.390
 different with the major arts but we 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.009
 allows everyone to have his level of 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.760
 to be able to monitor his territory as 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.830
 they want 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.360
 and that lowers the anxiety level of 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.620
 all the shows in the house because 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.120
 everyone is able to feel 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.130
 safe then calm down 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.200
 there are three qualities to subscribers the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.810
 first is his supposed to represent 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.480
 a tree we get along both of us can am 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.740
 it's relatively solid it's the 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.210
 first quality of a tree is that it 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.760
 has to be strong because if the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.170
 show this meaning that it's too shaking 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.280
 he would not want to ride because he 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.010
 would not feel safe 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.370
 the second is the said santos and 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.020
 height over there brasov white little over the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.430
 choice is going to have a good view on her 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.870
 environment that will feel comfortable 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.360
 to monitor his environment 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.790
 and after that people ask me 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.000
 tpiy of the equipment says it does not matter 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.190
 it's hot it does not bother him at all 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.800
 size of tablets at a good 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.600
 importance and often the fields is a 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.400
 little surrounded it is necessary that a tale and 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.620
 tablets with little robots or 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.820
 captions gets macaron on chains 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.040
 bouchard because they are capable 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.020
 to go can not lie is located in a 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.640
 kind of small rim here a beautiful borer 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.100
 sure because she feels a little 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.660
 little surrounded it's not all the shocks that 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.950
 will want to ride on the trees h 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.720
 but who will see the first time this 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.670
 we can do to encourage them to 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.800
 go up we see it with the treat we put 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.780
 treats little grass ripped off too 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.280
 be called stimulate a little bit go to 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.470
 get excited then something from the 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.540
 melt on it but the location of 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.570
 lambrecht and will take the most 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.489
 important against a good location 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.010
 of hot trees it was said that it is for 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.900
 monitor the territory 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.790
 and that means just about everything 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.280
 world have a warm place at home 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.360
 the kitchen table and a lot of people 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.220
 who ask me how am I doing for 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.980
 that my dear my record on the table 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.170
 I have a super easy trick let them 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.250
 aisles on the table one is distant 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.900
 hockey what's important for the 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.489
 choice at the level of the cat trees is 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.500
 to be able to monitor your environment 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.690
 gold in our Quebec houses the cab 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.670
 is often super well placed so saw 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.620
 on the kitchen the living room the most at the 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.109
 back to the stairs so it's a 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.609
 natural cat tree the show is in 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.769
 height more monitored his environment 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.909
 on several pieces for me what I 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.739
 know it's often tell people it says 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.870
 why not let things go 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.489
 on the table when you neither eat skin 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.409
 because we are able to learn at 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.049
 show not to climb on the table 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.700
 while you eat there you just have to 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.819
 more interesting thing is happening 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.810
 on the floor on the table so what I 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.870
 want to do is I'm going to train 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.819
 my show with grids to say if you 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.769
 remains often beautiful treats 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.629
 simon on the table i 'm just the 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.519
 take it I do not punish it I take it I 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.799
 had it on the floor and then once 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.729
 I see that there is the idea is no longer 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.560
 get on the table 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.269
 I would like us to think of his freelance 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.970
 let's wear at the beginning it's worth a lot 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.620
 Curator many small little something 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.190
 quarter of treats it's a piracy 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.110
 the same 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.820
 ok we can only our choice of just 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.560
 so we take riders scratching bodies 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.180
 not become batteries one belongs 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.590
 at the beginning a lot of battery 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.060
 but as our show progresses 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.979
 begins to understand that if they remain 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.960
 on the ground you have to have treats 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.460
 is there a little bit of ground that will 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.860
 quietly not fast 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.539
 ok then a certain moment given after 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.460
 a few weeks we will be able to 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.229
 leningrad at the beginning 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.419
 wait wait wait a cave 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.430
 on the menu a treat at the end of the show goes 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.080
 tend to what is going to end up 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.699
 have his flu someone going up on 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.699
 the table does not exist
