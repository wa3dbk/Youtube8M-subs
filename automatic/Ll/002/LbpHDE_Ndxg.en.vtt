00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
a remarkable history it was built for

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.500 
a remarkable history it was built for
the<00:00:19.410> furnace<00:00:19.770> railway<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.100> 1863<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.240> in

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the furnace railway in 1863 and in

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.650 
the furnace railway in 1863 and in
August<00:00:21.869> 1863<00:00:22.830> was<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.460> prime<00:00:23.730> locomotive<00:00:24.480> it

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
August 1863 was the prime locomotive it

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.380 
August 1863 was the prime locomotive it
was<00:00:24.779> number<00:00:25.050> 20<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.680> was<00:00:25.890> their<00:00:26.880> latest

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
was number 20 it was their latest

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.540 
was number 20 it was their latest
locomotive<00:00:28.019> but<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.560> only<00:00:28.680> lasted<00:00:29.220> seven

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
locomotive but it only lasted seven

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.580

years<00:00:29.730> with<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.000> furnace<00:00:30.300> railway<00:00:30.630> mainly

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
years with the furnace railway mainly

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.380 
years with the furnace railway mainly
because<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.460> probably<00:00:32.640> obsolete<00:00:33.149> when<00:00:33.300> it

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
because it was probably obsolete when it

been built as a mobile phone jog you

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.990 
been built as a mobile phone jog you
know<00:05:09.289> we've<00:05:09.440> kept<00:05:09.710> this<00:05:09.860> as<00:05:10.070> close<00:05:10.699> as

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
know we've kept this as close as

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.659 
know we've kept this as close as
possible<00:05:11.410> as<00:05:12.410> we<00:05:12.650> could<00:05:12.889> tip<00:05:13.220> to<00:05:13.370> how<00:05:13.490> it<00:05:13.550> was

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
possible as we could tip to how it was

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.790 
possible as we could tip to how it was

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
built so very few modifications you

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.740 
built so very few modifications you
might<00:05:16.010> say<00:05:16.280> we've<00:05:16.520> that<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.180> idea<00:05:17.539> has<00:05:17.720> been

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
might say we've that the idea has been

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.649 
might say we've that the idea has been
to<00:05:18.199> portray<00:05:18.680> a<00:05:18.710> locomotive<00:05:19.430> as<00:05:19.610> it<00:05:19.760> was<00:05:19.940> and

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
to portray a locomotive as it was and

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:34.690 
to portray a locomotive as it was and
when<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:20.930> was<00:05:21.050> built<00:05:21.080> in<00:05:21.380> 1863<00:05:22.070> I'm<00:05:22.520> sorry
