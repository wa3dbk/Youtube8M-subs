00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:22.460
 Thank you. 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.450
 I'm going to make a mini horse 2 horse today. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:38.309
 I bought it after it was so thin and showed the tree. 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.550
 Make one with this and make one more with the ice cream bar 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.550
 It is. 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.430
 First, properly weighed the size using a knife and then knife in my first certificate 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.630
 Please. 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:58.550
 Please break it. 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.550
 Then , using a pencil and a pencil , draw a shape of two hairs on the tree. 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:11.130
 I've drawn it like this. 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.049
 The ice cream bar also has a sheath 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.049
 Let's get the blocks ready. 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:24.479
 Please draw a chopping board. 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.479
 Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.760
 Oh, I'm going to cut the big piece first with the nipper. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.790
 First cut it in the collar and then 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.790
 U 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.870
 Cut the new part to the side of the tree. 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.180
 woo 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.040
 I also cut ice cream bars in the same way 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.490
 I did not do everything to you this way . 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:12.259
 Now you're gonna tidy it up. 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.259
 I will change it to the shape I painted. 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.350
 Make the corners round. 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.350
 U 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.350
 U 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.200
 Please trim the angled part a little. 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.010
 Now I'm going to make a hole in the handle. 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:46.900
 I gave him a year to use the grinder in this 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.900
 If you do not have a grinder, just use the handle and use it . 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.540
 222 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.730
 I punched this hole together so neat. 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:06.569
 Now, I'm going to put the tickets together. 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.569
 Refine the whole with fine sandpaper 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.090
 aa 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:22.930
 Now you can use the knife to make detail on the board. 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:26.670
 Side border seeping inwardly-mi d 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.670

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.810
 Now make a knife on the board. 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:54.019
 It'll paint the color. 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:59.620
 I blended a little yellow acrylic paint on the stain and gave it a color. 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.620
 Let's do it a little after the event. 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.280
 After it is completely dry, apply it once more thoroughly. 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.310
 U 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:29.200
 Now, let's get into the military squad first so I can feel a little more natural. 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.200
 Please apply. 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.600
 Finish with a clean brush . 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:47.350
