combat<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.860> obviously<00:02:29.459> gonna<00:02:29.700> take

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
combat so that is obviously gonna take

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.850 
out my polygon z but i think it's not a
great<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:33.390> deal<00:02:33.599> for<00:02:33.900> me<00:02:34.049> but<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.709> actually

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
great of a deal for me but it actually

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.009 
great of a deal for me but it actually
is<00:02:35.220> cuz<00:02:35.459> my<00:02:35.610> porygon<00:02:35.970> z<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.450> my<00:02:36.599> awesome

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019

dragon<00:03:00.629> dances<00:03:01.049> but<00:03:01.260> fire<00:03:01.650> punch<00:03:01.950> doesn't<00:03:02.790> did

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
dragon dances but fire punch doesn't did

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.140 
dragon dances but fire punch doesn't did
did<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.930> does<00:03:04.140> actually<00:03:04.410> nothing<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.849> that's

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
did it does actually nothing so that's

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.349 
did it does actually nothing so that's
rather<00:03:06.420> gay<00:03:06.810> but<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.889> just<00:03:08.459> wanted<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.060> get<00:03:09.209> the

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
rather gay but I just wanted to get the

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.690 
rather gay but I just wanted to get the
burn<00:03:09.599> hacks<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.560> would<00:03:10.799> be<00:03:10.980> really<00:03:11.400> useful

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
burn hacks so it would be really useful

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.199 
burn hacks so it would be really useful
for<00:03:12.269> me<00:03:12.420> butts<00:03:13.230> on<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.680> second<00:03:14.549> time<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:14.819> don't

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
for me butts on the second time I don't

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.940 
for me butts on the second time I don't
get<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.840> think<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.380> would<00:03:16.590> be<00:03:16.620> rather

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
get it so I think it would be rather

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.430 
get it so I think it would be rather
useless<00:03:17.609> and<00:03:17.970> now<00:03:18.660> he<00:03:18.720> goes<00:03:19.049> for<00:03:19.380> the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
useless and now he goes for the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.879 
useless and now he goes for the
waterfall<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:21.139> that's<00:03:22.139> obviously<00:03:22.319> gonna

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
waterfall and that's obviously gonna

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.039 
waterfall and that's obviously gonna
take<00:03:23.190> my<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.549> take<00:03:23.790> out<00:03:23.940> my<00:03:23.970> anger<00:03:24.120> because<00:03:24.780> he's

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
take my I take out my anger because he's

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.159 
take my I take out my anger because he's
a<00:03:25.079> really<00:03:25.530> known<00:03:26.400> defensive<00:03:27.000> thing<00:03:27.239> so<00:03:27.989> now<00:03:28.139> I

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
because his rather in in the fatigue a

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.279 
because his rather in in the fatigue a
fatigue<00:04:20.759> so<00:04:21.759> but<00:04:22.330> he<00:04:22.630> is<00:04:22.690> hurt<00:04:23.020> in<00:04:23.199> his

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
fatigue so but he is hurt in his

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.650 
fatigue so but he is hurt in his
confusion<00:04:23.770> so<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.250> think<00:04:24.639> it<00:04:24.850> paybacks<00:04:25.360> the

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
confusion so I think it paybacks the

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.529 
confusion so I think it paybacks the
crit<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.370> but<00:04:27.370> my<00:04:27.729> steelix<00:04:28.120> is<00:04:28.330> rather

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
crit and but my steelix is rather

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.430 
crit and but my steelix is rather
useless<00:04:28.990> now<00:04:29.320> with<00:04:29.560> such<00:04:30.150> help<00:04:31.259> so<00:04:32.259> now<00:04:32.380> he

for<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:28.720> extreme<00:05:29.199> speed<00:05:29.500> maybe<00:05:30.430> for<00:05:31.320> praying

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
for the extreme speed maybe for praying

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.219 
for the extreme speed maybe for praying
for<00:05:32.440> a<00:05:32.650> crit<00:05:33.010> or<00:05:33.280> something<00:05:34.150> I<00:05:34.270> don't<00:05:34.330> know<00:05:34.510> but

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
for a crit or something I don't know but

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.409 
for a crit or something I don't know but
he<00:05:35.470> doesn't<00:05:35.620> get<00:05:35.949> it<00:05:36.190> and<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.729> the<00:05:37.060> extreme

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
he doesn't get it and the the extreme

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.719 
he doesn't get it and the the extreme
speed<00:05:37.630> doesn't<00:05:37.900> do<00:05:38.199> a<00:05:38.229> lot<00:05:38.380> to<00:05:38.770> me<00:05:38.800> so<00:05:39.190> I<00:05:39.220> finish

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
speed doesn't do a lot to me so I finish

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.779 
speed doesn't do a lot to me so I finish
it<00:05:39.849> off<00:05:40.000> with<00:05:40.030> them<00:05:40.449> and<00:05:40.720> thunderbolt<00:05:41.650> and<00:05:41.889> now

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
it off with them and thunderbolt and now

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.270 
it off with them and thunderbolt and now
actually<00:05:43.330> I<00:05:43.389> have<00:05:43.630> a<00:05:43.659> plan<00:05:43.990> with<00:05:44.560> his<00:05:44.860> um

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.939 

gengar<00:05:48.280> I<00:05:48.539> think<00:05:49.539> he's<00:05:49.780> going<00:05:50.050> to<00:05:50.169> predict<00:05:50.710> my

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
gengar I think he's going to predict my

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.860 
gengar I think he's going to predict my
sub<00:05:51.370> because<00:05:51.699> I<00:05:51.820> know<00:05:51.880> his<00:05:52.240> ganger<00:05:52.539> has

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
sub because I know his ganger has

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.830 
sub because I know his ganger has
explosion<00:05:53.740> and<00:05:53.919> to<00:05:54.729> go<00:05:54.909> for<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.180> Shadow<00:05:55.539> Ball

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
explosion and to go for the Shadow Ball

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.100 
explosion and to go for the Shadow Ball
but<00:05:56.530> and<00:05:57.250> I<00:05:57.430> go<00:05:57.610> for<00:05:57.820> the<00:05:57.849> Thunderbolt<00:05:58.570> but<00:05:58.810> he

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
but and I go for the Thunderbolt but he

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.020 
but and I go for the Thunderbolt but he
actually<00:05:59.229> doesn't<00:05:59.650> predict<00:06:00.099> anything<00:06:00.400> he

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
actually doesn't predict anything he

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.969 
actually doesn't predict anything he
goes<00:06:01.270> for<00:06:01.599> the<00:06:01.750> explosion<00:06:02.169> kills<00:06:02.620> of<00:06:02.800> my

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979 
goes for the explosion kills of my

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.360
