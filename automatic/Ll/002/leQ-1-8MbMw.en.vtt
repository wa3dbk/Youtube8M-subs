 center 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.290
 anp 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.290
 to avoid 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450
 that was it 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.740
 the piece goes 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.740

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.070

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.350
 because 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.190
 the case 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.190

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.959
 8 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.759
 the 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.569
 totally agree 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.319

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.669

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:20.449
 it is a 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.449
 per hour 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.629
 the terrain 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.849
 It's really unfortunate 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.989
 already during the morning rush hour 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.639
 commodity prices

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.889
 since years 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:49.900
 you have misrata 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.180
 In addition 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.529
 nothing wrong with it 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:55.529
 then we'll see 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:58.009
