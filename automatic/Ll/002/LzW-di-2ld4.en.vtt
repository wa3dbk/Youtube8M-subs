00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.700
 two 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.210
 or 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.210
 ah 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.059
 André Uribe is going to prepare vegetables 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.689
 to the wok 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.420
 remember to always warm your wok before 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:21.150
 of adding oil and vegetables 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.970
 let's go with the ingredients 4 units 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.460
 of mushrooms cut in rooms 80 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.860
 grams of green zucchini 8 units of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.980
 cherry tomatoes 40 milliliters of wine 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.469
 white sunflower oil salt and pepper 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.310
 well then look what I have since 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.400
 I have a long time ago 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.680
 a wok warming up if there's already a lot 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.570
 temperature now then I'm going to change 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.100
 from olive oil to oil 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.560
 sunflower but look at it has some 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.760
 garlic cloves can not get here 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.760
 down or aromatic herbs 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.710
 through the walls of the wok 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.710
 and 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.130
 we add the mushrooms what I'm going to 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.770
 show is already going to be like 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.390
 time to turn 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.390
 or shake a little 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:19.950
 look here I will show the color that I 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.950
 I want to achieve with these mushrooms 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.280
 ready 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.780
 then as I had told you right now 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.060
 I'm going to set aside 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.860
 because why do I do that because if I 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.810
 added another ingredient begin to 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.280
 drop liquids 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.650
 then one more time Flavored 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.820
 with garlic oil 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.820
 As already taken temperature we add 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.820
 zucchini 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.390
 in this case I'm going to add I already know what 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.390
 they are the cherry tomatoes 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.149
 carve what I'm going to wait for it to 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.460
 install when they like it 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.910
 burst and so they are removed immediately 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.910
 of the game 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.069
 then already if it's time to 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.069
 add a little pepper 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.120
 a little bit of salt 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.770
 we are mixing 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.769
 let's incorporate now if the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.769
 mushrooms 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.730
 and we add a little white wine 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.250
 we let it evaporate and there was also 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.340
 said that we are going to add a bit of 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.960
 oregano the aromatic herb that you 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.000
 you want to add there is no problem with 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.210
 that 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.460
 this is a side dish an accompaniment 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.990
 for a dish 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.300
 then I remind you from the beginning 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.880
 let's add then a bit of 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.860
 sunflower oil to a very hot wok 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.620
 The first thing we are going to do is add 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.330
 some mushrooms cut in quarters 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.520
 we move them a lot so that they get brown 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.520
 after they are browned we reserve them 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.709
 apart in the same pan or wok we are going to 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.140
 add a little more oil let's 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.500
 saute what are the zucchini 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.200
 green then we add the same 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.930
 cherry tomatoes we incorporate again the 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.810
 mushrooms season with salt pepper 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.680
 a little white wine and oregano and 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.680
 we are ready 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.300
 gather the family around a good 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.550
 wok is a wonder I recommend them 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.300
