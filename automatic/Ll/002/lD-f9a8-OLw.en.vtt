00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.200 
I'm going to pour that into the sprayer
I<00:02:42.610> mean<00:02:42.880> into<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.180> bucket

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
I mean into the bucket

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.550 
I mean into the bucket
you<00:02:46.210> don't<00:02:46.420> want<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:46.630> mix<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.960> in<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.260> sprayer

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
you don't want to mix it in the sprayer

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.190 
you don't want to mix it in the sprayer
because<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:49.150> is<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:49.540> thick<00:02:49.840> it's<00:02:50.020> very

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
because it is so thick it's very

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.440 
because it is so thick it's very
difficult<00:02:50.740> to<00:02:50.920> get<00:02:51.070> going<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.850> solution<00:02:52.330> when

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
difficult to get going the solution when

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.660 
difficult to get going the solution when
it's<00:02:52.570> inside<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.960> sprayer<00:02:59.250> equal<00:03:00.250> parts<00:03:00.580> of

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
it's inside the sprayer equal parts of

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:17.500 
it's inside the sprayer equal parts of
water<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:03.100> then<00:03:03.280> take<00:03:03.520> your<00:03:03.670> drill

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.229 

okay<00:03:18.510> now<00:03:19.129> once<00:03:20.129> it's<00:03:20.310> mixed<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.819> bore<00:03:21.030> care

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
okay now once it's mixed the bore care

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.690 
okay now once it's mixed the bore care
actually<00:03:21.420> goes<00:03:21.750> into<00:03:21.900> solution<00:03:22.430> it's<00:03:23.430> very

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
actually goes into solution it's very

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.569 
actually goes into solution it's very
much<00:03:23.849> like<00:03:23.879> mixing<00:03:24.420> sugar<00:03:24.629> and<00:03:24.870> water<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:25.319> just

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
much like mixing sugar and water it just

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.000 
much like mixing sugar and water it just
totally<00:03:26.579> goes<00:03:26.969> into<00:03:27.209> solution<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:27.980> after<00:03:28.980> a

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
totally goes into solution so after a

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.229 
totally goes into solution so after a
few<00:03:29.189> minutes<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.489> mixing<00:03:29.849> you'll<00:03:29.969> have<00:03:30.120> this

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
few minutes of mixing you'll have this

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.220 
few minutes of mixing you'll have this
into<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.510> nice<00:03:30.769> watery<00:03:31.769> like<00:03:32.030> spray<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.390> when

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
into a nice watery like spray and when

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.559 
into a nice watery like spray and when
you<00:03:34.319> go<00:03:34.439> to<00:03:34.500> apply<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.670> should<00:03:36.000> apply<00:03:36.209> just

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
you go to apply it it should apply just

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.649 
you go to apply it it should apply just
like<00:03:36.720> you're<00:03:36.930> spraying<00:03:37.200> on<00:03:37.379> water<00:03:38.420> okay<00:03:39.420> once

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
like you're spraying on water okay once

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.119 
like you're spraying on water okay once
you've<00:03:39.810> got<00:03:39.989> your<00:03:40.200> boy<00:03:40.349> here<00:03:40.620> completely<00:03:41.040> in

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
you've got your boy here completely in

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.970 
you've got your boy here completely in
the<00:03:41.189> solution<00:03:41.670> now<00:03:42.450> you're<00:03:42.599> in<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.290> position<00:03:43.470> to

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
the solution now you're in a position to

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.879 
the solution now you're in a position to
pour<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.819> into<00:03:45.030> your<00:03:45.120> sprayer<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:46.709> not

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
pour that into your sprayer and not

pour that into your sprayer and not
worry<00:03:47.129> about<00:03:47.219> a<00:03:47.400> clogging<00:03:47.909> up<00:03:48.000> your<00:03:48.180> sprayer

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:01.159 

and<00:03:55.919> I<00:03:56.930> like<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.019> use<00:03:58.169> a<00:03:58.200> fan<00:03:58.560> tip<00:03:59.480> sprayer<00:04:00.480> just

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
and I like to use a fan tip sprayer just

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:02.270 
and I like to use a fan tip sprayer just
because<00:04:01.379> it<00:04:01.500> gives<00:04:01.590> me<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:01.769> nice<00:04:01.859> even

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
because it gives me a nice even

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.379 
because it gives me a nice even
application<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:04.189> also<00:04:05.189> just<00:04:05.340> one<00:04:05.519> note<00:04:05.730> when

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
application and also just one note when

down so that the handles down and this
parts<00:04:09.689> not<00:04:09.750> touching<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:10.200> ground<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:11.370> can

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
parts not touching the ground you can

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.159 
parts not touching the ground you can
pick<00:04:11.669> up<00:04:11.819> stuff<00:04:12.180> like<00:04:12.269> grass<00:04:12.599> clippings<00:04:13.079> and

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
such dirt and that will eventually clog

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.900 
such dirt and that will eventually clog
up<00:04:15.810> your<00:04:15.870> sprayers<00:04:16.229> to<00:04:16.470> try<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:16.709> always<00:04:17.009> pay
