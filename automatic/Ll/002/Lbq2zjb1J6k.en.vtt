bigger balloon that was some like 90,000

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.060 
bigger balloon that was some like 90,000
cubic<00:01:27.630> feet<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> really<00:01:28.530> really<00:01:28.770> small

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
cubic feet this is a really really small

cubic feet this is a really really small
balloon<00:01:29.329> 37,000<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:31.350> put<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> into

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
balloon 37,000 and to put it into

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.130 
balloon 37,000 and to put it into
context<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:33.299> could<00:01:33.420> actually<00:01:33.570> fly<00:01:34.079> this

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.289 
balloon in Branson's Bloom when he tried
the<00:01:37.409> Atlantic<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.100> very<00:01:38.189> very<00:01:38.460> small<00:01:38.759> so

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the Atlantic so it's very very small so

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.380 
the Atlantic so it's very very small so
I<00:01:39.780> will<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.200> at<00:01:40.500> much<00:01:40.799> lower<00:01:41.009> levels<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.790> in

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
I will be at much lower levels in in

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.840 
I will be at much lower levels in in
some<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> weather<00:01:43.399> and<00:01:44.399> because<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.790> a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
some of the weather and because it's a

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.910

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
a very special answer for that one

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.190 
a very special answer for that one
really<00:01:55.140> don't<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.500> well<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:56.729> small

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
really don't you well it's so small

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.830 
really don't you well it's so small
there's<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.290> little<00:01:58.469> cat<00:01:58.710> flap<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.070> opens<00:01:59.840> up

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
there's a little cat flap that opens up

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.230 
there's a little cat flap that opens up
on<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.530> side<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.610> actually<00:02:02.729> put<00:02:03.090> my

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
on the side so I can actually put my

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.480 
on the side so I can actually put my
legs<00:02:03.479> down<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.229> stretch<00:02:04.439> out<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:04.979> and

cat<00:02:05.969> napping<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.450> really<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.140> operative<00:02:07.680> word

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
cat napping is really the operative word

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.949 
cat napping is really the operative word
because<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.220> only<00:02:08.459> get<00:02:08.640> probably<00:02:09.360> an<00:02:09.629> hour<00:02:09.780> at

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
because you only get probably an hour at

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.559 
because you only get probably an hour at
a<00:02:10.080> time<00:02:10.110> at<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.739> most<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.280> if<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.120> can<00:02:12.270> get<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.510> a

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
a time at the most so if I can get to a

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.880 
a time at the most so if I can get to a
three<00:02:12.750> hour<00:02:12.840> sleep<00:02:13.140> in

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
three hour sleep in

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.890 
three hour sleep in

they'll be lucky aren't you something of
a<00:02:15.990> somnambulist<00:02:16.740> actually<00:02:17.430> didn't<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.760> want

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
a somnambulist actually didn't you want

to<00:02:18.090> nearly<00:02:18.240> climb<00:02:18.660> out<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.110> balloon<00:02:19.290> half

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
to nearly climb out of a balloon half

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.820 
to nearly climb out of a balloon half
asleep<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:21.450> was<00:02:21.600> after<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:22.050> six-day<00:02:22.380> flight

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
asleep that was after a six-day flight

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.600 
asleep that was after a six-day flight
and<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.430> was<00:02:23.640> yes<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.450> nearly<00:02:24.690> did<00:02:25.400> crawl<00:02:26.400> out

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
and that was yes I nearly did crawl out

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.150 
and that was yes I nearly did crawl out
but<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:27.000> time<00:02:27.210> I<00:02:27.240> got<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> pretty<00:02:27.720> good

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
but this time I got a pretty good

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.380 
but this time I got a pretty good
harness<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:29.430> hopefully<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.060> won't<00:02:30.150> happen

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
harness so hopefully that won't happen

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.330 
harness so hopefully that won't happen
