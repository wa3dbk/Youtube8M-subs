00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.439
 yes with these moving trains I want 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.170
 start this sequence or this special 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.560
 then follow the on and off 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.210
 for I now out my system and that 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.360
 I always want to be like that 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.600
 tell how I did what it was 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.629
 bring and just a little bit 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.040
 time how that works and now while learning 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.110
 at the first episode I have too 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.719
 have not shown how the drive trains 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.219
 although she could drive but there 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.040
 are not they driving there was such a 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.600
 bit dirty the tracks and now 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.850
 I also show that it works and 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.840
 yes , I had that on and 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.009
 take off and that is what it is 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.690
 It said there I am with a digital driver 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.789
 and several types on one of these 1 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.460
 even though they stretch two of them 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.420
 but now as a single track 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.119
 I would like to drive around it perfectly 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.880
 in the station now are good that the 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.030
 cleaning train of the old cars now before 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.380
 I have to stop very much 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:34.280
 much more at the mur team settle out of rum 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:38.229
 and that 's just the problem that that 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.439
 actually quite elaborate is there 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.960
 some even lure you in 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.909
 programmed spout have this 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.090
 spout has the consequence that here one 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.060
 walk a bit further and so mostly 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.369
 if you think you are standing right 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.460
 still here in the example next 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.790
 to roll on the railway crossing and 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.820
 that's not what we want 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.649
 so that it looks realistic and so 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.909
 I have to do so much 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.130
 me what synonymous an analog technology 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.570
 actually very common to one 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.340
 rail built 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.799
 on the one hand in poland one just 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.079
 can turn off so no current flows 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.910
 if the negative pole is not connected 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:23.280
 and we are with help 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.580
 there was a fail turn 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.390
 caused flow to flow or not 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.700
 and so then just one 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.350
 interruption in the rail and this 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.730
 interruption I do with the help of 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:43.020
 to the front of the bar I do that 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.620
 I have two isolators in the two 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.050
 end up 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.730
 a power and a truck relocated and now 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.950
 is actually the golden log comes 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:59.910
 on this dare here 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.550
 and should be the thing she drives 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.070
 simply liquid over 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.960
 However, she should be on her field 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.120
 still most jobs will still work 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.760
 stromboli an axis still outside 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.500
 is when all axes are about that 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.370
 I say pretty close when I'm fast 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.000
 found herself standing 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:26.430
 this is so, this I'm for 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.390
 use to tailor the rail too 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.400
 determine where to hold and who 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.550
 So either a lot of small ones 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.380
 you divorced and then you do that so 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.380
 They really should keep it accurate 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.350
 China for example or you do it like that 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.390
 Build yourself by just when 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.620
 I'll tackle that for a long time 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.850
 rail coffins here and jigsaw there 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.580
 incision rows that goes through once 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.820
 that's enough the stream does not jump 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.030
 scattered everywhere 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.870
 and then just stops here just 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.250
 where I can insert the connector 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.400
 the isolier actually connects 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.970
 pretty easy and free 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:17.220
 not so paid so does not cost 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:19.440
 not so much in the retail trade and yes me 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.860
 can now show just before lead and 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.820
 Although now on and in the shade 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.820
 base is also still one 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.220
 the comes now also automatically 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.140
 no matter if the deeds are driving now 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.520
 should at risk down there solves the 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:42.010
 so to speak, in the shadow station and equal 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.860
 would have the series 186 with the small 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.350
 to find tenants then come upstairs 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.900
 be and stop there now 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.630
 so nice now she keeps her eyes 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:57.000
 just before the railway crossing good that 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:59.610
 actually nothing blocks the 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.560
 barriers the supposed traffic 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.300
 yes, that was my question 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.390
 i have written in your commentary 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:13.230
 she likes to answer 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:13.230
 and otherwise until the next episode
