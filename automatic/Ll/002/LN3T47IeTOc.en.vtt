not because I was chasing it here it was

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.539 
not because I was chasing it here it was
say<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.540> wanted<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.990> hit<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.710> wasn't<00:01:19.890> chasing

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
say I wanted a hit but I wasn't chasing

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.179

it I just recorded it like blind there
at<00:01:23.490> word<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.240> stood<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> booth<00:01:24.990> with

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
at word I just stood in the booth with

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.980 
at word I just stood in the booth with
the<00:01:25.380> Mac<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.460> came<00:01:26.700> out<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:26.970> my<00:01:27.210> brain<00:01:27.570> into

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the Mac and it came out of my brain into

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.960 
the Mac and it came out of my brain into
the<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.259> that's<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:29.310> natural<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the so that's like really natural the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
the so that's like really natural the
way<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.360> was<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.710> made<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.390> I'll<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.659> wasn't

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
way it was a made and I'll just wasn't

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.480 
way it was a made and I'll just wasn't
chasing<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.470> hit<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.950> think<00:01:35.130> that's<00:01:35.310> why<00:01:35.460> I

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
chasing a hit and I think that's why I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.039 
chasing a hit and I think that's why I
think<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> hit<00:01:36.630> when<00:01:36.780> you're<00:01:36.930> not

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
think it is a hit when you're not

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.319 
think it is a hit when you're not
chasing<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.619> I've<00:01:38.460> recorded<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.270> studio
