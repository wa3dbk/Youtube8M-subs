really different it's the cadence 4-bit
binary<00:00:24.470> watch<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.279> let's<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:26.730> right<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.480> it

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
binary watch so let's get right to it it

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.120 
binary watch so let's get right to it it
comes<00:00:28.349> like<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:30.019> there's<00:00:31.019> an<00:00:31.289> orange<00:00:31.710> box

coated quartz glass and by the way this

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.229 
coated quartz glass and by the way this
is<00:02:06.240> water<00:02:06.750> resistant<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.590> well<00:02:07.649> not<00:02:08.429> water

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
is water resistant as well not water

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.510 
is water resistant as well not water
proof<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.080> don't<00:02:10.259> take<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.709> scuba<00:02:11.160> diving

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
proof so don't take this scuba diving

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.450 
proof so don't take this scuba diving
or<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.150> know<00:02:12.180> going<00:02:12.870> 10<00:02:13.650> 20<00:02:14.100> feet<00:02:14.310> underwater

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
or you know going 10 20 feet underwater

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.340 
or you know going 10 20 feet underwater
and<00:02:15.210> then<00:02:15.330> coming<00:02:15.630> up<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.900> doesn't<00:02:16.110> work

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
and then coming up and doesn't work

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.470 
and then coming up and doesn't work
because<00:02:16.970> water-resistant<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.090> totally

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
because water-resistant is totally

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.610 
because water-resistant is totally
different<00:02:18.660> than<00:02:18.930> waterproof

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
different than waterproof

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.470 
different than waterproof
water-resistant<00:02:20.520> simply<00:02:20.790> means<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.150> well

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
water-resistant simply means that well

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.960 
water-resistant simply means that well
if<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.690> spill<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.170> couple<00:02:22.650> drops<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.460> or<00:02:23.610> if

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
if you spill a couple drops on it or if

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.790 
if you spill a couple drops on it or if
you<00:02:24.060> get<00:02:24.210> a<00:02:24.240> couple<00:02:24.570> drops<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.900> rain<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.530> a

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
you get a couple drops of rain on it a

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.190 
you get a couple drops of rain on it a
bit<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.250> water<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.700> not<00:02:27.180> going<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.690> hurt<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.020> now

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
bit of water is not going to hurt it now

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.380 
the sense of all the technical
specifications<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.560> type<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:37.980> stuff

specifications and that type of stuff
but<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.720> might<00:02:40.080> be<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.350> interest<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.920> someone

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480

apparently<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.720> has<00:02:43.110> my<00:02:43.950> yota<00:02:44.460> quartz

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
apparently it has my yota quartz

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.350 
apparently it has my yota quartz
movement<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.620> movement<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:47.190> quite<00:02:48.120> nice

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
movement and the movement is quite nice

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.330

just<00:02:48.960> take<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.290> second<00:02:49.740> here<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:50.070> look<00:02:50.190> at<00:02:50.310> it

just take a second here and look at it
and<00:02:50.580> this<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:51.000> think<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.360> very<00:02:51.630> important<00:02:52.290> I

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
and this I think is very important I

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.990 
and this I think is very important I
mean<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.680> don't<00:02:52.860> need<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.130> know<00:02:53.280> watches<00:02:53.820> to

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
mean you don't need to know watches to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.430 
mean you don't need to know watches to

to say well the watch kind of makes it

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.390 
to say well the watch kind of makes it
above<00:03:36.450> average<00:03:36.750> doesn't<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:38.040> don't<00:03:38.220> see
