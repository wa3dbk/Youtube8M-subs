00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.120
 Ivan Sanchez-Rico better known as 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.680
 ricky is one of the most forward 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.050
 experienced from our league 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.880
 the aranjuez formed in the categories 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.980
 inferiors of Real Madrid debuted in the 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.960
 bbv league from the hand of quique getafe 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.930
 Sanchez Flores on September 12 , 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.300
 2004 in a match against Mallorca 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.470
 after two seasons ricky gift 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.390
 in the ranks of the Deportivo de la Coruña 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.580
 where he lived an idyll with the hobby 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.890
 Galicians in the sports team 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.660
 he lived a decline to the league forward and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.240
 the first division return of the hand of 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.580
 josé luís oltra 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.110
 At 33 years old, the Madrilenian is still 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.790
 frightening with his left handed in the rows 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.900
 of the grenade with the same determination 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.940
 facing goal 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.650
 bric and he answers us for the world league 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.650
 the jr soccer test 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.400
 a porter 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.590
 man daniela going up because he's friend 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.810
 mine logically and I have shared many 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.790
 years with him in sports and now he's 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.790
 in a big one by own merits 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.409
 a good defender I think he has a lot 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.200
 merit or manuel pagan 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.010
 It takes many years of professional and already you 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.040
 I say that 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.130
 who is 38 years old and the sky is fine 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.260
 fine then good besides being a 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.090
 great fellow friend and great captain me 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.090
 I think it's an example for everyone 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:49.510
 to a midfielder 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.430
 Well, it is clear and to choose many 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.060
 good but I stay with iniesta not 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.910
 by his way of being by his game 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.950
 logically and well then it is an example 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.950
 for Spaniards especially not 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.229
 a forward 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.090
 right now there are two that is so similar 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.920
 to the rest as they are Christian and Messi 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.810
 good 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.360
 It is clear that today by messi 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.660
 the four lions that you see now 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.660
 undoubtedly the best 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.500
 a coach 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.620
 Well, José Luis Oltra, I think 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.250
 did 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.180
 a great job in sports despite 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.180
 that in Christmas 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.430
 had a difficult ballot to ascend 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.530
 with the sports car to the first edition and 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.470
 we did it very well it was a year 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.650
 complicated and long and by own merits 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.380
 what was a great job and I 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.470
 I personally enjoyed it a lot 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.470
 i 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:09.280
 a stadium the world likes to play for 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.740
 I am one of the best 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.569
 if not the best where I could play 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.850
 it's not like I've played in fields 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.170
 euros many european fields but good 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.510
 I 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.810
 and also had no opportunity to mark 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.810
 as well 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.380
 a hobby 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.430
 man I personally was from 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.430
 sporting logically I think that 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.430
 is a social mass undoubtedly that 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.269
 has felt very much the deportivismo and the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.890
 passion that there has lived there put 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.890
 one and when you only notice 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.569
 a match 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.519
 maybe one against Madrid 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.010
 to one with themes always made good 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.349
 matches not but 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.689
 now maybe I remember the first 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:10.930
 year in the getafe that we won in madrid 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:12.939
 22 21 and in the coliseum and king second 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.959
 he did not get with a mother pack he's 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.959
 always good 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.150
 a team 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.800
 I really like how he is when the 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.940
 villarreal 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.470
 but it's clear that 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.880
 so it's good to say it's good to play 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.210
 football is Barcelona not only 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.210
 why 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.880
 a title 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.260
 any title is good but that 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.230
 still does not have to get a title and 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.360
 good 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.880
 logically good because the regularity and 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.720
 how nice the league is 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.720
 just from catching the league
