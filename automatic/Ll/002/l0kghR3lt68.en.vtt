00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.330
 I do not have a tutorial for you this time 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.219
 no review no tip no this time 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.379
 I have a question for you because I have 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:19.260
 a little problem with my cameras 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.650
 and I use the eos series the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.710
 small so that's the 600 and 650 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.590
 de for my videos and i just have 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.210
 problems with the sound 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.980
 I would like to somehow microphone 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.730
 connect and we have here too 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.739
 This microphone inputs on the side and 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.989
 because then, for example, the red shotgun 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.219
 plug in and thus the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.079
 Sound recordings now in the moment 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.829
 namely the extra again on the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.750
 laptop and an yeti blue on what 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.469
 little awkward that is still extra time 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.210
 repeal 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.969
 that's why I would like to do that over the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.039
 camera should do so in the reason synonymous 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.680
 No problem if there is such a 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.370
 entrance is to be found but I have 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.840
 always such a noise in there and there 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.439
 is the question what can you now against it 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.790
 heard against this background noise heard 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.790
 perhaps now even I 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.979
 have now the 56 d with the schottern 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.110
 connected and the sound is on 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.240
 a little better than the 600d work 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.780
 not much better 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.420
 of course I can in the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.770
 rework the making that is away 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.880
 I can just hear the noise 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.330
 hide 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.159
 then I listen to it and he notices 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.540
 now on the difference that sounds 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.520
 already better 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.799
 but you have in between depending on 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.540
 how to speak so funny he is 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.340
 why and do that when you 're over with 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.040
 Car doors forces but strange 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.649
 metal all right braid comes there 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.790
 sometimes out there and that's of course 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.189
 not so true 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.220
 From there, I would be quite right 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.380
 If I have another solution then 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.600
 would find 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.159
 I already have a bit 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.049
 read and already researched and 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.729
 there is this magic lantern question 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.920
 he has ever tried someone 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.990
 works as well and how does that look 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.239
 out with guaranteed according to etc 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.190
 because if you jailbreak eg a 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.380
 Wohnpark very clearly expires 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.240
 Guarantee claim the woman is singing 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.740
 how does that look at canon I mean 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.970
 that once burst that was exactly 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.310
 the same is when you are human 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.970
 climb onto the field ran the 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.400
 warranty claim and yes that would like 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.280
 I tend to avoid it plus you 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.570
 ask if that brings anything at all 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.760
 if you have no information what you are against 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.800
 He could do all the reports 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.430
 who also with a canon eos their videos 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.710
 take up 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.300
 Do you have any disturbing noises? 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.070
 there are no problems with and above all 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.530
 thing is what model you write 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.940
 I would like to know how 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.470
 that's how people deal with sound 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.570
 sometimes noise 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.730
 that sounds like in the original with the 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.520
 shotgun micro of does not replace the picture 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.260
 in microphone where this is still extremely 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.040
 but that is already the external one 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.910
 microphones 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.740
 what once worked on my sony 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.800
 Handycam so on the microphone clear 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.360
 not good at all , it does not know 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.980
 Everything is lying, I am a bit 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.870
 that's why I'm asking you so 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.900
 I hope you can help me there 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.180
 and yes, I look forward to your answers 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.180
 So good is one and goodbye
