00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.089
 Hey 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.089

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.550
 everywhere in the country you see it sometimes on TV then we have everything for it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.630
 Pay 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.290
 but you see cars along the work course heading but no one dinamo 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.920
 the people 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.230
 Spoil 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.660
 actually have to do with the establishment of a relict 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.660
 because that is what it is all about without a commitment 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.850
 the case of the exotic green rally and then I'm going to call the number there 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.260
 sixteen hundred volunteers over the coming weekend 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.770
 continental airlines 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.690
 not established 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.670
 and among those volunteers are ambulance personnel, fire service personnel 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.700
 or a job officials affiliated with various associations 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.520
 the Netherlands and in Belgium 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.070
 m the people of the eight-time rally club oh waalse rally club 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.210

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.140
 He served me what they want club supplies through the week in the week 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.939
 prior to the rally 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.680
 deliver this email 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.159
 which, as it were, ensures that the rally was neatly settled 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.420
 we call here eight times welles of which we are the largest 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.550
 the rally of the netherlands we are trying to pursue this year not only the 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.119
 be the biggest 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.609
 protestant 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.609
 That means we are well in advance 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:18.989
 the stuff as containers along the tests where people make a mistake 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.499
 being able 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:22.359
 that means we 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.829
 make sure that the toilets do not go along the current era 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.669
 to stand by itself 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.419
 they are simply brought 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.829
 company leaked with the press 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.389
 about twenty or so 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.149
 more a whole week to settle things like this already 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.219
 you must have the construction fences 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.409
 to be put on safety to be put on important work 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.649
 we do that 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:49.069
 hey all there with that twenty men because of a whole week 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:51.879
 that culminate in it 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.249
 on weekends 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:55.159
 because then the rally passes 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.189
 and then those twenty men are supplemented with extra people today there was the 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:02:59.899
 club 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:04.099
 whoever is deployed at various posts does not pay attention as a job but officially 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.799
 so if we do at other events, then again they are already a job or a job 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:08.779
 show 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:12.979
 where our own rally we are simply used as yes jackets of everything 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.109
 to ensure that there is a 4 when 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.709
 that the skipper good 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.709
 end up in their place so 4 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.789
 traffic controllers traffic sea bridge management and seats 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.519
 and that is what the rally is all about 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.169
 and I want to press it again 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.329
 he emphasized that all are volunteers 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.819
 who ensure that this event can be held 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.369

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:05.399
