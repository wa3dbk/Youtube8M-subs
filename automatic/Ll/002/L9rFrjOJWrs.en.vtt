different<00:02:43.550> but<00:02:44.890> that's<00:02:45.890> too<00:02:46.190> bad

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.120 

just<00:02:50.540> think<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:50.840> shun<00:02:51.110> versus<00:02:51.530> bear<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.040> I'll

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
just think of shun versus bear and I'll

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.720 
just think of shun versus bear and I'll
think<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:53.890> seem<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:54.920> be<00:02:54.980> doing<00:02:55.040> good<00:02:55.250> against

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
think I seem to be doing good against

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.700 
think I seem to be doing good against
Nemus<00:02:57.430> being<00:02:58.430> in<00:02:58.580> bio<00:02:58.760> almost<00:02:59.600> triple<00:03:00.170> points

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
Nemus being in bio almost triple points

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:08.100 
Nemus being in bio almost triple points
here<00:03:05.470> think<00:03:06.470> he<00:03:06.590> is<00:03:06.680> right<00:03:06.860> ability<00:03:07.250> did<00:03:07.430> I<00:03:07.520> oh

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
here think he is right ability did I oh

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.090 
here think he is right ability did I oh
good<00:03:11.080> now<00:03:12.080> I'm<00:03:12.140> guessing<00:03:12.350> a<00:03:12.590> free-for-all

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
good now I'm guessing a free-for-all

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.860 
good now I'm guessing a free-for-all
bound<00:03:13.400> gets<00:03:13.730> on<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.910> back<00:03:14.090> of<00:03:14.270> guns<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.510> feed<00:03:14.840> I

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
bound gets on the back of guns to feed I

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.660 
bound gets on the back of guns to feed I
guess<00:03:15.170> they're<00:03:15.380> just<00:03:15.410> out<00:03:15.680> for<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:15.950> few<00:03:16.070> seconds

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
guess they're just out for a few seconds

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.930 
guess they're just out for a few seconds
and<00:03:16.760> they<00:03:16.850> come<00:03:17.030> back<00:03:17.060> I'm<00:03:17.620> guessing<00:03:18.940> start

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
and they come back I'm guessing start

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.970 
and they come back I'm guessing start
with<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.120> doorbell<00:03:20.510> guys<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:21.200> think<00:03:21.470> someone's
