00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.830
 and good and came as cold jorge 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.830
 will start to feel 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.040
 until today at night is when this 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.389
 rather icy condition will be 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.490
 arriving to our region 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.439
 currently the frontal system is located 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.330
 here where I show it is a cold front 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.939
 very broad as we can see extends 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.769
 from the northern area and drags great 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.689
 part of this condition towards the area 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.760
 central to our state we see that 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.380
 it generates snow we see that it generates sleet 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.780
 and also freezing rain in some 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.520
 sectors the mass of this cold air already 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.469
 maintaining temperatures below 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.969
 freezing level for us 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.430
 wind factor today at night 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.410
 is going to be the essential element for 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.719
 the cold stays very much very 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.579
 intense we see that it could be cleared in 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.079
 our sky towards the day of 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.030
 Friday, which would be enough 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.770
 well to recover a little bit of 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.629
 all this mass of cold air that will be 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.969
 present today at night and 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.590
 also tomorrow day thursday about 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.750
 everything in the morning the winds 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.300
 some areas like midland prevail 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.760
 yellow fort above 20 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.430
 miles for us so far 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.140
 lightly around 7 10 miles 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.150
 per hour this may increase during 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.220
 tonight's hours causing that 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.990
 the values ​​go down in a condition 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.000
 quite but quite low in some 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.130
 points as we can see in yellow in 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.870
 milan in the dallas area likewise 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.200
 currently the thermometer is maintained at 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.450
 the 20 34 32 right now we have a 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.390
 pretty good condition above 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.010
 the average of 60 and this gives us how it is 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.810
 a relief from all this condition so 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.910
 cold that we will be feeling afterwards 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.950
 to end this day tomorrow 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.680
 we see that the maximum will hardly come by 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.420
 above 40 that's a condition 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.950
 pretty but pretty cold to have to 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.729
 the hand our coats our 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.500
 scarves 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.970
 equally our gloves especially 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.620

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.180
 spend a quite but quite environment 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.680
 gone through this cold air mass that 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.479
 will come to our area and that 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.250
 currently located in the area of 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.350
 yellow equally of dallas provoking 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.880
 in those sectors the snow for us 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.650

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.450

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.490
 variable cloudiness there is a condition 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.530
 dense cloud that begins to hog 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.630
 much of the area on this side we see 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.880
 layers of cloudiness accompanied by 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.350
 that begin to become effective and then 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.150
 reviewing our surveillance and 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.250
 warnings we realize that for 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.500
 us the warning that comes to us 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.870

 temperatures are around 30 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.050
