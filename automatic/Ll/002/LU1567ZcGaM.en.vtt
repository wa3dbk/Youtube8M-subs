00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.950 
to tie here so so I got this pattern
because<00:05:39.160> so<00:05:39.970> it<00:05:40.150> could<00:05:40.300> go<00:05:40.419> on<00:05:40.480> boys<00:05:40.660> or<00:05:40.930> girls

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
because so it could go on boys or girls

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.950 
because so it could go on boys or girls
and<00:05:41.950> then<00:05:42.160> I<00:05:42.220> got<00:05:42.400> this<00:05:42.610> really<00:05:43.300> cute<00:05:43.660> little

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
and then I got this really cute little

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.170 
and then I got this really cute little
and<00:05:44.940> this<00:05:45.940> will<00:05:46.660> let<00:05:46.810> you<00:05:47.140> fly<00:05:48.130> mask<00:05:48.400> for<00:05:49.030> the

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
and this will let you fly mask for the

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.909 
and this will let you fly mask for the
briar<00:05:49.630> class<00:05:50.290> no<00:05:50.770> traditional<00:05:52.770> in<00:05:53.770> this

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
briar class no traditional in this

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.900
