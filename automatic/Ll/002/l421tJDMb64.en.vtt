 Was able to tell him how much faith they can build significant regulatory my life 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.489
 Will be 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:55.960
 Faith is not made by anyone. 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:01:02.460
 It is not injected by force . 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.460
 You yourself believe in your choice 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:10.649
 What are you talking about now? 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.649
 It's not about religious beliefs. 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.190
 It refers to belief systems in the schedule that you have. 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:31.120
 Beliefs are thought thoughts that you believe in yourself . 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.120
 The kind of place caught stereotypes prayer 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:43.810
 This little piece of faith that I made myself 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:52.320
 I think I create stereotyped values ​​beliefs 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:58.250
 These systems of faith soon create the image of one's life 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.250
 It is to make me think about existence. 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.880
 It is a very important issue to know what to believe. 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:12.720
 The things I believe are going to be my reality. 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:24.390
 If you firmly believe something without doubt, you will experience the faith in your reality . 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.390
 Will be 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.319
 It is a realistic experience that can prove your faith . 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.930
 It will appear to be a reality as you believe 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.300
 If you do, your faith will become more solid. 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:51.910
 It is a stereotype . 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.910
 It becomes your own values 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:03.460
 However, through empirical facts that will support my faith, 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.460
 You should not think it's proven. 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:14.849
 In fact, since he believed, he believed that he created reality 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.849
 Because there are many cases 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:24.129
 In other words, the ham of faith 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:26.379
 It has created the reality of oneself. 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:32.250
 Everyday reality 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.250
 It does not prove my faith. 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.500
 The power of faith is what makes us reality. 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.819
 Normally, people believe what they believe 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.510
 As the experience in the real 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.930
 If a few more of his faith 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:03.430
 Creates be fixed 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:07.439
 When we experience it over and over again, our mind is already doubting the belief 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.439
 Without acceptance 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:17.120
 For that process, we have 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.120
 Stereotypes are formed. 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:26.009
 Building a situation arises that stereotypes 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.449
 From our obsession, our bitterness 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.449
 Beginning 

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:36.009
 For example, 

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:44.699
 I do not like him. 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:49.059
 If I raise a stereotyped belief about myself that I get well on evaluation 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:53.339
 In fact, your body has faith in 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:53.339
 We will create reality. 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:02.590
 Even if it's really small, 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.590
 It will stop worse. 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:15.810
 If you repeat that many times and experience 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:17.340
 The belief that I believed in myself, that I am not good, is stronger . 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.200
 under 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:27.790
 It is accepted as true in me 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:34.590
 I firmly believe that I make stereotypes. 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:34.590
 Then, from now on, there will be a lot of things to take. 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.670
 A little cold weather 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:44.000
 Worried about taking a cold 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:47.030
 When you come in with heavy exercise 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:54.940
 I 'm worried about the pain. 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:54.940
 Even the ever-ending obsession with my body ties me up 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:08.380
 When you actually believe that it really gets cold eun cold 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:12.250
 Exercise severely, and when you come in, 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:16.610
 If you get away from a little repetitive routine 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:23.840
 The longer the body is the five 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:31.000
 These things, however, are not actually that bad, 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:31.000
 It 's mostly because of deep conviction . 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:41.480
 I came over to the body in the mind is clear and not to destroy the belief the body 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:46.870
 To 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.870
 It's actually a disease. 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:57.740
 This is the fixed liver cancer that is latent in your mind. 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.740
 It is creating reality. 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:08.260
 Therefore, the fixed belief in me have what 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:15.280
 Keep your eyes closed and raw materials. 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:18.810
 So putting those beliefs were dominated my life to look like 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.810
 I hope you meditate. 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:30.160
 If you know right away through meditation , 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.160
 One thought will be irrevocable 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:41.990
 You shared a message about the importance of faith today . 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:46.300
 Then, in the light of the Buddha-nature inside us 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.300
 Happy Buddha , ten o'clock
