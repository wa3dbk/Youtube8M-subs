00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
back-to-school season is add flannels to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.580 
back-to-school season is add flannels to
almost<00:00:36.059> pretty<00:00:36.420> much<00:00:36.510> every<00:00:37.050> outfit<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.559> love

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
almost pretty much every outfit I love

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.130 
almost pretty much every outfit I love
flannels<00:00:38.250> because<00:00:38.610> they're<00:00:39.300> awesome<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:40.020> can

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
flannels because they're awesome you can

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.430 
flannels because they're awesome you can
buy<00:00:40.260> thin<00:00:40.770> ones<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.460> actual<00:00:42.120> flannel<00:00:42.600> ones<00:00:42.780> but

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
buy thin ones or actual flannel ones but

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.080 
buy thin ones or actual flannel ones but
I<00:00:43.649> thought<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.129> flannel<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.670> perfect

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
I thought that the flannel was perfect

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.110 
I thought that the flannel was perfect
because<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:46.050> not<00:00:46.200> only<00:00:46.500> gave<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.920> some<00:00:47.520> sort<00:00:47.910> of

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
because it not only gave it some sort of

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.209 
because it not only gave it some sort of
style<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.110> also<00:00:49.289> covered<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.890> back

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
style but it also covered the back

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.760 
style but it also covered the back
because<00:00:51.030> I'm<00:00:51.180> pretty<00:00:51.420> sure<00:00:51.690> most<00:00:52.320> schools

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
because I'm pretty sure most schools

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.850 
because I'm pretty sure most schools
will<00:00:53.129> not<00:00:53.160> allow<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.940> show<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:55.230> back<00:00:55.530> of

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
will not allow you to show the back of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.860 
will not allow you to show the back of
the<00:00:56.280> dress<00:00:56.550> because<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.030> does<00:00:57.180> cut<00:00:57.449> down<00:00:57.480> low

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the dress because it does cut down low

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.260 
the dress because it does cut down low
and<00:00:58.170> then<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:58.890> paired<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.219> outfit<00:00:59.730> with

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
and then I just paired this outfit with

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.700 
and then I just paired this outfit with
some<00:01:00.629> combat<00:01:01.289> boots

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
some combat boots

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.709 
some combat boots
so<00:01:02.070> again<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.910> any<00:01:02.940> outfit

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
so again you can do this to any outfit

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.660 
so again you can do this to any outfit
and<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.710> think<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:04.979> makes<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.400> perfect

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and I just think it makes the perfect

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.970 
and I just think it makes the perfect
back-to-school<00:01:06.619> outfit

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.570 

feel<00:01:10.250> like<00:01:10.580> I<00:01:10.910> can<00:01:11.180> magic

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580

feel like I can magic

sheared<00:02:05.590> tunic<00:02:06.189> which<00:02:06.759> was<00:02:06.970> always<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:07.689> just

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
make it look at the slip and this might

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.490 
make it look at the slip and this might
work<00:02:13.180> for<00:02:13.209> some<00:02:13.450> people<00:02:13.900> showing<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.350> back
