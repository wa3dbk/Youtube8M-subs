00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
two different certificates pieces so

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.680 
two different certificates pieces so
what<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:16.739> want<00:04:16.889> to<00:04:16.949> do<00:04:17.070> is<00:04:17.370> use<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:17.910> two

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
halves together and that will create the

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.629 
halves together and that will create the
false<00:04:21.299> certificate<00:04:21.509> and<00:04:22.199> then<00:04:23.100> once<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.460> have

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
false certificate and then once you have

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
this return to King rolled and this will

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.610 
this return to King rolled and this will
basically<00:04:26.250> complete<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.850> quest<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:31.410> that's

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
basically complete the quest and that's

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.790 
basically complete the quest and that's
a<00:04:31.740> bit<00:04:31.889> confusing<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.610> hopefully<00:04:33.600> that<00:04:34.590> made

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
a bit confusing and hopefully that made

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.870 
a bit confusing and hopefully that made
more<00:04:35.039> sense<00:04:35.100> in<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:35.850> sounded<00:04:36.539> but<00:04:37.880> it's

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
more sense in it sounded but it's

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.300 
more sense in it sounded but it's
difficult<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.539> explain<00:04:39.660> about<00:04:40.229> her<00:04:40.530> looking

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
difficult to explain about her looking

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.760 
difficult to explain about her looking
