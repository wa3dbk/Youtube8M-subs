00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.100
 Hello 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.430
 also today another make-up video e 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.430
 it is always a colorful trick 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.289
 you know that I like playing with colors 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.779
 I always like to do something different 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.730
 I would be surprised to always do the usual make up 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.840
 with the black-and-white news scale of 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.680
 gray and similar stuff 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.489
 here is not for me I like to play with 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.649
 colors 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.010
 maybe when I go out I am the first to use 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.370
 more browns though to make videos 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.850
 I like to play a little and a lot of videos 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.250
 on youtube with tricks of the shades 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.809
 of the brown you find to never end but 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.120
 however don't worry because 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.899
 I too have made several and I will do it 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.450
 still many indeed many of you 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.909
 have asked about VIPs on 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.700
 celebrities and I'm already working 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.400
 in fact on facebook I put a species 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.100
 of survey with four stars 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.740
 and I will let you choose exactly which one 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.810
 it will be the first one he will go on to make 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.030
 a tutorial so if you want too 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.820
 have your say go to facebook and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.250
 tell me then between the 4 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.860
 who you prefer this trick is perfect 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.990
 for an evening out an evening in 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.420
 disco maybe a special event 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.200
 I don't know how I really like it 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.350
 lot 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.300
 no I never want to have it usually 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.070
 of something I do myself though 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.979
 I must say that I really am 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.290
 satisfied I admit it here for my parents 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.430
 tastes here I like so much also remembers 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.770
 a bit of a galaxy because precisely with 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.400
 this violates the blue the golden that 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.220
 maybe it reminds me of stars or meteorites 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.640
 here are similar things that sparkle 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.540
 there are glitter is a trick 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.640
 strong at the same time bright me 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.410
 like it is just there to do it make me 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.050
 know you as always in the comments if 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.720
 the make up I made 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.250
 I like it and if so follow the tutorial 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.100
 he started spreading my usual primer 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.000
 and then apply this tollbooth 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.580
 avon exotic on the fold 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.550
 of the eye and the outer corner 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.450
 then going to fade with a brush from 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.880
 shading and adding on it a 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.190
 eyeshadow of a very similar color a 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.830
 plum color that fades upwards e 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.110
 towards the outside attic still of the 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.750
 further bases then using however 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.820
 pencils e 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.380
 in the middle of my part between modica e 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.230
 astute this but black and golden title 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.110
 freed and a pencil on the inside corner 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.030
 blue that I then go to fix with a 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.920
 eye shadow of the same color for a long time 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.870
 the outside instead I apply this color 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.870
 burgundy taken from a limited edition 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.230
 of clicks to go and make mine 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.020
 look much deeper and naked 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.090
 u updated in the center of my eyelid 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.740
 which gives a light to the mind of the whole 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.660
 makeup had faded very well with the 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.730
 two other colors at the hairline 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.750
 lower lashes 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:38.410
 I apply violet again it's gennai line 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.760
 in Trieste both in the internal arrival and 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.390
 then to go and draw one 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.410
 beautiful line 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:51.920
 thin with a small hill on the 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:55.250
 part of Verona in the point seems to 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.520
 naked 2 I apply foxy which is a matt cream 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.790
 super earth brow and buteyko that 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.570
 instead it is an honor shiver at the corner 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.770
 internal to give light I apply the 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:12.770
 mascara after explaining the lashes either 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:17.060
 the upper and lower ones and with the 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:19.410
 corrector I go precisely to correct a 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.870
 po all the defects e 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.510
 to give light under my eyes to 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.360
 fix dark circles under the eyes 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.390
 and to cancel any possible pull out 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.500
 thus also giving a form 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.870
 best 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.590
 all in one of cat on the cheeks offending 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.600
 this rosy blush, a little schiller 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.040
 because I really want to light like 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.280
 this as a proposal that reminds me 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:48.020
 alaska and for this reason also a 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.020
 illuminating and this is that of two 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:56.740
 cheekbones and nose here is everyone's

 debora's lipstick 39 number 39 24 hours e 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.000
 a very intense violet I therefore 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.360
 reactive just a little bit and then it 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.260
 dab with fingertips and above 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.350

 and lasts so much fig volume of the number 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.199
 zero 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.199
 Well 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.710
 here is that the look is finished 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.660
 easy to make even if 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.200
 very colorful and apparently could 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.480
 look complicated and a friend of mine fabri 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.790
 phases has achieved a lot of trick 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.190
 similar lately and I see them not 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.050

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.320

 click on it you can go and see 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.960
 even immediately if I want to see how a 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.980
 similar tutorial but with colors a little 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.540
 different 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.580
