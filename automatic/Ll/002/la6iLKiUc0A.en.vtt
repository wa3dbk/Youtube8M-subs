and that's the rock that's headed the
drum<00:05:30.860> as<00:05:31.129> you<00:05:31.999> can<00:05:32.149> see<00:05:32.330> here<00:05:32.569> this<00:05:32.749> is<00:05:33.159> typical

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
drum as you can see here this is typical

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:35.980 
drum as you can see here this is typical
of<00:05:34.399> the<00:05:35.089> area<00:05:35.330> that<00:05:35.539> the<00:05:35.629> machine<00:05:35.960> is

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
of the area that the machine is

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.480 
of the area that the machine is
currently<00:05:36.620> working<00:05:36.889> in<00:05:38.259> the<00:05:39.259> deeper<00:05:40.099> you<00:05:40.279> get

currently working in the deeper you get

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.399 
currently working in the deeper you get
at<00:05:40.639> the<00:05:40.759> soil<00:05:40.999> the<00:05:41.629> worse<00:05:41.839> it<00:05:42.080> gets<00:05:42.259> at<00:05:42.889> about

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
at the soil the worse it gets at about

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:48.309 
at the soil the worse it gets at about
200<00:05:45.409> deep<00:05:46.069> but<00:05:46.430> 50<00:05:46.789> deep<00:05:46.999> at<00:05:47.360> places<00:05:48.080> it's<00:05:48.259> just

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 
200 deep but 50 deep at places it's just

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:51.249 
200 deep but 50 deep at places it's just
straight<00:05:48.770> rock<00:05:49.009> the<00:05:49.939> ground<00:05:50.330> is<00:05:50.509> extremely

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
straight rock the ground is extremely

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:54.700 
straight rock the ground is extremely
compacted<00:05:51.919> and<00:05:52.809> it<00:05:53.809> takes<00:05:54.110> a<00:05:54.349> lot<00:05:54.680> of

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
compacted and it takes a lot of

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.489 
compacted and it takes a lot of
horsepower<00:05:55.009> to<00:05:55.939> get<00:05:56.149> through<00:05:56.509> it<00:05:56.599> here<00:05:57.229> -

00:05:57.489 --> 00:05:57.499 
horsepower to get through it here -

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:02.619 
horsepower to get through it here -
sandy<00:05:58.159> soils<00:05:58.639> or<00:05:59.469> low<00:06:00.469> B<00:06:00.680> source<00:06:01.029> in<00:06:02.029> here<00:06:02.059> you

sandy soils or low B source in here you

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:04.839 
sandy soils or low B source in here you
can<00:06:02.809> see<00:06:03.050> the<00:06:03.379> rock<00:06:03.589> so<00:06:04.279> the<00:06:04.399> machine<00:06:04.699> is

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
can see the rock so the machine is

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.559 
can see the rock so the machine is
actually<00:06:05.029> broken<00:06:05.449> all<00:06:05.719> that<00:06:05.869> rock<00:06:06.080> up<00:06:06.110> and<00:06:06.559> to

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569 
actually broken all that rock up and to

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:19.590 
actually broken all that rock up and to
approximately<00:06:08.569> 20<00:06:08.959> full<00:06:09.680> sizes

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.130 

you<00:06:20.290> can<00:06:20.560> see<00:06:20.800> here<00:06:21.130> with<00:06:21.760> Anna<00:06:21.940> she<00:06:22.150> has<00:06:22.810> done

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 
you can see here with Anna she has done

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.310 
you can see here with Anna she has done
other<00:06:23.410> rough<00:06:23.740> death<00:06:24.120> and<00:06:25.120> so<00:06:25.750> the<00:06:25.900> size<00:06:26.110> the

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
other rough death and so the size the

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:33.800 
other rough death and so the size the
Stubbs<00:06:26.620> is<00:06:26.920> going<00:06:27.670> through

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.290 

as<00:06:34.260> if<00:06:34.560> very<00:06:34.889> clean<00:06:35.220> and

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300

this<00:06:43.080> gives<00:06:43.319> you<00:06:43.439> an<00:06:43.530> idea<00:06:43.620> of<00:06:43.889> some<00:06:44.520> of<00:06:44.580> the

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:44.729 
this gives you an idea of some of the

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:51.279 
this gives you an idea of some of the
steps<00:06:45.199> the<00:06:46.199> Rose<00:06:46.530> here<00:06:47.960> 3.7<00:06:48.960> Peter<00:06:49.860> Rose<00:06:50.210> the

the<00:07:06.270> stuffs<00:07:06.570> that<00:07:06.690> we<00:07:06.990> are<00:07:07.050> mulching<00:07:07.830> here

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.040 
the stuffs that we are mulching here

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.360 
the stuffs that we are mulching here
grinded<00:07:08.610> our<00:07:09.120> pine<00:07:09.450> stuffs<00:07:09.840> pine<00:07:10.770> stumps<00:07:11.220> are

grinded our pine stuffs pine stumps are

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.270 
grinded our pine stuffs pine stumps are
one<00:07:11.460> of<00:07:11.550> the<00:07:11.640> hardest<00:07:11.850> to<00:07:12.480> grow<00:07:12.720> as<00:07:13.040> they<00:07:14.040> get<00:07:14.220> a

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 
one of the hardest to grow as they get a

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.680 
one of the hardest to grow as they get a
very<00:07:14.580> flexible<00:07:16.370> sunlight<00:07:17.390> structure<00:07:18.390> and

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.690 
very flexible sunlight structure and

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.960 
very flexible sunlight structure and
they<00:07:19.470> pull<00:07:19.860> a<00:07:19.890> lot<00:07:20.100> of<00:07:20.160> horsepower<00:07:20.460> off<00:07:20.850> the

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:20.970 
they pull a lot of horsepower off the

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.450 
they pull a lot of horsepower off the
machine<00:07:21.330> on<00:07:21.990> the<00:07:22.050> other<00:07:22.470> side<00:07:22.740> we've<00:07:23.160> got<00:07:23.190> the

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 
machine on the other side we've got the

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.090 
machine on the other side we've got the
hardwood<00:07:23.820> steps<00:07:24.150> which<00:07:24.990> are<00:07:25.260> lot<00:07:25.590> more<00:07:25.770> formal

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.100 
hardwood steps which are lot more formal

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.500 
hardwood steps which are lot more formal
it<00:07:26.310> breaks<00:07:26.670> a<00:07:26.790> lot<00:07:26.880> easier

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.510 
it breaks a lot easier

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.510 
it breaks a lot easier
so<00:07:27.900> therefore<00:07:28.250> would<00:07:29.250> use<00:07:29.910> about<00:07:30.120> 20%<00:07:30.690> less

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 
so therefore would use about 20% less

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.850 
so therefore would use about 20% less
horsepower<00:07:32.570> to<00:07:33.570> grade<00:07:33.870> the<00:07:34.320> equivalent<00:07:34.770> of

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 
horsepower to grade the equivalent of

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:48.560 
horsepower to grade the equivalent of
hardwood<00:07:35.670> stamps

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:48.570 

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.470 

this<00:07:49.290> is<00:07:49.500> what<00:07:50.280> that<00:07:50.460> job<00:07:50.880> looks<00:07:51.120> like<00:07:51.300> but

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:51.480 
this is what that job looks like but

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.620 
this is what that job looks like but
it's<00:07:51.600> finished<00:07:51.900> this<00:07:52.140> is<00:07:52.350> before<00:07:53.570> this<00:07:54.570> is

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:54.630 
it's finished this is before this is

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.050 
it's finished this is before this is
laughter<00:07:55.260> thank<00:07:55.980> you<00:07:56.070> very<00:07:56.220> much<00:07:56.460> for

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.060
