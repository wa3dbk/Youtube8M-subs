I<00:03:36.970> think<00:03:37.270> the<00:03:37.360> gym<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.960> all<00:03:38.170> that<00:03:38.350> stuff<00:03:38.530> is

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
I think the gym and all that stuff is

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.920

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
really bored with repetition like the

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.200 
really bored with repetition like the
gym<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.620> can't<00:04:11.980> I<00:04:12.220> can't<00:04:12.610> really<00:04:12.790> go<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.030> the
