00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
it's fairly easy to use just a couple of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.400 
it's fairly easy to use just a couple of
screws<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:34.219> there<00:00:35.300> you<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.510> probably<00:00:36.809> not<00:00:37.140> see

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
screws in there you can probably not see

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500 
screws in there you can probably not see
well<00:00:37.950> maybe<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.430> there's<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.210> white<00:00:39.329> piece

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
well maybe you can there's a white piece

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.560 
well maybe you can there's a white piece
of<00:00:39.540> plastic<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.200> goes<00:00:40.260> around<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:41.040> rod<00:00:41.579> now

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
of plastic that goes around a rod now

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.540 
of plastic that goes around a rod now
that<00:00:43.050> piece<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.530> plastic<00:00:43.649> turns<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.399> move

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
that piece of plastic turns as you move

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.970 
that piece of plastic turns as you move
the<00:00:44.730> lock<00:00:44.879> up<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.660> down<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.649> that's<00:00:46.739> what

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
the lock up and down so that's what

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.209 
the lock up and down so that's what
controls<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.430> lock<00:00:47.610> there's<00:00:48.239> also<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.539> c-clip

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
controls the lock there's also a c-clip

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.910 
controls the lock there's also a c-clip
like<00:00:50.570> this<00:00:51.570> inside<00:00:52.350> there<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.710> knock<00:00:52.890> that

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
like this inside there you knock that

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.860 
like this inside there you knock that
off<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.460> take<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.789> brought<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.809> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
way it's designed so I'll have to test

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.510 
way it's designed so I'll have to test
it<00:01:32.310> out<00:01:32.430> see<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:33.390> happens<00:01:33.750> well<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.680> know<00:01:34.829> so

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.410 
yeah this little silver button right
here<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.430> have<00:03:56.520> to<00:03:56.700> push<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:57.030> otherwise<00:03:57.270> it

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
here you have to push it otherwise it

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
here you have to push it otherwise it
gets<00:03:57.480> caught<00:03:59.720> so<00:04:00.720> now<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:00.900> got<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.170> key<00:04:01.350> in<00:04:01.530> and

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
gets caught so now I got the key in and

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.160 
gets caught so now I got the key in and
let's<00:04:04.440> see<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:04.650> can<00:04:05.030> turn<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.210> so<00:04:06.660> on<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.020> so

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
let's see I can turn it so on and so

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.860 
let's see I can turn it so on and so
forth<00:04:07.500> let's<00:04:07.920> pull<00:04:08.160> it<00:04:08.280> out<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.640> lock<00:04:09.570> stays

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
forth let's pull it out and lock stays

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:17.240 
forth let's pull it out and lock stays
in<00:04:10.050> there

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.490 

so<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.430> trick<00:04:18.760> to<00:04:19.090> removing<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.080> ignition

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
so the trick to removing the ignition

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.590 
so the trick to removing the ignition
lock<00:04:20.680> is<00:04:20.980> underneath<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:22.090> little<00:04:22.330> silver

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
lock is underneath that little silver

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.150 
lock is underneath that little silver
button<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:22.960> showed<00:04:23.200> you<00:04:23.410> you<00:04:23.680> just<00:04:23.830> take<00:04:24.010> the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
button I showed you you just take the

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.490 
button I showed you you just take the
bottom<00:04:24.460> of<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.610> plastic<00:04:24.820> housing<00:04:25.210> off<00:04:25.600> though

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
bottom of the plastic housing off though

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.080 
bottom of the plastic housing off though
this<00:04:26.710> plastic<00:04:27.100> housing<00:04:27.460> goes<00:04:27.610> over<00:04:27.940> the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
this plastic housing goes over the

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.790 
this plastic housing goes over the
steering<00:04:28.660> column<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:29.080> bottom<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.500> it<00:04:29.620> take

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
steering column the bottom to it take

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.310 
steering column the bottom to it take
that<00:04:29.980> off<00:04:30.250> put<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.360> key<00:04:31.540> in<00:04:31.750> turn<00:04:31.990> it<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.200> the

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
that off put the key in turn it to the

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.800 
that off put the key in turn it to the
run<00:04:32.830> position<00:04:33.090> take<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.120> little<00:04:34.360> allen<00:04:34.630> wrench

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
run position take a little allen wrench

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.690 
run position take a little allen wrench

that<00:04:38.770> push<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.670> little<00:04:39.940> silver<00:04:40.390> button<00:04:40.780> that

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
that push the little silver button that

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.740 
that push the little silver button that
I<00:04:40.900> showed<00:04:41.110> you<00:04:41.140> earlier<00:04:41.380> up<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:42.390> then<00:04:43.390> pull

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
I showed you earlier up and then pull

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.240 
I showed you earlier up and then pull
the<00:04:43.900> whole<00:04:43.930> cylinder<00:04:44.410> out<00:04:44.530> now<00:04:44.770> be<00:04:44.920> careful

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
the whole cylinder out now be careful

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.790 
the whole cylinder out now be careful
not<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.460> take<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.700> key<00:04:45.940> out<00:04:45.970> when<00:04:46.330> you're<00:04:46.480> done

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
not to take the key out when you're done

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.050 
not to take the key out when you're done
because<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:48.040> whole<00:04:48.190> lock<00:04:48.400> mechanism<00:04:48.940> will

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
because the whole lock mechanism will

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.720 
because the whole lock mechanism will
actually<00:04:49.390> fall<00:04:49.540> apart<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.830> then<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.490> have<00:04:51.610> to

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
actually fall apart and then you have to

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.670 
actually fall apart and then you have to
replace<00:04:51.970> it<00:04:52.210> now<00:04:52.750> I<00:04:52.780> have<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.080> matching<00:04:53.470> set<00:04:53.620> of

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
replace it now I have a matching set of

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.620 
replace it now I have a matching set of
keys<00:04:53.920> on<00:04:54.160> all<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.850> doors<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.390> ignition
