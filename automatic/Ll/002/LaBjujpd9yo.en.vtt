00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
to be done and that's why there will be

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.060 
to be done and that's why there will be
no<00:04:15.269> problems<00:04:15.810> after<00:04:16.289> midnight<00:04:16.590> of<00:04:16.709> course<00:04:16.889> we

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
no problems after midnight of course we

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.469 
no problems after midnight of course we
won't<00:04:17.250> know<00:04:17.370> whether<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.669> millennium<00:04:18.120> bug<00:04:18.299> is

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479

actually<00:04:18.870> there<00:04:19.109> until<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.889> Millennium<00:04:20.340> and

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
actually there until the Millennium and

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.640 
actually there until the Millennium and
in<00:04:20.880> some<00:04:21.239> senses<00:04:21.720> you<00:04:21.900> won't<00:04:22.049> really<00:04:22.349> know

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
in some senses you won't really know

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.170 
in some senses you won't really know
until<00:04:22.680> we<00:04:23.099> all<00:04:23.220> go<00:04:23.460> back<00:04:23.640> to<00:04:23.820> work<00:04:23.849> because

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
until we all go back to work because

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.830 
until we all go back to work because
there<00:04:24.390> are<00:04:24.479> two<00:04:24.659> sorts<00:04:25.050> of<00:04:25.110> millennium<00:04:25.560> by

there are two sorts of millennium by
if<00:04:25.990> you<00:04:26.080> like<00:04:26.260> there<00:04:26.830> is<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.130> bug<00:04:27.370> in<00:04:27.639> people's

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
if you like there is the bug in people's

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.629 
if you like there is the bug in people's
computer<00:04:28.660> where<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.990> date<00:04:29.199> changes<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.889> 2000

and the computer can't quite work out

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.170 
and the computer can't quite work out
what<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.560> is<00:04:32.710> but<00:04:33.400> there's<00:04:33.610> also<00:04:33.760> a<00:04:33.910> kind<00:04:34.120> of

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
what that is but there's also a kind of

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.719 
what that is but there's also a kind of
a<00:04:34.270> virus<00:04:34.630> which<00:04:35.229> malicious<00:04:35.860> people<00:04:36.070> put<00:04:36.580> into

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
computers and we won't know if those

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.490 
computers and we won't know if those
viruses<00:04:39.940> are<00:04:40.120> in<00:04:40.270> until<00:04:40.810> people<00:04:41.080> go<00:04:41.260> back<00:04:41.470> to

take no risks with that so they're

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.129 
take no risks with that so they're
