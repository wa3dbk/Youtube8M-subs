00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.340
 here is the automatics planted waters 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:16.450
 elongated form such here it is one grade 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:20.140
 then comes here these tomatoes are round 7 of 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:24.480
 limited growth ends 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.220
 roses due to the last inflorescence and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.310
 extra tomatoes harvest tomatoes 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.129
 formed by the steps of the cutters we 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:38.079
 here did not clean see how many there on 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:43.540
 the vot is right here strewn with the whole tomato 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:47.200
 Komi here we have how many 6 bushes three 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.010
 types of one variety and three types of another 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.310
 varieties 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.450
 in the greenhouse they are certainly higher than they will be in 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:58.540
 open field but the harvest makes us happy 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.800
 here we see there from limited 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:06.270
 growth planted us in a greenhouse 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.690
 it is formed a little differently than 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:14.409
 why tomato int and terminal why 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.280
 that this type of tomato has growth 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.840
 terminated by education 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.920
 flower brushes where are formed 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.619
 last tomatoes if you shape it 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.400
 one stalk is what we will have 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.330
 that is, an agency with limited 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.200
 by quantity 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:38.830
 brushes of tomatoes here formed my 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.490
 at the expense of the stepsons, here we see one groove 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.460
 she 's got a bunch of tomato on it 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.000
 pass it over here one more 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.270
 and at the expense of these stepsons we got 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.110
 additional amount of tomatoes 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.060
 there are such tomatoes are not formed in one 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.060
 stem 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.850
 naturally time they go lice distance 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.890
 between planted tomatoes should be 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:12.209
 at least 50 centimeters pinch them 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.790
 also not going here still watching 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.739
 the temperature is very high in warm 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.769
 and here on this brush we see that 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.609
 Tomatoes are not tied up by high 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.409
 air temperature in the greenhouse can be 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:30.239
 at the end of something 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:32.489
 brushes and behind that we will make 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.180
 still here here there and you already 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.790
 formed on this leaf will remove 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.799
 what else can you pinch this sheet 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:48.799
 remove so here you can remove this one 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:51.989
 leaf leaves are no longer working on 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:56.099
 fruiting only stretch the force 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:59.040
 the plant has more light now 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:02.060
 there from England they will start singing faster 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.370
 here do not turn the reds here 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.739
 Tomatoes appeared which tomatoes 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.769
 ripen on acoustics much tastier than 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.200
 you take pauses ears and put but here 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:17.090
 too many nuances 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.090
 its so here
