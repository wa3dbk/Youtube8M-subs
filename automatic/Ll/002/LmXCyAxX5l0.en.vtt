00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
now and I felt that I was the most

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.660 
now and I felt that I was the most
powerful<00:01:12.930> aside<00:01:13.710> from<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.070> course<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.369> shikai

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
powerful aside from of course of shikai

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.880 
powerful aside from of course of shikai
moments<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.780> particular<00:01:16.200> fight<00:01:16.680> for

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
moments in this particular fight for

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.440 
moments in this particular fight for
that<00:01:16.979> matter<00:01:17.220> not<00:01:17.430> only<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.030> chapter

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that matter not only just this chapter

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.330 
that matter not only just this chapter
because<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.020> really<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.259> shows<00:01:19.470> Ciroc<00:01:20.159> he's

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
because it really just shows Ciroc he's

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.620 
because it really just shows Ciroc he's
come<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> long<00:01:20.610> way<00:01:20.909> from<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.150> being<00:01:21.479> this

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
come a long way from just being this

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.749 
come a long way from just being this
brute<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.110> ali's<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.830> know<00:01:22.950> slashing<00:01:23.490> people
