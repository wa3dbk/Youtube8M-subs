00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.020
 original 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:21.700
 books you do not need to purify the 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:24.430
 food a disease used poorly 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.290
 they use jail ill then you have to 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.560
 understand the fuel element for the 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.560
 body 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.960
 we can 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.640
 good 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.760
 actually we have more but I want 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:48.210
 that are well of the stomach then 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:54.100
 so much fat that we keep trying to 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.650
 start with debugging the we were going 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.409
 entering people with the first level 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:04.800
 detoxification four days and in 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.800
 reality sub-17 all week 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.650
 one month seven days is so terrible and 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.090
 also this we can have at home not 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.220
 they are complicated things 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.460
 then how do we cook food 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.220
 this is the most important thing going for kiln 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.100
 grill and noisy mobile to take out clothes 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.830
 nothing would shimmer of scriptures what 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.770
 What we can do is aluminum foil 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.770
 tomato section cook 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.850
 above 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.760
 we go with the second plate that is to say that 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.670
 seasoning to use that are spices 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.720
 lemon or vinegar seeds because it's more 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.720
 toxic 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.640
 so lemons more debugging counting 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.780
 olive oil this is the main thing of 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.780
 this plan use 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.670
 the oil that will be made to settle 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.250
 isolate the salt in cooking the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.640
 food lady do not put salt or in 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.220
 Soup 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.500
 rest and natal when we left the plate 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.750
 we try and if necessary we go a 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.459
 little do they know how much salt 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.459
 we should with him 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.459
 and that dream in the day here we have to 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.440
 distribute that because we the 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.209
 fans and you can also fall partly to 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.730
 hypertension cardiovascular problems 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.080
 a lot of things I go with the other 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.020
 silver and now we start with the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.560
 detoxification one for remedies 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.810
 natural 4 bottles of water per day 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.810
 we have homemade vegetables 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.120
 we expose a pot of water and all the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.959
 norms that we feel like eating but 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.780
 the couples also sell us 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.400
 cut and we do not have time to 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.989
 cut them we buy it good 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.060
 which we have put trays in the water 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.050
 and the querétaro we have carrot 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.680
 pumpkin 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.680
 final 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:18.730
 we let the water be leaving if not 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.799
 we take a plate before the meal 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.830
 Main lunch and before 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:26.470
 dinner this is totally depurative 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.599
 detoxifying vegetable soup 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.970
 then we have you natural style 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.579
 this natural style without getting 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.879
 dietetics make a hand puñadito 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:39.430
 We put in the ironing cup for 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:42.250
 nothing and the 'free pull so that they arrive 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.840
 the bitter - to lower anxiety and 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.609
 also in those of the digestive system to 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.890
 people eat very well 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.140
 who adopts this style does not leave it anymore 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.629
 so ladies of tibet and what is 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.980
 terrific which is a black dagger not 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.319
 it's only to calm down but for the 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.090
 digestion and for me the team areas 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.579
 of sauce a lot politiken the bring it 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.110
 easily I pack that boston the same 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.790
 because it is more effective than natural 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.150
 the sachet if you do not have time is 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.550
 working with stressed if three and if 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.990
 he does not make a handful with his hand 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.210
 put many because if not if they are going to 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.440
 sleep by a handful of hand 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.470
 and then finally the gelatin 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.450
 dietetics do not eat all three serve as 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.430
 a means for anxiety are remedies 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.710
 natural I mean I have an attack of 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.230
 anger anxiety to bore you for 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.630
 eat a lot 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.090
 to calm down exactly and it also has 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.950
 protein and water if we protest 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.600
 detoxifies by selecting the organism 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.790
 then everything that is water is going to 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.780
 debugging will be easier and all that 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.780
 tour will also help us 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.680
 after we have already olive and we go with 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.560
 the citrus because citrus to see 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.950
 have vitamin c if they help you too 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.350
 debug the organism 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.030
 trustees we have strawberries also if 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.020
 they look in the tortilla do not buy 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.020
 strawberries we have 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:59.609
 and the kiwi 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.280
 why 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.750
 every day we hardly get up 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.940
 we take a glass of cold water and to 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.060
 detoxify the first thing we do and 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:24.250
 then one last one and we eat it this 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.250

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.520
 understand that it is part of life and 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.290
 we have to feed ourselves well because the 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.550
 good organisms spend bill 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.550
 aside how do you see yourself it's about 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:50.169
 it's important because we are 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:50.169
 lifelong 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.419
 diabetes hypertension high cholesterol 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.419
 all together 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.300
 3 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:10.240
 do not eat or meat in this 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.240
 detox tell us more business
