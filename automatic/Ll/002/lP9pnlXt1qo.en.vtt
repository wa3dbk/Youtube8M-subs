the<00:01:52.319> I<00:01:53.750> just<00:01:54.750> want<00:01:54.959> to<00:01:55.049> say<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.709> planes

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the I just want to say that the planes

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.130 
the I just want to say that the planes
which<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:56.579> see<00:01:56.759> over<00:01:56.880> here<00:01:57.030> their<00:01:57.869> color

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
which you can see over here their color

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.229 
which you can see over here their color
need<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.709> be<00:01:58.860> changed<00:01:59.369> every<00:01:59.549> time<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.209> open

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.239 
need to be changed every time you open

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:03.620 
need to be changed every time you open
up<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.869> file<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.009> main<00:02:02.189> thing<00:02:02.489> is<00:02:02.819> if<00:02:03.299> I

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
up a file so the main thing is if I

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.279 
up a file so the main thing is if I
click<00:02:03.929> close<00:02:04.079> over<00:02:04.439> here<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:05.509> if<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.659> open<00:02:06.869> up<00:02:07.079> a

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
click close over here and if I open up a

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.750 
click close over here and if I open up a
new<00:02:07.530> design<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:10.709> color<00:02:10.950> which<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.489> set

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
new design the color which I have set

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.400 
new design the color which I have set
for<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.120> sketch<00:02:12.360> as<00:02:12.660> well<00:02:13.200> as<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
for this sketch as well as the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.440 
for this sketch as well as the
background<00:02:13.829> remains<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.310> same<00:02:14.519> whereas<00:02:15.299> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
background remains the same whereas the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.319 
background remains the same whereas the
color<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.019> plane<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.530> always<00:02:16.769> white<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:18.000> if

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
color of the plane is always white so if

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.699 
color of the plane is always white so if
you're<00:02:18.510> comfortable<00:02:18.750> making<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.470> white<00:02:19.680> to

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
you're comfortable making it white to

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.670 
you're comfortable making it white to
say<00:02:20.090> I'll<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.359> change<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.079> color<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.380> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
say I'll just change the color of the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.910 
say I'll just change the color of the
claim<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.480> way<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.019> changing<00:02:25.739> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
claim this is a way of changing the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.319 
claim this is a way of changing the
color<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.340> plane<00:02:26.549> if<00:02:26.790> at<00:02:26.910> all<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.180> require

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
color of the plane if at all you require

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.270 
color of the plane if at all you require
so<00:02:28.230> I'm<00:02:28.319> going<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.560> change<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.889> color<00:02:29.069> of<00:02:29.130> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
so I'm going to change the color of the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.809 
so I'm going to change the color of the
white<00:02:29.459> color<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.239> plane<00:02:30.450> go<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.549> graphics<00:02:32.549> and

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
white color the plane go to graphics and

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.770 
white color the plane go to graphics and
you<00:02:33.180> can<00:02:33.329> see<00:02:33.510> lines<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.989> curves<00:02:34.459> just<00:02:35.780> select

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
you can see lines and curves just select

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.860 
you can see lines and curves just select
different<00:02:37.139> color<00:02:37.290> for<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.819> so<00:02:38.819> maybe<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.150> dark

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
different color for this so maybe a dark

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.440 
different color for this so maybe a dark
blue<00:02:40.579> click<00:02:41.579> on<00:02:41.700> over<00:02:41.850> here<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.180> see<00:02:42.329> the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
blue click on over here you can see the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.900 
blue click on over here you can see the
color<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.870> plane<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.530> being<00:02:43.709> changed<00:02:43.920> so

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
color of the plane is being changed so

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.789 
color of the plane is being changed so
the<00:02:45.269> main<00:02:45.480> thing<00:02:45.780> which<00:02:46.109> you<00:02:46.319> should<00:02:46.500> keep<00:02:46.650> in

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
the main thing which you should keep in

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.039 
the main thing which you should keep in
your<00:02:46.920> mind<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.400> don't<00:02:47.850> expect<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.420> color<00:02:48.780> of

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
your mind is don't expect the color of

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.220 
your mind is don't expect the color of
the<00:02:49.200> plane<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:50.370> be<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:51.450> same<00:02:51.690> when<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:51.989> open

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
the plane to be the same when you open

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.199 
the plane to be the same when you open
up<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.380> new<00:02:52.500> file<00:02:52.769> so<00:02:53.519> when<00:02:53.639> you<00:02:53.730> open<00:02:53.910> up<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.090> new

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
up a new file so when you open up a new

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.589 
up a new file so when you open up a new
file<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:55.109> color<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.560> plane<00:02:56.389> remains<00:02:57.389> as

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
file the color of the plane remains as

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.300 
file the color of the plane remains as
white<00:02:57.840> but<00:02:58.139> whereas<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.560> other<00:02:58.680> options<00:02:59.160> it

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
white but whereas the other options it

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.479 
white but whereas the other options it
remains<00:02:59.670> different<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:01.290> sometimes<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.370> is

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
remains different so sometimes it is

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.030 
remains different so sometimes it is
really<00:03:02.880> cumbersome<00:03:03.389> to<00:03:03.660> change<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.859> color

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
really cumbersome to change the color

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.289 
really cumbersome to change the color
the<00:03:05.220> plane<00:03:05.430> every<00:03:05.670> time<00:03:05.849> you<00:03:05.970> create<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.269> new

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
the plane every time you create a new

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.729 
the plane every time you create a new
plane<00:03:06.630> because<00:03:06.959> every<00:03:07.200> time<00:03:07.319> you<00:03:07.440> create<00:03:07.620> a

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
plane because every time you create a

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.379 
plane because every time you create a
new<00:03:07.829> plane<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.609> plane<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.940> going<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.209> get

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
new plane the plane is going to get

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.530 
new plane the plane is going to get
created<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.900> white<00:03:10.049> color<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:11.359> keep<00:03:12.359> this

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
created and the white color so keep this

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.420 
created and the white color so keep this
point<00:03:12.840> indium<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.500> your<00:03:13.650> mind<00:03:13.889> before

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
point indium in your mind before

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.059 
point indium in your mind before
changing<00:03:14.880> the

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
changing the

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.600 
changing the
the<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.840> colors<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.739> is<00:03:18.920> preferences

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
the the colors and the is preferences

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.880 
the the colors and the is preferences
and<00:03:19.819> if<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.659> all<00:03:20.780> required<00:03:21.200> this<00:03:21.530> is<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.799> way

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
and if it all required this is the way

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.399 
and if it all required this is the way
you<00:03:21.950> can<00:03:22.159> change<00:03:22.459> it<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.180> hope<00:03:23.390> you<00:03:23.629> enjoyed

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
you can change it so I hope you enjoyed

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.110 
you can change it so I hope you enjoyed
this<00:03:24.560> tutorial<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:25.010> hope<00:03:25.220> this<00:03:25.610> tutorial<00:03:25.790> is

going to help for some of the people who

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.569 
going to help for some of the people who
are<00:03:27.920> looking<00:03:28.430> for<00:03:28.760> changing<00:03:29.030> colors<00:03:29.390> and

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
are looking for changing colors and

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.800 
are looking for changing colors and
that's<00:03:31.579> all<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.060> thank<00:03:32.299> you<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:32.540> much<00:03:32.690> for
