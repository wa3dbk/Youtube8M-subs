00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.700
Rise up, Argent Crusaders!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.300
The hour of justice has come!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.400
Can you feel it, my son,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.100
closing in all around you?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.700
The Light's justice has been awakened

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.200
The sins of the past

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.800
have finally caught up to you.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.000
You will be called to account

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.300
for all the atrocities you've committed

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.300
the unspeakable horrors you've let loose upon this world

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.400
and the dark, ancient powers you've enslaved.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.600
Though my soul was one of the first

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.000
to be devoured by your evil

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.800
there are thousands more bound within this blade

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.100
and they cry out ... for release!

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.500
Look now to your defenses, my son

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.800
for the champions of justice gather at your gates!

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.200
Let them come.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.300
Frostmourne hungers.
