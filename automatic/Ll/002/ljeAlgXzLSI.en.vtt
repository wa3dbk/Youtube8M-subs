vision system predominantly the big

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.040 
vision system predominantly the big
thing<00:00:34.950> I'm<00:00:35.070> interested<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.700> how<00:00:35.850> we

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
thing I'm interested in is how we

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.420 
thing I'm interested in is how we
respond<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.230> moving<00:00:37.590> targets<00:00:37.980> how<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.100> process

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
respond to moving targets how we process

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.770 
respond to moving targets how we process
the<00:00:38.730> visual<00:00:38.850> information<00:00:39.450> from<00:00:39.600> moving

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the visual information from moving

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.990 
the visual information from moving
targets<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.469> then<00:00:40.890> from<00:00:41.309> there<00:00:41.489> how<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:41.879> we

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
targets and then from there how do we

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.819 
targets and then from there how do we
make<00:00:42.239> large<00:00:42.629> whole-body<00:00:43.170> coordinated

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
make large whole-body coordinated

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.220

like<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.939> what's<00:01:30.299> called<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.540> bas

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
like that we have a what's called a bas

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.109 
like that we have a what's called a bas
an<00:01:30.900> anticipation<00:01:31.350> timer<00:01:31.759> which<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> long

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
an anticipation timer which is a long

an anticipation timer which is a long
track<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.630> lights<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.170> move<00:01:34.259> along<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
track with lights that move along it and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.289 
track with lights that move along it and
we<00:01:35.250> use<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.610> actually<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.030> work<00:01:36.150> with

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
we use that actually to work with

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.850 
we use that actually to work with
athletes<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.720> how<00:01:36.869> they<00:01:36.990> anticipate<00:01:37.500> motion

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
athletes and how they anticipate motion

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.039 
athletes and how they anticipate motion
whether<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> ball<00:01:39.659> coming<00:01:39.930> towards

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
whether it be like a ball coming towards

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.440 
whether it be like a ball coming towards
them<00:01:40.590> or<00:01:40.920> someone<00:01:41.700> moving<00:01:41.970> towards<00:01:42.329> them

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
them or someone moving towards them

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.910 
them or someone moving towards them
running<00:01:42.750> towards<00:01:43.079> them<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.439> then<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> last

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
running towards them and then the last

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.440 
running towards them and then the last
piece<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.280> big<00:01:44.490> equipment<00:01:44.700> use<00:01:45.000> really<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.329> an

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
piece of big equipment use really is an

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
piece of big equipment use really is an
eye<00:01:45.570> tracker<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.680> allows<00:01:46.950> us<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.280> track

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
eye tracker and it allows us to track

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.710 
eye tracker and it allows us to track
where<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> athletes<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.390> actually<00:01:48.630> looking

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
where the athletes are actually looking

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.719 
where the athletes are actually looking
so<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.110> position<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.560> both<00:01:49.680> our<00:01:49.829> eyes<00:01:49.950> as<00:01:50.220> well

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
so the position in both our eyes as well

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.859 
so the position in both our eyes as well
as<00:01:50.850> what<00:01:50.970> they're<00:01:51.060> looking<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.720> there's

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
as what they're looking at so there's

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.120 
as what they're looking at so there's
three<00:01:52.020> cameras<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.590> system

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
three cameras on that system

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.980 
three cameras on that system
I'll<00:01:53.460> get<00:01:53.640> them<00:01:53.729> athletes<00:01:54.119> or<00:01:54.390> anyone<00:01:54.810> where

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
I'll get them athletes or anyone where

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
I'll get them athletes or anyone where
that<00:01:55.170> when<00:01:55.320> they're<00:01:55.439> performing<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.920> task<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
that when they're performing a task and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.560 
that when they're performing a task and
see<00:01:56.610> what<00:01:56.729> they're<00:01:56.880> looking<00:01:57.119> at<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.270> how

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
see what they're looking at and how

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.179 
see what they're looking at and how
they're<00:01:58.229> collecting<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.649> information<00:01:58.770> that

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
they're collecting the information that

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.130 
they're collecting the information that
visual<00:01:59.369> information<00:01:59.520> is

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
visual information is

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.660 
visual information is
we're<00:02:00.740> trying<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:00.950> understand<00:02:01.250> what's<00:02:01.370> normal

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
we're trying to understand what's normal

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.480 
we're trying to understand what's normal
first<00:02:01.910> from<00:02:02.780> there<00:02:02.930> we<00:02:03.110> can<00:02:03.230> start<00:02:03.490> targeting

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
first from there we can start targeting

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.700 
first from there we can start targeting
specific<00:02:05.420> questions<00:02:05.810> like<00:02:05.960> can<00:02:06.320> we<00:02:06.470> train

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
specific questions like can we train

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.680 
specific questions like can we train
particular<00:02:07.310> vision<00:02:07.520> tasks<00:02:08.090> if<00:02:08.240> we<00:02:08.390> turn<00:02:08.539> the
