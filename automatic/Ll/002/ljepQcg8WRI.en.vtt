thing that happens as you're beating is

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.660 
thing that happens as you're beating is
that<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.759> mixture<00:00:12.830> becomes<00:00:13.830> thicker<00:00:14.280> as<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
that the mixture becomes thicker as the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.109 
that the mixture becomes thicker as the
flour<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.540> added<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:16.340> then<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:17.550> sometimes

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
flour is added and then it's sometimes

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.060 
flour is added and then it's sometimes
difficult<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:20.720> remove<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.960> here's<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.710> secret

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
difficult to remove it here's a secret

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.810 
difficult to remove it here's a secret
if<00:00:23.810> you<00:00:24.810> gently<00:00:25.680> raise<00:00:26.510> the<00:00:27.510> beater<00:00:27.750> and

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
if you gently raise the beater and

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.209 
if you gently raise the beater and

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
accelerate a little bit the centrifugal

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.549 
accelerate a little bit the centrifugal
force<00:00:34.790> will<00:00:35.790> send<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.300> lot<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> batter<00:00:37.020> off

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
force will send a lot of the batter off

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.619 
force will send a lot of the batter off
to<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.399> side<00:00:38.960> into<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.350> pan<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.329> it

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
to the side into the pan so that it

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.510 
to the side into the pan so that it
makes<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.079> scraping<00:00:43.590> job<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.370> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
do a little bit easier most of the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.750 
do a little bit easier most of the
batter<00:00:48.600> will<00:00:48.960> wind<00:00:49.590> up<00:00:49.800> where<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.129> belongs<00:00:50.460> but

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
batter will wind up where it belongs but

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.220 
batter will wind up where it belongs but
you<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.120> want<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.420> leave<00:00:51.629> any<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
like to lick the batter's then you can

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.900
