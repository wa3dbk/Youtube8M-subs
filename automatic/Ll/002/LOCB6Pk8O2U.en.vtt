00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
order to make Hydra you want to make

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.580 
order to make Hydra you want to make
sure<00:03:42.129> you<00:03:42.310> take<00:03:42.489> small<00:03:42.639> sizes<00:03:43.530> like<00:03:44.530> small

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
sure you take small sizes like small

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.699 
sure you take small sizes like small
bite<00:03:45.099> size<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:46.329> can<00:03:46.509> do<00:03:46.689> medium<00:03:47.199> if<00:03:47.349> you<00:03:47.500> like

bite size you can do medium if you like
so<00:03:48.040> first<00:03:48.310> I'm<00:03:48.459> going<00:03:48.639> to<00:03:48.699> take<00:03:48.879> like<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.150> really

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:49.479

so first I'm going to take like a really
small<00:03:49.689> sizes<00:03:50.199> here<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:50.769> make<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.519> into<00:03:51.759> a<00:03:51.790> roll

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
small sizes here and make it into a roll

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.020 
small sizes here and make it into a roll
and<00:03:52.329> leave<00:03:53.079> them<00:03:53.319> on<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.680> other<00:03:53.799> plate<00:03:54.159> so<00:03:54.969> I'm

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
and leave them on the other plate so I'm

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.839 
and leave them on the other plate so I'm
going<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.239> continue<00:03:55.540> with<00:03:55.780> that

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.399 

now<00:04:00.849> because<00:04:01.209> this<00:04:01.480> recipe<00:04:02.079> is<00:04:02.170> very

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
now because this recipe is very

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.259 
now because this recipe is very
traditional<00:04:02.709> when<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.370> comes<00:04:03.609> to<00:04:03.849> the<00:04:03.939> shape

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
traditional when it comes to the shape

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.949 
traditional when it comes to the shape
of<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.870> Rogers<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:06.730> need<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.359> have<00:04:07.599> some

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
of the Rogers so you need to have some

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.089 
of the Rogers so you need to have some
sort<00:04:08.260> of<00:04:08.969> strainer<00:04:09.969> or<00:04:10.329> colander<00:04:11.079> it's<00:04:11.769> one<00:04:11.950> of

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
sort of strainer or colander it's one of

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.520 
sort of strainer or colander it's one of
these<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.579> bought<00:04:13.150> this<00:04:13.390> one<00:04:13.689> it<00:04:13.930> doesn't<00:04:14.290> help

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
these I bought this one it doesn't help

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.279 
these I bought this one it doesn't help
because<00:04:15.010> you<00:04:15.159> need<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.609> the<00:04:16.449> square<00:04:16.780> holes<00:04:17.049> to

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
because you need the the square holes to

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.550 
because you need the the square holes to
be<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.680> size<00:04:18.519> of<00:04:18.729> this<00:04:19.060> so<00:04:19.900> when<00:04:20.019> I<00:04:20.049> bought<00:04:20.289> this

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
be a size of this so when I bought this

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.010 
be a size of this so when I bought this
one<00:04:20.949> you<00:04:21.669> see<00:04:22.000> this<00:04:22.120> cross<00:04:22.419> over<00:04:22.840> this

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
one you see this cross over this

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.629 
one you see this cross over this
shouldn't<00:04:23.320> have<00:04:23.440> been<00:04:23.620> there<00:04:23.830> so<00:04:24.160> now<00:04:24.340> I<00:04:24.370> have

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
shouldn't have been there so now I have

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.640 
shouldn't have been there so now I have
a<00:04:24.669> no<00:04:24.880> tries<00:04:25.150> I<00:04:25.180> have<00:04:25.419> to<00:04:25.570> use<00:04:25.750> this<00:04:25.990> part<00:04:26.320> of<00:04:26.470> it

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
a no tries I have to use this part of it

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.529 
a no tries I have to use this part of it
these<00:04:27.160> parts<00:04:27.580> don't<00:04:27.759> work<00:04:27.880> at<00:04:28.210> all

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
these parts don't work at all

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.210 
these parts don't work at all
so<00:04:28.930> you<00:04:29.020> need<00:04:29.169> something<00:04:29.380> like<00:04:29.560> this<00:04:29.889> you<00:04:30.070> need

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
so you need something like this you need

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.950 
so you need something like this you need
to<00:04:30.370> buy<00:04:30.520> you<00:04:30.580> need<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.210> plastic<00:04:31.630> ones<00:04:31.810> are

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
shape of the hajdu here because I don't

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.279 
shape of the hajdu here because I don't
have<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.020> right<00:04:47.520> strainer<00:04:48.520> or<00:04:48.880> colander<00:04:49.660> here

have the right strainer or colander here

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.860 
have the right strainer or colander here
so<00:04:50.889> what<00:04:51.580> we<00:04:51.729> have<00:04:51.880> to<00:04:52.030> do<00:04:52.150> basically<00:04:52.270> take<00:04:52.750> the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
so what we have to do basically take the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.529 
so what we have to do basically take the
dough<00:04:53.050> you<00:04:53.650> know<00:04:53.940> stretch<00:04:54.940> it<00:04:55.090> a<00:04:55.150> little<00:04:55.180> bit

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
dough you know stretch it a little bit

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.730 
dough you know stretch it a little bit
to<00:04:55.990> fit<00:04:56.199> your<00:04:56.380> two<00:04:56.620> to<00:04:56.770> three<00:04:56.979> fingers<00:04:58.740> about

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
to fit your two to three fingers about

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.879 
to fit your two to three fingers about
this<00:04:59.919> much<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:00.970> then<00:05:01.479> you<00:05:01.660> see<00:05:01.870> these<00:05:02.080> these

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
this much and then you see these these

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.189 
this much and then you see these these
square<00:05:03.220> ones<00:05:03.520> here<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:04.030> dots<00:05:04.240> you're<00:05:05.050> going

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
square ones here the dots you're going

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.800 
square ones here the dots you're going
to<00:05:05.289> place<00:05:05.530> it<00:05:05.560> on<00:05:05.770> top<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.460> pull<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.300> towards

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
to place it on top and pull it towards

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.589 
to place it on top and pull it towards
you<00:05:08.110> so<00:05:09.010> you<00:05:09.070> need<00:05:09.280> to<00:05:09.430> get<00:05:09.610> a<00:05:09.639> shape<00:05:10.270> something

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
you so you need to get a shape something

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.320 
you so you need to get a shape something
like<00:05:11.020> this<00:05:11.260> okay<00:05:12.130> so<00:05:12.699> now<00:05:12.820> I<00:05:12.849> don't<00:05:13.000> have<00:05:13.120> to

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
like this okay so now I don't have to

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.760 
like this okay so now I don't have to
write<00:05:13.510> one<00:05:13.720> here<00:05:13.990> so<00:05:14.110> I<00:05:14.169> need<00:05:14.289> to<00:05:14.380> play<00:05:14.560> around

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
write one here so I need to play around

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.040 
write one here so I need to play around
to<00:05:15.039> get<00:05:15.220> to<00:05:15.760> get<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.270> boat<00:05:16.449> shapes<00:05:16.720> on<00:05:16.870> both

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
to get to get the boat shapes on both

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.830 
to get to get the boat shapes on both
sides<00:05:17.349> and<00:05:17.680> you<00:05:18.220> simply<00:05:18.669> leave<00:05:18.849> it<00:05:19.060> something

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
sides and you simply leave it something

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.810 
sides and you simply leave it something
like<00:05:19.870> that<00:05:20.260> and<00:05:20.530> we're<00:05:20.919> going<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.220> fry<00:05:21.699> this

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
like that and we're going to fry this

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.939 
like that and we're going to fry this
okay<00:05:22.479> so<00:05:22.539> just<00:05:22.930> to<00:05:23.020> give<00:05:23.199> you<00:05:23.229> a<00:05:23.349> quick<00:05:23.500> demo

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.279 

now<00:05:26.949> I<00:05:26.979> prepare<00:05:27.520> them<00:05:27.789> I<00:05:28.030> try<00:05:28.630> to<00:05:28.690> give<00:05:28.990> the

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
now I prepare them I try to give the

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.680 
now I prepare them I try to give the
shape<00:05:29.650> but<00:05:29.979> it<00:05:30.250> fades<00:05:30.729> away<00:05:30.940> so<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:31.539> best

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
shape but it fades away so the best

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.310 
shape but it fades away so the best
option<00:05:31.900> is<00:05:32.259> to<00:05:32.590> to<00:05:33.400> take<00:05:33.430> it<00:05:33.820> back<00:05:34.320> immediately

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
option is to to take it back immediately

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.790 
option is to to take it back immediately
once<00:05:36.280> you<00:05:36.460> make<00:05:36.940> the<00:05:37.120> shape<00:05:37.500> okay<00:05:38.500> and<00:05:38.680> then

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
once you make the shape okay and then

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.920 
once you make the shape okay and then
just<00:05:38.949> drop<00:05:39.220> it<00:05:39.400> to<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:39.550> oil<00:05:39.849> that's<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.720> best

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
just drop it to the oil that's the best

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.420 
just drop it to the oil that's the best
way<00:05:41.110> to<00:05:41.139> do<00:05:41.409> it

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.730 

just<00:05:46.180> make<00:05:46.389> sure<00:05:46.419> that<00:05:46.810> your<00:05:47.139> heat<00:05:47.350> is<00:05:47.500> on

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
medium and make sure that oil is hot

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.920 
medium and make sure that oil is hot
enough<00:05:50.199> before<00:05:50.590> you<00:05:51.000> place<00:05:52.000> the<00:05:52.300> huggers<00:05:52.720> in

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
enough before you place the huggers in

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.010 
enough before you place the huggers in
there<00:05:53.169> and<00:05:53.410> once<00:05:54.220> you<00:05:54.400> drop<00:05:54.669> them<00:05:54.880> put<00:05:55.780> your

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
there and once you drop them put your

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.350 
there and once you drop them put your
heat<00:05:56.259> closer<00:05:56.680> to<00:05:57.039> a<00:05:57.070> low<00:05:57.430> because<00:05:57.789> you<00:05:58.000> want<00:05:58.270> to

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
heat closer to a low because you want to

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.790 
heat closer to a low because you want to
make<00:05:58.509> sure<00:05:58.539> that<00:05:58.870> they're<00:05:59.080> fried<00:05:59.440> properly

and they're not raw from inside once you

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.310
