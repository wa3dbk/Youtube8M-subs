00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.179 
so one cup has a 42 grams of sugar and
you<00:02:50.120> can<00:02:50.390> use<00:02:50.540> 1<00:02:50.750> cup<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:51.170> guess<00:02:51.349> but<00:02:51.530> uh<00:02:51.590> I

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
you can use 1 cup I guess but uh I

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:53.800 
you can use 1 cup I guess but uh I
didn't<00:02:52.819> really<00:02:52.909> measure<00:02:53.090> back<00:02:53.390> then<00:02:53.599> and

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
didn't really measure back then and

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.319 
didn't really measure back then and
right<00:02:54.049> now<00:02:54.230> we<00:02:54.290> probably<00:02:54.680> use<00:02:54.859> 2<00:02:55.099> cups<00:02:55.329> cuz

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
right now we probably use 2 cups cuz

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.940 
right now we probably use 2 cups cuz
then<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.719> burn<00:02:56.870> them<00:02:57.079> anyway<00:02:57.409> in<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.620> workout

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
then you burn them anyway in the workout

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.940 
then you burn them anyway in the workout
and<00:02:58.159> you<00:02:58.280> need<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.549> carbs<00:02:58.760> when<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.450> train<00:02:59.950> so

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
and you need the carbs when you train so

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.190 
and you need the carbs when you train so
uh<00:03:01.329> 510<00:03:02.329> grams<00:03:02.799> with<00:03:03.799> 1<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.430> 2<00:03:04.459> cup<00:03:04.760> of<00:03:04.939> the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200
