was having trouble with let's say

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.630 
was having trouble with let's say

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
convergence because it's a lost screen

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.280 
convergence because it's a lost screen
tweak<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.299> was<00:02:22.450> locked<00:02:22.690> out<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.870> my<00:02:22.989> device

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
tweak and I was locked out of my device

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.809 
tweak and I was locked out of my device
because<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.739> kept<00:02:23.890> freezing<00:02:24.160> or<00:02:24.519> for<00:02:24.670> whatever

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
because it kept freezing or for whatever

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.729 
because it kept freezing or for whatever
reason<00:02:25.000> then<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.840> can<00:02:25.989> just<00:02:26.140> jump<00:02:26.290> in<00:02:26.410> here<00:02:26.530> go

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
reason then you can just jump in here go

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.069 
reason then you can just jump in here go
into<00:02:26.920> manage<00:02:27.400> go<00:02:27.849> to<00:02:27.910> packages<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.690> then

scroll<00:02:29.440> down<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:30.000> convergence<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:32.140> modify<00:02:32.680> and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
scroll down to convergence it modify and

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.979 
scroll down to convergence it modify and
then<00:02:33.010> remove<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.000> then<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.540> won't<00:02:34.690> have<00:02:34.780> that

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
then remove and then you won't have that
