keyboards<00:02:03.850> I've<00:02:03.939> used<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.360> think<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.979> highly

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
keyboards I've used I think and highly

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.559 
keyboards I've used I think and highly
customisable<00:02:06.640> pretty<00:02:06.880> much<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.450> know

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
customisable pretty much you know

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.449 
customisable pretty much you know
anything<00:02:07.869> you<00:02:07.929> can<00:02:08.050> think<00:02:08.289> of<00:02:08.380> is<00:02:08.769> on<00:02:09.069> there<00:02:09.280> so

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
anything you can think of is on there so

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.940 
anything you can think of is on there so
on<00:02:10.360> it's<00:02:10.899> got<00:02:11.019> many<00:02:11.140> things<00:02:11.440> as<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.590> can<00:02:11.739> see

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
on it's got many things as you can see

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.190 
on it's got many things as you can see
but<00:02:12.130> I<00:02:12.190> just<00:02:12.370> chose<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.790> windows<00:02:13.090> 8<00:02:13.300> theme

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
but I just chose the windows 8 theme

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.020 
but I just chose the windows 8 theme
[Music]

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.940 

so<00:02:18.360> moving<00:02:18.540> along<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.620> an<00:02:19.740> app<00:02:19.920> called

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
so moving along this is an app called

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.930 
so moving along this is an app called
Windows<00:02:20.940> Phone<00:02:21.150> 7<00:02:21.390> contact<00:02:21.870> it's<00:02:22.850> once<00:02:23.850> again

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
Windows Phone 7 contact it's once again

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.780 
Windows Phone 7 contact it's once again
another<00:02:24.710> Windows<00:02:25.710> Phone<00:02:25.890> 7<00:02:26.070> feel<00:02:26.400> for<00:02:26.670> your

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
another Windows Phone 7 feel for your

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.880 
another Windows Phone 7 feel for your
contacts<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:28.170> complete<00:02:28.530> with<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
contacts and it's complete with the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.850 
contacts and it's complete with the
sliding<00:02:29.450> animation<00:02:30.450> since<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.410> new<00:02:31.560> update

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
sliding animation since the new update

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.800 
sliding animation since the new update
so<00:02:32.070> it's<00:02:32.250> quite<00:02:32.430> good<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.820> like<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.570> and

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
so it's quite good I like this and

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.740 
so it's quite good I like this and
recommend<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.290> as<00:02:34.410> well

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.690 

this<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:39.560> another<00:02:39.770> app<00:02:39.950> called<00:02:39.980> my<00:02:40.310> settings

called astro file manager I think it's

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.960 
called astro file manager I think it's
the<00:02:54.620> best<00:02:54.800> file<00:02:55.070> manager<00:02:55.400> out<00:02:55.550> there<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:55.940> I
