a sensor kit like this on a Fiat 500 but

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.269 
a sensor kit like this on a Fiat 500 but
it<00:00:28.109> really<00:00:28.230> does<00:00:28.439> make<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.650> difference<00:00:28.769> when<00:00:29.189> it

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
it really does make a difference when it

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.910 
it really does make a difference when it
comes<00:00:29.310> down<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.990> knowing<00:00:30.990> your<00:00:31.380> surroundings

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
on these cars because they do have

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.250 
on these cars because they do have
pretty<00:00:33.120> large<00:00:33.300> blind<00:00:33.600> spots

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260

vehicle<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:43.979> park<00:01:44.430> right<00:01:44.700> now<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.720> if<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.990> were

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
vehicle in park right now but if I were

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.319 
vehicle in park right now but if I were
to<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.220> Drive<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:47.820> even<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:48.180> sitting

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
to have it in Drive or even just sitting

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.120 
to have it in Drive or even just sitting
here<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.750> turned<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.229> turn<00:01:49.680> signal<00:01:50.040> on

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
here and I turned the turn signal on

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.310 
here and I turned the turn signal on
it's<00:01:51.090> telling<00:01:51.390> me<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.659> there's<00:01:51.840> an<00:01:51.960> obstacle

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
it's telling me that there's an obstacle

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.230 
it's telling me that there's an obstacle
in<00:01:52.560> my<00:01:52.590> blind<00:01:52.860> spot<00:01:53.130> by<00:01:53.430> flashing<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.149> by

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
in my blind spot by flashing and by

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.090 
in my blind spot by flashing and by
beeping<00:01:54.689> now<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.350> walls<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> bunch

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
beeping now I have the walls and a bunch

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.560 
beeping now I have the walls and a bunch
of<00:01:56.219> debris<00:01:56.369> around<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.939> vehicle<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.479> that's

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
of debris around the vehicle so that's

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.420 
of debris around the vehicle so that's
why<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:57.960> going<00:01:58.170> off<00:01:58.320> right<00:01:58.560> now<00:01:58.680> but<00:01:59.280> this

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
why it's going off right now but this

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.800 
why it's going off right now but this
gives<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.700> an<00:01:59.820> idea<00:01:59.939> when<00:02:00.360> there<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.659> an

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
gives you an idea when there is an

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.620 
gives you an idea when there is an
obstacle<00:02:01.049> detected<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.219> light<00:02:02.490> lights<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.420> on

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
obstacle detected the light lights up on

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.120 
obstacle detected the light lights up on
either<00:02:03.780> side<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.409> when<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.649> turn<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.860> turn

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
either side and when you turn the turn

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.219 
either side and when you turn the turn
signal<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.450> detects<00:02:06.750> something<00:02:07.020> in

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
signal on if it detects something in

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.760 
signal on if it detects something in
your<00:02:07.320> blind<00:02:07.469> spot

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
your blind spot

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.089 
your blind spot
it<00:02:08.340> turns<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.789> starts<00:02:09.030> blinking

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
it turns on and starts blinking

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.819 
it turns on and starts blinking
for<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:10.909> backup<00:02:11.269> sensor<00:02:11.629> as<00:02:12.230> soon<00:02:12.409> as<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:12.620> put

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829 
for the backup sensor as soon as you put

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:18.309 
for the backup sensor as soon as you put
this<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.159> reverse<00:02:15.639> comes<00:02:16.639> on<00:02:16.849> and<00:02:17.319> it

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
this in reverse comes on and it

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.599 
this in reverse comes on and it
basically<00:02:18.409> shows<00:02:18.739> you<00:02:18.889> there's<00:02:19.249> nothing

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:19.609 
basically shows you there's nothing

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.280 
basically shows you there's nothing
behind<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.939> vehicle<00:02:20.299> now<00:02:20.450> my<00:02:20.599> associate<00:02:21.079> mo

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
behind the vehicle now my associate mo

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.530 
behind the vehicle now my associate mo
is<00:02:21.560> gonna<00:02:21.739> walk<00:02:21.950> behind<00:02:22.159> the<00:02:22.400> vehicle<00:02:22.849> from

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
is gonna walk behind the vehicle from

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.940 
is gonna walk behind the vehicle from
left<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.959> right<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.530> he's<00:02:24.709> gonna<00:02:24.859> show

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
left to right and he's gonna show

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.959 
left to right and he's gonna show
exactly<00:02:25.519> how<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:26.060> triggers<00:02:27.579> who's<00:02:28.579> walking

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:28.969 
exactly how this triggers who's walking

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:30.670 
exactly how this triggers who's walking
from<00:02:29.090> left<00:02:29.359> to<00:02:29.510> right<00:02:29.780> areas<00:02:30.260> in<00:02:30.409> the<00:02:30.469> rearview

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.059 
mirror
and<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.050> gives<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:33.319> an<00:02:33.410> idea<00:02:33.710> on<00:02:33.770> how<00:02:34.010> that

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
and that gives you an idea on how that

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.030 
and that gives you an idea on how that
works<00:02:34.400> now<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:35.690> way<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.140> front<00:02:36.590> sensors

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
works now the way that the front sensors

works now the way that the front sensors
work<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:37.520> it's<00:02:38.300> connected<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.620> the

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
work is it's connected to the to the
