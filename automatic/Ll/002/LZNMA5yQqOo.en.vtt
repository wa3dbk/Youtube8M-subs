of these different statistics and it's

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.399

put you in that game for a reason so

put you in that game for a reason so
you're<00:01:37.560> technically<00:01:37.860> leaving<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> best<00:01:38.549> game

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
could possibly be in at that moment in

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.130 
could possibly be in at that moment in
time<00:01:41.119> however<00:01:42.119> when<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.450> leave<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.750> game

time however when you leave that game

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.649 
time however when you leave that game
and<00:01:43.350> research<00:01:44.009> for<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.700> new<00:01:44.880> game<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.540> gonna

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
and research for a new game it's gonna

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.149 
and research for a new game it's gonna
try<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.079> put<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.290> back<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> because<00:01:47.009> it's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
try and put you back in it because it's

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.530 
try and put you back in it because it's
obviously<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> best<00:01:47.790> connection<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
obviously the best connection and the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.359 
obviously the best connection and the
best<00:01:48.750> overall<00:01:48.930> lobby<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.100> at

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
best overall lobby for you to be in at

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.310 
best overall lobby for you to be in at
that<00:01:50.759> moment<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> game<00:01:51.570> doesn't<00:01:51.869> realize

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that moment but the game doesn't realize

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.319 
that moment but the game doesn't realize
that<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.579> rage<00:01:53.850> quit<00:01:54.119> because<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
that you have just rage quit because you

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.850 
that you have just rage quit because you
don't<00:01:54.570> want<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.290> there

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
don't want to be in there

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.920 
don't want to be in there
it<00:01:56.040> doesn't<00:01:56.340> realize<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.850> however<00:01:57.299> when<00:01:57.840> you

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it doesn't realize that however when you

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.539 
it doesn't realize that however when you
go<00:01:58.079> back<00:01:58.320> into<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.590> Lobby<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.070> likelihood

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
go back into that Lobby the likelihood

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.850 
go back into that Lobby the likelihood
is<00:01:59.700> as<00:01:59.969> David<00:02:00.390> Vonderhaar<00:02:00.810> points<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.469> you're

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
is as David Vonderhaar points out you're

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.200 
is as David Vonderhaar points out you're
probably<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.280> gonna<00:02:02.430> leave<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.759> again

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
probably just gonna leave it again

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.130 
probably just gonna leave it again
because<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.479> don't<00:02:03.630> want<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:03.899> there<00:02:04.079> in

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
because you don't want to be there in

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.810 
because you don't want to be there in
the<00:02:04.200> first<00:02:04.380> place<00:02:04.560> you're<00:02:05.219> gonna<00:02:05.280> stay<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the first place you're gonna stay in the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.300 
the first place you're gonna stay in the
lobby<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.270> not<00:02:06.479> do<00:02:06.689> anything<00:02:06.930> or<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:07.469> start

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
lobby and not do anything or just start

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.100 
lobby and not do anything or just start
creeping<00:02:08.550> your<00:02:08.849> own<00:02:08.970> team<00:02:09.209> members<00:02:09.660> so

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
creeping your own team members so

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.390 
creeping your own team members so
putting<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.440> back<00:02:10.590> into<00:02:10.800> those<00:02:11.009> lobbies

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
putting you back into those lobbies

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.699 
putting you back into those lobbies
isn't<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.910> typically<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> good<00:02:12.720> idea

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
isn't a typically a good idea

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.949 
isn't a typically a good idea
and<00:02:13.920> david<00:02:14.549> vonderhaar<00:02:14.700> realize<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.719> right

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
and david vonderhaar realize this right

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.720 
and david vonderhaar realize this right
so<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.769> way<00:02:16.890> they're<00:02:17.040> going<00:02:17.129> to<00:02:17.189> try<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.579> go

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
so the way they're going to try and go

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.970 
so the way they're going to try and go
around<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:18.269> fix<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.140> at<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.530> moment<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
around to fix this at the moment the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.780 
around to fix this at the moment the
idea<00:02:20.129> is<00:02:20.549> to<00:02:20.760> deep<00:02:21.060> prioritize<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.049> Lobby<00:02:22.319> so

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
idea is to deep prioritize that Lobby so

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.089 
idea is to deep prioritize that Lobby so
despite<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.819> fact<00:02:23.939> that<00:02:24.209> Lobby

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
despite the fact that Lobby

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.750 
despite the fact that Lobby
statistically<00:02:26.099> would<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.430> best<00:02:26.579> Lobby

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
statistically would be the best Lobby

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.069 
statistically would be the best Lobby
for<00:02:26.909> you<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.269> in<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.510> terms<00:02:27.629> of<00:02:27.810> connection

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
for you to be in in terms of connection

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.640 
for you to be in in terms of connection
players<00:02:28.560> etc<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:29.640> will<00:02:30.000> forcibly<00:02:30.870> move<00:02:31.409> that

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
players etc it will forcibly move that

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.500 
players etc it will forcibly move that
Lobby<00:02:31.829> down<00:02:32.219> the<00:02:32.459> ranks<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.879> terms<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.329> which

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
Lobby down the ranks in terms of which

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.420 
Lobby down the ranks in terms of which
games<00:02:33.810> they<00:02:34.049> want<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.319> put<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.400> a

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
games they want to put you in so that a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.879 
games they want to put you in so that a
new<00:02:35.519> Lobby<00:02:36.090> you'll<00:02:36.269> be<00:02:36.420> found<00:02:36.629> first<00:02:37.109> and<00:02:37.469> that

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:37.889 
new Lobby you'll be found first and that

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.949 
new Lobby you'll be found first and that
Lobby<00:02:38.159> you'll<00:02:38.370> be<00:02:38.549> put<00:02:39.000> down<00:02:39.239> in<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.540> ranking

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
Lobby you'll be put down in the ranking

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.500 
Lobby you'll be put down in the ranking
system<00:02:39.989> so<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:40.859> means<00:02:41.099> that<00:02:41.489> like<00:02:42.120> typically<00:02:42.420> a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
system so it means that like typically a

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.209 
system so it means that like typically a
computer<00:02:42.989> wouldn't<00:02:43.200> understand<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.950> kind

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
computer wouldn't understand that kind

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:46.490 
computer wouldn't understand that kind
of<00:02:44.340> idea<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:44.909> why<00:02:45.150> does<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.599> why<00:02:45.900> do<00:02:45.959> not<00:02:46.290> want

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
of idea like why does it why do not want

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.349 
of idea like why does it why do not want
to<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.859> best<00:02:46.980> knobby<00:02:47.250> possible<00:02:47.819> but

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
to be in the best knobby possible but

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.449 
to be in the best knobby possible but
from<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:49.109> sort<00:02:49.379> of<00:02:49.470> human<00:02:50.099> standpoint

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
from a sort of human standpoint

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.979 
from a sort of human standpoint
obviously<00:02:50.790> you've<00:02:51.120> left<00:02:51.299> that<00:02:51.419> Lobby<00:02:51.720> for<00:02:51.930> a

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
obviously you've left that Lobby for a

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.170 
obviously you've left that Lobby for a
reason<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:53.189> is<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.459> very<00:02:53.730> cool<00:02:53.970> new

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
reason so this is a very cool new
