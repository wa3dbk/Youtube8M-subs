00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.359
 from the writing of parchment truth 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.440
 these are the news highlights of today 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.440
 The first thing I want to say is 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.330
 we have skills that we are now in 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.900
 family normally 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.150
 they lost children I do not know 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.500
 hard 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.349
 and tell them we 're all 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.520
 dismayed we are wrong that is the 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.020
 people of the guard family mind 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.080
 that is in the same situation because 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:33.070
 this happens to us in the consultations 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.070
 daily many 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.370
 actually 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.510
 in the loss of a relative 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.129
 live is not a vitamin 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:48.230
 very difficult to find a place we have 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:54.079
 decided of course 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:58.600
 supports the family you need for the 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.820
 second thing I want to report is that 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.739
 do we had the visit of instructions 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.400
 specials to extend those moments 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.570
 videos 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.570
 that from the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.430
 and one took all the documentation that 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.810
 I belong 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.100
 that is, the prosecution is already 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.100
 intervening in the case 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.600
 and as a third 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.600
 I know I want 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.710
 is to say is that we have started with 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.810
 any process that occurs in the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.880
 hospital the request for 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.100
 the information of what happened to the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.520
 interveners with those who treated the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.520
 patient 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.680
 whereupon the information that we are going to 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.380
 give is 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.740
 until we have the report of the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.740
 medical 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.800
 the solar ray service and people 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.800
 the exams 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:20.260
 we will do that we will give responsibilities to 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:28.250
 from the follow - up report of the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:30.350
 patient because the information of the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.720
 professionals intervene because they have 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.340
 48 hours to report the afternoon 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.250
 on Tuesday morning he has a 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.470
 information the service manager and the 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.720
 america header and effect to 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.670
 we reference this requires an evaluation 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.890
 doctor in the house says that he does not know 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:55.200
 rather give the protocols 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:57.060
 you have until I do not have the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.420
 things and we had to take a measure of 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.730
 responsibility that is the idea of ​​this 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.069
 talk that you know how to inform and 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.459
 wait according to what informs us 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.390
 let's say the patient enters the one 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.390
 I was with the patients 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.850
 at least he knows how long he was in 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.010
 general involved 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.819
 when I have had let's say the 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.600
 observation 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:29.050
 and he was 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.730
 and I want you to understand this 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.820
 protocols that are followed are protocols 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.290
 that are universal, that is, I do many 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.870
 years he was chief of guard before 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.040
 I had cecilia and we were doing exactly 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.560
 the same thing that is done in the hospital 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.210
 fernandez that a trauma center in one 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.250
 of the two center the biggest trauma 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.600
 that in the city buenos aires 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.550
 exactly the same for example I give it 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.850
 example all polytraumatized patients 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.700
 has a chest plate a plate 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.320
 pelvis and a cervical spine plate 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.430
 all polytraumatized patients 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.110
 tend to that they saw this is at level 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.970
 popular that all patients when 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.470
 they receive it when they raise it in their life 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.930
 public they put a necklace called 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.000
 of Philadelphia because it is presupposed that 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.130
 can a cervical lesion be followed 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.110
 all the protocols and we are extremely 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.019
 dismayed with this that happened because of 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.109
 somehow affects us all 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.359
 and talk about what the family to the 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.509
 family is not interested in statistics 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.430
 I think the pain that these people feel 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:29.009
 like dad, you can not imagine what 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.690
 who can feel thanks to them but what 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.900
 that we can assure you that this is 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.970
 everything absolutely this protocolized what 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.039
 what we do and the patient how 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.629
 they treat polytraumatized patients and 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.509
 it is likely that the doctor on duty 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:45.030
 moment considered obvious that what he had 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.470
 was enough in the evaluation and that 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.270
 you will see later is in the anatomy 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.650
 pathological actually in medicine 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.409
 forensics that will inform us of the 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.289
 silver what was the final cause of death 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:58.559
 and I put them to this I insist on the 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:02.860
 years that I have here in infinity of 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:04.569
 experiences for which he is saved here 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.909
 the life of many patients and it is saved 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.889
 permanently things that one says no 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.739
 it may have survived that 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.899
 good for times the devil mind the tail 

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:18.309
 as it happened on the hug me 

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:20.469
 it hurts a lot also is that this 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:23.709
 pain situation of the family the 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:26.440
 they use for a policy really 

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:28.660
 I am hurt price that knows me knows 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.240
 it can not be that this is used 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.140
 health comes saying another protocol never 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.330
 it was an event something I'm wrong about that and 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.289
 here we are working and you know in 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:45.219
 set 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:45.219
 really use this in this situation 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:53.389
 maybe the difference of habits does not 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:57.020
 I understand that is what I want 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:58.729
 transmit a request for reports to 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.270
 hospital and to medicate you are going to 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:05.300
 answer that report request with him 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.950
 not by the institutions but is that with 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.470
 the principality of the patient must 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.240
 answer touch on the community to the 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.830
 family first of the community and 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.280
 then to our leaders of the 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.280
 inside 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:21.220
 but it makes me very bad to do it day 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.770
 that for this situation of using this 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.000
 situation the truth is regrettable and 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.650
 you are also thinking that 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.600
 really like that a human being can not 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.729
 use a situation of this to make of 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.729
 a girl of a daughter I have children 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:45.360
 I want that in my work company that 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:47.520
 we put everything all the work to him daily 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.690
 we can not understand 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:54.479
 doctor from the parchment writing 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:57.169
 true these are the news highlights 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.169
 from today
