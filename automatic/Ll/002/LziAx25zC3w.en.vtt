cyclocross<00:00:13.470> bike<00:00:13.800> which<00:00:14.010> I've<00:00:14.190> converted

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
cyclocross bike which I've converted

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.080 
cyclocross bike which I've converted
into<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.269> roadie<00:00:15.840> at<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.170> moment<00:00:16.880> now<00:00:17.880> as<00:00:17.940> you

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
into a roadie at the moment now as you

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.910 
into a roadie at the moment now as you
can<00:00:18.180> see<00:00:18.240> it's<00:00:19.020> running<00:00:19.440> the<00:00:19.590> ultegra

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
can see it's running the ultegra

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.880 
can see it's running the ultegra
groupset<00:00:20.300> nice<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.570> smooth<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.710> runs

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
groupset nice and smooth and it runs

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.220 
groupset nice and smooth and it runs
like<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.130> dream<00:00:23.510> the<00:00:24.510> other<00:00:24.539> tool<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.140> I'm

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
using is over here it's my new heart

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.269 
using is over here it's my new heart
rate<00:00:28.590> monitor<00:00:29.010> which<00:00:29.340> also<00:00:29.550> monitors<00:00:30.270> my

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
rate monitor which also monitors my

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.660 
rate monitor which also monitors my
cadence<00:00:33.020> average<00:00:34.020> speed<00:00:34.350> per<00:00:34.590> second<00:00:35.010> you

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
cadence average speed per second you

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.889 
cadence average speed per second you
have<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> look<00:00:36.059> over<00:00:36.300> here<00:00:36.329> I've<00:00:36.570> got<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
have a look over here I've got the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.150 
have a look over here I've got the
cadence<00:00:37.320> sensor<00:00:37.980> set<00:00:38.399> up<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.590> also<00:00:40.590> over<00:00:40.980> here

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
cadence sensor set up and also over here

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.780 
cadence sensor set up and also over here
which<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.489> my<00:00:41.670> speed<00:00:42.390> sensor<00:00:42.600> or<00:00:43.290> bipolar<00:00:43.920> it's

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
which is my speed sensor or bipolar it's

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.799 
which is my speed sensor or bipolar it's
