00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
okay I'm just going to do a quick

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.430 
okay I'm just going to do a quick
example<00:00:02.550> solve<00:00:02.850> or<00:00:03.540> walkthrough<00:00:04.049> solve<00:00:04.259> using

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
example solve or walkthrough solve using

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.600 
example solve or walkthrough solve using
the<00:00:04.799> petrous<00:00:05.160> method<00:00:06.529> and<00:00:07.529> i'll<00:00:08.160> post<00:00:08.429> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
the petrous method and i'll post the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.879 
the petrous method and i'll post the
scramble<00:00:09.059> in<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.510> video<00:00:09.809> description<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.710> on

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
scramble in the video description and on

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:29.570 
scramble in the video description and on
the<00:00:10.980> screen<00:00:11.280> so<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.210> can<00:00:12.300> follow<00:00:12.540> along<00:00:28.580> so

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the screen so you can follow along so

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.460 
the screen so you can follow along so
right<00:00:29.970> after<00:00:30.119> scrambling<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.990> first<00:00:31.230> thing<00:00:31.380> I

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
right after scrambling the first thing I

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.299 
right after scrambling the first thing I
see<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.700> pair<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.739> these<00:00:34.739> two<00:00:35.070> edges

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
see is this pair and these two edges

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.010 
see is this pair and these two edges
right<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:37.760> so<00:00:38.760> I'm<00:00:39.149> going<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.390> first<00:00:39.780> build

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
right here so I'm going to first build

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.330 
right here so I'm going to first build
the<00:00:40.410> T<00:00:40.829> by<00:00:40.950> T<00:00:41.010> by<00:00:41.250> T<00:00:41.309> block<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:43.070> I'm<00:00:44.070> going<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
the T by T by T block and I'm going to

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.020 
the T by T by T block and I'm going to
use<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.910> these<00:00:45.120> two<00:00:45.390> edges<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.670> this<00:00:47.670> pair

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
use one of these two edges and this pair

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.779 
use one of these two edges and this pair
to<00:00:48.840> first<00:00:49.110> make<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> t<00:00:49.890> by<00:00:50.039> t<00:00:50.100> by<00:00:50.430> one<00:00:50.640> block<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
to first make a t by t by one block and

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.850 
to first make a t by t by one block and
I'm<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.449> use<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.930> edge<00:00:55.199> because<00:00:55.649> it's

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
I'm going to use this edge because it's

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.040 
I'm going to use this edge because it's
really<00:00:56.010> easy<00:00:56.309> i<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:56.940> do<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> u2<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.899> move

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
really easy i can just do a u2 and move

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.320 
really easy i can just do a u2 and move
it<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.890> blue<00:00:59.370> layer<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:01.160> now<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.309> l2

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.890 

there's<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.689> two<00:01:06.960> by<00:01:07.080> two<00:01:07.140> by<00:01:07.260> one<00:01:07.530> block<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
there's the two by two by one block and

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.000 
there's the two by two by one block and
then<00:01:09.900> red<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.470> white<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.950> back<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.590> i'm

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
then red and white is back here so i'm

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.520 
then red and white is back here so i'm
just<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:15.150> an<00:01:15.299> m2<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:18.080> place<00:01:19.080> sit

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
just going to do an m2 and place sit

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.450 
just going to do an m2 and place sit
right<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:21.350> then<00:01:22.350> join<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
right here and then join this with the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.190 
right here and then join this with the
two<00:01:23.700> by<00:01:23.820> T<00:01:23.880> by<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.270> block<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.630> made<00:01:24.810> earlier<00:01:27.200> so

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
two by T by one block I made earlier so

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.380 
two by T by one block I made earlier so
now<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.530> two<00:01:29.250> by<00:01:29.369> two<00:01:29.430> by<00:01:29.549> three<00:01:29.909> block<00:01:30.119> I'm

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
now the two by two by three block I'm

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.950 
now the two by two by three block I'm
going<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.570> use<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:31.049> corner<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.689> this<00:01:33.689> side

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
going to use this corner and this side

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.440 
going to use this corner and this side
and<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.610> edge<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.430> am<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.150> first

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and this edge so I am going to first

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.270 
and this edge so I am going to first
pair<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.869> corner<00:01:40.229> with<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.920> these<00:01:41.040> two

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
pair the corner with one of these two

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.920 
pair the corner with one of these two
edges<00:01:41.960> which<00:01:42.960> everyone<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.380> easiest<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.930> that

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
edges which everyone is easiest and that

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.370 
edges which everyone is easiest and that
happens<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.409> be<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.740> one<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.930> what<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.110> want<00:01:49.320> to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
happens to be this one so what I want to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.740 
happens to be this one so what I want to
do<00:01:49.500> first<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:51.320> position<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.500> piece<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
do first is position this piece on the

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.749 
do first is position this piece on the
yellow<00:01:54.750> layer<00:01:54.960> where<00:01:55.649> yellow<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.070> facing<00:01:56.579> up

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
yellow layer where yellow is facing up

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.740 
yellow layer where yellow is facing up
on<00:01:57.090> top<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:58.490> at<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.640> same<00:01:59.850> time<00:01:59.909> line<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.659> up

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
on top and at the same time line it up

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.039 
on top and at the same time line it up
with<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.960> corner<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:02.630> that's<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.960> be

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
with the corner and that's going to be

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.290 
with the corner and that's going to be
pretty<00:02:04.200> easy<00:02:04.350> because

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.520 

the<00:02:09.380> corner<00:02:10.380> is<00:02:10.410> already<00:02:10.740> oriented<00:02:12.020> in<00:02:13.020> such<00:02:13.350> a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
the corner is already oriented in such a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.330 
the corner is already oriented in such a
way<00:02:13.710> that<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:13.980> can<00:02:14.840> move<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.290> piece<00:02:16.800> like<00:02:17.070> this

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
way that I can move the piece like this

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.390 
way that I can move the piece like this
and<00:02:18.080> pair<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.110> up<00:02:19.260> like<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:21.470> now<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.920> see

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
and pair it up like that and now I see

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.060 
and pair it up like that and now I see
this<00:02:24.200> red<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.350> yellow<00:02:25.620> edge<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.590> I'm<00:02:28.830> just

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
this red and yellow edge so I'm just

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.190 
this red and yellow edge so I'm just
going<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.280> position<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.030> place<00:02:30.270> which

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
going to position that in place which

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.640 
going to position that in place which
also<00:02:31.500> lines<00:02:32.160> this<00:02:32.460> edge<00:02:32.700> up<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:34.290> be<00:02:34.410> place

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
also lines this edge up to be place

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.880 
also lines this edge up to be place
right<00:02:34.920> here<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.760> first<00:02:35.970> thing<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.240> do<00:02:36.300> is

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
right here so the first thing I do is

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.740 
right here so the first thing I do is
just<00:02:38.960> move<00:02:39.960> this<00:02:40.200> on<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.860> yellow<00:02:41.100> layer<00:02:41.750> which

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
just move this on the yellow layer which

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.110 
just move this on the yellow layer which
also<00:02:42.990> breaks<00:02:43.530> up<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.770> two<00:02:44.550> by<00:02:44.670> two<00:02:44.730> lucky

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
also breaks up the two by two lucky

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.430 
also breaks up the two by two lucky
block<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:47.480> now<00:02:48.480> I'm<00:02:48.630> just<00:02:48.780> going<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.050> move<00:02:49.230> it

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
block and now I'm just going to move it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.720 
block and now I'm just going to move it
here<00:02:50.810> in<00:02:51.810> position<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.590> now<00:02:53.250> when<00:02:53.460> i<00:02:53.490> restore

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
here in position and now when i restore

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.860 
here in position and now when i restore
the<00:02:54.060> block<00:02:54.620> i<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:56.460> created<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.180> q<00:02:57.510> x<00:02:57.600> 2<00:02:57.660> x<00:02:57.840> 3

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
the block i have created the q x 2 x 3

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.360 
the block i have created the q x 2 x 3
block<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:00.690> i<00:03:00.720> have<00:03:00.900> two<00:03:01.080> bad<00:03:01.260> edges<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:02.100> one

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
block so i have two bad edges this one

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.930 
block so i have two bad edges this one
and<00:03:02.610> this<00:03:02.730> one<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.860> i'm<00:03:05.220> not<00:03:05.370> going<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.610> go<00:03:05.760> into

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
and this one so i'm not going to go into

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.540 
and this one so i'm not going to go into
detail<00:03:06.390> how<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.750> fix<00:03:07.020> bad<00:03:07.230> edges<00:03:07.740> so<00:03:08.310> I'm<00:03:08.370> just

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
detail how to fix bad edges so I'm just

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.449 
detail how to fix bad edges so I'm just
going<00:03:09.800> fix<00:03:10.800> them<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:13.100> what<00:03:14.100> I'm<00:03:14.190> going<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.340> do

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
going fix them and what I'm going to do

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.699 
going fix them and what I'm going to do
now<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.670> finish<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.750> first<00:03:15.959> two<00:03:16.170> layers<00:03:16.380> so

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
now is finish that first two layers so

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.290 
now is finish that first two layers so
I'm<00:03:16.800> going<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.010> build<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.340> 1<00:03:17.520> x<00:03:17.640> 2<00:03:17.670> x<00:03:17.820> 3<00:03:17.910> block

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
I'm going to build a 1 x 2 x 3 block

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.510 
I'm going to build a 1 x 2 x 3 block
right<00:03:18.480> here<00:03:18.800> I'm<00:03:19.800> going<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.070> solve<00:03:20.280> these

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
right here I'm going to solve these

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.990 
right here I'm going to solve these
pieces<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:22.410> obviously<00:03:22.830> i'm<00:03:23.670> going<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:23.910> use

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
pieces so obviously i'm going to use

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.290 
pieces so obviously i'm going to use
this<00:03:24.270> pair<00:03:24.600> right<00:03:24.630> here<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:26.030> I'm<00:03:27.030> going<00:03:27.270> to

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
this pair right here and I'm going to

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.000 
this pair right here and I'm going to
find<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.750> orange<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.410> yellow<00:03:28.470> edge<00:03:28.800> which

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
find that orange and yellow edge which

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.220 
find that orange and yellow edge which
happens<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.430> be<00:03:29.520> here<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.060> I'm<00:03:31.050> going<00:03:31.200> to

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
happens to be here and I'm going to

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.699 
happens to be here and I'm going to
place<00:03:31.470> this<00:03:31.739> right<00:03:31.980> here<00:03:33.110> so<00:03:34.110> in<00:03:34.170> order<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.470> do

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
place this right here so in order to do

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.699 
place this right here so in order to do
that<00:03:34.920> I'm<00:03:35.190> going<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.600> move<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.750> pair<00:03:37.019> up<00:03:37.290> to

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
that I'm going to move the pair up to

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.210 
that I'm going to move the pair up to
the<00:03:37.890> view<00:03:38.340> layer<00:03:38.550> and<00:03:39.320> I'm<00:03:40.320> going<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.680> move<00:03:40.950> the

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
the view layer and I'm going to move the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.540 
the view layer and I'm going to move the
pair<00:03:41.430> out<00:03:41.580> of<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.790> way<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:43.070> move<00:03:44.070> this<00:03:44.250> edge

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
pair out of the way and move this edge

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:51.500 
pair out of the way and move this edge
right<00:03:44.970> here<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:48.980> when<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.010> put<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:50.430> back<00:03:50.730> to

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
right here and when I put this back to

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.970 
right here and when I put this back to
the<00:03:51.660> our<00:03:51.840> lair<00:03:54.110> they<00:03:55.130> join<00:03:56.130> together<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:57.440> I<00:03:58.440> am

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
the our lair they join together and I am

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.430 
the our lair they join together and I am
looking<00:03:59.580> for<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.880> next<00:04:00.030> pair<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:01.200> I'm<00:04:01.320> going

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
looking for the next pair that I'm going

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.600 
looking for the next pair that I'm going
to<00:04:01.530> use<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:02.070> fill<00:04:02.310> in<00:04:02.810> this<00:04:03.810> last<00:04:04.140> about<00:04:04.830> two

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
to use to fill in this last about two

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.900 
to use to fill in this last about two
pieces<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.390> finish<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.260> first<00:04:07.440> few<00:04:07.620> layers<00:04:07.910> so

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
pieces to finish the first few layers so

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.800 
pieces to finish the first few layers so
I<00:04:09.239> see<00:04:09.570> this<00:04:09.750> corner<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.320> this<00:04:11.220> edge<00:04:11.690> so<00:04:12.690> when

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
I see this corner and this edge so when

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.020 
I see this corner and this edge so when
I<00:04:12.840> do<00:04:12.930> an<00:04:13.350> r2

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.050 

that<00:04:18.030> corner<00:04:18.419> is<00:04:18.690> going<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:18.989> be<00:04:19.139> right<00:04:19.709> here

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
that corner is going to be right here

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.700 
that corner is going to be right here
and<00:04:21.060> then<00:04:21.690> I'm<00:04:22.169> going<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.800> do<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.910> move<00:04:24.180> and

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
and then I'm going to do a you move and

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.550 
and then I'm going to do a you move and
are<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:27.090> pair<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.540> two<00:04:27.570> pieces<00:04:27.900> up<00:04:28.229> and<00:04:28.470> then

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
are to pair the two pieces up and then

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.370 
are to pair the two pieces up and then
move<00:04:28.710> into<00:04:28.889> place<00:04:29.220> like<00:04:29.630> this<00:04:33.080> they're<00:04:34.080> paired

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
move into place like this they're paired

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.140 
move into place like this they're paired
now<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:34.889> now<00:04:35.100> I<00:04:35.990> can<00:04:36.990> join<00:04:37.229> them<00:04:37.410> to<00:04:38.150> this

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
now and now I can join them to this

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.409 
now and now I can join them to this
block<00:04:39.449> here<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:39.960> make<00:04:40.350> a<00:04:40.380> 1<00:04:40.620> x<00:04:40.740> 2<00:04:40.770> x<00:04:40.919> 3<00:04:41.040> block

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
block here and make a 1 x 2 x 3 block

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.770 
block here and make a 1 x 2 x 3 block
which<00:04:42.419> finishes<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.229> first<00:04:43.470> few<00:04:43.620> layers
