00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.400 
play so this is actually kind of in
invade<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.640> think<00:00:36.059> well<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.960> enemy<00:00:37.230> team

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
invade I think well the enemy team

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.440 
invade I think well the enemy team
actually<00:00:37.620> ran<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.219> kind<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.460> check<00:00:38.730> our<00:00:39.000> blue

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
actually ran to kind of check our blue

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.060 
actually ran to kind of check our blue
but<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:39.750> didn't<00:00:39.989> actually<00:00:40.170> end<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.590> taking

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
but they didn't actually end up taking

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.600 
but they didn't actually end up taking
it<00:00:41.190> which<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.489> kind<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.850> surprise<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.610> was

hoping that like I haven't gotten any

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.810 
hoping that like I haven't gotten any
skills<00:00:46.500> yet<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.950> saw<00:00:47.100> i<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.520> picked<00:00:47.730> up

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
of him as soon as possible but

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.340 
of him as soon as possible but
unfortunately<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:12.090> did<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.110> just

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
unfortunately I did not and we just

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.649 
unfortunately I did not and we just
gotta<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.799> know<00:01:13.830> no<00:01:14.159> one<00:01:14.340> no<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.150> really<00:01:15.420> died

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
gotta you know no one no one really died

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.160 
gotta you know no one no one really died
uh<00:01:16.200> which<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.009> good<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.909> um<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.900> know<00:01:18.990> we

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
uh which is good but um you know we

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.390 
uh which is good but um you know we
didn't<00:01:19.350> end<00:01:19.439> up<00:01:19.530> getting<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.830> kill<00:01:19.979> or<00:01:20.100> anything

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
didn't end up getting a kill or anything

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.190 
didn't end up getting a kill or anything
so<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.000> actually<00:01:21.180> my<00:01:21.509> first<00:01:21.720> mistake<00:01:21.960> I

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
so this is actually my first mistake I

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.929 
so this is actually my first mistake I
go<00:01:22.350> ahead<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.619> teleport<00:01:22.950> top<00:01:23.100> lane<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:23.850> as

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
go ahead and teleport top lane but as

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.580 
go ahead and teleport top lane but as
you<00:01:24.060> guys<00:01:24.180> probably<00:01:24.210> saw<00:01:24.720> lime<00:01:24.960> oom<00:01:25.229> right<00:01:25.439> now

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
you guys probably saw lime oom right now

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.160 
you guys probably saw lime oom right now
so<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.640> really<00:01:26.670> can't<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.210> anything<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:27.990> top

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
so I really can't do anything and on top

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.350 
so I really can't do anything and on top

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.720 
wisely and you are focusing the right
targets<00:03:55.470> because<00:03:55.890> something<00:03:56.250> like<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.549> at<00:03:56.700> a

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
targets because something like that at a

targets because something like that at a
higher<00:03:56.910> elo<00:03:56.940> would<00:03:57.329> probably<00:03:58.079> cost<00:03:58.350> me<00:03:58.650> the

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
higher elo would probably cost me the

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.009 
higher elo would probably cost me the
