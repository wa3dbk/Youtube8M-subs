it<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.720> had<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.140> get<00:01:46.259> around<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.680> it

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
it we just had to get around to it

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.719 
it we just had to get around to it
because<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.040> had<00:01:47.130> some<00:01:47.250> other<00:01:47.340> stuff<00:01:47.610> we

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
because we had some other stuff we

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.280 
because we had some other stuff we
wanted<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.229> be

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
the salmon and asparagus roll which you

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.190 
the salmon and asparagus roll which you
probably<00:03:14.500> just<00:03:14.920> saw<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.850> it<00:03:16.000> was<00:03:16.030> good<00:03:16.329> it<00:03:17.049> was

actually<00:03:17.590> really<00:03:17.739> it<00:03:18.250> was<00:03:18.400> really<00:03:18.700> really

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
actually really it was really really

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.600 
actually really it was really really
good<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.390> I<00:03:19.959> think<00:03:20.799> especially<00:03:20.950> since<00:03:21.430> the

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
good and I think especially since the
