answer is no let me explain why the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.600 
answer is no let me explain why the
drive<00:00:42.660> belt<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.200> actually<00:00:43.649> under<00:00:43.829> tension<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
drive belt is actually under tension and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.020 
drive belt is actually under tension and
it's<00:00:45.149> also<00:00:45.360> elastic<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:47.070> elasticity<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
it's also elastic the elasticity of the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.119 
it's also elastic the elasticity of the
drive<00:00:48.360> belt<00:00:48.629> soaks<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.440> elliptical

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
drive belt soaks up the elliptical

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.910 
drive belt soaks up the elliptical
motion<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.000> pulley<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.629> spins<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
motion of the pulley as it spins the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.279 
motion of the pulley as it spins the
tension<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.879> drive<00:00:54.120> belt<00:00:54.390> actually<00:00:54.960> pulls

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
tension of the drive belt actually pulls

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.130 
tension of the drive belt actually pulls
the<00:00:55.590> axle<00:00:56.160> hard<00:00:57.030> against<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.539> bush<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.109> the

set it up there raise the axle till it

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.630 

okay<00:02:56.750> now<00:02:57.739> what<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.950> want<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.160> do<00:02:58.310> is<00:02:58.340> I'm

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
okay now what I want to do is I'm

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.190 
okay now what I want to do is I'm
actually<00:02:58.790> going<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.180> run<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.480> machine<00:02:59.840> very

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
actually going to run the machine very

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
actually going to run the machine very
slowly<00:03:00.819> let<00:03:01.819> me<00:03:01.940> explain<00:03:02.030> why<00:03:02.630> if<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.799> run<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.130> at

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
slowly let me explain why if I run it at

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.530 
slowly let me explain why if I run it at
a<00:03:04.310> high<00:03:04.519> speed<00:03:04.579> it's<00:03:05.450> possible<00:03:05.750> that<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:07.540> dial

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
a high speed it's possible that the dial

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.509 
a high speed it's possible that the dial
indicator<00:03:09.019> might<00:03:09.260> bounce<00:03:09.560> over<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.340> high

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
indicator might bounce over the high

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.879 
indicator might bounce over the high
high<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.299> low<00:03:11.450> spots<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.230> give<00:03:12.440> us<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.680> false

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
high and low spots and give us a false

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.199 
high and low spots and give us a false
reading<00:03:13.190> so<00:03:13.400> I'm<00:03:13.459> going<00:03:13.609> to<00:03:13.670> run<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.880> machine

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
reading so I'm going to run the machine

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.710 
reading so I'm going to run the machine
as<00:03:14.299> slow<00:03:14.540> as<00:03:14.569> possible<00:03:14.750> just<00:03:15.319> to<00:03:15.980> give<00:03:16.130> the

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
as slow as possible just to give the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.720 
as slow as possible just to give the
follow-up<00:03:17.720> time<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.170> react<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:19.130> any<00:03:19.280> high<00:03:19.549> or

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
follow-up time to react to any high or

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.500 
follow-up time to react to any high or
low<00:03:19.850> spots<00:03:20.209> on<00:03:20.389> the<00:03:20.480> toilet<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:25.850> turning<00:03:26.329> the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
low spots on the toilet so turning the

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:44.320 
low spots on the toilet so turning the
power<00:03:26.660> supply<00:03:26.900> on

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.870 

ok

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
ok

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.640 
ok
we<00:03:47.450> can<00:03:47.600> see<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.810> little<00:03:47.960> flicker<00:03:48.350> in<00:03:48.560> the

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
we can see a little flicker in the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.510 
we can see a little flicker in the
needle<00:03:49.390> which<00:03:50.390> looks<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:50.870> be<00:03:51.050> about<00:03:51.920> two

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
needle which looks to be about two

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.700 
needle which looks to be about two
graduations<00:03:53.150> maybe<00:03:53.630> slightly<00:03:54.170> over<00:03:54.530> two

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
graduations maybe slightly over two

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.570 
graduations maybe slightly over two
graduations<00:03:55.280> once<00:03:55.970> again<00:03:56.330> point<00:03:57.290> zero<00:03:57.380> two<00:03:58.070> of

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
graduations once again point zero two of

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.300 
graduations once again point zero two of
a<00:03:58.730> millimeter<00:03:59.200> which<00:04:00.200> i<00:04:00.320> think<00:04:00.380> is<00:04:00.680> still<00:04:01.010> less

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
a millimeter which i think is still less

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.180 
a millimeter which i think is still less
than<00:04:01.340> 1000<00:04:02.300> of<00:04:02.330> an<00:04:02.480> inch<00:04:02.630> and<00:04:02.960> about<00:04:03.860> the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
than 1000 of an inch and about the

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.670 
than 1000 of an inch and about the
quarter<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:05.090> thickness<00:04:05.540> of<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:06.410> human<00:04:06.590> hair

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
quarter of the thickness of a human hair

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.650 
quarter of the thickness of a human hair
so<00:04:09.680> that's<00:04:09.890> how<00:04:10.070> true<00:04:10.490> it<00:04:10.700> is<00:04:10.730> possible<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:11.420> get

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
so that's how true it is possible to get

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.280 
so that's how true it is possible to get
your<00:04:11.810> tires<00:04:12.050> using<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.710> torture<00:04:13.100> machine
