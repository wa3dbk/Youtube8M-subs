00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
one across the 40 are we going to see a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.500 
one across the 40 are we going to see a
lot<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.399> think<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:51.090> know<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.390> way

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
lot of this you think you know the way

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.540 
lot of this you think you know the way
things<00:00:51.570> went<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.500> most<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> first<00:00:53.160> half

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
things went for most of the first half

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.000 
things went for most of the first half
especially<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> first<00:00:54.570> quarter<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.829> looks

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
especially the first quarter this looks

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.350 
especially the first quarter this looks
like<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.190> wrinkle<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.730> they<00:00:56.940> might<00:00:57.149> try<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
like a wrinkle that they might try to

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.810 
like a wrinkle that they might try to
generate<00:00:57.840> some<00:00:58.079> offense<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.250> any<00:00:59.399> case<00:00:59.460> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
generate some offense but in any case I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
generate some offense but in any case I
think<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.239> keeps<00:01:00.420> Houston<00:01:00.870> guessing<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.410> little

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
think it keeps Houston guessing a little

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.619 
think it keeps Houston guessing a little
bit<00:01:01.890> because<00:01:02.520> Houston<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.239> most<00:01:03.449> part

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
bit because Houston for the most part

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.479 
bit because Houston for the most part
the<00:01:03.780> first<00:01:04.019> half<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.409> put<00:01:04.559> eight<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:04.799> nine<00:01:05.159> guys

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the first half we put eight or nine guys

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.080 
the first half we put eight or nine guys
in<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> box<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:07.409> beat<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.070> by<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
in the box and just beat you by then the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.330
