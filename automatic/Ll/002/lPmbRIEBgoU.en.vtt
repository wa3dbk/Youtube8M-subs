00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hello I am the summer of the horses in 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 show and I want you one today 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.179
 very simple about how to imagine her 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.219
 mobilize your tank 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.730
 because the pool is known as the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.920
 actually ride the bike and also 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.430
 really balanced center of the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.430
 rider 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.520
 So now I have my matte here 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.870
 usually brought if not 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.460
 works fresh then has rained then you can 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.090
 of course, this exercise in the meadow 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.790
 do 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.850
 you just have to go to the floor 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.360
 and find any object 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.340
 where the legs could drauflegen so 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.960
 It would be ideal if this object still 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.800
 that would be a bit lower 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.949
 here 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.379
 this angle by 90 Â° results that would be 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.449
 So about three inches 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.610
 lower but that works fine too 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.350
 is not quite as dramatic I put 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.600
 me here so comfortable behind can also the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.149
 army to do the side and the 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.750
 exercise is in the end just you put 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.619
 down 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.210
 one deliberately goes into the hollow cross 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.690
 loses the contact here behind 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.149
 in the basin area to ground and then 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.250
 you try the spine again 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.009
 to extend and then the contact 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.500
 by rolling up the basin, so to speak 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.610
 to win back to the ground 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.380
 that's a very simple one 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.399
 to practice mobilization it is, so to speak 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.800
 dry for years and the 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.330
 actual practice looks like that 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.229
 Imagine that I always used to 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.020
 like in casino here, so to speak, my 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.750
 roulette slice and i have in here 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.349
 my tank the ball and this cool 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.420
 I try a basin easily and to 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:55.399
 roll the I imagine so before that 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.069
 is the movement of the practiced and 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.590
 circle i really try in here 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.030
 my pool this clientele 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.160
 The legs remain in place 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.860
 contact with my subject with mine 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.459
 pad and then I change hands practically 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.860
 the direction and try here too 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.380
 again as uneven as possible Aspects 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.470
 to move something really interesting 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.140
 if you do these circles then 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.120
 you often find out relatively quickly 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.830
 yes down here left there ex a bit 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.599
 the movement is not quite that round 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.730
 the movement feels that way 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.590
 little bit 4 can and if you have the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.060
 direction changes then it is 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.520
 that one says this direction goes however 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.349
 much worse if you have the feeling 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.710
 that one side is quite significant 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.770
 worse there 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.630
 are you probably due, so to speak 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.480
 for an appointment with the abstract partner 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.280
 or granite therapists because then has 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.840
 He probably has a basin blockade 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.060
 and I have a video already over it 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.160
 made the crooked rider or too 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.760
 Of course, blocked riders in the long term 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.720
 be extremely relaxed and 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.090
 in the long term, also on the health of 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.630
 affect horses negatively and one 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.460
 Leaning in the tank of the rider can also 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.530
 long term also to a deep basin 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.820
 of the horse therefore lead when you are 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.640
 do not be sure, you better leave 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.720
 from the good therapist 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.840
 physiotherapist manuel therapist 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.000
 watch or also has a doctor like 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.360
 with additional training and let yourself 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.430
 just mobilize and solve 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.530
 because that's really important for him 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.260
 itself released time so that one 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.660
 easy exercise you can ride on 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.220
 just run for three to five minutes 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.080
 that really brings you and it was 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.740
 Become ten with the time is the movement 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.600
 this circular movement always 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.820
 Smoother the changes of direction 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.920
 are becoming more even so you can 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.410
 yes in the end then just a synonymous 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.320
 round links circle round 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.420
 legal circles he deliberately try 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.830
 make smaller circles then again 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.140
 larger circles 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.490
 So that we have more fantasy in the end 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.650
 no limits set 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.990
 and that is an uncomplicated and 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.760
 really efficient exercise around easy 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.640
 ever let go a little bit and 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.680
 easier to get on the horse if you 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.360
 you with the theme of the loose seat 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.610
 of the rider to occupy even more 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.380
 then you are exactly right 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.200
