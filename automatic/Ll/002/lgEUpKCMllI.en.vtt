is going to be a quick video about

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.630 
is going to be a quick video about
amplifier<00:00:31.480> and<00:00:31.750> the<00:00:31.930> question<00:00:32.410> is<00:00:32.559> it<00:00:32.920> Opie<00:00:33.430> or

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
amplifier and the question is it Opie or

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.850 
amplifier and the question is it Opie or
is<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:34.000> overpowered<00:00:34.660> and<00:00:34.809> some<00:00:35.470> people<00:00:35.739> might

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860

is it overpowered and some people might
be<00:00:36.010> like<00:00:36.160> oh<00:00:36.280> yeah<00:00:36.460> amplifies<00:00:36.820> totally<00:00:37.180> Opie

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
be like oh yeah amplifies totally Opie

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.850 
be like oh yeah amplifies totally Opie
this<00:00:37.629> that<00:00:37.809> whatever<00:00:38.080> other<00:00:38.350> people<00:00:38.590> won't<00:00:38.680> be

in my opinion after the tests and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.319 
in my opinion after the tests and
everything<00:00:44.980> like<00:00:45.309> that<00:00:45.370> I<00:00:45.640> don't<00:00:46.210> think

3 sitrep pro easily yes overpowered why
was<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.180> overpowered<00:00:55.750> though<00:00:55.899> it<00:00:56.590> basically

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
was it overpowered though it basically

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.119 
was it overpowered though it basically
completely<00:00:57.940> cancelled<00:00:58.840> out<00:00:59.050> dead<00:00:59.500> silence

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
completely cancelled out dead silence

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.040 
completely cancelled out dead silence
all<00:01:00.309> together<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:02.500> didn't<00:01:02.949> counter<00:01:03.699> it<00:01:03.850> it

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
all together it didn't counter it it

cancelled<00:01:05.050> it<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.170> that's<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:05.590> big<00:01:05.950> difference

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
off mic I'm gonna be quiet as a mouse

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.230 
off mic I'm gonna be quiet as a mouse
and<00:01:14.800> I<00:01:14.860> don't<00:01:14.979> want<00:01:15.100> you<00:01:15.190> guys<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:15.640> hear

anything other than what's actually
happening<00:01:19.090> in<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.390> video<00:01:19.630> clips<00:01:20.020> but

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
happening in the video clips but

basically what's going to happen is I

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.480 
basically what's going to happen is I
also<00:01:22.959> suggest<00:01:23.229> if<00:01:23.530> you<00:01:23.590> have<00:01:23.800> headphones<00:01:24.009> to

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
also suggest if you have headphones to

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.240 
also suggest if you have headphones to
put<00:01:24.640> them<00:01:24.789> on<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:25.090> use<00:01:25.300> them<00:01:25.509> because<00:01:26.250> you're

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
put them on and use them because you're

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.740 
put them on and use them because you're
really<00:01:27.520> going<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.729> get<00:01:27.849> the<00:01:27.940> full<00:01:28.149> effect<00:01:28.300> of

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
really going to get the full effect of

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.779 
really going to get the full effect of
the<00:01:29.259> sound<00:01:29.619> tests<00:01:30.099> if<00:01:30.250> you're<00:01:30.580> using

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
the sound tests if you're using

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.309 
the sound tests if you're using
headphones<00:01:31.060> we<00:01:31.450> might<00:01:31.630> not<00:01:31.780> notice<00:01:31.929> quite<00:01:32.200> as

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
headphones we might not notice quite as

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:33.570 
headphones we might not notice quite as
much<00:01:32.440> if<00:01:32.619> you're<00:01:32.740> just<00:01:32.890> using<00:01:33.009> like<00:01:33.220> regular

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
much if you're just using like regular

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.639 
much if you're just using like regular
speakers<00:01:33.970> so<00:01:34.750> keep<00:01:34.929> that<00:01:34.959> in<00:01:35.080> mind<00:01:35.349> but<00:01:35.530> the

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
speakers so keep that in mind but the

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:36.749 
speakers so keep that in mind but the
first<00:01:35.860> test<00:01:36.099> is<00:01:36.220> going<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.399> be<00:01:36.459> what's<00:01:36.610> called

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
first test is going to be what's called

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.820 
first test is going to be what's called
a<00:01:36.880> controlled<00:01:37.240> test<00:01:37.330> I<00:01:37.720> don't<00:01:38.440> have<00:01:38.619> any

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
a controlled test I don't have any

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.620 
a controlled test I don't have any
special<00:01:39.280> perks<00:01:39.550> neither<00:01:39.970> dis<00:01:40.179> flex<00:01:40.450> he's

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
special perks neither dis flex he's

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.609 
special perks neither dis flex he's
going<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:40.840> run<00:01:40.959> around<00:01:41.110> in<00:01:41.289> little<00:01:41.410> circles

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
going to run around in little circles

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.020 
going to run around in little circles
and<00:01:41.979> stuff<00:01:42.160> just<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.399> hear<00:01:42.610> what<00:01:42.759> it<00:01:42.849> sounds

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
and stuff just to hear what it sounds

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.690 
and stuff just to hear what it sounds
like<00:01:43.209> then<00:01:43.989> we're<00:01:44.140> going<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.289> move<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.530> I<00:01:45.069> don't

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
like then we're going to move to I don't

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.160 
like then we're going to move to I don't
have<00:01:45.910> amplifier<00:01:46.450> anything<00:01:46.750> like<00:01:46.869> that<00:01:46.899> and

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
have amplifier anything like that and

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.109 
have amplifier anything like that and
flex<00:01:47.470> is<00:01:47.619> using<00:01:47.890> dead<00:01:48.039> silence<00:01:48.489> then<00:01:48.940> we're

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
flex is using dead silence then we're

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.240 
flex is using dead silence then we're
going<00:01:49.239> to<00:01:49.300> go<00:01:49.360> amplify<00:01:50.229> versus<00:01:50.770> like<00:01:51.220> a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
going to go amplify versus like a

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.889 
going to go amplify versus like a
regular<00:01:51.489> character<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.360> then<00:01:52.690> we're<00:01:52.810> going

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
regular character and then we're going

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.839 
regular character and then we're going
to<00:01:52.959> go<00:01:53.020> into<00:01:53.110> amplify<00:01:53.739> versus<00:01:54.160> dead<00:01:54.340> silence

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
to go into amplify versus dead silence

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:56.520 
to go into amplify versus dead silence
so<00:01:55.420> we're<00:01:55.569> about<00:01:55.660> to<00:01:55.810> get<00:01:55.899> into<00:01:55.959> the<00:01:56.170> test<00:01:56.380> I'm

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
so we're about to get into the test I'm

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.990 
so we're about to get into the test I'm
gonna<00:01:56.679> be<00:01:56.830> quiet<00:01:57.099> just<00:01:57.429> put<00:01:57.759> your<00:01:57.819> headphones

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
gonna be quiet just put your headphones

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.910 
gonna be quiet just put your headphones
on<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.390> listen<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:59.020> then<00:01:59.319> we'll<00:01:59.500> get<00:01:59.649> into<00:01:59.770> my

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
on and listen and then we'll get into my

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:38.809 
on and listen and then we'll get into my
conclusion<00:02:00.489> afterwards

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.770 

okay<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:40.200> basically<00:02:40.739> as<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.939> can<00:02:42.120> see<00:02:42.390> from

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
okay so basically as you can see from

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.280 
okay so basically as you can see from
the<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:44.069> test<00:02:44.370> their<00:02:44.840> regular<00:02:45.840> versus

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
the the test their regular versus

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.610 
the the test their regular versus
regular<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:47.459> can<00:02:47.670> hear<00:02:47.909> them<00:02:48.379> just<00:02:49.379> fine<00:02:49.560> I

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
regular you can hear them just fine I

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.170 
regular you can hear them just fine I
mean<00:02:49.950> it's<00:02:50.069> not<00:02:50.129> as<00:02:50.400> good<00:02:50.549> as<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.700> course<00:02:50.969> with

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
mean it's not as good as of course with

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.729 
mean it's not as good as of course with
using<00:02:51.420> like<00:02:51.540> amplifier<00:02:51.959> versus<00:02:52.290> regular<00:02:52.439> and

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
using like amplifier versus regular and

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.580 
using like amplifier versus regular and
it<00:02:52.799> shouldn't<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:53.730> even<00:02:54.540> just<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:55.019> don't<00:02:55.139> have

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
it shouldn't but even just I don't have

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.349 
it shouldn't but even just I don't have
amplified<00:02:56.099> they<00:02:56.340> don't<00:02:56.519> have<00:02:56.670> dead<00:02:56.879> silence<00:02:57.269> I

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
amplified they don't have dead silence I

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:58.789 
amplified they don't have dead silence I
can<00:02:57.599> hear<00:02:57.870> them<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:58.139> mean<00:02:58.319> it<00:02:58.439> might<00:02:58.590> not<00:02:58.739> be

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
can hear them I mean it might not be

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.069 
can hear them I mean it might not be
like<00:02:59.280> amazing<00:02:59.639> but<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.239> can<00:03:00.420> still<00:03:00.599> hear<00:03:00.659> you

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
like amazing but I can still hear you

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.869 
like amazing but I can still hear you
know<00:03:01.200> kind<00:03:01.409> of<00:03:01.469> what's<00:03:01.590> going<00:03:01.769> on<00:03:01.920> then<00:03:02.579> you<00:03:02.730> go

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
know kind of what's going on then you go

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.270 
know kind of what's going on then you go
regular<00:03:03.389> versus<00:03:03.750> dead<00:03:03.959> silence<00:03:04.469> now<00:03:05.010> it

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
regular versus dead silence now it

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.369 
regular versus dead silence now it
doesn't<00:03:05.549> make<00:03:05.669> them<00:03:05.819> really<00:03:06.209> dead<00:03:06.659> silent

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
doesn't make them really dead silent

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.050 
doesn't make them really dead silent
like<00:03:07.530> they<00:03:07.620> make<00:03:07.799> no<00:03:08.159> noise<00:03:08.430> as<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.909> could

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
like they make no noise as you could

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.420 
like they make no noise as you could
tell<00:03:09.209> like<00:03:09.510> but<00:03:10.109> you<00:03:10.319> don't<00:03:10.349> really<00:03:10.709> hear<00:03:11.189> them

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
tell like but you don't really hear them

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.490 
tell like but you don't really hear them
until<00:03:11.879> they're<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:12.269> literally<00:03:12.840> like<00:03:13.049> I<00:03:13.230> can

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
until they're like literally like I can

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.479 
until they're like literally like I can
stab<00:03:13.829> you<00:03:14.099> from<00:03:14.370> here<00:03:14.659> range<00:03:15.659> basically<00:03:16.489> um

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
stab you from here range basically um

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.849 
stab you from here range basically um
then<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.329> go<00:03:18.510> amplify<00:03:19.079> versus<00:03:19.469> you<00:03:19.829> know

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
then you go amplify versus you know

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.589 
then you go amplify versus you know
regular<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.549> guess<00:03:20.849> you<00:03:20.969> would<00:03:21.090> call<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.269> and

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
regular I guess you would call it and

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.929 
regular I guess you would call it and
they<00:03:22.139> sound<00:03:22.319> like<00:03:22.439> elephants<00:03:23.010> just<00:03:23.219> holy<00:03:23.609> shit

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:23.939 
they sound like elephants just holy shit

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:25.399 
they sound like elephants just holy shit
you<00:03:24.030> can<00:03:24.209> hear<00:03:24.480> like<00:03:24.659> everything<00:03:25.139> you<00:03:25.260> can

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
you can hear like everything you can

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.140 
you can hear like everything you can
hear<00:03:25.560> them<00:03:25.650> really<00:03:25.829> far<00:03:26.010> away<00:03:26.129> etc<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.909> that's

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
hear them really far away etc and that's

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.170 
hear them really far away etc and that's
what<00:03:27.269> amplify<00:03:27.659> is<00:03:27.719> supposed<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.500> do<00:03:28.709> now<00:03:29.430> this

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
what amplify is supposed to do now this

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.809 
what amplify is supposed to do now this
is<00:03:30.389> why<00:03:30.569> i<00:03:30.599> don't<00:03:31.139> think<00:03:31.439> it's<00:03:31.819> overpowered

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
is why i don't think it's overpowered

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.539 
is why i don't think it's overpowered
when<00:03:33.389> you<00:03:33.510> go<00:03:33.659> amplify<00:03:34.290> versus<00:03:34.769> dead<00:03:34.980> silence

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
when you go amplify versus dead silence

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.970 
when you go amplify versus dead silence
it<00:03:35.760> doesn't<00:03:36.510> make<00:03:36.840> them<00:03:37.230> like<00:03:37.530> they're<00:03:37.739> not

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
it doesn't make them like they're not

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.580 
it doesn't make them like they're not
using<00:03:38.310> dead<00:03:38.699> silence<00:03:39.180> at<00:03:39.359> all<00:03:39.750> like<00:03:40.409> how

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
using dead silence at all like how

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.819 
using dead silence at all like how
sitrep<00:03:41.099> did<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.909> just<00:03:42.329> kind<00:03:42.629> of<00:03:42.689> makes<00:03:42.959> dead

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
sitrep did it just kind of makes dead

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.929 
sitrep did it just kind of makes dead
silence<00:03:44.370> not<00:03:44.729> quite<00:03:45.449> as<00:03:45.659> silent<00:03:46.699> they're<00:03:47.699> not

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
silence not quite as silent they're not

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.539 
silence not quite as silent they're not
they're<00:03:48.180> still<00:03:48.389> not<00:03:48.540> as<00:03:48.689> loud<00:03:48.959> as<00:03:49.409> like<00:03:50.370> a

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
they're still not as loud as like a

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.270 
they're still not as loud as like a
regular<00:03:50.939> versus<00:03:51.659> regular<00:03:51.900> where<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.530> have<00:03:53.040> no

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
versus dead silence the dead silence

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.099 
versus dead silence the dead silence
character<00:03:58.319> still<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:58.739> less<00:03:59.129> than<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.810> regular

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
character still is less than the regular

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.339 
character still is less than the regular
character<00:04:01.769> without<00:04:01.889> me<00:04:02.340> using<00:04:02.699> amplify<00:04:03.349> so

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
character without me using amplify so

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.649 
character without me using amplify so
basically<00:04:04.889> it's<00:04:05.099> kind<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.430> they've<00:04:05.909> balanced

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
basically it's kind of they've balanced

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.229 
basically it's kind of they've balanced
it<00:04:06.780> they<00:04:06.930> kind<00:04:07.199> of<00:04:07.290> counter<00:04:07.889> each<00:04:08.069> other<00:04:08.370> dead

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
it they kind of counter each other dead

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.390 
it they kind of counter each other dead
silence<00:04:09.509> makes<00:04:09.959> amplify<00:04:10.470> not<00:04:10.799> quite<00:04:11.250> as

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.030 
silence makes amplify not quite as

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
effective amplify makes dead silence not

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.759 
effective amplify makes dead silence not
quite<00:04:14.549> as<00:04:14.729> effective<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.509> don't<00:04:16.259> think<00:04:16.620> that

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
quite as effective I don't think that

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.390 
quite as effective I don't think that
amplify<00:04:17.250> is<00:04:17.539> overpowered<00:04:18.539> it<00:04:18.889> they<00:04:19.889> found

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
amplify is overpowered it they found

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.629 
amplify is overpowered it they found
kind<00:04:20.759> of<00:04:20.849> like<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> good<00:04:21.359> in<00:04:21.989> between<00:04:22.639> area

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
kind of like a good in between area

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.999 
kind of like a good in between area
where<00:04:24.000> dead<00:04:24.300> silence<00:04:24.719> still<00:04:25.229> does<00:04:25.500> something

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009 
where dead silence still does something

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.060 
where dead silence still does something
just<00:04:26.789> not<00:04:26.940> as<00:04:27.120> good<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.539> amplify<00:04:28.349> still<00:04:28.830> does

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
just not as good and amplify still does

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.589 
just not as good and amplify still does
something<00:04:29.490> just<00:04:29.699> not<00:04:29.849> as<00:04:30.030> good<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:30.419> they<00:04:30.539> do

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
something just not as good so they do

amplify<00:04:38.340> if<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.550> don't<00:04:38.880> run<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.150> headset

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
amplify if you don't run a headset

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:40.999 
amplify if you don't run a headset
because<00:04:39.840> it's<00:04:39.990> not<00:04:40.169> going<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.409> really<00:04:40.530> benefit

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
because it's not going to really benefit

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.830 
because it's not going to really benefit
you<00:04:41.130> at<00:04:41.250> all<00:04:41.400> but<00:04:42.000> if<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.180> do<00:04:42.300> run<00:04:42.479> a<00:04:42.509> headset

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
you at all but if you do run a headset

you at all but if you do run a headset
and<00:04:43.020> try<00:04:43.680> amplify<00:04:44.130> you<00:04:44.190> might<00:04:44.550> like<00:04:44.789> it<00:04:44.820> you

and try amplify you might like it you

might<00:04:45.240> not<00:04:45.419> I<00:04:45.659> don't<00:04:45.840> know<00:04:45.930> whatever<00:04:46.199> but<00:04:46.620> it

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460

doesn't that's not the point the point
is<00:04:49.440> is<00:04:49.650> I<00:04:49.889> don't<00:04:49.949> think<00:04:50.159> that<00:04:50.880> amplify

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
is is I don't think that amplify

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.360 
is is I don't think that amplify
as<00:04:51.539> overpowered<00:04:52.199> and<00:04:52.349> that's<00:04:52.919> pretty<00:04:53.099> much<00:04:53.219> it

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370
