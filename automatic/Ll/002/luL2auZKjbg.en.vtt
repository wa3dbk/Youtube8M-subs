00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.429
 Now that was a package of 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.429
 wine school 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.320
 hello welcome to a follow 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.380
 the web wine school made us special 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.320
 important is 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.450
 It's getting a bit spiritual today 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.439
 meditative it's about sweet wine and we 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.430
 fly there a certain 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.559
 missionary zeal we want you 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.180
 convert no we want to motivate you 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.250
 you the world of sweet wine always too 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.900
 open and for us are sweet wines and 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.129
 Sweet wines do not cry the same 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.720
 people will eventually get one 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.850
 sweet wine into the glass, find that 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.190
 are quite rightly scary that 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.899
 The wines are harvested and harvested 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.030
 developed like dry wines and only 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.160
 at the very end with open east 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.690
 by face to come from often 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.219
 sorts of grapes for good sweet wine even 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.870
 not suitable are thorn fields 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.700
 semi-dry and very sweet 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.190
 spoiling a theme sweet wines altogether 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.289
 afloat we only give these wines 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.720
 people from whose voice endure little 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:09.700
 because then those can be awake 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.530
 to stick sometimes you have something 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.200
 you've got that charm of anja 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.940
 You said I have that in the office 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.950
 the more the cost 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.570
 yes, but rather after the show 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.909
 taped and could do it all over 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.470
 difficult to become so bad 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.750
 sweets tastes sweet and sweet in front of a pub 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.689
 sticky and good sweet wine has everything 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.650
 a game in a row 16 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.630
 We have already written that 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.729
 and most often are found in the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.439
 riesling and sweets 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.030
 that is also what you most often 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.680
 gets the fingers and there are rough 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.000
 We said three types of sweets 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.009
 to explain to you and to put to heart 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.409
 semi-dry fruit sweet and noble sweet 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.570
 to be seen here as a tidy cabinet 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.950
 Fruity late reading and 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.259
 Trockenbeerenauslese that was now 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.780
 again many words of the series 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.740
 after we start with the feinherben 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.930
 Cabinet on 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.590
 but me with empty glasses the wink with 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.430
 the fence post with double occupancy 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.990
 riesling is the grape we need 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.579
 no longer explain this is Cabinet 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.500
 predicate we have nine in a row 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.509
 explains only something about the serious 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.250
 and intensity of the wine from not all 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.750
 The legs are kabinette and 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.980
 not all kabinette senses fine tart 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.980
 ketchup ostia 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.420
 the only new thing about the Riesling Cabinet 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.850
 feinherb is fine herb that is not 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.770
 legally defined name she 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.690
 is the rule rather than the term 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.760
 used semi-dry because of the one 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.050
 has poor image and is semi-dry 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.730
 legally to a maximum 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.980
 sugar content of 18 grams per liter 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.400
 limited and feinherb also comes often 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.310
 at 20 or 25 grams for use 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.950
 20 grams are legally but then already 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.890
 fruit ice the wine does not taste good 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.380
 sweet hence the artifice with feinherb 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.630
 our order now to you is worried 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.060
 you a riesling cabinet feinherb am 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.820
 Best of the muse and try the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.660
 nicely chilled solo 90 percent of 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.040
 people who say they would 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.110
 Drink only dry wines 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.239
 If you're in love 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.610
 the blind in the glass gives exactly when 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.920
 you were then hooked then worried you 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.959
 the same five years older and 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.600
 try it and then you will see 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.130
 how beautiful the sweetness takes back and 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.440
 What a great food companion 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.430
 and that fit in with almost everything 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.829
 what you can imagine what good 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.769
 sweet wines is a crisp one 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.720
 acid and a good extract so too 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.700
 with a bit of gerbstoffen the the 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.799
 sweet buffer then tastes even weep with 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.290
 40 grams of residual sugar pleasantly light and 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.630
 vibrating that gives itself cabinet or 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:47.480
 as well as here as late vintage comes exactly 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:49.100
 great as always everything on the sweet ones 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.570
 legs often only have eight or nine 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.040
 percent alcohol 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.560
 as you can during the shoot you 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.350
 drink in glasses but admitted the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.690
 late reading with 80 grams of residual sugar at 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.250
 liter have the act then very much 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:07.120
 then saturating many then climb out 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.120
 So, glory in honor 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.470
 with the wine before not yet 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.940
 Yes, I have to get out 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.890
 sometimes get such a wine and 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.570
 Try it tastes very good 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.359
 for eating we are then much riper 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.669
 yes ten years or older last 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.690
 category sweet that are weeping 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.440
 rotten grapes 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.900
 that sounds pretty much 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.180
 but this is noble rot 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.760
 that is harmless you know that from 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.680
 blue cheese for example the pc 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.010
 The crying game comes as an entry 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.930
 scene yes or gray rot and power 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.940
 the shell is broken by the grapes 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.680
 Bears are crumbling just like raisins 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.690
 but what is evaporated is mainly water 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.640
 sugar and acid are retained and 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.890
 The legs then have a lot of acid 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.530
 a lot of sugar and a lot 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.830
 season it if the winter is still a few 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.810
 healthy bears are then called 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.810
 the beerenauslese and when the winter 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.760
 really only raisin pick then that is 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.800
 it's a dry berry selection then 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.930
 mighty much too powerful but 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.970
 very powerful wine exactly because of the too 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.810
 we can do that at one 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.670
 Sunday afternoon not yet on a few 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.320
 reminders and supplements to the financial statements 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.210
 as already explained in a row nine 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.130
 the predicates in Germany only to the 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.020
 sugar content of the must 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.180
 that means a berlese selection does not have to 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.520
 to be of noble women's material and what you have 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.640
 so at bhs from the discounter gets like 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.070
 the abbreviation is often that is true 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.110
 not sweetened later but often 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.290
 not very spicy like an original 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.000
 good pa is worth a good base 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.850
 You do not get to be drunk 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.800
 under 25 euros for the half bottle and 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.200
 there is still the predicate selection that 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.030
 is sweeter than the late-vintage and one such 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.030
 bit of the problem among the 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.540
 sweet wine, on the other hand, growers in some years 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.970
 30 to 40 percent occurs robs 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.960
 and in some years just not that 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.280
 means if you want to know we want one 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.690
 Elite tastes then you have to 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.000
 winzer questions she was going to open and 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.730
 where we try back at the beginning 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.110
 If we were to say he is necessarily one 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:11.150
 taste good sweet wine 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.150
 exactly say it was for today 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.340
 Yes
