you<00:02:31.860> can<00:02:31.980> see<00:02:32.130> it'll<00:02:32.370> probably<00:02:32.550> look<00:02:32.819> similar

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
you can see it'll probably look similar

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.270 
you can see it'll probably look similar
to<00:02:33.300> this<00:02:33.600> with<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.260> dark<00:02:34.470> at<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.709> bottom<00:02:35.069> and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
to this with the dark at the bottom and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.340 
to this with the dark at the bottom and
the<00:02:35.760> search<00:02:35.940> bar<00:02:36.180> at<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.270> top<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.170> think<00:02:37.319> a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
the search bar at the top and I think a

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.260 
the search bar at the top and I think a
lot<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.470> people<00:02:37.590> use<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.190> search<00:02:38.430> bar<00:02:38.700> some<00:02:39.060> do

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
lot of people use the search bar some do

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.690 
lot of people use the search bar some do
so<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.540> can<00:02:39.690> keep<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.989> if<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.170> want<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:41.610> it

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
so you can keep it if you want that it

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.729 
so you can keep it if you want that it
sometimes<00:02:41.880> conflicts<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:42.840> we'll<00:02:43.020> just<00:02:43.110> remove

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
sometimes conflicts so we'll just remove

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.340 
sometimes conflicts so we'll just remove
it<00:02:43.890> for<00:02:44.010> now<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.570> then<00:02:45.570> start<00:02:45.840> both<00:02:46.019> without

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
it for now and then start both without

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.960 
it for now and then start both without
clock<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.980> we'll<00:02:47.130> hold<00:02:47.340> down<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.580> home<00:02:47.610> screen

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
clock so we'll hold down the home screen

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.570 
clock so we'll hold down the home screen
and<00:02:48.360> select<00:02:48.780> widgets<00:02:49.290> wait<00:02:50.070> for<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.400> and

and select widgets wait for that and

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.310 
and select widgets wait for that and
then<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.880> want<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.180> one<00:02:51.330> called<00:02:51.630> Bob<00:02:52.019> clock

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320
