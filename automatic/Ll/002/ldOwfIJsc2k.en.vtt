00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
it's a Porsche but i'm not sure what

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.469 
it's a Porsche but i'm not sure what
Porsche<00:01:10.310> is<00:01:10.549> but<00:01:10.790> it's<00:01:10.880> definitely<00:01:11.060> not<00:01:11.330> the

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
Porsche is but it's definitely not the

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:26.499 
Porsche is but it's definitely not the
spider

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.179 

see<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.659> car<00:01:27.840> looks<00:01:28.079> like<00:01:28.289> a<00:01:28.320> lamb<00:01:28.649> bone<00:01:28.920> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
see that car looks like a lamb bone I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.340 
see that car looks like a lamb bone I
think<00:01:30.030> that's<00:01:30.149> a<00:01:30.299> Lambo<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.020> hundred

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
think that's a Lambo on one hundred

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.790 
think that's a Lambo on one hundred
percent<00:01:31.380> show<00:01:31.770> their<00:01:32.009> looks<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.399> one

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.340 

so<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:38.910> the<00:01:39.060> site<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.720> car<00:01:39.930> that's<00:01:40.200> going

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
so you see the site the car that's going

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.200 
so you see the site the car that's going
to<00:01:40.410> pass<00:01:40.590> me<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.100> by<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.580> side<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.150> is

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
to pass me in by the side of that is

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.990 
to pass me in by the side of that is
like<00:01:42.540> little<00:01:42.780> kind<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.290> indents<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.100> it's

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
like little kind of indents and it's

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.480 
like little kind of indents and it's
it's<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.690> that<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.470> basically<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.070> that

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
it's like that is basically like that

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.650 
it's like that is basically like that
the<00:01:47.790> spider<00:01:48.120> has<00:01:52.760> you'll<00:01:53.760> see<00:01:53.940> it<00:01:54.060> you'll<00:01:54.510> see

the spider has you'll see it you'll see
a<00:01:54.690> more<00:01:54.900> like<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.520> descriptive<00:01:57.230> picture<00:01:58.230> of

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
a more like this descriptive picture of

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.200 
a more like this descriptive picture of
the<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.040> car<00:01:59.250> at<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.490> end<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.030> video<00:02:05.210> it's

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
the the car at the end of the video it's

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.210 
the the car at the end of the video it's
not<00:02:06.330> too<00:02:06.510> hard<00:02:06.720> it's<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:07.200> quite<00:02:07.680> an<00:02:07.770> early<00:02:08.070> hot

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
not too hard it's a quite an early hot

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.690 
not too hard it's a quite an early hot
pursuit<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.220> EMPs<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.120> blocks<00:02:12.420> so

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
pursuit and you have EMPs and blocks so

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.790 
pursuit and you have EMPs and blocks so
it's<00:02:14.700> not<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:14.910> korea<00:02:15.600> say<00:02:15.960> unless<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.410> think

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
it's not that korea say unless I think

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.710 
it's not that korea say unless I think

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
that's the Lambo against at us not taken

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.420 
that's the Lambo against at us not taken
out<00:02:20.870> it's<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.380> only<00:02:22.800> hard<00:02:23.040> thing<00:02:23.100> about

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
out it's just the only hard thing about

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.640 
out it's just the only hard thing about
this<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:24.060> achievement<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.750> finding<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.440> car

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650

this this achievement is finding the car
itself<00:02:26.070> taking<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.610> downs<00:02:26.820> no<00:02:27.030> problem<00:02:27.480> just

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
itself taking the downs no problem just

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.230 
itself taking the downs no problem just
got<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.350> find<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.650> yes<00:02:29.490> it's<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:29.880> car<00:02:30.090> around
