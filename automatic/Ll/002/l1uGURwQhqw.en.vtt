00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.340
 to 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.190
 Y 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.880
 hi how are you here I bring you another 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.800
 very simple design but very nice to me 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.320
 I like it a lot 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.120
 here I am putting the almond with a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.180
 acrylic 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.630
 opaque salmon color cited a mixture that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.740
 I did here I am showing you this 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.610
 mix that I'm putting and I made it with 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:35.870
 golden players and here I say crystal what 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.320
 I'm putting in a triangle shape 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.720
 be skewed 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.230
 I made a mistake I caught a lot of monomer 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.870
 before picking up the acrylic and I was 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.430
 I was running a lot so do not do 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.829
 that mistake you here also to the 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.170
 pick up this pearl that is the real color 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.890
 organic beige 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.870
 you also have a lot of monomer in 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.539
 the brush before picking up the acrylic and 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.550
 battaglia a little there but also that 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:10.310
 I'm doing it sideways 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.310
 like a triangular triangle on the side 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.590
 now sometimes to the golden angel 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:22.110
 many also say they dance golden 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.250
 I apply little acrylic crystal one capita 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.870
 down to be able to paste the angel wing 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.360
 I'm putting it with the brush I'm going 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.660
 accommodating between 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.350
 of the two colors I put up to 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.350
 get to tip 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.450
 and 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.640
 I took clean monomer 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.710
 to be able to encapsulate I advise you 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.680
 let the angel wing dry 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.390
 a little good the acrylic because if 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.990
 encapsulate then then they get up 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.500
 the bits me in capsule then then 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.690
 and if I fight a little if I was moved 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.490
 a few pieces but I advise you what 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.000
 let dry a little before 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.000
 encapsulate 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.390
 here I took a brown glaze 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.740
 very short the color and says 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.690
 manchitas to design 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.800
 Leopard pulls what you want to say in 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.840
 the white triangular this also what 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.450
 can do before I encapsulate 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.210
 I think it 's better 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.150
 but this time I put it on 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.730
 just let them take off very well before 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.580
 put the end and gel because if they are not done 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.040
 bombitas if it does not dry well but there 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.510
 I'm delineating the brown spots that 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.510
 I did with this line you're like color 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.510
 bronze 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.430
 the days are put I put dots in the 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.430
 spaces left 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:04.049
 and here I'm going to take a gel 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.710
 this is an orange stick 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.540
 showing 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.939
 on that side take gel 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.260
 and I 'll put it in the area of 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:16.250
 the smile 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.250
 as they are very neutral shades very 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.250
 natural 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.360
 that's why I'm putting it on swarovski senna 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.110
 in the smile to delineate the so that 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.110
 highlight more 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.269
 and this with the same orange stick what 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.510
 I put a little bit into the gel and that's how 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.560
 I raise my 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.560
 they are obs kiss 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.540
 and this one gets into the lamp about 30 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.610
 seconds and it goes very well this way is 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.290
 as I always stick the hoops that never 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.690
 has battled that I fall to my 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.030
 Clients never drop them 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.180
 but I never say never true but it is 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.460
 rare the time it falls and this already after 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.340
 I put the end and the stand I'm using 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.170
 organic that little pro team band in the 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.760
 cuticle 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.240
 now I'm putting the end and gel and 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.390
 It is very simple but very beautiful in 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.269
 the camera is not appreciated to see as much as 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:22.340
 the acrylic with glitter and the and the 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.340
 angel wing shine very beautiful 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.420
 He liked this design very much and is very 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.270
 easy and simple as you can see 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.970
 I wish you liked it, I hope it's done 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.150
 could capture better appreciate with this 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.790
 camera struggled much there want them 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.790
 petition to those who are looking at that 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:45.420
 make a video to see how to place 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.120
 the camera as a bataller this I hope 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.710
 to be able to improve little by little but to see 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.430
 some chips that you can give me for 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.650
 learn and improve my my videos are the 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:00.050
 I thank you very much I hope you have 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.050
 liked and even the naan thanks
