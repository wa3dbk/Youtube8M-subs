book was incredible and I finished it
about<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.250> week<00:00:44.309> ago<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.600> kept<00:00:45.840> thinking<00:00:45.989> I

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
about a week ago and I kept thinking I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.080 
about a week ago and I kept thinking I
wanted<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.649> do<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> video<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.879> was

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
wanted to do a video on it but I was

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.970 
wanted to do a video on it but I was
sort<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.329> torn<00:00:48.600> because<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.379> know<00:00:49.500> who<00:00:49.680> wants

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
sort of torn because you know who wants

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.939 
sort of torn because you know who wants
to<00:00:50.039> watch<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.730> video<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.510> book<00:00:51.899> that's<00:00:52.710> kind

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
to watch a video on a book that's kind

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.229 
to watch a video on a book that's kind
of<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> whole<00:00:53.190> reason<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.550> do<00:00:53.610> videos<00:00:54.030> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
of the whole reason I do videos is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.220 
of the whole reason I do videos is
because<00:00:54.570> books<00:00:54.870> are<00:00:55.170> different<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:57.629> it's

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
because books are different but it's

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.599 
because books are different but it's
stayed<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> back<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.890> my<00:00:58.980> mind<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.520> I

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
stayed in the back of my mind and I

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.400 
stayed in the back of my mind and I
think<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.059> realized<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.780> few<00:01:00.809> reasons<00:01:01.260> why<00:01:01.379> I

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
think I realized a few reasons why I

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.110 
think I realized a few reasons why I
wanted<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.829> do<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> quick<00:01:02.160> video<00:01:02.370> encouraging

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
wanted to do a quick video encouraging

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
spent you know about seven years trying

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.740 
spent you know about seven years trying
to<00:05:13.650> digest<00:05:13.830> a<00:05:14.190> lot<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:14.520> stuff<00:05:14.789> on<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.389> YouTube

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
to digest a lot of stuff on the YouTube

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.420 
to digest a lot of stuff on the YouTube
and<00:05:15.870> Internet<00:05:16.080> forms<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:16.620> all<00:05:16.680> that<00:05:16.860> so<00:05:17.400> I

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
and Internet forms and all that so I

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.520
