00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.920
 Panasonic 's large factory in boomer province 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.240
 It was made in the corner of a large site 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.890
 It is a refrigerated showcase of the right and a supermarket 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:28.580
 Since each store is different, you have to make a small-lot, high-mix product 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.850
 A strange figure is in one corner of the line 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:43.850
 Wearing a wearable device called smart glass to the head 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:48.460
 We are doing a complex task even snappy 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:54.560
 I think only by skillful skill 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:57.220
 It is distribution money such as a good picture such as this by radio from a tablet 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.210
 Screw bracket fixed 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:07.460
 Here I was watching at the terminal 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:10.210
 The snap shot of the work process flows in order 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:16.799
 In the work manual using photos 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.799
 With this , even beginners can work without getting lost 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:25.909
 Panasonic started using this terminal on part of the assembly line last November 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:35.000
 Work is getting better gradually though first generation second generation 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.990
 Comes into the 8 hours of that standard of man hours from the first generation by turning on 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.930
 The 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:49.490
 Next to a skilled worker with a camera on his head 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.490
 I shoot the work with his eyes and use it for the work manual 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.659
 He said battery still be taught such a skilled person Toka that the leader is for horizontal until now 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:03.670
 I put a certain weight there, but 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.670
 It 's a revolutionary way because you can tell everything to workers with a single photo 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.000
 There are about 800 processes for assembly work 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.890
 Yes 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.160
 When I get this low floor spread 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.390
 All the work of one process with Sochi 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:26.150
 This about I length and a One side by side go figure 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:31.299
 It is the most difficult skill to remember all the work alone 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.299
 The conventional work manual is a thick booklet 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.440
 There are 200 pages 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.129
 Once work is done, I stop my hand and watch again 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.129
 Oh I see 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:48.600
 In the future we will introduce this method, which has been in small quantities and many varieties, in the whole process 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.770
 It is Fukumoto of train yesterday 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.810
 Because I waited for know-how 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.310
 This worker in the hallway Lou's member of the company will be very large and put on Curly 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.319
 you know 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.319
 In that sense more effective 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.230
 The reason for the attention of smart glasses is leaf 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.769
 This google glass 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.330
 But google is a sudden thing last month 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:21.990
 Announced to stop selling to individuals 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:24.290
 It is said that the problem of privacy is the cause, and in the future it is taken to development for corporate use 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.290
 I will 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:38.380
 Actually, Japanese manufacturers are fighting more than other countries in market development for corporate use 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:43.140
 Each maker introduces products one after another in spite of the stagnation of google 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.140
 Selling to production and logistics sites 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.549
 Smart glasses are also in the hospital 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.260
 This is a hemodialysis treatment room 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:03.130
 While looking at the position of the blood vessel with a small sonography device 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.069
 Prick the patient's arm 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.939
 Clean the moon station and put it back to your body 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.939
 Then I will stab 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.530
 I 'm out now 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.060
 This white point is 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.810
 It is ahead of you of the needle 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.290
 Almost without shifting eyes 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.250
 The color is that you can move the needle 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:35.200
 I think it's a merit 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:35.200
 It can be seen on a terminal with the head of a small sonograph 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:40.979
 I used to check on a remote monitor 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:49.770
 There is a very big sense of security that the actual needle situation and the screen are visible at the end of the hand. 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.680
 I worked on the terminals used by Panasonic and Todai Hospital 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.680
 Brother Industries 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.400
 Launched specifically for corporate customers in 2012 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.889
 this 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.639
 Left and right 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:15.180
 Well, however that show the image in a see-through 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.490
 Come in hospital before Google Glass that it was the first time in the world 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.760
 Hmm 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:27.030
 This new terminal already used by Panasonic etc. 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.030
 It will be released in earnest this fall 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:35.300
 We greatly improved old terminal and enabled to use with putting on glasses 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:46.740
 I can say that it is this kind of analog sensibility because you can move freely in the 5 schools here 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:51.500
 I think that's where such places and what are the characteristics of Japanese companies, so those places are 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.500
 Say it is nice if Ikere to survive become strengths
