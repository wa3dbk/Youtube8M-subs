dust filters and optional to 120

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.640 
dust filters and optional to 120
millimeter<00:01:26.909> fans<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.390> could<00:01:27.509> install<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.530> it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
millimeter fans you could install but it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.590 
millimeter fans you could install but it
does<00:01:28.770> not<00:01:28.890> come<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.189> those<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.640> course<00:01:29.909> take

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
does not come with those of course take

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.020 
does not come with those of course take
out<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> aside<00:01:31.259> panel<00:01:31.650> because<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.280> has<00:01:32.490> thumb

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
out the aside panel because it has thumb

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.359 
out the aside panel because it has thumb
screws<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.659> easily<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.200> comes<00:01:34.380> off<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:34.950> can

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
screws so easily it comes off and we can

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.130 
screws so easily it comes off and we can
take<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> quick<00:01:35.909> peek<00:01:36.150> here<00:01:36.420> at<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> inside<00:01:36.960> of

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
take a quick peek here at the inside of

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.109 
take a quick peek here at the inside of
this<00:01:37.259> case<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.860> said<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.250> black<00:01:38.520> inside

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
this case like I said it's black inside

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.380 
this case like I said it's black inside
and<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:40.759> starting<00:01:41.759> from<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> bottom

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
and out and starting from the bottom

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.889 
and out and starting from the bottom
here<00:01:42.720> where<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.350> PSU<00:01:43.890> lies<00:01:44.390> it's<00:01:45.390> got<00:01:45.630> dust

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
here where the PSU lies it's got dust

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.569 
here where the PSU lies it's got dust
filters<00:01:46.290> there<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:46.979> that's<00:01:47.159> pretty<00:01:47.369> good<00:01:47.520> that

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
filters there so that's pretty good that

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.940 
filters there so that's pretty good that
they<00:01:47.759> included<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.320> mainstream

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
they included that this is a mainstream

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.490 
they included that this is a mainstream
budget<00:01:50.850> case<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.540> for<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:52.110> included

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
budget case so for them to have included

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.399 
budget case so for them to have included
dust<00:01:52.649> filters<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.070> pretty<00:01:53.310> good<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.409> moving

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
dust filters is pretty good and moving

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.260 
dust filters is pretty good and moving
up<00:01:55.680> here<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.189> see<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.700> grills<00:01:56.969> for

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
up here you can see that the grills for

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.080 
up here you can see that the grills for
