00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:10.549
 Today is the protoleaf channel 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:18.020
 It's can not be with the pin been told me you blooming coming and what branches to bloom 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:19.369
 Roughly varieties of your own home Clematis if just time that has been extended now sprout 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.140
 Although you may not know 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.500
 System is real is seen 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:31.970
 It all grew out of what it meant 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:34.970
 It is said that about how long the flower blooms from the dead branch 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:39.140
 At first it is said that the old branch bloom 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:48.350
 The type Kisaki type is here 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:50.030
 For example, this is look from there vine that grew last year already in this way the colon and to that of this year spring flowers 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.960
 There is blooming flower eyes 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.910
 That has increased the previous year 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.170
 A flower blooms immediately from the branch This is the old branch bloom and 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.930
 Hmm 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.110
 It will be 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.650
 And this time the opposite Roko 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.670
 There is no string of last year 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:13.000
 And I've cut it because it's been done 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:18.920
 Thus new from inside the ground 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.810
 I say because I have shoots ride this is the cn's bloom 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:31.759
 And because it is in the middle 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:38.240
 Well it made to the fact that both old and new me but from where it was extended last year as earlier 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.940
 In this way we have been growing the vine does not have a flower in here 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.770
 In 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:53.609
 This type was obtained both old and new so come with flowers on the tip and come stretch a little bit more 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:57.179
 It is not that I do not know the house as one indication that will be 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:02:01.049
 To some extent it is the timing when a new sprout comes out 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:07.880
 My house is an old branch or both old and new 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.880
 It is also an important time to check if it is ca
