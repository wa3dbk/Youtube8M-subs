00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.800

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.349
 aliexpress website 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.420

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.720

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.960

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.040

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.510
 nothing there's putting off here means u 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.940

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:45.690
 barcode so we get that in our 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.969
 we have a set of something like 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.170
 instructions in chinese and english 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.530
 languages I think we do not need the same 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.090
 charger wiring 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:04.129
 so yusb and small such plug as on 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.860
 but those were up being inserted over here 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.250
 ear hook and bluetooth itself 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.890
 bluetooth headset may 30th day tea and 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.030
 here it says bluetooth and all button 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.600
 nothing else means here we have 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.450
 rubber ear cushions so mean that 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.630
 regards cost cost i'm exactly 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.630
 I remember that less than 200 rubles that is 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.140
 actually very affordable cheap goods 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.110
 chic 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.060
 now we will naturally test it and 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.820
 already make a conclusion worth it with nonsense 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.450
 acquire or not but looks like 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.880
 not bad 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.799
 and the cool thing is that she's small 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.770
 but the only thing you will need to check 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.380
 how good and the other person will be 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.299
 hear us when we talk here 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.570
 mikrofonchik here but respectively 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.880
 very far it turns out we are 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.710
 mikrofonchik and unknown will be good 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.250
 heard or not so now let me 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.979
 will test it 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.719
 and I'll be back to show you how dreams 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.780
 ranked with the phone is everything ok 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.990
 Well, some kind of conclusion with you 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.520
 already do about 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.290
 This device is all I'm going to the test 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.930
 so friends I tested this 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.140
 bluetooth headset means i want 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.890
 say bluetooth headset is working 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.900
 the sound quality of the interlocutor in principle 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.010
 averages are a bit muffled but 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.420
 I can hear perfectly I also hear everything 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.780
 the volume is adjusted on the phone all 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.720
 one button works as I said 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.510
 one click is take the second call 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.690
 pressing end call that is all 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.910
 works great and for this cost i 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.610
 I think that you can buy this thing 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.800
 for those people who are long enough 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.620
 work doesn't work but speaks 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.760
 telephone and, accordingly, the hand gets tired and 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.130
 wow tired and brains tired in general 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.870
 You can buy about the connection for 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.410
 order to connect this bluetooth 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.950
 Headset to the smartphone must be pressed 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.220
 on the button and hold it for 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.980
 three seconds when we blink two 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.700

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.370

 available to be on the smartphone then 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.310
 there is on the smartphone it is determined by us 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.720
