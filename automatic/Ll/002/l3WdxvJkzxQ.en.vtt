00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.179 

I'll<00:01:25.960> cut<00:01:26.320> it<00:01:26.470> right<00:01:26.710> here<00:01:27.159> and<00:01:27.340> then<00:01:28.180> I<00:01:28.479> will

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
I'll cut it right here and then I will

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:43.440 
I'll cut it right here and then I will
hide<00:01:30.189> it<00:01:40.950> because<00:01:41.950> we<00:01:42.310> have<00:01:42.520> in<00:01:42.820> our<00:01:43.000> program

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
hide it because we have in our program

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.069 
hide it because we have in our program
we<00:01:43.570> have<00:01:43.750> n<00:01:44.020> so<00:01:44.259> fetcher<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:45.009> ABC<00:01:45.939> then<00:01:46.689> it's

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
we have n so fetcher and ABC then it's

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.069 
we have n so fetcher and ABC then it's
just<00:01:47.590> matter<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.490> click<00:01:49.119> to<00:01:49.450> switch<00:01:49.840> the

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
just matter of click to switch the

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.950 
just matter of click to switch the
languages<00:01:50.710> by<00:01:51.429> doing<00:01:52.060> this<00:01:52.299> you<00:01:52.570> would<00:01:52.750> know

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
languages by doing this you would know

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.710 
languages by doing this you would know
both<00:01:53.289> languages<00:01:53.799> so<00:01:54.220> Phaedra<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:54.880> ABC<00:01:55.569> and

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
both languages so Phaedra and ABC and

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.169 
both languages so Phaedra and ABC and
will<00:01:55.899> be<00:01:56.170> much<00:01:56.590> much<00:01:56.860> more<00:01:57.220> advanced<00:01:57.549> than<00:01:57.759> any

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
will be much much more advanced than any

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.320 
will be much much more advanced than any
any<00:01:59.039> musician<00:02:00.039> who<00:02:00.280> knows<00:02:00.459> only<00:02:00.729> one<00:02:01.119> language

any musician who knows only one language
only<00:02:01.929> so<00:02:02.289> theta<00:02:02.560> or<00:02:02.890> one<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.340> ABC<00:02:04.000> be

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
only so theta or one the ABC be

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.610 
only so theta or one the ABC be
believable<00:02:05.770> like<00:02:06.189> I<00:02:06.399> am
