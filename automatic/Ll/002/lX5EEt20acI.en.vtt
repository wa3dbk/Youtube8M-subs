photovoltaic system electric heating
wasn't<00:01:01.750> possible<00:01:01.900> so<00:01:02.560> that<00:01:02.770> left<00:01:02.980> solar<00:01:03.370> of

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
wasn't possible so that left solar of

on such a small roof comes with its own
set<00:01:08.530> of<00:01:08.560> challenges

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
set of challenges

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.300 
set of challenges
so<00:01:09.880> what's<00:01:10.150> this<00:01:10.270> you're<00:01:10.420> actually<00:01:10.510> made<00:01:10.840> from

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
so what's this you're actually made from

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.130 
so what's this you're actually made from
well<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.460> matrix<00:01:13.119> inside<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.510> panel<00:01:13.869> is<00:01:13.990> made

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
well the matrix inside the panel is made

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.130 
well the matrix inside the panel is made
of<00:01:14.260> copper<00:01:14.460> there's<00:01:15.460> a<00:01:15.690> selective<00:01:16.690> coating

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
of copper there's a selective coating

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.980 
of copper there's a selective coating
paint<00:01:17.590> on<00:01:17.770> it<00:01:17.890> so<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.640> whole<00:01:18.790> surface<00:01:19.630> inside

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
paint on it so the whole surface inside

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.310 
paint on it so the whole surface inside
is<00:01:20.170> made<00:01:20.410> of<00:01:20.530> copper<00:01:21.040> and<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.570> casing<00:01:22.930> itself

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
is made of copper and the casing itself

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.750 
is made of copper and the casing itself
is<00:01:23.700> made<00:01:24.700> of<00:01:24.850> galvanized<00:01:25.600> steel<00:01:25.750> right<00:01:26.760> but

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
is made of galvanized steel right but

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.219 
is made of galvanized steel right but
instead<00:01:28.060> of<00:01:28.210> having<00:01:28.360> glass<00:01:28.720> like<00:01:29.020> where

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
instead of having glass like where

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.640 
instead of having glass like where
normally<00:01:29.710> for<00:01:29.950> domestic<00:01:30.630> houses<00:01:31.630> we<00:01:32.500> have

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
normally for domestic houses we have

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.480 
normally for domestic houses we have
your<00:01:33.509> polycarbonate<00:01:34.509> which<00:01:34.810> is<00:01:34.990> still<00:01:35.920> tough

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
your polycarbonate which is still tough

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.060 
your polycarbonate which is still tough
enough<00:01:36.790> but<00:01:37.540> we<00:01:38.080> have<00:01:38.170> no<00:01:38.320> risk<00:01:38.500> of<00:01:38.680> breakage

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
enough but we have no risk of breakage

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.790 
enough but we have no risk of breakage
because<00:01:39.490> this<00:01:40.300> needs<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.690> move<00:01:40.810> in<00:01:40.990> travel<00:01:41.320> yes

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
because this needs to move in travel yes

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.260 
because this needs to move in travel yes
and<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.430> know<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.580> may<00:01:42.820> have<00:01:42.850> a<00:01:43.000> branch

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
and you know you may have a branch

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.970 
and you know you may have a branch
falling<00:01:43.540> on<00:01:43.750> it<00:01:43.870> on<00:01:44.050> something<00:01:44.290> so<00:01:44.620> we<00:01:44.770> prefer

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
falling on it on something so we prefer

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.280 
falling on it on something so we prefer
to<00:01:45.130> keep<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:45.700> simple<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.570> it<00:01:46.750> will<00:01:46.930> be<00:01:47.050> easier

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
to keep it simple and it will be easier

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.350 
to keep it simple and it will be easier
to<00:01:47.320> replace<00:01:47.710> if<00:01:47.950> need<00:01:48.130> be<00:01:48.160> as<00:01:48.400> well<00:01:48.580> so<00:01:49.150> and

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
to replace if need be as well so and

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.630 
to replace if need be as well so and
that's<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.350> way<00:01:50.680> it's<00:01:50.800> been<00:01:50.890> structured<00:01:51.340> for

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
that's the way it's been structured for

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.310 
that's the way it's been structured for
this<00:01:51.760> particular<00:01:51.940> process<00:01:52.450> obviously<00:01:52.840> this

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
this particular process obviously this

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.620 
this particular process obviously this
panel<00:01:54.010> is<00:01:54.159> super<00:01:54.730> light<00:01:54.880> comparing<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.510> other

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
panel is super light comparing to other

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.440 
panel is super light comparing to other
solar<00:01:56.470> panels<00:01:56.860> we<00:01:56.980> make<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:57.400> can<00:01:57.550> see<00:01:57.760> can

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
solar panels we make and you can see can

solar panels we make and you can see can
be<00:01:58.480> lifted<00:01:58.960> easily<00:01:59.380> it's<00:01:59.980> probably<00:02:00.340> less<00:02:01.060> than

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
slim than this one as you can see the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.449 
slim than this one as you can see the
brackets<00:02:22.810> here<00:02:22.959> is<00:02:23.110> very<00:02:23.320> massive<00:02:23.739> this<00:02:24.310> is

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
brackets here is very massive this is

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.479 
brackets here is very massive this is
only<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.730> 90<00:02:24.910> liter<00:02:25.239> tank<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:25.900> when<00:02:26.830> it's<00:02:26.980> empty

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
only a 90 liter tank and when it's empty

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.810 
only a 90 liter tank and when it's empty
as<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.420> can<00:02:28.570> see<00:02:28.780> it's<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:30.220> weight<00:02:30.370> of<00:02:30.549> it<00:02:30.670> is

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
as you can see it's the weight of it is

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.910 
as you can see it's the weight of it is
quite<00:02:31.030> insignificant<00:02:31.450> but<00:02:32.049> because<00:02:32.769> we

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
quite insignificant but because we

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.530 
quite insignificant but because we
thought<00:02:33.100> about<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.940> fact<00:02:34.180> that<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.450> whole

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
thought about the fact that the whole

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.840 
thought about the fact that the whole
thing<00:02:34.810> is<00:02:34.930> moving<00:02:35.110> we<00:02:35.890> put<00:02:36.100> this<00:02:36.220> we<00:02:36.640> announce

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
thing is moving we put this we announce

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.130 
thing is moving we put this we announce
it<00:02:37.030> with<00:02:37.239> extra<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.340> strength<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.989> way

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
it with extra and strength and the way

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.420 
it with extra and strength and the way
we're<00:02:41.320> going<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.560> anchor<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.130> roof<00:02:42.250> is

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
we're going to anchor it to the roof is

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.340 
we're going to anchor it to the roof is
also<00:02:42.700> going<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:42.910> be<00:02:43.000> instead<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:43.989> using<00:02:44.200> a

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
also going to be instead of using a

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.229 
also going to be instead of using a
normal<00:02:44.380> text<00:02:44.799> screws<00:02:45.100> or<00:02:45.340> other<00:02:45.579> fixing

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
normal text screws or other fixing

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.280 
normal text screws or other fixing
material<00:02:46.750> we're

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
material we're

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.059 
material we're
looking<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.650> use<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:48.069> full<00:02:48.849> and<00:02:49.260> not<00:02:50.260> bolt<00:02:50.709> kind

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
looking to use a full and not bolt kind

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.399 
looking to use a full and not bolt kind
of<00:02:51.159> system<00:02:51.549> that<00:02:51.579> can't<00:02:52.090> really<00:02:52.329> rip<00:02:53.140> itself

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409 
of system that can't really rip itself

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.330 
of system that can't really rip itself
of<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.909> roof<00:02:54.909> so<00:02:55.239> that<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.439> one<00:02:57.099> difference

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
of the roof so that is one difference

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.190 
of the roof so that is one difference
the<00:02:57.700> other<00:02:57.819> difference<00:02:58.239> is<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.629> panel<00:02:58.900> itself

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
the other difference is the panel itself

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.709 
the other difference is the panel itself
again<00:03:00.099> normally<00:03:00.489> in<00:03:00.609> a<00:03:00.730> traditional<00:03:01.359> house<00:03:01.510> we

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:01.719 
again normally in a traditional house we

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.750 
again normally in a traditional house we
put<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.989> panel<00:03:02.549> vertically<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:03.700> not

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
put the panel vertically and not

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.599 
put the panel vertically and not
horizontally<00:03:04.500> again<00:03:05.500> here<00:03:05.799> we<00:03:06.040> have<00:03:06.129> a<00:03:06.250> fairly

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
horizontally again here we have a fairly

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.179 
horizontally again here we have a fairly
short<00:03:06.849> roof<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.900> panel<00:03:08.200> is<00:03:08.319> wider<00:03:08.950> and

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
short roof so the panel is wider and

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.890 
short roof so the panel is wider and
shorter<00:03:09.430> rather<00:03:09.790> than<00:03:09.970> longer<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.720> slimmer

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
shorter rather than longer and slimmer

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.160 
shorter rather than longer and slimmer
so<00:03:11.379> again<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.220> was<00:03:12.400> customized<00:03:13.030> for<00:03:13.659> the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
so again this was customized for the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.319 
so again this was customized for the
situation<00:03:14.349> area<00:03:14.980> why<00:03:15.549> is<00:03:15.700> it<00:03:15.819> a<00:03:15.879> problem<00:03:16.209> when

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
situation area why is it a problem when

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.119 
situation area why is it a problem when
there<00:03:16.480> are<00:03:16.569> no<00:03:16.659> temperatures<00:03:17.139> because<00:03:17.889> those

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
there are no temperatures because those

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:19.530 
there are no temperatures because those
copper<00:03:18.459> pipes<00:03:18.700> are<00:03:18.879> very<00:03:19.030> slim

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
copper pipes are very slim

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.599 
copper pipes are very slim
and<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.200> waters<00:03:20.530> start<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:20.950> crystallize<00:03:21.159> they

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
and the waters start to crystallize they

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.220 
and the waters start to crystallize they
expand<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.120> there<00:03:22.299> in<00:03:22.389> order<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.689> explain<00:03:23.049> so

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
expand and there in order to explain so

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.960 
expand and there in order to explain so
they're<00:03:23.409> just<00:03:23.590> going<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:23.829> buckle<00:03:24.040> these

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
they're just going to buckle these

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.479 
they're just going to buckle these
risers<00:03:25.359> so<00:03:25.569> that<00:03:26.079> Valve<00:03:26.439> will<00:03:26.739> save<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.340> day

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
risers so that Valve will save the day

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.960 
risers so that Valve will save the day
in<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:27.939> way<00:03:28.090> by<00:03:28.950> sensing<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:30.099> there's<00:03:30.340> frost

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
in a way by sensing that there's frost

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.449 
in a way by sensing that there's frost
conditions<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:32.169> it<00:03:32.319> will<00:03:32.470> allow<00:03:32.709> movement<00:03:33.069> of

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
conditions and it will allow movement of

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.940 
conditions and it will allow movement of
water<00:03:33.879> and<00:03:34.329> those<00:03:34.419> Rises<00:03:34.870> they<00:03:35.439> stop<00:03:35.709> it<00:03:35.829> from

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
water and those Rises they stop it from

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.699 
water and those Rises they stop it from
freezing<00:03:36.159> when<00:03:36.970> it<00:03:37.120> fills<00:03:37.389> here<00:03:37.840> any

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
freezing when it fills here any

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.759 
freezing when it fills here any
temperature<00:03:39.189> that<00:03:39.430> is<00:03:39.609> less<00:03:39.849> than<00:03:40.030> 4<00:03:40.329> degrees

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
temperature that is less than 4 degrees

opens<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:45.609> it<00:03:45.700> start<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.060> drip<00:03:46.269> off<00:03:46.419> the<00:03:46.659> water

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
opens and it start to drip off the water

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.949 
opens and it start to drip off the water
right<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.859> spread<00:03:48.430> movement<00:03:48.849> and<00:03:49.120> that

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
right and spread movement and that

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.780 
right and spread movement and that
movement<00:03:50.230> obviously<00:03:50.859> it<00:03:50.950> doesn't<00:03:51.159> want<00:03:51.459> one

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
movement obviously it doesn't want one

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.849 
movement obviously it doesn't want one
foot<00:03:52.000> or<00:03:52.150> move<00:03:52.329> they<00:03:52.840> don't<00:03:52.870> raise<00:03:53.260> yeah<00:03:53.709> it's

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
foot or move they don't raise yeah it's

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.550 
foot or move they don't raise yeah it's
like<00:03:54.040> living<00:03:54.519> your<00:03:54.690> garden<00:03:55.690> hose<00:03:55.810> open<00:03:56.169> your

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
like living your garden hose open your

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.080 
like living your garden hose open your
hips<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:57.010> it<00:03:57.129> doesn't<00:03:57.400> freeze<00:03:57.519> so<00:03:57.760> that's<00:03:57.970> the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
hips and it doesn't freeze so that's the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.530 
hips and it doesn't freeze so that's the
same<00:03:58.269> principle<00:03:58.949> for<00:03:59.949> us<00:03:59.979> it<00:04:00.280> was<00:04:00.489> a<00:04:00.849> very

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
same principle for us it was a very

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.479 
same principle for us it was a very
unique<00:04:01.780> challenge<00:04:02.290> it's<00:04:02.799> like<00:04:03.040> trying<00:04:03.400> to

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
unique challenge it's like trying to

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.219 
unique challenge it's like trying to
create<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.269> square<00:04:04.569> egg<00:04:04.840> but<00:04:05.709> we're<00:04:06.159> very<00:04:06.280> much

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
create a square egg but we're very much

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.539 
create a square egg but we're very much
into<00:04:08.229> those<00:04:08.409> kind<00:04:08.650> of<00:04:08.709> challenges<00:04:08.949> and<00:04:09.340> want

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
into those kind of challenges and want

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.140 
into those kind of challenges and want
to<00:04:09.699> showcase<00:04:10.510> that<00:04:11.079> we<00:04:11.319> can<00:04:11.530> do<00:04:11.680> solar<00:04:11.949> even<00:04:12.609> to

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
to showcase that we can do solar even to

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.629 
to showcase that we can do solar even to
the<00:04:13.269> smallest<00:04:13.419> house<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.199> we<00:04:15.099> currently<00:04:15.280> have

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
the smallest house and we currently have

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.310 
the smallest house and we currently have
solar<00:04:15.970> for<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.359> largest<00:04:16.780> project<00:04:17.109> in<00:04:17.199> New

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
solar for the largest project in New

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.659 
solar for the largest project in New
Zealand<00:04:17.620> this<00:04:17.829> will<00:04:18.039> be<00:04:18.159> the<00:04:18.280> other<00:04:18.340> end<00:04:18.609> of

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
Zealand this will be the other end of

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.479 
Zealand this will be the other end of
the<00:04:18.820> extreme<00:04:19.120> so<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.780> we<00:04:20.769> are<00:04:20.889> way<00:04:21.099> up<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.370> the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
the extreme so and we are way up to the

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.100 
the extreme so and we are way up to the
challenge

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
challenge
