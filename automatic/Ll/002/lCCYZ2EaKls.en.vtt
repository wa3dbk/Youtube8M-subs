00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.760
 in the past month of December it 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.300
 presented at the center porsche marbella 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.670
 the seventh generation of the 911 races 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.369
 very few are the models that reach 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.660
 the 50 years of history reinventing 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.660
 in each renewal 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.430
 consider 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.980
 why 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.060
 but the action 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.350
 the values 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.350
 the town although s 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.370
 center porsche marbella allowed us 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.580
 try this latest version of the race 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.520
 more specifically the porsche 911 race 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.740
 s aesthetically maintains the lines of 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.200
 their previous models although renovated 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.630
 giving it a more current and dynamic 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.030
 also offers mechanical innovations and 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.420
 technologies that further improve your 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.420
 driving 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.340
 the interior is elegant sober more 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.019
 broad than its predecessor giving it great 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.150
 part of the protagonism of the driver 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:28.610
 The console has also been extended 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.610
 central being similar to the Panamanian 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:03:01.210
 and has a 3.8 six cylinder engine 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.240
 that generates a power of 400 horses 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.270
 and that is able to accelerate from 0 to 100 in 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.180
 43 seconds can also reach a 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:16.420
 maximum speed of 304 kilometers per 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:19.420
 time the new 911 models can 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.250
 optionally equip the pdk change of 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.830
 seven speeds with manual transmission 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.080
 sequential and automatic and for 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.360
 nostalgic a seven manual change 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.750
 speeds their combined consumption is 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.910
 95 liters in annual change and 87 liters 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.430
 every 100 kilometers in the change 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.989
 automatic is also lighter thanks 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.140
 to the new aluminum body and 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:45.480
 stiffer steel and weighing 45 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.480
 kilograms lower than that of its predecessor
