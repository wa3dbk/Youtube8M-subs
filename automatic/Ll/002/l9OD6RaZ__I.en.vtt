00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.660 

you

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.949 

and<00:04:03.670> I<00:04:03.760> felt<00:04:03.970> like<00:04:04.060> I<00:04:04.209> heard<00:04:04.540> it<00:04:04.689> a<00:04:04.810> little

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
and I felt like I heard it a little

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.020 
and I felt like I heard it a little
better<00:04:05.110> that<00:04:05.379> time<00:04:05.560> while<00:04:05.799> playing<00:04:06.069> I<00:04:06.400> also

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
better that time while playing I also

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.699 
better that time while playing I also
could<00:04:07.239> have<00:04:07.329> sang<00:04:07.569> this<00:04:07.720> exercise<00:04:08.260> without

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
could have sang this exercise without

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.500 
could have sang this exercise without
ghosting<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.400> right<00:04:09.549> hand<00:04:10.290> okay<00:04:11.290> so<00:04:12.420> once<00:04:13.420> you

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
ghosting the right hand okay so once you

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.210 
ghosting the right hand okay so once you
feel<00:04:13.689> comfortable<00:04:13.720> with<00:04:14.140> one<00:04:14.439> key<00:04:14.650> simply

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
feel comfortable with one key simply

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.830 
feel comfortable with one key simply
move<00:04:15.459> on<00:04:15.579> to<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.879> next<00:04:15.909> key<00:04:16.299> up<00:04:16.479> a<00:04:16.570> fourth

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
move on to the next key up a fourth

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.840 
move on to the next key up a fourth
until<00:04:17.440> you've<00:04:17.560> gone<00:04:17.680> through<00:04:17.919> all<00:04:18.039> 12<00:04:18.190> keys<00:04:18.579> I

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
until you've gone through all 12 keys I

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.750

think if you do that you've come a long

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.480 
think if you do that you've come a long
