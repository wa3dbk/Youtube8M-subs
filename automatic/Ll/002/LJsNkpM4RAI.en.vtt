00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.079
 dangers can hide in such a quiet 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.879
 and a peaceful place in our courtyard but 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.030
 Something I do not see that traffic flow 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.280
 road lanes commendable that you 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.190
 I remember so well what I mean 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.619
 told at the last lesson however 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.530
 Present attention in environmentalists there are garages 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.570
 stand our neighbors' cars through the arch 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.759
 gate entrance to the courtyard 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.940
 so what are you and many kids 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:23.380
 often do not pay attention to it 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:27.069
 let's go to the entrance of my first courtyard 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.099
 safety rule never play 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:32.740
 counties or exit from the yard and in the arches 

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:34.479
 marat when a car from the street drives into 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.509
 yard driver often 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.090

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.380
 right before not jump yasha also possible 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.270
 get under the car before and it's very dangerous 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.599
 as dangerous to play right in 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.730
 the entrance of the driveway into the courtyard between the houses 

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:58.330
 very narrow to do so 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.240
 Casey can not be understood before leaving 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.640

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:09.670

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.210
 just so it is not necessary to run out in what 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.520
 location from the yard 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.980

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.890
 this time from the yard the car did not come out here 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:38.530

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:41.130

 places where such signs are installed 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.550
 We are mainly pedestrians 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.940

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.400

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.880

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.670
 It happens to be in their way and 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.209
 besides know that the car can go 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.060
 not only forward but also back and what is this 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.880
 white lanterns lit not touch 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.300
 machines are special signals that 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.450
 they warn us that the car is going to 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.460
 go or I reverse this 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.580
