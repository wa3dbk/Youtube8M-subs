00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.590
 such a system 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.590
 frankly speaking about withdrawing from production 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.099
 but it 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.099
 you speak 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.640
 November 4 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.999
 the faces of one of the telegrams 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:29.589
 number of orphans 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.589
 have looked 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.560
 that is, more than 20 years 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.560
 superior 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.560
 I find it difficult to catch the material you need 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.700
 impossible to explain very accurately was 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.700
 fired upon 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.830
 Yury Karmazin 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.620
 I would like to thank everyone 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.020
 who helped 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.450
 this season 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.450
 would say 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.940
 m 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.180
 f 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.440
 g 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.440
 other 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.950
 2 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.770
 in the present and future 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.770
 not 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.230
 in 2008 we had to 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.580
 it turned out that in the last 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.840
 decades as fast as it is now 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.300
 to be a little cool 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.300
 outwardly strongly in a circle 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.940
 thanks to all the rally participants 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.349
 in turn 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.139
 Now 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:21.309
 with this in june feel 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:21.919
 uncomfortable
