one of the key features we want to focus

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.850 
one of the key features we want to focus
on<00:01:03.600> right<00:01:03.629> here<00:01:04.110> with<00:01:04.290> these<00:01:04.409> boots<00:01:04.680> through

the<00:01:04.920> mid<00:01:05.100> phone<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.640> reinforced<00:01:06.360> x-cage

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the mid phone it just reinforced x-cage

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.929 
the mid phone it just reinforced x-cage
and<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.890> layering<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.490> wraps<00:01:08.760> around

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
and it's a layering that wraps around

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.289 
and it's a layering that wraps around
the<00:01:09.180> mid-foot<00:01:09.600> region<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:11.010> designed<00:01:11.909> to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
the mid-foot region it is designed to

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.260 
the mid-foot region it is designed to
create<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.200> tighter<00:01:13.500> snug<00:01:13.920> fit<00:01:14.729> around<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.119> mid

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
create a tighter snug fit around the mid

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.010 
create a tighter snug fit around the mid
foot<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:18.890> basically<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.790> spot<00:01:21.570> area

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
foot and basically it is this spot area

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.770 
foot and basically it is this spot area
that<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.310> cage<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.909> then<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.509> actual

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
that is the cage and then the actual

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.080 
that is the cage and then the actual
upper<00:01:25.140> design<00:01:25.439> which<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.890> see<00:01:25.920> here<00:01:26.100> it's

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
upper design which you can see here it's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.830 
upper design which you can see here it's
kind<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.570> lime<00:01:27.900> color<00:01:28.909> runs<00:01:29.909> through<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
kind of this lime color runs through the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.420 
kind of this lime color runs through the
middle<00:01:30.869> portion<00:01:32.540> so<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:33.689> divided<00:01:34.290> up<00:01:34.470> with

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
middle portion so it's divided up with

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.690 
middle portion so it's divided up with
this<00:01:35.670> X<00:01:36.000> cage<00:01:36.329> layering<00:01:36.689> system<00:01:37.700> that

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
this X cage layering system that

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.950 
this X cage layering system that
layering<00:01:38.939> system<00:01:39.240> goes<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.720> through<00:01:39.869> the

along<00:01:51.780> with<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.260> get<00:01:52.650> this<00:01:52.860> techfit<00:01:53.610> car

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
along with that you get this techfit car

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.120 
along with that you get this techfit car

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and it's been anatomically cut so it

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.860 
and it's been anatomically cut so it
fits<00:01:56.340> pretty<00:01:56.640> snug<00:01:57.030> around<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:57.420> ankle<00:01:57.720> line

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.350 
so there's going to be a little bit of a
stretch<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.520> as<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.820> put<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.000> around<00:02:09.149> your

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
stretch in as you put it around your

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.020 
stretch in as you put it around your
ankle<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.649> fits<00:02:10.860> very<00:02:10.950> snug<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.730> around

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
ankle and it fits very snug in around

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.480 
ankle and it fits very snug in around
really<00:02:12.750> quickly<00:02:12.950> first<00:02:13.950> thing<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.310> know<00:02:14.459> is

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
really quickly first thing to know is

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.580 
really quickly first thing to know is
I'm<00:02:14.940> going<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.120> bring<00:02:15.209> in<00:02:15.330> one<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.690> Nike

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
I'm going to bring in one of the Nike

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.530 
I'm going to bring in one of the Nike
maker<00:02:16.890> colors<00:02:17.340> very<00:02:18.000> very<00:02:18.270> different

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
maker colors very very different

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.020 
maker colors very very different
principles<00:02:19.110> with<00:02:19.260> both<00:02:19.440> boots<00:02:19.739> adidas<00:02:20.580> will

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
principles with both boots adidas will

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.820 
principles with both boots adidas will
just<00:02:21.209> focus<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.870> cut<00:02:22.110> around<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.410> ankle

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
just focus on a cut around the ankle

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.979 
just focus on a cut around the ankle
line<00:02:23.010> whereas<00:02:24.000> night<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.450> have<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.630> much

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
line whereas night you have a much

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.759 
line whereas night you have a much
higher<00:02:25.170> make<00:02:25.530> cook<00:02:25.739> are<00:02:26.300> very<00:02:27.300> very<00:02:27.510> different

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
higher make cook are very very different

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.640 
higher make cook are very very different
so<00:02:28.769> it's<00:02:29.010> not<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.959> serving<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.050> same<00:02:31.230> function

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
so it's not a serving the same function

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.140 
so it's not a serving the same function
as<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.890> nike<00:02:32.250> boots<00:02:32.459> some<00:02:32.790> people<00:02:33.030> have

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
as the nike boots some people have

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.280 
as the nike boots some people have
commented<00:02:33.390> on<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.780> fact<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.080> they<00:02:34.230> think

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
commented on the fact that they think

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.050 
commented on the fact that they think
that<00:02:34.590> maybe<00:02:35.100> these<00:02:35.310> are<00:02:35.550> going<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.850> same

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
that maybe these are going in the same

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.330 
that maybe these are going in the same
route<00:02:36.269> this<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:36.780> more<00:02:36.989> just<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.410> keep<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.739> snug

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
route this is more just to keep it snug

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.449 
route this is more just to keep it snug
in<00:02:38.610> around<00:02:38.850> your<00:02:39.000> ankle<00:02:39.330> line<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:41.010> tech<00:02:41.250> foot

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
a shortcut tongue and it actually

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.990 
a shortcut tongue and it actually
attaches<00:02:47.489> in<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.300> middle<00:02:48.540> portion<00:02:49.880> but<00:02:50.880> it

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
attaches in the middle portion but it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.820 
attaches in the middle portion but it
doesn't<00:02:51.330> go<00:02:51.540> entirely<00:02:52.050> all<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.470> way<00:02:52.590> down<00:02:52.800> to

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
the under foot portion is just like a

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.900 
the under foot portion is just like a
semi<00:02:55.560> cut<00:02:55.829> techfit<00:03:01.489> so<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:02.549> can<00:03:02.730> see<00:03:02.880> how

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
semi cut techfit so you can see how

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.370 
semi cut techfit so you can see how
that's<00:03:03.180> going<00:03:03.299> to<00:03:03.360> fit<00:03:03.540> around<00:03:03.690> your<00:03:03.930> ankle

that's going to fit around your ankle
it's<00:03:04.620> going<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.799> be<00:03:04.860> nice<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.040> snug<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.700> it

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
it's going to be nice and snug and it

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.530 
it's going to be nice and snug and it
keeps<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.720> tongue<00:03:07.140> in<00:03:07.350> place<00:03:08.150> as<00:03:09.150> you

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
keeps that tongue in place as you

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.640 
keeps that tongue in place as you
tighten<00:03:09.780> them<00:03:09.959> up<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.230> something<00:03:10.500> might

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
tighten them up and something might

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.590 
tighten them up and something might
notice<00:03:10.980> as<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.370> tighten<00:03:11.549> them<00:03:11.760> up<00:03:11.880> this

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
notice as you tighten them up this

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.930 
notice as you tighten them up this
region<00:03:13.140> does<00:03:13.350> pull<00:03:13.620> in<00:03:13.769> pretty<00:03:13.980> tight<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.489> it

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
region does pull in pretty tight and it

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.410 
region does pull in pretty tight and it
matches<00:03:15.450> up<00:03:15.720> with<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.079> technicolor<00:03:17.329> so<00:03:18.329> it

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
matches up with that technicolor so it

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.210 
matches up with that technicolor so it
gives<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.810> very<00:03:19.019> uniform<00:03:19.320> fit<00:03:19.829> around<00:03:19.950> the

gives you a very uniform fit around the

gives you a very uniform fit around the
ankle<00:03:20.549> line<00:03:24.140> inside<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.350> boot<00:03:25.500> there's<00:03:26.010> a

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
ankle line inside the boot there's a

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.930 
ankle line inside the boot there's a
pretty<00:03:26.790> big<00:03:27.829> padded<00:03:28.829> region<00:03:29.250> around<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.700> heel

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
pretty big padded region around the heel

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.420 
pretty big padded region around the heel
which<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.180> thought<00:03:30.329> was<00:03:30.480> interesting<00:03:31.430> it's

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
which I thought was interesting it's

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.220 
which I thought was interesting it's
almost<00:03:32.700> like<00:03:32.880> a<00:03:32.910> memory<00:03:33.360> foam<00:03:33.630> type<00:03:33.930> feel<00:03:34.400> and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
almost like a memory foam type feel and

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.590 
almost like a memory foam type feel and
that's<00:03:37.230> different<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.739> what<00:03:37.890> we've<00:03:38.070> seen<00:03:38.340> from

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
that's different to what we've seen from

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.789 
that's different to what we've seen from

around<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.470> ankle<00:03:43.799> area<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:45.019> it's<00:03:46.019> going<00:03:46.140> to

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
around the ankle area and it's going to

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.960
