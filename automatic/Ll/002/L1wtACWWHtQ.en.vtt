is<00:00:25.009> no<00:00:25.189> more<00:00:25.509> a<00:00:26.509> bad<00:00:27.020> shot<00:00:27.410> than<00:00:27.560> a<00:00:27.649> slight<00:00:27.950> a

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
is no more a bad shot than a slight a

hook atop a fat it's just a mechanical
error<00:00:32.509> what<00:00:33.170> happens<00:00:33.470> is<00:00:33.620> because<00:00:33.739> it's<00:00:34.100> such

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
error what happens is because it's such

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
right so quickly golfers can allow this

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.690

to become sort of felt as if it's some
sort<00:00:43.910> of<00:00:44.120> mental<00:00:44.980> problem<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.190> they<00:00:46.400> they

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
sort of mental problem and they they

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.570 
sort of mental problem and they they
sort<00:00:47.060> of<00:00:47.150> classes<00:00:47.660> getting<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:48.350> shanks<00:00:48.920> so

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
hit the odd shank the same as you might

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.600 
hit the odd shank the same as you might
hit<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.540> odd<00:01:26.750> slice<00:01:27.110> or<00:01:27.380> hook<00:01:27.710> but<00:01:28.250> that's<00:01:28.430> all

hit the odd slice or hook but that's all

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.820 
hit the odd slice or hook but that's all
it<00:01:28.820> should<00:01:29.060> be<00:01:29.330> so<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.229> first<00:01:30.470> thing<00:01:30.590> to

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
it should be so the first thing to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.539 
it should be so the first thing to
understand<00:01:31.340> with<00:01:31.580> a<00:01:31.610> shank<00:01:31.970> is<00:01:32.330> that<00:01:33.549> what

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
understand with a shank is that what

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.230 
understand with a shank is that what
whatever<00:01:35.540> your<00:01:35.869> swing<00:01:36.229> path<00:01:36.560> whether<00:01:36.920> it's

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
whatever your swing path whether it's

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.920 
whatever your swing path whether it's
inside<00:01:38.320> outside<00:01:39.320> or<00:01:39.979> square<00:01:40.549> what<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:41.570> know

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
inside outside or square what you know

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.469 
inside outside or square what you know

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
for sure is that at the moment of impact

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.460 
for sure is that at the moment of impact
the<00:01:45.140> club<00:01:45.560> is<00:01:45.860> further<00:01:46.670> away<00:01:47.060> from<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.659> than

silver part of the of the club back

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.450 
silver part of the of the club back
and<00:03:58.620> throw<00:03:59.310> so<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:01.620> will<00:04:01.800> make<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.010> horrible

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
and throw so it will make a horrible

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.940 
and throw so it will make a horrible
noise<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:02.880> won't<00:04:03.060> feel<00:04:03.300> very<00:04:03.600> nice<00:04:04.140> but<00:04:04.920> you

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
noise it won't feel very nice but you

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.970 
noise it won't feel very nice but you
can<00:04:05.250> see<00:04:05.490> from<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.240> splodge<00:04:06.600> there<00:04:07.020> that<00:04:07.890> I

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
can see from the splodge there that I

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.710 
can see from the splodge there that I
got<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.280> ball<00:04:08.460> right<00:04:08.910> on<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.270> end<00:04:09.390> of<00:04:09.570> the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
got the ball right on the end of the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.880 
got the ball right on the end of the
club<00:04:10.730> if<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:11.940> do<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:12.330> enough<00:04:12.690> times<00:04:13.050> you

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
club if you do this enough times you

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.420 
club if you do this enough times you
will<00:04:14.160> start<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.790> train<00:04:15.330> yourself<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:16.430> catch

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
will start to train yourself to catch

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.910 
will start to train yourself to catch
the<00:04:17.670> ball<00:04:17.820> in<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.030> right<00:04:18.299> place<00:04:18.709> this<00:04:19.709> will

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
the ball in the right place this will

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.890 
the ball in the right place this will
this<00:04:20.280> will<00:04:20.340> make<00:04:20.670> this<00:04:20.850> a<00:04:20.910> natural<00:04:21.630> motion

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
this will make this a natural motion

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.930 
this will make this a natural motion
doesn't<00:04:22.770> matter<00:04:22.890> whether<00:04:23.100> you're<00:04:23.250> inside<00:04:23.730> or

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
doesn't matter whether you're inside or

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.720 
doesn't matter whether you're inside or
outside<00:04:24.120> if<00:04:24.870> you<00:04:25.080> can<00:04:25.260> do<00:04:25.440> this<00:04:25.650> drill<00:04:25.920> it<00:04:26.550> will

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
outside if you can do this drill it will

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.010 
outside if you can do this drill it will
sort<00:04:26.970> things<00:04:27.180> out<00:04:27.510> another<00:04:28.440> good<00:04:28.650> one<00:04:28.860> is<00:04:29.070> to

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
sort things out another good one is to

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.110 
sort things out another good one is to
make<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.050> head<00:04:31.410> cover<00:04:33.920> just<00:04:34.920> behind<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.970> golf

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
make a head cover just behind the golf

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.590 
make a head cover just behind the golf
ball<00:04:37.130> so<00:04:38.130> that<00:04:38.370> you've<00:04:38.760> got<00:04:38.790> just<00:04:39.390> about

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
ball so that you've got just about

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.230 
ball so that you've got just about
enough<00:04:40.050> room<00:04:40.410> for<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.160> club<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.460> pass<00:04:41.880> but

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
enough room for the club to pass but

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.450 
enough room for the club to pass but
make<00:04:42.420> sure<00:04:42.450> it's<00:04:42.870> behind<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.650> ball<00:04:43.830> because

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
make sure it's behind the ball because

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.520 
make sure it's behind the ball because
the<00:04:44.730> idea<00:04:44.850> is<00:04:45.180> is<00:04:45.540> that<00:04:45.720> if<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:46.020> come<00:04:46.290> down

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
the idea is is that if you come down

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.580 
the idea is is that if you come down
from<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.220> outside<00:04:47.880> you'll<00:04:48.510> catch<00:04:48.720> it<00:04:48.780> or<00:04:49.200> if

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
from the outside you'll catch it or if

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.500 
from the outside you'll catch it or if
you<00:04:49.710> start<00:04:50.010> moving<00:04:50.250> out<00:04:50.610> too<00:04:50.910> early<00:04:50.970> your

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
you start moving out too early your

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.630 
you start moving out too early your
catch<00:04:51.780> it<00:04:51.990> but<00:04:52.380> you<00:04:52.500> should<00:04:52.530> be<00:04:52.800> able<00:04:52.980> to<00:04:53.430> hit

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
catch it but you should be able to hit

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.320 
catch it but you should be able to hit
nice<00:04:53.940> and<00:04:54.210> easily<00:04:54.360> back<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.560> throw<00:04:56.330> without

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
nice and easily back and throw without

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:08.010 
nice and easily back and throw without
getting<00:04:57.690> anywhere<00:04:58.050> near<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:59.040> head<00:04:59.220> cover

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020
