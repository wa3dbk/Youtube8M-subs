00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hello everyone, welcome back, play Victoria 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.589
 care victory but preparation 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.910
 today we will see how to play better with 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.000
 the arsenal 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.099
 let's start by looking at the rose I'm not at 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.490
 list sailing all because of the names 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.140
 here they are really complicated to read e 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.769
 also because as you see the form in 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.609
 particular is the best way and read 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.289
 and look good of image because a 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.810
 explaining it would be really complicated but 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.469
 let's look immediately at the form I believe it is 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.469
 the most important thing in this tactic 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.920
 then as you see it is a very 3 5 2 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.290
 very very personalized as you see 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.579
 in practice we have three defenders e 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.329
 these or left unchanged 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:53.000
 then in midfield I put two 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:57.059
 central midfielders is a right wing 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.149
 backward f you favorite hairpin and in 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.809
 in this case we give then how 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.880
 see the backward right wing becomes 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.450
 and complementary with the left wing ie 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.450
 and walcott because on the right and in 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.979
 practice we will always be low but we will have 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.750
 a more advanced midfielder while 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.420
 on the left we have one advanced it 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.040
 to the most backward midfielder 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.930
 as you see it all calculated for no 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.880
 leave holes in defense but we'll see 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.960
 better with observing the movements of the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.710
 players instead the attack we have one 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.290
 fixed point a reference point for 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.420
 the whole team that the g1 which 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.490
 will remain firm to receive all the balloons 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.420
 and does answers for his companions of 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.750
 team instead is 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.890
 as the playmaker we have ozil and how 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.619
 second striker than if necessary 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.189
 then it will become the real tip 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.140
 but we have podolski 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.560
 so now let's look at movements of the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.229
 so here we are players 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.299
 from defensive phase on defense 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.890
 in the cover phase 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.070
 we have sanya or the right wing 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.259
 backward who returns to the defense 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.130
 similarly one of the midfielders 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.380
 central defenses will go in place of 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.660
 made by the left-back 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.489
 this means that in the end the defense 3 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.709
 will become a five-man defense 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.630
 so even if apparently this 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.830
 looks like a very unbalanced form in 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.480
 attack 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.290
 as you can see I did it so that it is 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.660
 implicated and not discovered in any 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.580
 of the two phases in midfielders instead 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.890
 the other midfielder excused and 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.650
 will take a central position and 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.080
 done it will become a cd c this way 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.540
 we will also have full coverage of the 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.850
 midfield with the help of ozil che 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.030
 as we will see in the player performance e 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.209
 also hangs a little back in defense in 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.970
 construction phase of the maneuver instead 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.760
 we have almost all the players 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.040
 they move only dynamic make movement in 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.019
 so as to be unpredictable 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.170
 the only one who is as sighted remains still and 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.700
 jim and this I also explained alive 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.230
 because he must be the point of 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.530
 referring to the team and keeping high 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.870
 the line of attack and must remain 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.510
 rather static so you can 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.519
 receive balls and then make a bank 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.769
 for example or towards the left wing 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.290
 walcott who could then get on 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.780
 cross and cross towards the center or 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.220
 giving the ball to podolski who could 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.640
 try the blow from outside or 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.780
 go into the area and maybe do a 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:42.440
 2 in turn and then finalize e 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.870
 put in the door when the 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.540
 central midfielder who would be 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.569
 wisher eventually goes up front and becomes 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.170
 a playmaker at your sim who 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:57.550
 it widens a little and becomes almost one 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.110
 let's say a side midfielder here 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.239
 now let's look at the intensity of the 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.150
 attacking players in defense which is the 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.660
 following that is defending defenders 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.970
 a lot and they do very little forward 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.880
 often while midfielders e 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.650
 attackers doing both phases 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.500
 naturally favoring one though 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.930
 with the only exception of walcott who 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.750
 will tend to rise face is to stay in 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.240
 attack in order to exploit its 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.650
 it shines in the restarts and to return little 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.700
 in defense also because it would be useless 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.010
 given its poor ability in contrast 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.169
 slip and marking 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.130
 now we also look at tactics 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.890
 personalized 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.660
 here it is then dna then the speed of 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.790
 pass the construction of the maneuver 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.880
 it's slow 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:50.479
 we have as parameter 25 and the steps 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.090
 they are short and safe as you see this 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.770
 because why the evening players 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.720
 they are rather slow 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.419
 so I think it's the best thing 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.120
 also adopt a slow game stand that 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:08.030
 don't cause them to run also because in 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.550
 from this point of view they would be 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.970
 really scarce respect many 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.150
 other teams and we never manage to do 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.830
 in an advance with 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.960
 our midfielders and strikers in 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.630
 how too slow 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.180
 the only walcott exception that in fact in 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.690
 a somewhat particular position so 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:32.710
 to be able to exploit all his abilities 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:34.810
 physical crosses are normal but 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.830
 quite a few as you see the 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:42.700
 parameter and 36 because when you go cover 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.910
 the ball possession between the crosses is not the 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.530
 better tactic here we say however of 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.150
 occasionally even just to be the 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.460
 predictable and to exploit ours 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.270
 that is, tower can be worth it 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:59.080
 also try a cross the launch of the 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:02.320
 pull this 60 because when you try to 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.720
 create opportunities and risk 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.270
 maybe to take possession of the stars 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.660
 therefore the stress never to arrive in 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.250
 then in the opponents area pull for 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.260
 you can also unblock the situation 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.630
 try the tip from outside the board 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:20.380
 to try maybe with podolski which is a 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:24.280
 sniper of distance and when you think 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.960
 to fail in any other way a 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.300
 penetrate the defense meshes 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.580
 opposing 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.400
 on the other hand we have a pressing in defense 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:36.730
 medium ie a defensive line in the low 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.130
 and high as well as aggression ie the 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:42.100
 pressing that is not asphyxiating does not go 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.870
 to double often but you are not 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.740
 even to make containment and is not 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:51.160
 too passive team lights and 77 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.170
 how do you see this because why? 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.680
 when under construction 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.710
 maneuver 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.430
 and we may find ourselves in trouble because 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:03.310
 maybe the opponent is pressing 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.750
 really hard really asphyxiating proceeds 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.860
 much with doubling the defensive line 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.360
 high with high team width 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.769
 we could also try to change the game 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.360
 to do 

00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:17.089
 long and high pass towards the other 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.249
 band so you find someone who 

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:21.110
 inevitably things will be free and that 

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:25.639
 maybe he can get to the bottom and then 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:28.579
 cross exploiting with physical skills 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:32.479
 and the skill in the air game dg or even 

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:35.329
 polonsky and this is today's tactic 

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:38.419
 guys I hope you can come in handy 

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:40.699
 for your games at site 14 if 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.110
 maybe she managed to win me 

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:43.699
 definitely pleasure 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.099
 and if you too, if you please leave me a 

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:47.569
 like and subscribe to the channel I vi 

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:50.499

 Hi everyone
