you guys out there who are wondering how
the<00:00:09.420> different<00:00:09.809> factions<00:00:10.200> weapons<00:00:10.650> perform

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
the different factions weapons perform

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.879 
the different factions weapons perform
who<00:00:11.700> looks<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.030> coolest<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.630> overall<00:00:13.469> who

you would just enjoy play as starting
off<00:00:17.310> with<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> Terran<00:00:17.820> Republic's<00:00:18.240> default

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
off with the Terran Republic's default

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.510 
off with the Terran Republic's default
weapon<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.230> light<00:00:19.380> assault<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.920> track<00:00:20.220> 5

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
weapon for the light assault the track 5

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.359 
weapon for the light assault the track 5
this<00:00:21.510> thing<00:00:21.750> takes<00:00:22.230> seven<00:00:22.680> shots<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.100> take<00:00:23.279> out

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
this thing takes seven shots to take out

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.040 
this thing takes seven shots to take out
someone<00:00:23.670> at<00:00:23.760> close<00:00:23.970> when<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.630> compare<00:00:24.930> that

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
someone at close when you compare that

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.300 
someone at close when you compare that
to<00:00:25.109> other<00:00:25.320> weapon<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> game<00:00:25.980> it's

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
to other weapon to the game it's

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.820 
to other weapon to the game it's
actually<00:00:26.609> slightly<00:00:26.970> higher<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.900> by<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.800> I

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
actually slightly higher and by that I

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.060 
actually slightly higher and by that I
mean<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.519> takes<00:00:29.779> one<00:00:30.779> or<00:00:30.929> two<00:00:31.080> more<00:00:31.529> shots<00:00:31.800> to

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
mean it takes one or two more shots to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.430 
mean it takes one or two more shots to
get<00:00:32.219> your<00:00:32.340> target<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.759> average<00:00:33.149> then<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
get your target on average then the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.950 
get your target on average then the
other<00:00:34.559> factions<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.540> not<00:00:36.719> going

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
other factions and so it's not going

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.049 
other factions and so it's not going
down<00:00:37.020> damage<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.190> van<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.550> or<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> new

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
down damage the van you or the new

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.540 
down damage the van you or the new
conglomerate<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.530> does<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> pretty

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
conglomerate but it does have a pretty

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.310 
conglomerate but it does have a pretty
high<00:00:41.790> rate<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.030> fire<00:00:42.270> higher<00:00:42.750> than<00:00:43.020> all<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
high rate of fire higher than all the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.350 
high rate of fire higher than all the
other<00:00:43.440> factions<00:00:43.890> out<00:00:44.040> there<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:45.210> also

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
other factions out there and it also

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.209 
other factions out there and it also
doesn't<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:45.960> very<00:00:46.170> much<00:00:46.260> cake<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.039> if<00:00:47.100> you're

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
doesn't have very much cake so if you're

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.860 
doesn't have very much cake so if you're
one<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.430> those<00:00:47.489> guys<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.940> likes<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.570> get

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
one of those guys that likes to just get

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.420 
one of those guys that likes to just get
a<00:00:48.899> lot<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.170> shots<00:00:49.320> downrange<00:00:49.770> you're<00:00:50.250> maybe

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
a lot of shots downrange you're maybe

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.040 
a lot of shots downrange you're maybe
not<00:00:50.610> too<00:00:50.760> accurate<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.390> high<00:00:51.719> recoil

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
not too accurate with high recoil

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.139 
not too accurate with high recoil
weapons<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:53.160> tamron<00:00:53.520> public<00:00:53.760> would<00:00:54.000> be<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
weapons the tamron public would be a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.299 
weapons the tamron public would be a
good<00:00:54.300> choice<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.750> mind<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.160> is

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
good choice for you mind you that is

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.700 
good choice for you mind you that is
only<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.760> light<00:00:56.940> assaults<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.930> how<00:00:58.649> does

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
only for the light assaults so how does

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.430 
only for the light assaults so how does
a<00:00:58.859> medics<00:00:59.219> default<00:00:59.579> weapon<00:00:59.730> appear<00:01:00.180> well<00:01:00.840> it

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
a medics default weapon appear well it

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.900 
a medics default weapon appear well it
still<00:01:01.739> takes<00:01:01.920> seven<00:01:02.190> shots<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.520> kill<00:01:02.609> someone

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
still takes seven shots to kill someone

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.179 
still takes seven shots to kill someone
up<00:01:03.000> close<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> only<00:01:04.320> other<00:01:04.589> factors<00:01:05.010> are

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
up close so the only other factors are

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.300 
up close so the only other factors are
our<00:01:05.460> rate<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.090> fire<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.479> kick<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.920> how<00:01:08.070> does<00:01:08.130> it

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
our rate of fire and kick so how does it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.700 
our rate of fire and kick so how does it
compare<00:01:08.400> well<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.750> both<00:01:09.930> categories<00:01:10.170> it

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
compare well in both categories it

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.410 
compare well in both categories it
actually<00:01:11.070> does<00:01:11.310> slightly<00:01:11.549> better<00:01:11.790> there's

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
actually does slightly better there's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.060 
actually does slightly better there's
not<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.750> much<00:01:12.900> kick<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.590> light<00:01:13.740> assaults

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
not as much kick as the light assaults

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.670 
not as much kick as the light assaults
and<00:01:14.689> the<00:01:15.689> rate<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.960> fire<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.259> actually

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and the rate of fire is actually

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.320 
and the rate of fire is actually
slightly<00:01:16.890> higher<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.880> what<00:01:18.030> you're<00:01:18.119> looking

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
slightly higher so what you're looking

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.969 
slightly higher so what you're looking
at<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.689> gun<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> little<00:01:19.890> more

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
at is a gun that is a little more

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.190 
at is a gun that is a little more
effective<00:01:20.369> at<00:01:20.520> long<00:01:20.670> range<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.750> little<00:01:22.110> bit

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
effective at long range and a little bit

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.929 
effective at long range and a little bit
more<00:01:22.350> effective<00:01:22.710> at<00:01:22.799> close<00:01:22.979> range<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.759> you're

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
more effective at close range if you're

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.120 
more effective at close range if you're
wondering<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.390> they<00:01:24.509> did<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.950> light

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
wondering what they did this the light

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.590 
wondering what they did this the light
assaults<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.759> anyone<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> map<00:01:27.450> of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
assaults can get anyone on the map of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.149 
assaults can get anyone on the map of
their<00:01:27.659> jetpack<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.680> were<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.890> give<00:01:29.009> them

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
their jetpack if you were to give them

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.399 
their jetpack if you were to give them
the<00:01:29.280> best<00:01:29.460> weapon<00:01:29.820> out<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.689> all<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> classes

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the best weapon out of all the classes

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.380 
the best weapon out of all the classes
then<00:01:31.799> there<00:01:32.189> would<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.700> no<00:01:32.880> point<00:01:33.270> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
then there would really be no point to

there the freedom fighters of planetside
they're<00:02:53.750> blue<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:54.890> they<00:02:55.040> must<00:02:55.220> be<00:02:55.280> pretty

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
they're blue so they must be pretty

they're blue so they must be pretty
appealing<00:02:55.700> right<00:02:55.880> well<00:02:56.720> their<00:02:57.500> guns<00:02:57.709> are

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
trade-off for that is that their bullets

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.790 
trade-off for that is that their bullets
do<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.790> little<00:03:04.970> bit<00:03:05.090> higher<00:03:05.209> damage<00:03:05.450> on<00:03:06.440> average

close<00:03:09.170> in<00:03:09.470> seven<00:03:09.830> afar<00:03:10.100> which<00:03:10.580> would<00:03:11.000> make

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
close in seven afar which would make

close in seven afar which would make
these<00:03:11.360> good<00:03:11.540> at<00:03:11.690> range<00:03:11.930> but<00:03:12.410> they<00:03:12.739> do<00:03:12.800> have<00:03:13.010> a

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
these good at range but they do have a

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
little bit higher kick so you're gonna

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.270 
little bit higher kick so you're gonna
have<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.269> burst<00:03:14.540> fire<00:03:14.780> pretty<00:03:15.170> regularly<00:03:15.950> and
