00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
oil down the side and slide still thin

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.890 
oil down the side and slide still thin
line<00:02:24.660> along<00:02:24.890> each<00:02:25.890> side<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.540> can<00:02:27.540> run<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> little

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
line along each side I can run a little

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.229 
line along each side I can run a little
bit<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.260> top<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.970> make<00:02:29.970> sure<00:02:30.000> you

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
bit on the top and make sure you

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.140 
bit on the top and make sure you
definitely<00:02:30.599> get<00:02:30.660> way<00:02:30.840> over<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.940> barrel<00:02:32.940> goes

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
definitely get way over the barrel goes

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.410 
definitely get way over the barrel goes
through<00:02:33.510> right<00:02:33.989> there<00:02:34.849> so<00:02:35.849> then<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> slide

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
through right there so then the slide

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.490 
through right there so then the slide
punch<00:02:36.810> set<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.319> upside<00:02:37.620> down<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.780> then<00:02:40.319> for

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
punch set that upside down and then for

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.650 
punch set that upside down and then for
your<00:02:40.560> gun<00:02:41.090> you're<00:02:42.090> going<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.269> put<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.450> little

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
your gun you're going to put a little

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.350 
your gun you're going to put a little
bit<00:02:42.900> on<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.769> outside<00:02:44.069> of<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.190> barrel<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:45.209> it

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
bit on the outside of the barrel so it

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.390 
bit on the outside of the barrel so it
gets<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.870> spring<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:46.860> some<00:02:47.069> gets<00:02:47.250> on<00:02:47.340> the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
gets the spring so some gets on the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.990 
gets the spring so some gets on the
spring<00:02:47.670> you're<00:02:48.599> going<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.810> run<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.260> along<00:02:49.349> just

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
spring you're going to run it along just

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.470 
spring you're going to run it along just
a<00:02:51.000> little<00:02:51.209> bit<00:02:51.390> or<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:53.209> slide<00:02:54.209> run<00:02:54.480> zone

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
a little bit or the slide run zone

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.920 
a little bit or the slide run zone
little<00:02:57.019> it<00:02:57.140> tracks<00:02:57.470> they're<00:02:58.720> going<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.810> put

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
little it tracks they're going to put

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.750 
little it tracks they're going to put
some<00:02:59.959> back<00:03:00.950> towards<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.340> hammer<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:04.489> that

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
some back towards the hammer so that

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.490 
some back towards the hammer so that
doesn't<00:03:05.239> so<00:03:05.750> that<00:03:05.780> slides<00:03:06.140> really<00:03:06.319> easily<00:03:06.650> a

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
doesn't so that slides really easily a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.229 
doesn't so that slides really easily a
pretty<00:03:09.500> much<00:03:09.590> thumb<00:03:09.860> make<00:03:10.700> sure<00:03:10.849> everything

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
pretty much thumb make sure everything

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.150 
pretty much thumb make sure everything
make<00:03:12.019> sure<00:03:12.049> that's<00:03:12.319> why<00:03:12.500> it's<00:03:12.650> nice<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:12.920> loose

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.550 

so<00:03:16.160> once<00:03:16.310> you're<00:03:16.400> done<00:03:16.489> with<00:03:16.549> that<00:03:17.560> you're

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
so once you're done with that you're

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.220 
so once you're done with that you're
going<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:18.709> take<00:03:18.830> your<00:03:18.860> spring<00:03:19.959> since<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:21.080> just

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
going to take your spring since you just

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.440 
going to take your spring since you just
put<00:03:21.379> oil<00:03:21.560> on<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.860> barrel<00:03:22.190> it's<00:03:23.090> going<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.329> get

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
put oil on the barrel it's going to get

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.809 
put oil on the barrel it's going to get
a<00:03:23.480> wheel<00:03:23.690> on<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:23.900> so<00:03:25.450> it<00:03:26.450> works<00:03:26.659> fine<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:28.629> then

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
a wheel on it so it works fine and then

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.460 
a wheel on it so it works fine and then
where<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:32.720> barrel<00:03:33.019> goes<00:03:33.140> through<00:03:33.349> you're

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
where the barrel goes through you're

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.039 
where the barrel goes through you're
going<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.650> put<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:33.829> spring<00:03:34.129> there<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:35.209> just

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
going to put the spring there and just

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.930 
going to put the spring there and just
push<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.440> slide<00:03:36.680> backwards<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.700> the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
push the slide backwards so that the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.569 
push the slide backwards so that the
barrel<00:03:41.209> goes<00:03:41.359> through<00:03:41.629> like<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:42.310> now<00:03:43.310> then

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
barrel goes through like that now then

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.210 
barrel goes through like that now then
you<00:03:43.700> got<00:03:43.819> to<00:03:43.849> lift<00:03:44.030> up<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.269> slide<00:03:44.859> to<00:03:45.859> line<00:03:46.010> up

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
you got to lift up the slide to line up

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.280 
you got to lift up the slide to line up
the<00:03:46.549> hole<00:03:47.060> where<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.269> screw<00:03:47.510> goes<00:03:47.629> in<00:03:47.840> you

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
the hole where the screw goes in you

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.110 
the hole where the screw goes in you
just<00:03:48.470> slide<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:48.799> back<00:03:48.890> forth<00:03:49.250> that<00:03:49.879> little

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
just slide it back forth that little

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.690 
just slide it back forth that little
piece<00:03:50.299> right<00:03:50.390> there<00:03:50.510> slots<00:03:50.870> with<00:03:51.109> this<00:03:51.260> so

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
piece right there slots with this so

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.949 
piece right there slots with this so
it's<00:03:52.700> not<00:03:52.790> going<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:53.000> go<00:03:53.120> anywhere<00:03:53.359> they<00:03:53.840> just

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
it's not going to go anywhere they just

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.530 
it's not going to go anywhere they just
got<00:03:54.109> to<00:03:54.200> hold<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.440> up<00:03:54.530> in<00:03:54.560> line<00:03:54.829> you<00:03:54.950> know<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.540> can

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
got to hold it up in line you know I can

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.580 
got to hold it up in line you know I can
see<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.810> but<00:03:56.870> it's<00:03:57.140> right<00:03:57.319> there<00:03:59.379> and<00:04:00.379> take

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
see that but it's right there and take

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.200 
see that but it's right there and take
your<00:04:00.620> screw

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.640 

we<00:04:06.780> can<00:04:07.020> get<00:04:07.110> it<00:04:07.230> back<00:04:07.320> in

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:38.080 

sometimes<00:04:13.549> it's<00:04:13.790> hard<00:04:13.970> to<00:04:14.000> put<00:04:14.180> back<00:04:14.299> in

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.959 

jail<00:04:38.750> understanding<00:04:39.530> like<00:04:39.740> that

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:43.969 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:45.850 

the<00:04:44.569> screwdrivers<00:04:45.110> a<00:04:45.169> little<00:04:45.349> big<00:04:45.529> for<00:04:45.559> the

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
the screwdrivers a little big for the

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.920 
the screwdrivers a little big for the
screw<00:04:46.189> but<00:04:46.549> it<00:04:46.699> works

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.050 

don't<00:04:53.740> over<00:04:53.919> tighten<00:04:54.070> it<00:04:54.250> just<00:04:54.430> putting<00:04:54.759> in<00:04:54.850> 20

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
don't over tighten it just putting in 20

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.330 
don't over tighten it just putting in 20
stops<00:04:55.419> and<00:04:55.720> just<00:04:56.470> check<00:04:56.800> this<00:04:56.889> every<00:04:57.039> once<00:04:57.280> in

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
stops and just check this every once in

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.529 
stops and just check this every once in
a<00:04:57.400> while<00:04:57.520> visa<00:04:57.759> might<00:04:57.940> come<00:04:58.090> loose<00:04:58.300> because

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
a while visa might come loose because

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.480 
a while visa might come loose because
that's<00:04:58.870> constantly<00:04:59.350> blowing<00:04:59.830> back<00:05:00.160> and<00:05:00.400> then

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
that's constantly blowing back and then

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.379 
that's constantly blowing back and then
my<00:05:00.630> it<00:05:01.630> does<00:05:01.930> come<00:05:02.139> loose<00:05:02.350> so<00:05:03.190> then<00:05:03.789> once<00:05:04.270> you

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
my it does come loose so then once you

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:05.879 
my it does come loose so then once you
get<00:05:04.479> that<00:05:04.600> on<00:05:04.660> you're<00:05:05.500> going<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.680> hold<00:05:05.800> down

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
get that on you're going to hold down

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.980 
get that on you're going to hold down
your<00:05:06.009> slide<00:05:06.970> catch<00:05:07.630> and<00:05:09.330> move<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.479> slide<00:05:10.750> back

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
your slide catch and move the slide back

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.430 
your slide catch and move the slide back
and<00:05:11.020> forth<00:05:11.229> and<00:05:11.970> that's<00:05:12.970> how<00:05:13.120> you<00:05:13.180> all<00:05:13.509> and
