00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.900
 in this video we will analyze a doubt a 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.850
 doubt that usually 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:14.170
 have many people 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:17.920
 how much is less 2 squared and how much 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.380
 it's minus 2 squared 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.970
 note that in this above the 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.849
 square only affects 2 not at least 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.529
 as it does not affect at least we do 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:35.290
 first square and the least we copy it 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.830
 unless you look at how many 2 blocks away 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.800
 square 2 by 2 which is 4 that's less 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.920
 4 however here this the square and 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.790
 that affects at least then it would be less 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:54.809
 two for minus two minus minus 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.809
 less for less plus 2 for 2 4 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.429
 another way of looking at this is how is it 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.879
 negative number raised to an exponent 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:05.280
 for more results and 2 squared 3 4 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.259
 is another way of doing it is the same and 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.780
 you have to take this into account 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:14.340
 example if it puts us minus 3 squared 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.930
 minus 1 this is square only affects the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.880
 3 in less we copy it 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:26.960
 3 squared is 9 minus one minus 91 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.380
 minus 10 but minus 3 squared 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.630
 minus 1 now the box affects at least 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.479
 exponent pair negative number is 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.760
 positive 3 squared 9 minus one that 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:44.210
 it's 8 I hope that with this video it has been 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:47.270
 clarified well this at least with the 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.119
 square like this or in the parentheses because 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.340
 this is one of the doubts that many 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.500
 people when they have to perform a 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.780
 problem many students because always 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.780
 see that they do not understand this well
