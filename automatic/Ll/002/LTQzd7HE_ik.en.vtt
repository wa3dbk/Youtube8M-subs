level<00:02:59.769> and<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:01.060> again<00:03:01.840> have<00:03:02.140> nothing<00:03:02.530> up<00:03:02.680> here

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
level and I again have nothing up here

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.400 
level and I again have nothing up here

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
because the levels these two levels are

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:54.850 
because the levels these two levels are
quite<00:03:05.799> small<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:35.280> then<00:03:36.280> she<00:03:36.580> has<00:03:36.730> her<00:03:36.760> teeth
