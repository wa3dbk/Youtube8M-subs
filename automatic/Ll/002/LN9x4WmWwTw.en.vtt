 go you go to show you some 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.650
 small so that at first we open 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:31.260
 Younger run with country 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:36.550
 then we will open my old steam with 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:39.690
 ping have nine that in summary his little goal 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.270
 otherwise it will be perfect chance marivaux 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:47.290
 cheating we will do the max y quote 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.520
 also so we will take selected these 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:56.590
 stuff there the little body and where you go 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:00.000
 we were the smallest pixel lowest 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.160
 it was going to take all this done copy 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.780
 in shape it makes you stick here we have 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.640
 the head of free young salmon stintz 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.080
 emitted automatically great scholar 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.480
 impatience the second buyers a 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.680
 size and who are doing save 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.540
 here we have 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.120
 of friedel on my old style but by 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.799
 example if we close it all we're on 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.900
 our attitude let's put on the site who 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.629
 you tie white like that because that 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.459
 went and swap white what I 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.629
 can you show to do on yourself that 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.000
 you have this law 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.489
 I do not think about that I'm transforming you 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.159
 all this in transparent rsa is going to be a 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.170
 little bit long when we put transparencies 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.599
 there because it puts in the color white 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.150
 instead of transparency what we want 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.379
 it's right there on the stream you can 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:03:02.620
 close that you have to open it with guy 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:03:03.730
 morgan rest we must admit it we 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.859
 could do it alone if you had 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.060
 never thought about tonight and if you can 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.060
 put you in the description 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:22.629

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:26.500
 tension games and like unworthy photoshop 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:29.949
 but only a little less specialized 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.790
 so free there gets checked then the 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:35.919
 wheel for my team and for fact or 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.260
 if this is not done a little 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:42.030
 selection you make continuous selection 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:46.259
 I will take all that shines 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.729
 not like that with no control chif 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:50.530

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:56.560
 click on all the sections are 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:04:05.699
 white in fact we do not want here I 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:07.810
 guess had then we see in you of 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:10.870
 numbers between the tips are 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.150
 bullish white then you make a 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.530
 right click on his voice was selected 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:20.849
 all the selection you make layer 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:25.400
 then you go on transparency and 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:27.139
 color green alpha safrana located 1 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.750
 perceived or validated it will transform 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:34.310
 all the color they are threatening this 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:37.820
 color-layer transparency colors 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.410
 ralph validated here is the going 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.300
