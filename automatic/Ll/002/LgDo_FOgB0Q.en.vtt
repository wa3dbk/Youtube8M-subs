00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 very good pink well today I bring you a 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.029
 somewhat different video 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.550
 I still think a retro video not you 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.660
 worry, I have a top that I did a lot 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.370
 time I wanted to do what I have in the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.920
 head but good today I came for that 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.509
 today I came to tell you about a new 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.920
 acquisition with which I have made for 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.330
 specifically for my collection of 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.990
 portable but not without more 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.490
 collection but for the desire to play 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.289
 a little bit because of the madness that has given me 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.750
 Well the fact is that as many already 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.490
 you will know since it came out more or less 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.320
 I have the cndh since that I have always been 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.000
 more from the sony laptop previously 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.210
 they had not had any nintendo ds 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.980
 Now I have one but I found it 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.739
 Austin but the case that I expose more 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.820
 tension and for consoles in general in 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.820
 the current earnings 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.629
 and when it showed off a bit that 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.699
 seen as sad the truth is that it has 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.089
 delighted much more by ps vita but 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.129
 watching the game catalog so good and 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.900
 powerful that was having 3ds and the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.729
 I tried and I really liked the 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.320
 sad effect as you see how they get 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.479
 very shopping to play I liked it very much 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.920
 this console because that's precisely why 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.020
 I caught the 3ds 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.960
 morzine evil revelations or castlevania 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.280
 things like that called me a lot 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.140
 but he always had the thorn in his head 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.960
 of people having a pepsi life because 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.270
 they are very powerful super comfortable 500 sticks 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.289
 already manufactured very important and has 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.289
 had to buy ice cream 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.560
 the sliding button pro that is called 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.330
 in Spanish and well then another day I 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.110
 I decided I found a pretty offer 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.960
 pretty good and if I have done with a 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.940
 little person I'm going to teach well 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.590
 here you have to forgive me I move a 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.119
 little the video but is that here I do not have 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.670
 nothing with which to hold it I do not have 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.280
 no kind of my nothing so that's what 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.130
 there is and I feel good as you see me 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.690
 come with the script and 13 a game of 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.520
 third person action pretty 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.280
 Entertaining the truth is something that 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.259
 they like that they do not have no manual 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.560
 it's because you do not wear it it's just 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.760
 because it seems that they do not bring manual 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.800
 lately the games something that I already 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.420
 they like what they bring digital they come what 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.220
 you can check the console but 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.100
 I have always liked the fact of having 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.770
 the manuals with their with their little things their 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.440
 story of all those good things let's go 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.440
 to what the console is also has 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.360
 come with a sleeve and the winner this 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.720
 I got out for a hundred euros all the 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.860
 console with the game in the case this is not 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.900
 It is not bad considering that it is 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.540
 the model 3g or if it is I can get him 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.409
 a sim card 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.540
 here to have three genres that is to 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.340
 have clear internet the console 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.140
 parla for you to see the truth is that no 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.450
 I did not do anything wrong taking into account 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.310
 which is the 3g model and is also in 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.109
 perfect conditions does not have any 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.959
 scratch also has a protector that has 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.430
 taken from the first day and it works 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.170
 perfectly of state throwing some to 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.790
 from the truth they are great has 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.319
 delighted the console I thought I was going to 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.400
 be more uncomfortable because the times 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.980
 that you have tried in a store 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.650
 he appreciated that the sticks are very close 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.099
 that the buttons or something like that 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.049
 but the truth is that it has been very not me 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.519
 He liked it a lot and here he will be 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.239
 much more uncomfortable it is true that here 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:24.000
 there is little room to grab it without 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.560
 touch the touch without wanting but nothing 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.230
 truth is that it's something you're used to 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.750
 little also sell some cases with 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.090
 those who can grab everything better and 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.040
 well as you see I do not have much now 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.620
 same all I have are we see this 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.909
 pawns already with the console are some games 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.560
 or the numbers and pretty things 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.710
 Entertaining the truth and with trophy for 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.320
 get rid of the ride more 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.520
 I could miss my playstation goal 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.630
 since I have bought the story 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.970
 Well, if I could not miss here, 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.590
 console and some more like from farms and 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.820
 but, well, I'm going to put this 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.210
 just so you can see with a lot of 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.210
 the console 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.170
 right now I have it with the brightness I think 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.330
 that practically to the minimum 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.980
 of this screen the best of this 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.920
 console is the screen precisely 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:15.530
 because it's a wave the colors look 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:17.900
 really well the phone we have it almost 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.480
 to the minimum really does not have much 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.799
 shine appears with an lcd screen 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.570
 as the second model that are 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.960
 announcing now but anyway as I say to 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.680
 despite not having so much 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.110
 both brightness and that of the wave of 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.930
 latest version x that the colors look 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.280
 cool 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.500
 it really looks like a note if it's what 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.150
 they wanted to get the touch you give 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.889
 teconsa seeks you can see differences 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:49.360
 although clearly out 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:52.150
 surely but not so much but good 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.550
 that very happy with the purchase and 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.130
 then teach later some 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.230
 another something other than more than you 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.420
 I wanted to take a first look at the 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.010
 console well that was all for now 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.630
 from as always you can find me 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.890
 the hundreds you want to put down 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.140
 or by sending an email to ask 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.270
 breathe back mail.com later 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.370
 surely make a comparison video 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.470
 three times mind-specific 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.300
 I think that many of us can help 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.620
 interest so if you would like too 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.140
 see that put it down there though 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.790
 play in silly and good not you 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.190
 worry because soon I will have another 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.870
 retro video that I'm preparing that is 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.160
 everything for now as I said see you 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.160
 in the next video chao 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.150
 Y
