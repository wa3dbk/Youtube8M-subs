the brows grow and then just follow a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.789

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
want a little bit of more precision like

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.960 
want a little bit of more precision like
we<00:02:14.760> can<00:02:14.940> use<00:02:15.920> this<00:02:16.920> stuff<00:02:17.130> called<00:02:17.400> browsing

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
we can use this stuff called browsing

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.170 
we can use this stuff called browsing
zits<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.269> wax<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.720> powder<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.560> just<00:02:19.739> kind<00:02:20.010> of

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
zits a wax and powder and I just kind of

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.320 
zits a wax and powder and I just kind of
there's<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.239> bit<00:02:21.480> more<00:02:21.660> precision<00:02:22.370> 22<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:24.120> brow

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
there's a bit more precision 22 the brow

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.990 
there's a bit more precision 22 the brow
if<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:25.080> want<00:02:25.319> like<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.650> can<00:02:25.860> show<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.849> like

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
if you want like I can show you I like

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.020 
if you want like I can show you I like
to<00:02:27.150> do<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.870> wax<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.470> powder<00:02:28.709> together<00:02:29.069> so

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
to do the wax and the powder together so

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.370 
to do the wax and the powder together so
obviously<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.660> would<00:02:30.810> work<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:31.110> little

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
obviously this would work a little

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.400 
obviously this would work a little
better<00:02:31.590> with<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.090> bigger<00:02:33.090> angle<00:02:33.390> brush<00:02:33.810> but<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
better with a bigger angle brush but the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.160 
better with a bigger angle brush but the
kit<00:02:34.650> comes<00:02:35.370> with<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.880> smaller<00:02:36.330> one<00:02:36.720> why<00:02:36.930> not

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
kit comes with the smaller one why not

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.820 
kit comes with the smaller one why not
use<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.519> it's<00:02:38.519> good<00:02:38.730> for<00:02:38.760> traveling<00:02:39.830> let's

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
use it it's good for traveling let's

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.130
