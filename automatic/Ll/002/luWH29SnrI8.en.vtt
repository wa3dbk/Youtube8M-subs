00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.019
 how about mx high-end friends in this 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.929
 I will show you an accessory 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:14.840
 which will surely be of interest to you 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:19.040
 especially if you are a person who is 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:23.210
 that already acquired a galaxy s 4 or that is 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.630
 indecisive between the galaxy s 4 and the is 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:32.620
 say john and the reason for indecision 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:36.220
 it's because the age says it has a 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.220
 metal body 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:44.830
 well, we have the solution 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:47.850
 if you like the galaxy s 4 more but 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:51.130
 Would you also like to have 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.010
 a metal cover 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.010
 good the solutions are here 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.420
 we present these that are the covers 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.800
 back 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.610
 there 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.610
 we can see them 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.680
 they look very good are aluminum and we're going 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.610
 to see how they look 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:23.540
 This is polycarbonate plastic as it is 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:29.010
 everyone knows is characteristic of samsung 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.640
 we put this in that simple way 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.640
 there is 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:44.780
 surely with this you can help 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:50.799
 decide on the s4 or the human 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.799
 it's covered let's clean it a little 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.880
 you can see there in its finish 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.880
 of aluminum 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.539
 there you can appreciate it well 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.500
 the truth is that it looks very very very very 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.500
 all right 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.420
 helps the s4 feel more solid 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.420
 in the hand 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.300
 it does not add weight but if it feels more 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.210
 solid 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.200
 the truth is that it is a very very good 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:39.010
 aspect and it's also in the other color 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.010
 which is aluminum completely 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.900
 but also 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.270
 they are there 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.690
 it looks 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:06.530
 especially if you are thinking or you already have 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.580
 the galaxy s 4 in white then 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.580
 this aluminum color 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.260
 they look very good on the bottom of the 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.410
 video I'll leave the links for 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.410
 what
