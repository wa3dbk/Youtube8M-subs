to<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.440> depth<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:03.170> so<00:01:04.170> he<00:01:04.379> started<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.890> dig

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to this depth and so he started to dig

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.050 
to this depth and so he started to dig
that's<00:01:05.489> where<00:01:05.729> he's<00:01:05.939> at<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.390> corner

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:25.590
