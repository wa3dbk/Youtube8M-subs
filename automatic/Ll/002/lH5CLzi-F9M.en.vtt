00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
a diesel engine and even then it will

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.620 
a diesel engine and even then it will

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
only be in the four by fours but even so

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.140 
only be in the four by fours but even so
I<00:04:58.870> quite<00:04:59.110> like<00:04:59.410> infinity<00:04:59.979> it's<00:05:00.190> like<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.400> cooler

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
I quite like infinity it's like a cooler

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
sporty Alexis and for that I think there

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.230 
sporty Alexis and for that I think there
is<00:05:04.240> a<00:05:04.660> place<00:05:04.990> between<00:05:05.410> H<00:05:05.860> and<00:05:06.220> Jay<00:05:06.550> that<00:05:06.970> suits

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
is a place between H and Jay that suits

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.740 
is a place between H and Jay that suits
