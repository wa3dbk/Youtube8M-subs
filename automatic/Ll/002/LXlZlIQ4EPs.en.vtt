 Park event which was held between july 4th and 6th at Omotesando Hills.

 that place so ill show that footage too!

00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:39.422

 expensive brands in japan so im going to try them out later!

thats the signature of the brand model Haruka Ayase. so cool.

00:00:54.478 --> 00:01:02.638
this is a chart of anti oxidant level and it 
 shows even from 20's, the level starts dropping.

00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:08.624
and this shows the amount of skin change and 
 in 30's and 40's, skin changes drastically.

00:01:09.816 --> 00:01:16.519
it means its important to start taking good care of your skin from 20's.

00:01:18.273 --> 00:01:22.649
this is a Pitera Family tree and in the 
 middle, there is a facial treatment essence.

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:37.020
and you can add those brightening line, the aging care line, 
 or LXP series which is a more luxurious line.

00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:42.360

 SK2. and you can see the pix of their bare face.

 power. lets convert it to the age.
