00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.049
 hi nice that you again look at one 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.670
 video of fun recipes 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.440
 today i'm gonna show you how 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.379
 super crispy for a few minutes 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.390
 potato chip flavor from the microwave 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.700
 what do you need a microwave for this 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.600
 of course a mandolin 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.270
 but you can also possibly have one 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.350
 use cheese slicer and firm cooking 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.869
 potato 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.420
 a little sea salt and a large plate with 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.369
 a piece of baking paper so very important 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.399
 otherwise the potatoes stay on the bend 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.960
 paste and we start cutting 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.609
 of the potato 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:51.510
 they important that it is very thin slices 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:53.690
 for this we then lay on it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.690
 baking paper 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:06.840
 and then sprinkle with a little 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:10.320
 and then they can sweat 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.310
 microwave set a microwave frame 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.610
 at 900 war and we sank the two 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.310
 minutes in a microwave 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.710
 you can also set the microwave to 700 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.820
 800 w but then it may be that they pair 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.820
 seconds longer in need 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.799
 about glove handy to morning quite 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.799
 very hot 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.829
 is that she can start a bit well 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.000
 tower we are going to say we turn around and then 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.319
 he still is a time and a half minute 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.319
 the microwave 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.459
 so the result after three and a half 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.110
 minute in the microwave 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.080
 well i have been able to withhold my 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.470
 chipz is enough cooled cheese now 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.470
 to attempt 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.549
 as you hear its super crashing 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.500
 and then also really nice I think it is one 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.909
 successful experiment 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.269
 thank that look and see you next 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.269
 times
