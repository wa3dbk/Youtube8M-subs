00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.820

 Walkie talkie namely Navitel 9 version 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.869
 when you started it flew at us out 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.229
 system 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.850
 for one second it will be returned 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.360
 we run long enough 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.360
 Navitel 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:33.450
 Navitel launched card socialization as 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.450
 usually 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.310
 Well, you can suffer these small 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.310
 limitations 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.730
 composition 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.860
 he did not see us 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.520
 great everything can go into 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.520
 3D mode 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.520
 I want to say right away how standard 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.270
 navigate this wheel adjust 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:12.350
 scale can not go 0 emotions only 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.210
 flax button or body so but the projectile 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.510
 alonso understandable I think about the navigator on 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.510
 I will tell more to the man further 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.420
 go back the shell 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.560
 and see the program so by the way I want 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.470
 say that on this unit 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.660

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.930

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.520
 Navigator that is desirable here of course 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.540
 use the stylus exit 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.170

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.880
