00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.340
 hello how are my name is alejandro 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.330
 this time the song is very accomplished 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.309
 of the strongest 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.790
 bull and pampa in this case bull and pampa 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.710
 my major is therefore the scale 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.340
 that derives from this chord in the scale 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.340
 greater natural 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.610
 Y 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.810
 and the chords that derive from this scale 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.050
 therefore it would be 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:47.080
 Major chord that is my second grade 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:50.320
 usa - third degree sun sustained lower 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:54.210
 fourth grade 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.210
 fifth degree tamayo 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.450
 and higher sixth grade and relative 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.600
 C sharp minor and the seventh grade 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.130
 which is a diminished chord that is re 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.460
 sustained 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.460
 and we close 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.270
 we are going to use in this investment 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.650
 it's a translation if we want to think about it 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.930
 how to move the greater re and 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.930
 we added the bass where it would correspond 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.260
 therefore use this position 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.260
 the greatest is used 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.680
 also uses sustained sun to less 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.159
 I had to use F sharp minor 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.740
 yes 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.030
 finished 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.030
 and they are would do something like that 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.990
 or not 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.049
 to 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.600
 i 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.890
 l 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.890
 p 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.500
 one 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.350
 sources 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.610
 one 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.859
 well this has been the introduction to 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.459
 bull and pampa I hope that I could have 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.290
 play and I hope it's useful in the 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.340
 next video I will show you how to play 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.340
 the electric riff
