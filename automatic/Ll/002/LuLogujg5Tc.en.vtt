smooth<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:40.310> know<00:02:40.340> it's<00:02:40.550> it's<00:02:40.820> not<00:02:41.000> as<00:02:41.209> maybe

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
smooth you know it's it's not as maybe

trendy<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.080> be<00:02:42.560> producing<00:02:43.010> in<00:02:43.130> Chicago<00:02:43.610> but

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
trendy to be producing in Chicago but

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.640 
trendy to be producing in Chicago but
that<00:02:44.330> also<00:02:44.510> makes<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:44.989> a<00:02:45.080> little<00:02:45.260> more<00:02:45.440> unique

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
that also makes it a little more unique

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.949 
that also makes it a little more unique
and<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.250> little<00:02:46.459> more<00:02:46.610> novel<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.209> think<00:02:47.750> that

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
and a little more novel and I think that

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.080 
and a little more novel and I think that
people<00:02:48.410> expect<00:02:48.920> products<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.519> be<00:02:49.640> made<00:02:49.820> here

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
people expect products to be made here

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.330 
people expect products to be made here
and<00:02:50.299> I<00:02:50.720> think<00:02:50.959> that<00:02:51.140> if<00:02:51.440> it's<00:02:51.590> made<00:02:51.769> in<00:02:51.799> Chicago

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
and I think that if it's made in Chicago

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.250 
and I think that if it's made in Chicago
it<00:02:52.580> has<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:52.880> level<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.330> quality<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.989> level

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
it has a level of quality and the level

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.229 
it has a level of quality and the level
of<00:02:54.410> respect<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.340> might<00:02:55.640> not<00:02:55.790> get<00:02:55.970> being

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
of respect that you might not get being

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.000 
of respect that you might not get being
made<00:02:56.480> other<00:02:56.660> cities<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.290> think<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:57.769> that

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
made other cities and I think that that

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.690 
made other cities and I think that that
goes<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.220> long<00:02:58.459> way<00:02:59.500> as<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.560> brand<00:03:01.010> as<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.250> business

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
goes a long way as a brand as a business

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.360 
goes a long way as a brand as a business

the name drift alone you know lends to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.479 
the name drift alone you know lends to
