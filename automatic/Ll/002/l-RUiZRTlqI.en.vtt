could<00:00:42.719> play<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.350> exact<00:00:43.649> same<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:44.129> smgs<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
could play the exact same with smgs and

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.270 
could play the exact same with smgs and
ARS<00:00:45.680> for<00:00:46.680> an<00:00:46.770> example<00:00:47.309> Oh<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:48.420> mw3<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:50.010> scar

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
ARS for an example Oh like mw3 the scar

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.880 
ARS for an example Oh like mw3 the scar
and<00:00:50.399> mw3<00:00:50.910> was<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:52.320> could<00:00:52.469> run<00:00:52.620> around

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
and mw3 was like you could run around

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.920 
and mw3 was like you could run around
with<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.520> kill<00:00:54.059> people<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.360> close<00:00:54.600> just

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
with it and kill people up close just

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.799 
with it and kill people up close just
because<00:00:55.110> they<00:00:55.230> killed<00:00:55.469> fast<00:00:55.969> but<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.539> game

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
because they killed fast but this game

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.139 
because they killed fast but this game
smgs<00:00:58.469> are<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:58.710> always<00:00:59.190> wind<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.820> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
smgs are like always wind in the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.540 
smgs are like always wind in the
close-quarter<00:01:00.930> battles<00:01:01.410> unless<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.520> have

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
close-quarter battles unless you have

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.369 
close-quarter battles unless you have
like<00:01:02.789> an<00:01:02.940> FAL<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.600> select<00:01:03.899> fire<00:01:04.080> because

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
like an FAL with select fire because

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.429 
like an FAL with select fire because
that<00:01:04.500> gun<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.860> insane<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.200> haven't

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
that gun is insane if you if you haven't

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.340 
that gun is insane if you if you haven't
used<00:01:07.710> assault<00:01:08.189> rifles<00:01:08.549> yet<00:01:08.700> you're<00:01:08.939> not<00:01:09.350> going

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
used assault rifles yet you're not going

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.719 
used assault rifles yet you're not going
to<00:01:10.470> use<00:01:10.590> them<00:01:10.770> because<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.100> like<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.520> think

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
to use them because you like you think

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.120 
to use them because you like you think
the<00:01:11.850> SMGs<00:01:12.420> are<00:01:12.570> better<00:01:12.780> trust<00:01:13.110> me<00:01:13.260> try<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.560> FAL

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the SMGs are better trust me try the FAL

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.630 
the SMGs are better trust me try the FAL
wits<00:01:14.430> like<00:01:14.880> fire<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.390> ridiculous

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
wits like fire it's ridiculous

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.350 
wits like fire it's ridiculous

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.410 
apparently though it's going to get
nerfed<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.320> little<00:01:19.560> bit<00:01:19.740> i'm<00:01:20.670> not<00:01:20.820> entirely

nerfed a little bit i'm not entirely

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.240 
nerfed a little bit i'm not entirely
sure<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.439> already<00:01:22.619> nerfed<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
sure on that they already nerfed it a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.039 
sure on that they already nerfed it a
little<00:01:23.460> bit<00:01:23.670> already<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.750> still

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
little bit already but it's still

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.080 
little bit already but it's still
insanely<00:01:25.920> good<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.610> best<00:01:26.790> assault

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
insanely good it's the best assault

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.620 
insanely good it's the best assault

SWAT<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.110> pretty<00:01:31.350> good<00:01:31.500> too<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.479> those<00:01:33.479> are

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
SWAT is pretty good too and those are

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.960 
SWAT is pretty good too and those are
probably<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.320> top<00:01:34.619> 3<00:01:35.310> i'd<00:01:35.579> say<00:01:35.880> um<00:01:37.970> i'm
