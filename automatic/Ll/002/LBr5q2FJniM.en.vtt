change now we'll show you how to put the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
change now we'll show you how to put the
cabin<00:02:59.910> filters<00:03:00.239> in<00:03:01.880> go<00:03:02.880> ahead<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.209> pop<00:03:03.360> this

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
cabin filters in go ahead and pop this

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.100 
cabin filters in go ahead and pop this
out<00:03:07.280> now<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.340> ones<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:08.819> you<00:03:08.940> take<00:03:09.150> out<00:03:09.390> we'll

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
probably have a part number on the side

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.729 
probably have a part number on the side
this<00:03:13.500> one<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.890> CAF<00:03:14.880> one<00:03:15.780> seven<00:03:16.200> five<00:03:16.440> eight

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
this one is a CAF one seven five eight

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.490 
this one is a CAF one seven five eight
which<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.670> STP<00:03:18.739> air<00:03:19.739> filter<00:03:20.269> now<00:03:21.500> looking

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
which is the STP air filter now looking

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.860 
which is the STP air filter now looking
at<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.799> holder<00:03:23.160> here<00:03:23.430> you'll<00:03:24.359> see<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:24.660> has<00:03:24.810> a

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
at the holder here you'll see it has a

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.500 
at the holder here you'll see it has a
little<00:03:25.500> edge<00:03:25.889> right<00:03:27.590> here<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.370> then<00:03:30.359> you'll

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
little edge right here and then you'll

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.940 
little edge right here and then you'll
notice<00:03:30.750> on<00:03:31.139> your<00:03:31.290> cabin<00:03:31.769> filter<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.340> has<00:03:33.950> this

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
notice on your cabin filter it has this

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.449 
notice on your cabin filter it has this
little<00:03:35.280> edge<00:03:35.430> here<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:36.840> goes<00:03:37.079> over<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:38.370> you

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
little edge here that goes over so you

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.599 
little edge here that goes over so you
just<00:03:38.670> want<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:38.880> be<00:03:39.000> be<00:03:39.480> careful<00:03:40.310> about<00:03:41.310> making

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
just want to be be careful about making

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.220 
just want to be be careful about making
sure<00:03:42.359> that<00:03:42.569> that<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:43.350> edge<00:03:44.810> goes<00:03:45.810> over<00:03:46.200> that

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
sure that that that edge goes over that

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.120 
sure that that that edge goes over that
little<00:03:46.560> lip<00:03:48.139> and<00:03:49.139> you<00:03:49.350> can<00:03:49.530> see<00:03:49.739> it<00:03:49.799> from<00:03:49.920> this

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
little lip and you can see it from this

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.960 
little lip and you can see it from this
side<00:03:52.760> kind<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:53.819> look<00:03:53.970> at<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.209> there<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:55.970> see

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
side kind of look at it there and see

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.789 
side kind of look at it there and see
that<00:03:57.150> it's<00:03:57.269> gone<00:03:57.420> over<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.319> it's<00:03:58.470> in<00:03:58.620> there

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
that it's gone over so it's in there

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.870 
that it's gone over so it's in there
properly<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:01.590> best<00:04:01.829> way<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.040> remember<00:04:02.549> how

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
properly the best way to remember how

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.379 
properly the best way to remember how
these<00:04:03.120> go<00:04:03.329> back<00:04:03.359> in<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:04.549> your<00:04:05.549> right<00:04:05.819> filter<00:04:06.269> is

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
these go back in is your right filter is

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.660 
these go back in is your right filter is
going<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.599> have<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.900> knob<00:04:07.079> on

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
going to have the knob on

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.890 
going to have the knob on
oops<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.840> knob<00:04:10.049> on<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.470> left<00:04:10.980> side<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.900> then

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
oops the knob on the left side and then

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.599 
oops the knob on the left side and then
your<00:04:13.109> left<00:04:13.319> filter<00:04:13.889> will<00:04:14.069> have<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.400> knob<00:04:14.579> on

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
your left filter will have the knob on

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.879 
your left filter will have the knob on
the<00:04:14.790> right<00:04:14.940> side<00:04:15.239> so<00:04:15.540> we'll<00:04:15.690> put<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.739> new

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
the right side so we'll put the new

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.180 
the right side so we'll put the new
cabin<00:04:17.340> filters<00:04:17.729> back<00:04:17.970> in

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
cabin filters back in

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.730 
cabin filters back in
slide<00:04:21.190> that<00:04:21.460> in<00:04:21.670> there<00:04:21.910> yeah<00:04:22.840> let's<00:04:23.410> get<00:04:23.560> some
