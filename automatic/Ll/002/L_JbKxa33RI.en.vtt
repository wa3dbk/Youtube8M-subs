00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:11.700
 www point of fishing point as you 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.310
 fish shop the list of programs 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.680
 of what's clear I'm bad today we're going to 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.880
 teach how to make our 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.360
 pressing bridges 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.150
 let's show what the knot is 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.610
 from braiding to friends 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.360
 The first thing that we have to do 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.770
 is 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.600
 instead a thread of 0 victims or less 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.160
 to the fine thread that we're going to use that goes 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.050
 to be a 0 12 0 14 016 it is assumed that 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.820
 let's use a post and braided 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.790
 to throw them to a possible then it 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.780
 assumes that we are going to use and then 012 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.690
 be 14 016 well that what happens that with 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.700
 those threads 0 that all the 0 14 16 does not 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.260
 can play directly to the braid with 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.090
 the new skillful was already more than 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.270
 checked every hour of throwing 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:05.350
 loose then we have to do to 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.250
 play 0 12 0 14 0 16 with a thread of 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.560
 0 20 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.259
 I in my case use it in black to 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.570
 to see when it enters that it has already entered 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:17.170
 and have more confidence when it comes to 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.170
 throw where we would put five 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.390
 meters nothing more than five meters what 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.610
 we would do but let's close the knot that 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.450
 what are we going to do the braiding of 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.390
 we put 7 meters we are going to 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.060
 proceed to do 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.100
 with the thread in this case of 20 that I 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.100
 I use for these bridges 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.790
 and the braided 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.190
 play I put the two threads in 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.630
 parallel and collect there I traded him 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:52.040
 we give a coca and we had it by itself 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.040
 and picking up the thread on those occasions 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.760
 OK 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.149
 and we think 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.940
 and we closed a friend for later 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.890
 to close it at the end we give the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.590
 back and we do the same operation with 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.180
 it with him normal 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.030
 As I said before I use it in 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.700
 black so that to know who has entered 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.030
 and I will have more security at the time of 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.030
 to work 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.170
 and we thought the nile did not close it almost 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.240
 the whole of how it's almost closed and 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.210
 we leave it there right now to do 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.950
 finish the knot close the knot 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.740
 we start to throw here directly 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.080
 but we take the thread of the thread and what 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.250
 we approach the braided knot 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.150
 previously we deserve it a little bit for 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.150
 so as not to burn the nylon 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.439
 As you can see, it's already stuck to the knot and now 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.129
 let's close the knot 13 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:08.639
 we tie a knot in the remainder of the 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.200
 braided is simply for to be able 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.719
 take it with a plier that is not us 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.319
 escape that if we do not do it is usually 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:19.800
 escape 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:22.460
 As you can see, it is already closed and now it is not 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.080
 and we throw you already have the knot 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:29.730
 perfectly done now let's 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:34.770
 put to cut the leftovers 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:37.950
 we can not cut rock saw 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.930
 and here the braided we cut it but they 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.470
 we leave a couple of millimeters or so 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.890
 of habits we think 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.530
 imparting 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.650
 we close we open electrized we learn 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.370
 with the team we saw well because this would be 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.040
 the zone of the thread five meters five 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.770
 meters of normal thread and we help our 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.020
 fine wire and twisted her area 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.390
 we give seven meters and we help our 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.830
 yellow our click what we already 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.670
 let's use 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.240
 Well, you see the knot perfectly 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.240
 fact 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.840
 I hope this video has helped 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:27.099
 to be able to make your knots of 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.740
 braided and would encourage them to use this 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:32.169
 stressed for a long time using the 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.560
 tips and you'll see that you get some 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.560
 more meters 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.560
 points like your fishing tent
