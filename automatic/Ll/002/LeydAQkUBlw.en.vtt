00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.119
 to 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.320
 the plant 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.119
 and hello everyone I'm ready 1 video and good 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.730
 we are in a new test in a new 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.650
 video and well I'm going to start this that 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.180
 It would be like making positions because we 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.000
 they help realize that not many people know 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.430
 make positions of a server so that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.690
 see that it's more hardcore and here I'm going 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.370
 record all the videos of the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.930
 elaboration of positions today we are going to 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.500
 see the position called health 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.540
 snapshot what this position is for 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.699
 serves to heal us instantly from 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.769
 a very effective way and to make you 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.140
 damage to some many like skeletons and 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.940
 zombies instead of curing them to them 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.089
 does the same damage that we are already healed 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.129
 us and well first of all let's go 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:02.260
 to the basic materials that we had 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:05.199
 a watermelon crystal gunpowder and balloons ton 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.759
 very well first of all occupy a 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.750
 inner kraft and here I do not have a 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.750
 stake 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.850
 first let's make bottles with three 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.400
 video so three jars and we're going to 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.500
 fill water in a small boat as 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.970
 many surely many of you already 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.400
 they know it but this is for the new 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:30.450
 we open our table of positions 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.760
 and we put them now to start first 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.630
 that we need nothing of edward so that 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.650
 have a farm of that and well let's 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.050
 that is collected a little while 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.730
 I'll take a little here we have only one 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.270
 this is the level in the 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:51.180
 strengths and good we put it here and 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.550
 We wait for the huarte and the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.010
 the water bottles are going to be converted 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.190
 in something called mundane potion or al 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.260
 potion or something like that now let's do 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.350
 another riffle we will need gold and a 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.229
 watermelon we put the gold ingot and we 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.170
 is going to give nine pips we put nuggets 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.200
 and there are about a watermelon in half so 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.840
 sanz and 918 chips really and it gives us 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.240
 the bright watermelon with watermelon 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.980
 sparkly 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.110
 we put it here to the strange position 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.140
 and it's going to become a position of 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.069
 instant health 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:34.020
 we let it pass i ii iii and iv 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.420
 and that by the way I'm on the server 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.190
 where will I be recording the series I can already 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.569
 upload the video to invite them when 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.340
 have the first foundations of the 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.790
 new villa of the chronicles of the server 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.450
 part 2 and good 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.579
 is not in instant health if you 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.769
 We put ton balloons into health 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.049
 snapshot 2 that would heal us 5 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.599
 hearts in total as well as this health 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.780
 normal snapshot will cure us 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.689
 only what they were being 2.5 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.489
 hearts is with glows conclusion it 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.220
 multiply the effect and ask us 5 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.580
 hearts 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.550
 and well once it is ready it becomes 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.730
 in instant health 2 now we put you 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.070
 gunpowder so that it is throws bleu and of 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.290
 what is the use that is red bleu us 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.470
 we are not know in a pp or we need 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.030
 use it fast nothing else we are running 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.570
 We are with 25 of life 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.330
 we lament to the ground and we are already cured by 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.150
 that's faster than drinking it and now 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.510
 it almost ends 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.000
 and you're ready, they're instant health 2 and 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.070
 throw bless 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.780
 and these positions serve to heal 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.230
 look 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:50.069
 let's go to a space to show them 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.980
 that kill a great cool bat 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.209
 they kill aggressive monsters and good 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.470
 I still do not know the monsters when 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.840
 come out monsters I come back and I'll be back 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.340
 and well we are already here they are already together 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.210
 a few have passed as five 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.020
 minutes and already catch the bat good 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:14.370
 now we are here we have to go well 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.140
 they hurt and another one was killed and we 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.380
 grant the experience we are going to throw 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.470
 the other flip flops and they are now very great 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.060
 most I get ong is very useful for 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.640
 Hispanics as you can see I get to all 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.470
 the experience is profitable since it does not 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.110
 you have to be killing as commonly 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.670
 he does it and well, this will be all for 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.320
 this video we will see in a following 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.320
 great video goodbye
