00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
trades and there'll be more on that in

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.420 
trades and there'll be more on that in
the<00:01:44.410> future<00:01:44.560> you're<00:01:44.860> going<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.250> see<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.370> lot

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
the future you're going to see a lot

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.280 
the future you're going to see a lot
more<00:01:45.550> about<00:01:45.790> detail<00:01:46.360> on<00:01:46.570> that<00:01:46.810> area<00:01:47.080> of<00:01:47.229> the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
more about detail on that area of the

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.670 
more about detail on that area of the
game<00:01:47.500> when<00:01:48.340> we<00:01:48.490> can<00:01:49.060> say<00:01:49.240> more<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.590> other

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
game when we can say more and the other

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.500 
game when we can say more and the other
thing<00:01:50.770> is<00:01:51.010> we<00:01:51.280> worked<00:01:51.700> on<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.970> simulation

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
thing is we worked on the simulation

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.570 
thing is we worked on the simulation
engine<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:53.620> scores<00:01:53.950> will<00:01:54.130> be<00:01:54.160> much<00:01:54.400> more

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
engine the scores will be much more

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.360 
engine the scores will be much more
varied<00:01:55.290> with<00:01:56.290> scoring<00:01:56.650> going<00:01:56.920> up<00:01:57.040> this<00:01:57.160> year

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
varied with scoring going up this year

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.070 
varied with scoring going up this year
in<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.550> NHL<00:01:57.970> you're<00:01:58.270> going<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.450> see<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.660> little

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
in the NHL you're going to see a little

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.210 
in the NHL you're going to see a little
more<00:01:59.200> variance<00:01:59.800> and<00:02:00.190> how<00:02:00.430> our<00:02:00.760> sim<00:02:01.150> engine

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
more variance and how our sim engine

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.130 
more variance and how our sim engine
gives<00:02:03.220> up<00:02:03.369> goals<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.910> assists<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:04.869> it<00:02:05.020> should

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
gives up goals and assists so it should

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.620 
gives up goals and assists so it should
be<00:02:05.170> a<00:02:05.259> much<00:02:05.440> more<00:02:05.790> realistic<00:02:06.790> impression<00:02:07.540> of

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
be a much more realistic impression of

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.040 
be a much more realistic impression of
what<00:02:07.750> what<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.649> scoring<00:02:09.009> is<00:02:09.160> like<00:02:09.369> any<00:02:09.700> gel<00:02:10.050> so

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
what what the scoring is like any gel so

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.840 
what what the scoring is like any gel so
that's<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.739> dynasty<00:02:12.220> improvements<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.730> can

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
that's the dynasty improvements I can

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.180 
that's the dynasty improvements I can
tell<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.060> about<00:02:13.150> right<00:02:13.360> now<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.920> next

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
tell you about right now and the next

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.250 
tell you about right now and the next
area<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.610> be<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:15.850> pro<00:02:16.150> which<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.750> course<00:02:16.780> the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
area is be a pro which is of course the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.220 
area is be a pro which is of course the
big<00:02:17.709> thing<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.040> we<00:02:18.130> did<00:02:18.220> last<00:02:18.400> year<00:02:18.610> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
big thing that we did last year and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.479 
big thing that we did last year and
seems<00:02:20.230> like<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.500> was<00:02:20.590> really<00:02:20.950> well<00:02:21.160> received

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
seems like it was really well received

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.580 
seems like it was really well received
by<00:02:21.850> our<00:02:21.880> community<00:02:22.360> they<00:02:22.900> love<00:02:23.110> playing<00:02:23.260> be<00:02:23.560> a

try to improve it so one of them is the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.330 
try to improve it so one of them is the
famous<00:02:46.570> I<00:02:46.989> scored<00:02:47.290> ten<00:02:47.500> goals<00:02:47.530> in<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.130> first

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
famous I scored ten goals in the first

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.070 
famous I scored ten goals in the first
three<00:02:48.519> games<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.880> be<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> pro<00:02:49.299> as<00:02:49.510> an<00:02:49.660> NHL<00:02:50.049> player

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
three games of be a pro as an NHL player

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.390 
three games of be a pro as an NHL player
and<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.860> got<00:02:51.010> sent<00:02:51.190> down<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:53.290> was<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:54.130> little

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
and I got sent down that was a little

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.190 
and I got sent down that was a little
bit<00:02:54.610> due<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.150> fact<00:02:55.330> that<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.780> need<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:56.080> be

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
bit due to the fact that you need to be

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.270 
bit due to the fact that you need to be
a<00:02:56.230> complete<00:02:56.680> player<00:02:56.920> in<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.190> NHL<00:02:59.010> we<00:03:00.010> may<00:03:00.250> have

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
a complete player in the NHL we may have

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.400 
a complete player in the NHL we may have
skewed<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:00.820> too<00:03:01.000> much<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.420> be<00:03:01.570> a<00:03:01.600> complete

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
skewed it too much to be a complete

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.500 
skewed it too much to be a complete
player<00:03:02.590> so<00:03:03.190> we're<00:03:03.430> going<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:03.820> tune<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.209> so<00:03:04.330> that

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
player so we're going to tune it so that

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.860 
player so we're going to tune it so that
statistics<00:03:05.400> will<00:03:06.400> be<00:03:06.549> more<00:03:06.880> if<00:03:07.690> you're

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
statistics will be more if you're

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.229 
statistics will be more if you're
producing<00:03:08.489> you<00:03:09.489> can<00:03:09.700> stick<00:03:09.940> around<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.209> little

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
producing you can stick around a little

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.740 
producing you can stick around a little
longer<00:03:10.450> in<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.900> NHL<00:03:11.850> but<00:03:12.850> if<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.360> are<00:03:13.390> getting

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
longer in the NHL but if you are getting

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.840 
longer in the NHL but if you are getting
two<00:03:14.019> eps<00:03:14.200> in<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.650> other<00:03:14.799> areas<00:03:14.920> of<00:03:15.519> your<00:03:15.610> game

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
two eps in the other areas of your game

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.250 
two eps in the other areas of your game
you<00:03:16.150> will<00:03:16.360> eventually<00:03:16.840> go<00:03:16.930> down<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.200> the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
you will eventually go down to the

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.680 
you will eventually go down to the
minors<00:03:17.590> there<00:03:18.400> are<00:03:18.549> players<00:03:18.820> in<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.090> NHL<00:03:19.269> in

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
minors there are players in the NHL in

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.030 
minors there are players in the NHL in
the<00:03:19.870> past<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.440> have<00:03:20.530> had<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:20.799> same

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
the past that have had that same

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.560 
the past that have had that same
scenario<00:03:21.489> where<00:03:21.670> they<00:03:21.760> come<00:03:21.940> up<00:03:22.090> they<00:03:22.269> score

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
scenario where they come up they score

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.020 
scenario where they come up they score
they<00:03:23.470> won't<00:03:23.709> do<00:03:23.860> anything<00:03:23.890> else<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:24.730> then<00:03:24.880> the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
they won't do anything else so then the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.430 
they won't do anything else so then the
coach<00:03:25.180> has<00:03:25.329> to<00:03:25.420> set<00:03:25.600> them<00:03:25.690> down<00:03:25.780> because<00:03:26.110> at

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
coach has to set them down because at

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.960 
coach has to set them down because at
the<00:03:26.530> end<00:03:26.560> of<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.799> day<00:03:26.950> he<00:03:27.519> doesn't<00:03:27.790> want<00:03:27.910> to

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
the end of the day he doesn't want to

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.280 
the end of the day he doesn't want to
let<00:03:28.090> in<00:03:28.209> three<00:03:28.450> goals<00:03:28.660> while<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.019> scored

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
let in three goals while you scored

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.830 
let in three goals while you scored
three<00:03:29.470> goals<00:03:29.590> but<00:03:30.459> we<00:03:30.820> are<00:03:30.970> improving<00:03:31.269> that<00:03:31.570> so

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
three goals but we are improving that so

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.820 
three goals but we are improving that so
it<00:03:31.900> should<00:03:32.019> be<00:03:32.049> a<00:03:32.140> much<00:03:32.290> easier

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
it should be a much easier

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.910 
it should be a much easier
trying<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.160> stay<00:03:33.340> up<00:03:33.430> in<00:03:33.550> NHL<00:03:34.000> if<00:03:34.210> you<00:03:34.420> are

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
trying to stay up in NHL if you are

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.790 
trying to stay up in NHL if you are
producing<00:03:36.330> another<00:03:37.330> area<00:03:38.050> that<00:03:38.110> I'm<00:03:38.590> working

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
producing another area that I'm working

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.200 
producing another area that I'm working
with<00:03:38.980> Shawn<00:03:39.600> on<00:03:40.600> is<00:03:41.020> a<00:03:41.320> teen<00:03:41.590> Adi<00:03:42.030> they<00:03:43.030> will<00:03:43.180> be

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
with Shawn on is a teen Adi they will be

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.210 
with Shawn on is a teen Adi they will be
much<00:03:43.480> more<00:03:43.720> improved<00:03:44.050> it<00:03:44.350> won't<00:03:44.650> be<00:03:44.830> if<00:03:45.040> I

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
much more improved it won't be if I

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.790 
much more improved it won't be if I
don't<00:03:45.430> score<00:03:45.550> no<00:03:45.910> one<00:03:46.030> will<00:03:46.150> score<00:03:46.420> for<00:03:46.660> me<00:03:46.800> so

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
don't score no one will score for me so

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.200 
don't score no one will score for me so
it<00:03:48.010> should<00:03:48.190> be<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.340> much<00:03:48.550> more<00:03:48.820> interactive

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
it should be a much more interactive

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.630 
it should be a much more interactive
team<00:03:50.140> experience<00:03:50.740> where<00:03:51.280> when<00:03:51.490> you're

team experience where when you're

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.490

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
they can do something on the ice to help

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.670 
they can do something on the ice to help
you<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:58.570> other<00:03:58.690> one<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:58.930> for<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.290> goalies

in be a pro he plays a goalie and you

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.320 
in be a pro he plays a goalie and you
might<00:04:03.910> get<00:04:04.150> 10<00:04:05.080> to<00:04:05.200> 12<00:04:05.440> shots<00:04:05.710> a<00:04:05.890> game<00:04:05.920> 15<00:04:06.850> it

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
might get 10 to 12 shots a game 15 it

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.180 
might get 10 to 12 shots a game 15 it
would<00:04:07.480> seem<00:04:07.660> kind<00:04:07.960> of<00:04:08.050> low<00:04:08.200> so<00:04:08.890> we're<00:04:09.070> working

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
would seem kind of low so we're working

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.980 
would seem kind of low so we're working
on<00:04:09.520> making<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.910> CPU<00:04:10.240> much<00:04:10.420> more<00:04:10.630> aggressive

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
on making the CPU much more aggressive

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.350 
on making the CPU much more aggressive
in<00:04:11.080> their<00:04:11.200> shooting<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:12.370> that<00:04:12.520> should<00:04:12.730> give

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
in their shooting and that should give

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.110 
in their shooting and that should give
the<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.900> be<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.260> pro<00:04:14.440> goalie<00:04:14.820> fans<00:04:15.820> who<00:04:16.090> are
