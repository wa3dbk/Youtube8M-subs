next<00:02:09.590> part<00:02:09.830> is<00:02:10.039> a<00:02:10.099> lava<00:02:10.910> flow<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.750> then<00:02:11.930> the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
next part is a lava flow so then the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.380 
next part is a lava flow so then the
redstone<00:02:12.620> travels<00:02:13.220> up<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.640> then<00:02:13.819> it<00:02:14.209> doesn't

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
redstone travels up and then it doesn't

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.569 
redstone travels up and then it doesn't
really<00:02:14.540> travel<00:02:15.079> its<00:02:15.260> current<00:02:15.590> but<00:02:16.430> let<00:02:16.549> me

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
really travel its current but let me

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.130 
really travel its current but let me
just<00:02:16.670> reset<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:17.239> really<00:02:17.480> quick<00:02:17.659> you<00:02:17.989> can

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
just reset this really quick you can

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.750 
just reset this really quick you can
control<00:02:18.500> lava<00:02:18.769> flow<00:02:19.010> with<00:02:19.129> redstone

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
control lava flow with redstone

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.089 
control lava flow with redstone
I'm<00:02:20.409> pretty<00:02:21.409> sure<00:02:21.590> there's<00:02:21.620> lots<00:02:21.860> of

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
I'm pretty sure there's lots of

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.179 
I'm pretty sure there's lots of
tutorials<00:02:22.220> on<00:02:22.849> how<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.120> do<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:23.720> uh<00:02:24.189> when

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
tutorials on how to do it but uh when

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.860 
tutorials on how to do it but uh when
the<00:02:25.280> restaurant<00:02:25.640> turns<00:02:25.790> on<00:02:26.120> basically<00:02:26.720> the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
the restaurant turns on basically the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.259 
the restaurant turns on basically the
lava<00:02:27.079> will<00:02:27.409> flow<00:02:27.680> hopefully<00:02:28.489> that<00:02:28.670> didn't<00:02:28.970> go

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
lava will flow hopefully that didn't go

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:30.880 
lava will flow hopefully that didn't go
yet<00:02:29.510> but<00:02:30.019> if<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.200> don't<00:02:30.379> do<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.620> right<00:02:30.769> the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
yet but if you don't do it right the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.770 
yet but if you don't do it right the
lava<00:02:31.099> will<00:02:31.280> just<00:02:31.430> flow<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.909> then<00:02:32.450> another

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
lava will just flow and then another

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.460 
lava will just flow and then another
cool<00:02:33.170> trick<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.590> learned<00:02:33.860> was<00:02:34.129> um<00:02:34.340> if<00:02:35.079> God<00:02:36.079> did<00:02:36.349> I

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
cool trick I learned was um if God did I

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.399 
cool trick I learned was um if God did I
want<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.799> take<00:02:37.129> um<00:02:37.909> oh<00:02:38.239> so<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.900> had<00:02:39.079> a<00:02:39.110> mishap

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
want to take um oh so I had a mishap

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.600 
want to take um oh so I had a mishap
where<00:02:40.599> this<00:02:41.599> clock<00:02:41.959> like<00:02:42.470> got<00:02:43.069> deleted<00:02:43.400> like

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
where this clock like got deleted like

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.490 
where this clock like got deleted like
it<00:02:44.269> kind<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.780> wants<00:02:45.019> destroyed<00:02:45.290> all<00:02:45.470> my

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
it kind of wants destroyed all my

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.270 
it kind of wants destroyed all my
redstone<00:02:45.859> but<00:02:46.519> circuitry<00:02:47.420> but<00:02:48.019> then<00:02:48.170> um<00:02:48.349> if

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
redstone but circuitry but then um if

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.920 
redstone but circuitry but then um if
you<00:02:49.489> didn't<00:02:49.700> know<00:02:49.819> about<00:02:49.939> this<00:02:50.209> like<00:02:50.390> cake

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
you didn't know about this like cake

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.199 
you didn't know about this like cake
doesn't<00:02:51.319> get<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:51.859> washed<00:02:52.190> away<00:02:52.459> by<00:02:52.579> water<00:02:53.060> or

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
doesn't get like washed away by water or

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.690 
doesn't get like washed away by water or
lava<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.720> just<00:02:53.930> flows<00:02:54.260> in<00:02:54.500> between<00:02:54.859> then<00:02:55.489> just

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
lava it just flows in between then just

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.729 
lava it just flows in between then just
channels<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.299> lava<00:02:56.659> to<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.079> center<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.650> then

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
channels the lava to the center and then

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.879 
channels the lava to the center and then
kills<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:59.170> alright<00:03:00.170> sorry<00:03:00.409> guys<00:03:00.620> at<00:03:00.799> the

kills you alright sorry guys at the

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.289 
kills you alright sorry guys at the
positive<00:03:01.220> putting<00:03:01.549> their<00:03:01.700> but<00:03:01.879> because<00:03:02.060> I'm<00:03:02.180> I

positive putting their but because I'm I

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.479 
positive putting their but because I'm I
was<00:03:02.450> like<00:03:02.569> this<00:03:02.720> is<00:03:02.780> what<00:03:03.109> up<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.709> just<00:03:04.370> made

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
was like this is what up I just made

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.970 
was like this is what up I just made
random<00:03:04.819> attardi<00:03:05.180> noises<00:03:05.569> but<00:03:05.750> I'm<00:03:05.900> yeah<00:03:06.709> that

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
random attardi noises but I'm yeah that

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.000 
random attardi noises but I'm yeah that
is<00:03:07.159> pretty<00:03:07.400> much<00:03:07.639> it<00:03:07.909> uh<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:10.389> way<00:03:11.389> the<00:03:11.810> oh<00:03:12.170> crap

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
is pretty much it uh the way the oh crap

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.759 
is pretty much it uh the way the oh crap
I<00:03:13.159> come<00:03:13.340> flying<00:03:13.489> off<00:03:13.730> by<00:03:13.940> accident<00:03:14.090> on<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.840> way

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
I come flying off by accident on the way

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.599 
I come flying off by accident on the way
this<00:03:16.340> works<00:03:16.609> is<00:03:16.940> when<00:03:17.269> lava<00:03:17.900> turns<00:03:18.319> on<00:03:18.650> the

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
this works is when lava turns on the

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.910 
this works is when lava turns on the
it'll<00:03:20.420> flow<00:03:20.659> both<00:03:20.900> ways<00:03:20.959> instead<00:03:21.379> of<00:03:21.620> just<00:03:21.739> one

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
it'll flow both ways instead of just one

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.339 
it'll flow both ways instead of just one
really<00:03:21.950> because<00:03:22.370> lava<00:03:22.730> originally<00:03:23.420> flows<00:03:23.810> the

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
really because lava originally flows the

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.140 
really because lava originally flows the
lowest<00:03:24.769> point<00:03:25.069> and<00:03:25.220> they<00:03:25.730> each<00:03:25.819> make<00:03:26.030> the

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
lowest point and they each make the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.520 
lowest point and they each make the
lowest<00:03:26.449> point<00:03:26.629> there<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.079> then<00:03:27.199> you<00:03:27.290> start

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
lowest point there and then you start

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.470 
lowest point there and then you start
digging<00:03:27.680> this<00:03:27.889> hole<00:03:28.129> and<00:03:28.400> then<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.299> should

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
digging this hole and then it should

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.920 
digging this hole and then it should
stay<00:03:30.129> but<00:03:31.129> uh<00:03:31.160> yeah<00:03:31.669> if<00:03:31.970> you<00:03:32.209> guys<00:03:32.419> don't<00:03:32.720> like

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
stay but uh yeah if you guys don't like

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.159 
stay but uh yeah if you guys don't like
red<00:03:33.199> stone<00:03:33.500> um<00:03:33.769> I<00:03:34.010> still<00:03:34.760> make<00:03:34.940> a<00:03:34.970> let's<00:03:35.900> place

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
red stone um I still make a let's place
