and<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.439> add<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.710> at<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> end<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.880> then

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and you can add that at the end so then

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:08.310 
and you can add that at the end so then
into<00:01:54.840> our<00:01:54.960> wet<00:01:55.200> mixture<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:55.890> our<00:01:56.310> eggs

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.160 

we've<00:02:09.320> also<00:02:09.530> got<00:02:09.830> our<00:02:09.860> olive<00:02:10.369> oil<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:12.140> olive

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
we've also got our olive oil the olive

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.960 
we've also got our olive oil the olive
oil<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.680> going<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.830> ensure<00:02:13.100> it<00:02:13.190> stays<00:02:13.220> nice<00:02:13.640> and

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
oil is going to ensure it stays nice and

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.400 
oil is going to ensure it stays nice and
soft<00:02:14.270> but<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.540> still<00:02:14.750> holds<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.170> nice

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
soft but it still holds that nice

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.320 
soft but it still holds that nice
texture<00:02:15.860> then<00:02:16.550> we<00:02:16.760> got<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.910> little<00:02:17.060> bit<00:02:17.210> of<00:02:17.270> our

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
texture then we got a little bit of our

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.940 
texture then we got a little bit of our
sweetener<00:02:17.780> coming<00:02:18.110> from<00:02:18.200> our<00:02:18.350> maple<00:02:18.500> syrup

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
sweetener coming from our maple syrup

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.420 
sweetener coming from our maple syrup
which<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:19.520> less<00:02:19.850> refined<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:21.070> last<00:02:22.070> we're

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
which is less refined and last we're

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.390 
which is less refined and last we're
gonna<00:02:22.490> add<00:02:22.700> our<00:02:22.730> vanilla<00:02:22.910> extract<00:02:24.280> then<00:02:25.280> you

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
gonna add our vanilla extract then you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.950 
gonna add our vanilla extract then you
simply<00:02:25.760> combine<00:02:26.120> all<00:02:26.480> your<00:02:26.660> wet<00:02:26.840> ingredients

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
simply combine all your wet ingredients

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:39.010 
simply combine all your wet ingredients
together<00:02:36.670> now<00:02:37.700> eggs<00:02:37.910> are<00:02:38.060> stabilizers<00:02:38.870> and

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
together now eggs are stabilizers and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.710 
together now eggs are stabilizers and
they'll<00:02:39.140> essentially<00:02:39.710> what<00:02:39.980> hold<00:02:40.370> our<00:02:41.330> whole

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
they'll essentially what hold our whole

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.230 
they'll essentially what hold our whole
muffin<00:02:42.260> mixture<00:02:42.530> together<00:02:42.760> so<00:02:43.760> when<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:43.970> bake

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
muffin mixture together so when you bake

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.850 
muffin mixture together so when you bake
as<00:02:44.450> well<00:02:44.660> they<00:02:45.020> help<00:02:45.170> them<00:02:45.260> hold<00:02:45.410> together<00:02:45.590> and

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
as well they help them hold together and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.500 
as well they help them hold together and
they<00:02:45.920> also<00:02:46.070> help<00:02:46.370> that<00:02:46.520> nice<00:02:46.730> cooked<00:02:47.150> feeling

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
they also help that nice cooked feeling

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.400 
they also help that nice cooked feeling
coming<00:02:47.690> through<00:02:52.000> okay<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.240> as<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.480> said<00:02:53.540> baking

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
coming through okay and as I said baking

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.260 
coming through okay and as I said baking
is<00:02:54.560> as<00:02:54.710> simple<00:02:54.950> as<00:02:55.010> adding<00:02:55.220> our<00:02:55.490> wet<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:56.150> our

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
is as simple as adding our wet to our

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.970 
is as simple as adding our wet to our
dry<00:02:56.510> that's<00:02:57.110> what<00:02:57.230> I'm<00:02:57.320> gonna<00:02:57.410> do<00:02:59.590> and<00:03:00.590> now<00:03:00.890> you

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
dry that's what I'm gonna do and now you

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.010 
dry that's what I'm gonna do and now you
just<00:03:01.160> simply<00:03:01.460> fold<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.850> in<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.750> know<00:03:02.840> make

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
just simply fold it in you know make

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.790 
just simply fold it in you know make
sure<00:03:03.260> you're<00:03:03.440> nice<00:03:03.710> and<00:03:04.070> even<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.120> gentle

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
sure you're nice and even and gentle

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.870 
sure you're nice and even and gentle
you're<00:03:06.800> going<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:06.980> make<00:03:07.100> sure<00:03:07.130> that<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.670> whole

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
you're going to make sure that the whole

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.680 
you're going to make sure that the whole
mixture<00:03:08.209> gets<00:03:08.660> some<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.959> that<00:03:09.050> moisture<00:03:09.560> so

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
mixture gets some of that moisture so

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.729 
mixture gets some of that moisture so
now<00:03:11.690> it's<00:03:11.810> time<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.020> add<00:03:12.200> our<00:03:12.230> strawberries

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
now it's time to add our strawberries

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.110 
now it's time to add our strawberries
and<00:03:12.890> they've<00:03:12.980> cooled<00:03:13.160> down<00:03:13.400> so<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:13.700> can<00:03:13.850> handle

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
and they've cooled down so I can handle

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.080 
and they've cooled down so I can handle
them<00:03:14.239> quite<00:03:14.420> easily<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:15.610> just<00:03:16.610> using<00:03:16.940> the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
them quite easily so just using the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.500 
them quite easily so just using the
other<00:03:18.020> end<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.440> my<00:03:18.620> spatula<00:03:19.370> scrape<00:03:20.270> them<00:03:20.390> off

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
other end of my spatula scrape them off

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.650 
other end of my spatula scrape them off
and<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:21.200> can<00:03:21.290> see<00:03:21.470> they've<00:03:21.650> left<00:03:21.890> behind<00:03:22.010> a

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
and you can see they've left behind a

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.540 
and you can see they've left behind a
nice<00:03:23.660> sticking<00:03:24.230> kind<00:03:24.470> of<00:03:24.560> residue<00:03:25.370> which

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
nice sticking kind of residue which

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.060 
nice sticking kind of residue which
which<00:03:25.850> means<00:03:26.150> it's<00:03:26.300> perfect

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
which means it's perfect

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.590 
which means it's perfect
it's<00:03:28.070> almost<00:03:28.190> some<00:03:28.459> sort<00:03:28.640> of<00:03:28.670> kid<00:03:29.000> play<00:03:29.390> art

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
it's almost some sort of kid play art

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.460 
it's almost some sort of kid play art
and<00:03:30.320> again<00:03:30.860> just<00:03:31.220> fold<00:03:31.489> it<00:03:31.580> in<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.720> already

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
and again just fold it in and already

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.440 
and again just fold it in and already
just<00:03:34.010> by<00:03:34.130> mixing<00:03:34.310> you<00:03:34.580> can<00:03:34.730> see<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.180> the

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
just by mixing you can see the the

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.060 
just by mixing you can see the the
strawberries<00:03:35.959> because<00:03:36.380> they're<00:03:36.560> so<00:03:36.709> jammy

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
strawberries because they're so jammy

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.190 
strawberries because they're so jammy
they<00:03:37.310> just<00:03:37.459> add<00:03:37.610> that<00:03:37.820> you<00:03:38.660> know<00:03:38.690> extra

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
they just add that you know extra

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.860 
they just add that you know extra
textural<00:03:39.620> element<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.040> ensure<00:03:40.340> that<00:03:40.370> they

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
textural element to ensure that they

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.830 
textural element to ensure that they
loosen<00:03:41.870> up<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.110> mixture<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:44.480> that's<00:03:44.630> ready

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
loosen up the mixture and that's ready

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.380 
loosen up the mixture and that's ready
to<00:03:44.959> go<00:03:45.110> but<00:03:45.500> before<00:03:45.590> we<00:03:45.890> do<00:03:46.070> our<00:03:46.310> special<00:03:47.180> or

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
to go but before we do our special or

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.390 
to go but before we do our special or
optional<00:03:48.140> ingredient<00:03:48.590> but<00:03:48.739> definitely<00:03:49.250> I

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
optional ingredient but definitely I

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.680 
optional ingredient but definitely I
think<00:03:49.459> most<00:03:49.880> important<00:03:50.330> because<00:03:50.420> it<00:03:50.570> adds

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
think most important because it adds

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.360 
think most important because it adds
that<00:03:50.780> little<00:03:51.050> bitterness<00:03:51.290> is<00:03:51.890> our<00:03:52.190> food

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
that little bitterness is our food

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.150 
that little bitterness is our food
corneum<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:54.380> again<00:03:54.560> it's<00:03:54.680> really<00:03:54.770> important

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
corneum and again it's really important

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.880 
corneum and again it's really important
just<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.340> gently<00:03:55.700> fold<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:56.090> through<00:03:56.800> so<00:03:57.800> the

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
just to gently fold that through so the

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.440 
just to gently fold that through so the
reason<00:03:58.160> why<00:03:58.310> I<00:03:58.340> think<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.670> cacao<00:03:58.970> nibs<00:03:59.180> are<00:03:59.300> so

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
reason why I think the cacao nibs are so

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.540 
reason why I think the cacao nibs are so
essential<00:03:59.570> is<00:04:00.470> because<00:04:00.980> they're<00:04:01.190> bitterness

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
essential is because they're bitterness

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.130 
essential is because they're bitterness
they<00:04:01.760> cut<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.330> the<00:04:02.360> sweetness<00:04:02.959> and<00:04:03.050> the

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
they cut the the sweetness and the

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.600 
they cut the the sweetness and the
strawberries<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.860> maple<00:04:04.010> syrup<00:04:04.280> is<00:04:04.430> so

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
strawberries and the maple syrup is so
