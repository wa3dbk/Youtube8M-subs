00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.740
 Ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.400
 who of them does not know these 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.560
 chart picture of trees cause this 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.730
 harm is the so-called 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.519
 Buchholzzünsler the Buchbaumzünsler 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.539
 belongs to the family of butterflies 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.609
 however, it's not that butterflies 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.390
 the ultimate cause but the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.300
 precedent of the meeting the hood of the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.150
 Buchholzzünsler is not native to him 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.129
 comes from east asia china japan korea and 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.960
 was so suspected by the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.460
 international plants and containers 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.190
 traded with us in europe 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.329
 2006 2007 are the first falls in 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.050
 germany baden württemberg 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.530
 occurred 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.109
 in austria 2009 vorwerk and since 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.679
 this time, the spreads 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:02.149
 book art also in our region 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:04.739
 here in power thinking are the orders of 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.680
 Buchholzzünsler massive since the previous year 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.500
 and this year is how the development is now 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.290
 this boxwood calculator of butterflies 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.750
 itself has a span of about 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.360
 four four and a half inches and lives in the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.130
 The environment of the book is itself 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.470
 nocturnal and then flies in the night 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.240
 after the mating the box tree was created 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.869
 there were at from the so-called 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.630
 mirror 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.360
 the butterfly loves no more than one 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.729
 week on different weapons stadiums 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.460
 then develops a caterpillar and 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.000
 This caterpillar causes this eating damage 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.380
 first inside the bus and then 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.659
 he eats outward the deadline 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.880
 leaves and if the epidemic is very massive 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.979
 is also the bark 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.450
 The development is above all 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.039
 temperature-dependent here in Europe went 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.200
 We are from two to three generations in the 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.759
 year out in east asia itself as a heat 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.520
 It is four to six generations 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.409
 in the year after the frost damage inside 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.200
 starts and the caterpillars are very well camouflaged 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.789
 it is necessary that you not only 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.820
 the box tree viewed outside but 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.220
 also looks inside and determines 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.590
 whether it has already come to a loss 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.180
 one can determine if one caterpillar 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.020
 this cancellation is very 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.810
 laborious and not really efficient 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.850
 Most importantly it is injecting measures 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.750
 and here are two very 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.750
 good medium 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.130
 one is the middle career of the 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.200
 company tele flora the other is that 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.270
 medium calypso from the company bayer 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.870
 both are so-called systemic 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.610
 Medium system is that the active ingredient 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.710
 Form is taken over green 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.340
 the plant juice acts and as soon as the 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.480
 eating caterpillars will break down 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.950
 however, the mortality rate is included 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.210
 The robbed then becomes very high when the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.520
 rates are still very small 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.550
 we know meanwhile are the caterpillars 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.740
 about three and a half inches tall like that 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.900
 you have to achieve a contact effect 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.190
 that means the boxwood must be outside 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.620
 be played and inside 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.740
 so that the medium directly on the 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.900
 Caterpillar applied is a possibility 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.430
 also the box tree with one 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.100
 high pressure cleaner to jump off here 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.870
 please put a plane underneath it 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.730
 the caterpillar is lonely and 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.380
 can destroy 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.630
 please note also if you have the 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.610
 Cut boxwood 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.020
 that is not composting it is 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.100
 very important to the cut 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.270
 destroy best to spend 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.400
 the next generation for this year 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.510
 we expect in june if you want to 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.860
 Buchholzzünsler or to others 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.720
 Plant protection problems have questions 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.220
 The competent team will be in the country 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.220
 bayer is happy to advise you
