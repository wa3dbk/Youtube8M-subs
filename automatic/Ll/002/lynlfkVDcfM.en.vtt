00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.660
 hello very good two sales we record and 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:07.660
 mateo tips today I bring you a new video 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.760
 I'm a good chicken driver and 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.260
 we are here in special 800 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.889
 subscribers and good can we do 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.429
 an interview and we're going to create question 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.429
 What is your name 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.960
 how old are you 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.960
 where do you live 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.810
 when you started on youtube 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.710
 and 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.710
 about three years ago and why start 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:48.440
 why are you calling doctor the chicken because 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:51.880
 pc xbox one or play 4 what is your channel 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.880
 favorite that is not fifa 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.620
 and say 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.230
 during his I saw the enough variety to 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.470
 channel because that change suddenly to 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.090
 only the psuv and fixed but because 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.690
 basically you think that really 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.690
 there is a handicap 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.200
 and what would you say is the handicap for 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.549
 the people who do not know it basically the 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.159
 people who can not play so much that they have 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.159
 that because it's not as good as others 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.689
 players like Christian ronaldo touch or 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.039
 toti that should never fail 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:38.890
 Dejected that seems to have shit 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:42.720
 what equipment you are small or they do not 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.720
 none what is your favorite movie 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.000
 to see what your favorite color is 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:57.150
 what was your first console 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.150
 the super 264 which was your first fifa 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.350
 90 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.420
 and you think you can stay between the three 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.659
 first of the immense league of europe 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.269
 on-line 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.150
 It is not very difficult and there are very 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:15.540
 good right now I'm the third but 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.940
 there are very good people and it is difficult to 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.069
 thing but when you try it was you think 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.549
 which is the best rival of eurogamer are 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:26.819
 line the one that obviously plays the best 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:29.519
 I think it would be between more and what are 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.410
 the three worst things that you grow up in 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.630
 fifa 14 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.970
 good handicap centers spectators and 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.970
 it's good that you would do it to fix 15 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.799
 you have thought to buy the weight 2015 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:49.469
 for the new generation 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.090
 and finally what advice would you give 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.090
