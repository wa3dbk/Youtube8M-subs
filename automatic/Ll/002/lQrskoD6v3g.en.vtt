00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:13.249
 the revolution of four-wheel drive began in 1940 when 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:17.230
 the first discs were put into service by the army of the states 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.029
 United 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.109
 they needed a lightweight vehicle and multiple applications 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.869
 two different designs were proposed but the ten designed by 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.869
 cuil and blowing them companys was the chosen one 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.629
 It was revolutionary because its construction was simple but 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.629
 extremely robust 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.950
 the comfort and safety of primitives but that did not stop him 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.950
 become the favorite of all soldiers 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.680
 very rigorous tests 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.680
 They showed that they could handle more than any other vehicle 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.210
 will be driven by a 60 horsepower engine and weighed only one thousand 100 kilograms 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.510
 this combination of robustness and power meant that it could go because 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.510
 practically anywhere 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.230
 revolutionized the mobility of agents 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.200
 Versatile and light weight was the first vehicle that could be transported 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 by plane to the battlefield 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.550
 in the Second World War 700 thousand of them were built for their 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.550
 use in Europe and the Pacific 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.010
 On the 20th the team was one of the first vehicles to arrive 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.010
 the beaches for 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.080
 was a machine that gave the allies an advantage in every area of 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.080
 conflict throughout the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.220
 during the war he became so famous that even the Russian president the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.220
 amount in 1 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.810
 but perhaps the most famous person of all that of employment the seats of 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.200
 skin 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 it was the merlin erased 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.309
 the basic kit was adapted to many unusual and different shapes including 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:16.169
 this amphibious version 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.169
 later canceled because according to her 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.579
 for the next 40 years through the Korean wars and 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:29.910
 vietnam phillips 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.910
 it remained as a standard military transport vehicle 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.509
 in fact in 1984 everything
