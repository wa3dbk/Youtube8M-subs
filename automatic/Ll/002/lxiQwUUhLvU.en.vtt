00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:19.519
 Hello Moore Nine folks here are tips about 47 and get one more free for 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:25.300
 all played in Beijing of course in the 2 today times over time quite 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.359
 simply because the SGA is my favorite weapon and of course it 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.130
 a strong weapon 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.950
 the only thing left to life if you want to call it that is the feltes 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.660
 Klein Magazine 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.270
 say I think the SGA Red has only 20 shots in the magazine and then again 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.170
 with the extended magazine 30 so that really brings 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.020
 and years back I added the modified RAF mode 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.930
 the power plants Notes also not really good weapon Krad final fight to themselves 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.740
 Brain really well suited 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.250
 and snatches oily the skills Dexterity Hovercraft 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.560
 Round Manger pro 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.129
 meanwhile really mean 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.509
 Diack "I'd say standard acclaim is the top ten I've got this one 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.610
 few knowledge for me 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.049
 Percent dexterity 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.090
 op also man in close combat 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.530
 and also remotely because you can really get in faster as well as the app 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.580
 has seen that gives a really shoe-man seer 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.430
 because the reef fires in Andy two ponds and 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.380
 because honestly are not to the bay 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.190
 So there are also good times like two balls around from close range over 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.910
 gone when you have probably shot 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.680
 yes I just got used to it in mw2 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.940
 to move in with the weapon 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.680
 and then you have really precise 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.550
 who his balls to the opponent 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.660
 housed grumbling percent off FIFA so stays five hits 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.810
 Percent again Action Pro really helps the norm 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.080
 I must also say that Kühne Speaking of KGaA 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.430
 one has really big magazines now and again collects his blom 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.320
 Package only then new claim local edge to species and what else I know 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.990
 everything 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.990
 but honestly I do not do it all 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.369
 "I do not know, I do not usually have so many kids as Assistant Hanno 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.740
 Petersen Darabos as well as useful for me 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.580
 the custom I necessarily and now yes because they do not deduct or 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.889
 Burning come 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.039
 but I also rarely have to predict it now and therefore it does 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.560
 to me 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.279
 hardly any sense anyway 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:28.209
 and since we're in Modern Warfare 2, the box is now building on each other and 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.289
 Mandy had only lost five too 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.289
 from then on it is easy to follow the pursuer 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.399
 it is simply not recommended for me so Doll the percent 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:38.839
 in the a-sample 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.649
 Förg capture or that raiders per park 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:45.639
 and I just have the sustainability of Rome so well I should be back 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.639
 bit wizened owners wandered that wanted to address people 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:53.499
 around Bush Kratschmer number 4, all of their equipment and that's just fine 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:55.379
 of course the hand grenade 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.150
 or scan and content extra Nazareth 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.110
 To see the app, the club has it for all who see, I'll tell you anyway 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.259
 again that is refuse me in the soul on the 11th 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:05.320
 the Harrier 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.320
 of course on the 7th and Chief rescued rocket 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:10.579
 yes good 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.120
 So my topic is today 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.410
 very easily 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.350
 Today, every year, the assembly soul as it has developed and so 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.159
 continue 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.150
 So I really did 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.150
 In my youth, Sina say it now or 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:30.269
 from the noise of my product becoming aware of Gold Titi videos 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.189
 happy to see montages I was always thrilled to see such 04 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.969
 really the best of the multiplayer is now once all so 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:39.929
 combined music 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:42.659
 to see and that has always brought me fun 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.129
 and I have to say that suffered has really gone much further 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.389
 also develops the gameplay 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.859
 So one looked at Marmont harbor then Océ 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.209
 there were maybe some really cool kids with us 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.750
 Today, the mass shows there were many more people recording equipment and many 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:00.979
 People 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.419
 the kind just keep busy 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.459
 how does it make a montage 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.269
 or to make Tesch and around 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.799
 Dr the unit simply for this multi thesis with the weapons Nkufo Quiz and what 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.389
 there is still everything 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.549
 and at that time it was just a bit simpler knit because you have 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.150
 was happy and saw it as a conclusion 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.150
 so it was real or is a big difference from back then to today 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.069
 and then briefly to talk about today and Hagen 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.570
 So the file I do not know like me 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.409
 Kolmer always with a crying and a laughing eye 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.289
 Percent on to 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.450
 Yes I do not know 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.050
 So on the one hand I think the ard team is really really cool 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:47.060
 sometimes it is really too much for me then 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.580
 I do not know so you really have to recognize the GPR 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.509
 can 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.749
 and since both of them I have to say almost that one between 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.889
 after two months between and can distinguish colors for me there is 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.860
 two categories of montages 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.520
 once the ARD themes and rabbits 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.580
 which are mostly designed from Galicia and then the 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.030
 Gameplay montages 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.340
 where you can really ask me the hardest felt questions or draw 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.039
 can 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.999
 or rather, it becomes 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:18.219
 yes, yes 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:21.999
 "I do not know about the montages we really always have a lot I can do 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:23.349
 many Lobos 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.539
 So flow going on for me no question at all belong almost to it 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.659
 but this whole not because you recognize yet come the ten percent the 8 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.610
 I'm not the only one who sees it that way 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.740
 and I'm pretty sure some of you will see it differently 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.050
 some of you say is totally cool 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.050
 so many by broken and 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.139
 "Did not you see black and white then go back in the bunch 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.470
 I mean I did not understand anything against the contemplation and it 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.470
 is probably also a critical topic to speak Iran 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.479
 then everyone will have their own opinion but I just think so 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.389
 the 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.389
 yes that is sometimes too little 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.240
 enough and maybe 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.310
 is completely okay and sometimes even better than 4 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.160
 But I'm really interested in your opinion and that's one 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:14.979
 Today my greed question 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:15.870
 so what 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.870
 That's how you prefer to see montage 

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:20.990
 surprise 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.279
 beautiful reports them really cool is Eddie 10 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:25.870
 the best lighting effects 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.030
 Aldi Geissen 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.930
 wos and practice me there is still everything there 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.509
 or really mounting the 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.509
 I'll say school picks up moderately 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.879
 really 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:43.069
 Well, they are only vaccinate if they even find finds and rabbits 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.199
 but 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.850
 Dr, I do not know, so I'll just find that one again 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.860
 simple rescued yellow shiver 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.199
 Mondays simply a lot smaller are quite simple 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:57.199
 because you can focus more than it can on the kills and that's for me 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:00.389
 actually the meaning of one 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:03.080
 the shooter assembly factory last time 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.280
 very easily 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.600
 because you miss her the best moments from each game 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.639
 would like to do that and not necessarily 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:14.029
 So I think you should really differentiate normally into two categories 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:16.969
 once it's him montage 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:21.649
 or you have to look at the phone in the Telch Updike has that with Larry King 

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.999
 really on it and the bags you just have to cebit-themes 

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:26.039
 subscribe to 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:27.080
 Mainz 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.789
 both teams are so well I can look good and the design of the opponents too 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:32.139
 good for later life 

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:35.590
 continue if you start earlier to edit the indexes 

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:40.549
 and around 8, that's why I just think you're there 

00:07:40.549 --> 00:07:45.429
 But, as I said, things have to be different from what your favorite ones do 

00:07:45.429 --> 00:07:46.879
 Type of montages is 

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:50.099
 she goes over this Bartholdy Elite kra 

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:55.499
 Mounting or a tall sculpture and keeps Schmidt really cool PS and 

00:07:55.499 --> 00:07:58.819
 are in sum from Schalksmühle the comments the recent thumbs down 

00:07:58.819 --> 00:07:59.940
 above that he is very nice 

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.099
 and subscribes to natural and offenders and maybe Mike Hammer 

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:05.539
 So we'll see you first of all North Rhine show
