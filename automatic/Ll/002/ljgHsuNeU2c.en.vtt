00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
simple to more developed anyway we've

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.940 
simple to more developed anyway we've
got<00:01:09.090> some<00:01:09.390> basic<00:01:09.600> chords<00:01:10.080> here<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.799> are

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
got some basic chords here that are

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
so let's um do a little voicing

so let's um do a little voicing
preparation<00:01:17.850> before<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.330> dive<00:01:18.960> into<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
preparation before we dive into the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.490 
preparation before we dive into the
rhythmic<00:01:19.979> example<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.990> were<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> play<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
rhythmic example so if I were to play a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.130 
rhythmic example so if I were to play a
basic<00:01:22.860> G<00:01:23.729> major<00:01:24.000> triad<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.600> my<00:01:24.720> sound<00:01:24.960> like

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
basic G major triad in my sound like

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.240 
basic G major triad in my sound like
this

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.030 

now<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:32.000> obviously<00:01:32.240> is<00:01:32.840> simply<00:01:33.560> a<00:01:33.740> major

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
now that obviously is simply a major

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.550 
now that obviously is simply a major
chord<00:01:34.430> it<00:01:34.820> doesn't<00:01:35.180> become<00:01:35.479> dominant<00:01:35.990> until

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
chord it doesn't become dominant until

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.999 
chord it doesn't become dominant until

this there's a scale source that runs

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.640 
this there's a scale source that runs
through<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.090> known<00:02:17.540> as<00:02:17.720> G<00:02:18.110> mixolydian

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
through that known as G mixolydian

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.410 
through that known as G mixolydian
that's<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.400> modal<00:02:19.819> scale<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:25.239> mention<00:02:26.239> this

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
that's a modal scale I mention this

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.259 
that's a modal scale I mention this
because<00:02:26.739> going<00:02:27.739> back<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.040> my<00:02:28.220> last<00:02:28.700> voicing<00:02:29.180> on

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
because going back to my last voicing on

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.780 
because going back to my last voicing on
a<00:02:29.299> g7<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:30.350> can<00:02:30.739> actually<00:02:30.860> move<00:02:31.190> these<00:02:31.430> upper

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
a g7 I can actually move these upper

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.059 
a g7 I can actually move these upper
triads<00:02:32.239> around<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.810> little<00:02:33.049> bit<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.709> get<00:02:34.010> me

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
triads around a little bit to get me

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.759 
triads around a little bit to get me
some<00:02:34.430> motion<00:02:34.940> on<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.390> chord<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.930> still<00:02:36.500> stay

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
some motion on that chord and still stay

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.280 
some motion on that chord and still stay

within a mixolydian mode restriction

00:02:39.290 --> 00:03:01.539 
within a mixolydian mode restriction
overall<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.489> for<00:02:40.700> example<00:02:59.530> G<00:03:00.530> mixolydian<00:03:00.890> is

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
overall so for example G mixolydian is

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.660 
overall so for example G mixolydian is

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
static voice over a g7 but we make it a

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.180

triad embellishments so called and the
second<00:04:45.460> one<00:04:45.550> is<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:45.790> little<00:04:45.970> more<00:04:46.090> rhythmically

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
second one is a little more rhythmically

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.450 
second one is a little more rhythmically
involved<00:04:47.140> with<00:04:47.590> some<00:04:47.830> more<00:04:47.980> rhythmic

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
involved with some more rhythmic

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.370 
involved with some more rhythmic
subdivisions<00:04:49.120> let's<00:04:49.660> have<00:04:49.810> a<00:04:49.840> look<00:04:50.020> at<00:04:50.169> the

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
subdivisions let's have a look at the

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.700 
subdivisions let's have a look at the
first<00:04:51.120> one<00:04:52.120> here<00:04:52.150> here<00:04:52.750> we<00:04:52.840> go<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:53.470> I'll<00:04:53.560> give

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
first one here here we go and I'll give

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:18.580 
first one here here we go and I'll give
a<00:04:53.740> quick<00:04:53.919> count<00:04:54.250> of

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.219 

okay<00:05:19.590> so<00:05:20.189> that<00:05:20.460> was<00:05:20.550> fairly<00:05:20.729> straightforward

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
okay so that was fairly straightforward

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:35.779 
okay so that was fairly straightforward
straight<00:05:22.229> up<00:05:22.409> three<00:05:22.740> major<00:05:34.400> sort<00:05:35.400> of<00:05:35.460> implying

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
straight up three major sort of implying

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.629 
straight up three major sort of implying
a<00:05:35.939> g7<00:05:36.330> over<00:05:36.689> B<00:05:36.870> momentarily<00:05:37.439> we<00:05:38.250> went<00:05:38.430> to<00:05:38.610> a

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
a g7 over B momentarily we went to a

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:44.110 
a g7 over B momentarily we went to a
fairly<00:05:39.569> straightforward<00:05:39.960> voicing<00:05:40.650> for<00:05:40.800> a<00:05:40.830> c7

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:55.510 

but<00:05:45.120> then<00:05:45.240> on<00:05:45.389> the<00:05:45.419> f7<00:05:45.990> I<00:05:46.349> do<00:05:46.409> a<00:05:46.650> series<00:05:47.039> of
