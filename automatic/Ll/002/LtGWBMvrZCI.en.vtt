 greets you my hands novelty 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:17.609
 smartphone cassi hp 960 and 2x + food 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.890
 x plus it means that he has 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.130
 eight-core processor and not just 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.470
 take nuclear but also turbo it and 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.470
 operating at 2000 megahertz 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.510
 so perfect for him a little excursion 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:47.480
 So Russian Russian is here in 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.480
 firmware i.e. firmware multilanguage 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:56.460
 mouth right here they are also present 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.949
 factory firmware initially play 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.110
 market is supported and can be entered 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.280
 google account and many other accounts 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.830
 the only one was a little problem in 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.490
 only Chinese 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.979
 keyboard 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.010
 Well, install what additional 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:20.400
 Keyboards Russian did not make 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:23.790
 the problem is because the process of artur shit 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.320
 then this result is 30 to 1353 not 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.320
 maximum can also more 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.909
 show it depends on temperature 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.210
 processor how strong was it 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.210
 overloaded 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.400
 let's see information about 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.400
 device 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.030
 here we have 2000 hertz if you go for this 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.920
 ssylochku you can see what 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.690
 the state is now all eight 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.610
 nuclei as you can see at the moment they are all 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.409
 are in deep sleep and therefore 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.659
 we have no additional consumption but 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.450
 again say the best words 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.640
 to the processor itself that it is much 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.709
 more economical than their competitors percent 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.680
 by 40 on energy saving 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.690
 that is, all these eight cores 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.690
 very energy energy efficient 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.800
 Dads equipment sensors correctly 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:35.769
 say that this smartphone doesn't have 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:38.430
 there is no thermometer and barometer 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.430
 humidity sensor 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:53.060
 so he has two sim cards for them 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:56.060
 here and here the camera covers it 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.060
 wonderful 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.480
 so we put this smartphone together 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.480
 thank you five for attention
