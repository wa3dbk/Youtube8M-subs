steak I really don't get steak from
Mexican<00:00:48.719> food<00:00:48.870> restaurants<00:00:49.260> because<00:00:49.350> they

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
Mexican food restaurants because they

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.569 
Mexican food restaurants because they
overcook<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.219> seemed<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:50.550> right

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and I feel like it needs something like

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.729 
and I feel like it needs something like
that<00:00:53.190> maybe<00:00:54.030> some<00:00:54.329> sour<00:00:54.539> cream<00:00:54.660> would<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.620> good

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
that maybe some sour cream would be good

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.470 
that maybe some sour cream would be good
yeah<00:00:56.010> because<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.699> steak<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.300> cheese

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480
