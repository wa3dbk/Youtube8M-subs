of the same thing Muslim i think is in
in<00:01:35.000> danish<00:01:35.479> it's<00:01:35.720> it's<00:01:36.050> a<00:01:36.229> very<00:01:36.500> big<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:37.190> very

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
in danish it's it's a very big a very

in danish it's it's a very big a very
odd<00:01:37.760> creature<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:39.670> so<00:01:40.670> in<00:01:41.120> my<00:01:41.870> mind<00:01:41.900> what<00:01:42.530> we

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
odd creature and so in my mind what we

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.120 
odd creature and so in my mind what we
do<00:01:42.860> is<00:01:43.130> kind<00:01:43.580> of<00:01:43.729> monster<00:01:44.180> it's<00:01:45.170> we're<00:01:45.650> making

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
do is kind of monster it's we're making

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.520 
do is kind of monster it's we're making
odd<00:01:46.430> things<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:47.180> doesn't<00:01:47.780> really<00:01:47.930> fit<00:01:48.290> and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
odd things that doesn't really fit and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.760 
odd things that doesn't really fit and
has<00:01:49.030> different<00:01:50.030> layers<00:01:50.300> of<00:01:50.660> understanding<00:01:51.380> so

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
has different layers of understanding so

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.250 
has different layers of understanding so
it's<00:01:52.670> playground<00:01:53.390> but<00:01:53.630> it's<00:01:53.780> also<00:01:54.080> more

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260 

well<00:02:00.260> I<00:02:00.290> think<00:02:00.979> it's<00:02:01.310> very<00:02:01.460> important<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.150> us

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.580 
kids I think it's really good judges
actually<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:19.920> think<00:03:21.230> kids<00:03:22.230> would<00:03:22.379> like

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
actually I think kids would like

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.729 
actually I think kids would like
something<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.340> they<00:03:23.549> don't<00:03:23.819> really

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
something that they don't really

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.199 
something that they don't really
understand<00:03:25.739> as<00:03:26.099> a<00:03:26.159> beginning<00:03:26.700> but<00:03:27.319> if<00:03:28.319> they

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
understand as a beginning but if they

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.780 
understand as a beginning but if they
play<00:03:30.209> on<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.629> and<00:03:30.900> as<00:03:31.290> as<00:03:31.769> they<00:03:32.010> go<00:03:32.189> along<00:03:32.310> and

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
play on it and as as they go along and

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.660 
play on it and as as they go along and
they<00:03:33.329> get<00:03:33.569> to<00:03:33.720> know<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.680> understand

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
they get to know it and and understand

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.399 
they get to know it and and understand
it<00:03:35.790> during<00:03:36.689> time<00:03:36.989> it's<00:03:37.379> a<00:03:37.890> I<00:03:38.310> think<00:03:39.079> that's<00:03:40.079> our

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
it during time it's a I think that's our

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.470 
it during time it's a I think that's our
that's<00:03:40.920> good<00:03:41.700> gold<00:03:42.000> force

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.510
