00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
where to cut the perforation here that

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.350 
where to cut the perforation here that
was<00:01:43.200> attached<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.549> spiral<00:01:45.060> here

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
was attached to the to the spiral here

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.289 
was attached to the to the spiral here
off<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.899> also<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.920> bottom<00:01:47.369> being<00:01:47.520> curved<00:01:48.000> I

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
off and also this bottom being curved I

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.960 
off and also this bottom being curved I
don't<00:01:48.540> use<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.409> either<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> first<00:01:50.820> thing

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
don't use this either so the first thing

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.130 
don't use this either so the first thing
you<00:01:51.060> want<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.540> now<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.840> don't<00:01:51.990> have

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
you want to do is now if you don't have

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.679 
you want to do is now if you don't have
scissors<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.189> fold<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.610> over<00:01:53.880> crease

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
scissors you can fold this over crease

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.389 
scissors you can fold this over crease
it<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.170> rip<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.799> should<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.189> just

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
it and then rip it and it should be just

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.789 
it and then rip it and it should be just
fine<00:01:56.640> I've<00:01:57.450> done<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.780> before<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.350> course<00:01:58.380> it's

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
fine I've done it before of course it's

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.530 
fine I've done it before of course it's
not<00:01:58.950> quite<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.340> pretty<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.030> I'm<00:02:00.090> gonna<00:02:00.240> cut

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
not quite as pretty so I'm gonna cut

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.249 
not quite as pretty so I'm gonna cut
along<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.110> line<00:02:01.439> here<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:03.060> that's<00:02:03.329> perfect

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
along this line here so that's perfect

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.020 
along this line here so that's perfect
straight<00:02:04.680> line<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.310> now<00:02:05.490> what<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.700> want<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.939> do

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
straight line and now what I want to do

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.969 
straight line and now what I want to do
is<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.180> want<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.360> make<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.780> square<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.680> take

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
is I want to make this square so I take

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.609 
is I want to make this square so I take
this<00:02:08.250> edge<00:02:08.729> here<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.330> just<00:02:09.360> cut<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.080> I

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
this edge here that I just cut and I

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.910 
this edge here that I just cut and I
bring<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.979> down

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
bring it down

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.550 
bring it down
here<00:02:13.920> along<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.550> edge<00:02:14.790> now<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:16.110> tells<00:02:16.410> me

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
here along this edge now this tells me

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.630 
here along this edge now this tells me
where<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.370> need<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.150> cut<00:02:18.450> along<00:02:18.810> here<00:02:19.140> like<00:02:21.230> that

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
where I need to cut along here like that

to make this triangle which gives me a

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.210 
to make this triangle which gives me a
perfect<00:02:26.790> square<00:02:27.150> piece<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.480> paper<00:02:27.690> okay<00:02:28.349> now

slides down in there like that and then

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.140 
slides down in there like that and then
you<00:03:28.410> crease<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.130> there's<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.850> little

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
you crease it and there's a little

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.599 
you crease it and there's a little
origami<00:03:30.709> envelope<00:03:31.709> if<00:03:31.859> you<00:03:31.980> take<00:03:32.160> this<00:03:32.310> top

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
origami envelope if you take this top

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.699 
origami envelope if you take this top
one<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.090> pull<00:03:33.780> it<00:03:33.900> down<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.380> can<00:03:34.530> put

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
one and pull it down and you can put

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.500 
one and pull it down and you can put
your<00:03:34.829> seeds<00:03:35.069> inside<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.640> here<00:03:35.760> like<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:36.209> and

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
your seeds inside of here like that and

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.500 
your seeds inside of here like that and
then<00:03:37.319> this<00:03:37.590> one<00:03:37.650> here<00:03:38.190> goes<00:03:38.250> down<00:03:38.760> inside<00:03:39.359> of

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
then this one here goes down inside of

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.960 
then this one here goes down inside of
there<00:03:39.660> also<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.410> then<00:03:41.100> once<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.549> put<00:03:41.819> your

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
there also and then once you put your

of tape with me you don't have to have
tape<00:03:51.690> but<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.410> don't<00:03:52.769> trust<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.459> you<00:03:53.639> know

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
tape but I don't trust this you know

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.160 
tape but I don't trust this you know
this<00:03:53.850> could<00:03:54.060> get<00:03:54.239> caught<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.810> could<00:03:54.959> pull

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
this could get caught and it could pull

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.620 
this could get caught and it could pull
out<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:56.010> know<00:03:56.130> with<00:03:56.280> origami<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:57.329> you<00:03:57.510> know

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
out and I know with origami it you know

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.870 
out and I know with origami it you know
using<00:03:58.019> tape<00:03:58.350> is<00:03:58.500> against<00:03:58.709> rules<00:03:59.010> but<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.519> always

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
using tape is against rules but I always

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.550 
using tape is against rules but I always
take<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.090> little<00:04:00.329> piece<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.690> tape<00:04:00.870> if<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.139> have<00:04:01.380> it

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
take a little piece of tape if I have it

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.599 
take a little piece of tape if I have it
and<00:04:01.709> then<00:04:02.519> just<00:04:02.760> tape<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.410> outer<00:04:04.410> piece<00:04:05.069> down

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
and then just tape that outer piece down

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.590 
and then just tape that outer piece down
that<00:04:06.420> way<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.750> won't<00:04:06.989> pull<00:04:07.200> out<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:08.600> there's

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
that way it won't pull out and there's

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.599 
that way it won't pull out and there's
my<00:04:09.810> little<00:04:09.989> envelope<00:04:10.440> now<00:04:10.889> it<00:04:11.040> doesn't<00:04:11.340> hold<00:04:11.430> a

them in this I use this just for
transportation<00:04:32.069> and<00:04:32.250> you<00:04:32.639> throw<00:04:32.849> a<00:04:32.879> bunch<00:04:33.060> of

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
transportation and you throw a bunch of

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.730 
transportation and you throw a bunch of
these<00:04:33.300> in<00:04:33.419> your<00:04:33.509> pocket<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.169> seats<00:04:34.409> stand

these in your pocket and the seats stand
there<00:04:34.979> fairly<00:04:35.219> well<00:04:35.550> so<00:04:36.439> of<00:04:37.439> course<00:04:37.590> when<00:04:37.800> I

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
there fairly well so of course when I

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.070 
there fairly well so of course when I
get<00:04:38.039> back<00:04:38.219> I<00:04:38.250> use<00:04:38.580> regular<00:04:39.120> seat<00:04:39.629> envelopes

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
get back I use regular seat envelopes

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.990 
get back I use regular seat envelopes
larger<00:04:40.500> ones<00:04:40.680> because<00:04:41.009> this<00:04:41.189> is<00:04:41.340> really<00:04:41.550> small

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
larger ones because this is really small

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.390 
larger ones because this is really small
hard<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.419> see<00:04:42.599> and<00:04:42.870> it's<00:04:43.289> these<00:04:43.620> are<00:04:43.680> hard<00:04:44.129> to

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
hard to see and it's these are hard to

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.149 
hard to see and it's these are hard to
take<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.419> categorize<00:04:45.960> or<00:04:46.139> to<00:04:46.289> kind<00:04:46.770> of<00:04:46.889> put<00:04:47.069> in

origami seed packet and just these here
are<00:05:10.770> really<00:05:11.430> inexpensive<00:05:11.819> I<00:05:12.210> picked<00:05:12.479> this<00:05:12.659> I

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
are really inexpensive I picked this I
