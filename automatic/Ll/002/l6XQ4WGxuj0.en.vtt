is brand new has like 52 miles on it

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.940 
is brand new has like 52 miles on it
since<00:03:07.269> I've<00:03:07.420> driven<00:03:07.569> it<00:03:10.920> turn<00:03:11.920> off

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
since I've driven it turn off

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.490 
since I've driven it turn off
unnecessary<00:03:12.660> electrical<00:03:13.660> accessories<00:03:13.959> such

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
unnecessary electrical accessories such

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.160 
unnecessary electrical accessories such
as<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.709> seat<00:03:15.069> heaters<00:03:15.430> or<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.730> radio<00:03:16.170> driving

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
as the seat heaters or the radio driving

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.650 
as the seat heaters or the radio driving
the<00:03:17.290> vehicle<00:03:17.709> will<00:03:17.860> recharge<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.610> battery<00:03:18.970> if

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
the vehicle will recharge the battery if

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.420 
the vehicle will recharge the battery if
the<00:03:19.959> message<00:03:20.350> remains<00:03:20.530> on<00:03:21.010> for<00:03:21.250> an<00:03:21.310> extended

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
the message remains on for an extended

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.210 
the message remains on for an extended
period<00:03:22.330> of<00:03:22.420> time<00:03:23.430> have<00:03:24.430> your<00:03:24.610> battery<00:03:24.819> check

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
period of time have your battery check

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.800 
period of time have your battery check
so<00:03:27.220> I'm<00:03:27.580> assuming<00:03:27.819> because<00:03:28.060> it's<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.450> new<00:03:28.569> car

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
so I'm assuming because it's a new car

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.000 
so I'm assuming because it's a new car
hasn't<00:03:29.110> had<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.260> chance<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.650> charge<00:03:29.890> the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
hasn't had a chance to charge the

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.220 
hasn't had a chance to charge the
battery<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:30.870> that's<00:03:31.870> probably<00:03:33.780> okay<00:03:34.780> curious

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
battery so that's probably okay curious

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.870 
battery so that's probably okay curious
it's<00:03:35.440> actually<00:03:35.769> watching<00:03:36.100> everything<00:03:36.610> it's

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
it's actually watching everything it's

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.220 
it's actually watching everything it's
kind<00:03:37.090> of<00:03:37.120> nice<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.330> have<00:03:37.390> that<00:03:37.480> diagnostic<00:03:37.900> I

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
kind of nice to have that diagnostic I

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.630 
kind of nice to have that diagnostic I
guess<00:03:38.440> but<00:03:38.680> everything<00:03:39.070> on<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.340> thing<00:03:39.519> is

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
guess but everything on this thing is

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.660 
guess but everything on this thing is
pretty<00:03:40.120> sophisticated<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:42.010> cool<00:03:42.250> thing<00:03:42.430> is<00:03:42.459> I

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
pretty sophisticated the cool thing is I

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.509 
pretty sophisticated the cool thing is I
can<00:03:42.700> turn<00:03:43.000> off<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.209> climate<00:03:43.840> controls<00:03:44.519> here

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
can turn off the climate controls here

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.900 
can turn off the climate controls here
and<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.420> panel<00:03:46.780> should<00:03:46.810> go<00:03:47.140> dark<00:03:47.910> probably

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
and the panel should go dark probably

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.160 
and the panel should go dark probably
shut<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.239> car<00:03:49.420> off<00:03:49.570> I<00:03:49.750> press<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.350> volume<00:03:53.579> up

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
shut the car off I press the volume up

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:07.590 
shut the car off I press the volume up

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
suppose I don't know I just don't see

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.870 
suppose I don't know I just don't see
the<00:04:14.590> advantage<00:04:14.980> of<00:04:15.070> this<00:04:15.220> over<00:04:15.519> a<00:04:15.549> traditional

poor rear visibility split up with that
split<00:04:26.289> window<00:04:26.530> design<00:04:27.010> I'm<00:04:27.190> not<00:04:27.280> too<00:04:27.400> crazy

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
split window design I'm not too crazy

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.210 
split window design I'm not too crazy
about<00:04:27.760> that<00:04:27.910> either<00:04:28.240> so<00:04:29.229> for<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.890> same<00:04:30.039> money

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
about that either so for the same money

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.950 
about that either so for the same money
I'd<00:04:30.400> probably<00:04:30.580> just<00:04:30.789> get<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.030> MDX<00:04:31.450> to<00:04:31.660> be<00:04:31.750> done

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
I'd probably just get the MDX to be done

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.740 
I'd probably just get the MDX to be done
or<00:04:32.500> else<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.800> be<00:04:32.860> more<00:04:33.010> practical<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:33.720> get<00:04:34.720> a

this is our after MDX it's got

although<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:02.630> actually<00:05:03.630> like<00:05:04.050> this

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
although the I actually like this

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.840 
although the I actually like this
navigation<00:05:04.590> system<00:05:05.010> better<00:05:05.160> because<00:05:05.580> it's<00:05:05.760> a

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
navigation system better because it's a

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.310 
navigation system better because it's a
bit<00:05:06.000> more<00:05:06.150> straightforward<00:05:06.720> to<00:05:06.750> use

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
bit more straightforward to use

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.730 
bit more straightforward to use

and it's touchscreen the other car I'd

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:30.460 
and it's touchscreen the other car I'd
kind<00:05:10.980> of<00:05:11.010> like<00:05:11.160> a<00:05:11.190> BMW<00:05:11.490> style<00:05:12.090> I<00:05:12.300> Drive<00:05:28.430> and

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
kind of like a BMW style I Drive and

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.500 
kind of like a BMW style I Drive and
stuff<00:05:31.470> so<00:05:31.970> I'm<00:05:32.970> not<00:05:33.090> going<00:05:33.210> to<00:05:33.300> show<00:05:33.390> you<00:05:33.450> the
