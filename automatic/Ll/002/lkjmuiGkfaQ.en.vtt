circles up with a juggernaut machine

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.540 
circles up with a juggernaut machine
again<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.690> this<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:56.110> pretty<00:02:56.920> much<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.190> bones

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
again and this is pretty much the bones

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.210 
again and this is pretty much the bones
of<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.940> strategy<00:02:58.420> one<00:02:59.260> tip<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.680> would<00:02:59.890> give<00:03:00.100> you

of the strategy one tip I would give you
is<00:03:00.400> do<00:03:00.670> not<00:03:00.850> stall<00:03:01.360> in<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.750> long<00:03:02.140> corridor

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
is do not stall in the long corridor

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.890 
is do not stall in the long corridor
between<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:03.610> know<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.060> electric<00:03:04.420> fence<00:03:04.600> and

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
between you know the electric fence and

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.140 
between you know the electric fence and
the<00:03:05.020> drug<00:03:05.200> rap<00:03:05.410> machine<00:03:05.710> as<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.610> can<00:03:06.910> get

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
the drug rap machine as you can get

and<00:03:39.220> repeat<00:03:39.520> and<00:03:39.700> repeat<00:03:40.120> now<00:03:41.020> if<00:03:41.230> you<00:03:41.350> do<00:03:41.500> get

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
and repeat and repeat now if you do get

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.560 
and repeat and repeat now if you do get
stocking<00:03:42.130> up<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.370> corridor<00:03:42.700> there<00:03:43.030> are<00:03:43.239> a<00:03:43.270> few

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
stocking up the corridor there are a few

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.500 
stocking up the corridor there are a few
alternative<00:03:44.320> paths<00:03:44.620> like<00:03:45.459> you<00:03:45.580> can<00:03:45.790> turn<00:03:46.330> on

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
alternative paths like you can turn on

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.660 
alternative paths like you can turn on
the<00:03:46.630> electric<00:03:46.780> fence<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.560> before<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:48.489> come

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
the electric fence and before you come

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.120 
the electric fence and before you come
to<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:48.910> long<00:03:49.090> corridor<00:03:49.420> area<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.739> can<00:03:50.920> go<00:03:51.070> to

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
to the long corridor area you can go to

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.470 
to the long corridor area you can go to
the<00:03:51.840> teleporter<00:03:52.840> by<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.459> mp40<00:03:54.459> you<00:03:55.090> know<00:03:55.209> just

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
the teleporter by the mp40 you know just

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.190 
the teleporter by the mp40 you know just
to<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:55.720> left<00:03:55.750> our<00:03:57.570> eyeball<00:03:58.570> comes<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:59.020> wall

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
to the left our eyeball comes to wall

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.860 
to the left our eyeball comes to wall
you<00:03:59.470> can<00:03:59.590> run<00:03:59.830> straight<00:04:00.459> up<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.760> middle<00:04:00.940> you

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
you can run straight up the middle you

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.710 
you can run straight up the middle you
know<00:04:01.989> pass<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.590> sleight-of-hand<00:04:03.400> machine<00:04:04.000> so

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
know pass the sleight-of-hand machine so

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.540 
know pass the sleight-of-hand machine so
there<00:04:05.200> are<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.410> few<00:04:05.620> ways<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:05.890> get<00:04:06.190> out<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.370> a

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
there are a few ways to get out of a

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.850 
there are a few ways to get out of a
sticky<00:04:06.730> situation<00:04:07.080> but<00:04:08.080> I<00:04:08.110> would<00:04:08.470> recommend

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
sticky situation but I would recommend

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.100 
sticky situation but I would recommend
that<00:04:09.070> you<00:04:09.340> try<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.300> stick<00:04:10.600> to<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.900> long

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
that you try and stick to the long

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.380 
that you try and stick to the long
corridor<00:04:11.440> area<00:04:11.890> as<00:04:12.250> you<00:04:12.820> can<00:04:12.940> get<00:04:13.090> up<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.300> the

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
corridor area as you can get up to the

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.600 
corridor area as you can get up to the
double<00:04:13.660> cap<00:04:13.810> machine<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:14.350> it<00:04:14.560> kind<00:04:15.550> of

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
double cap machine and it kind of

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.970 
double cap machine and it kind of
concentrates<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.480> zombies<00:04:16.989> into<00:04:17.380> one<00:04:17.620> area

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
concentrates the zombies into one area

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.590 
concentrates the zombies into one area
where<00:04:18.310> you<00:04:18.370> can<00:04:18.520> just<00:04:18.549> flame<00:04:18.940> for<00:04:19.270> them<00:04:19.450> and

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
where you can just flame for them and

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.160 
where you can just flame for them and
it's<00:04:20.169> very<00:04:20.530> effective<00:04:20.859> now

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
it's very effective now

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.050 
it's very effective now
one<00:04:23.170> last<00:04:23.410> tip<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.800> will<00:04:23.980> give<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.370> is<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:24.850> do

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
one last tip I will give you is you do

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.260 
one last tip I will give you is you do
not<00:04:25.510> under<00:04:25.990> any<00:04:26.110> circumstances<00:04:26.640> open<00:04:27.640> the

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
not under any circumstances open the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.020 
not under any circumstances open the
kind<00:04:28.510> of<00:04:28.570> factory<00:04:29.140> area<00:04:29.380> because<00:04:30.370> if<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.670> open

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
kind of factory area because if you open

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.270 
kind of factory area because if you open
the<00:04:31.120> stairs<00:04:31.420> in<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.690> factory<00:04:32.080> area<00:04:32.320> they<00:04:32.950> will

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
the stairs in the factory area they will

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.850 
the stairs in the factory area they will
spawn<00:04:33.700> behind<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:34.540> by<00:04:35.290> a<00:04:35.320> spawn<00:04:35.710> behind

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
spawn behind you and by a spawn behind

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.890 
spawn behind you and by a spawn behind
you<00:04:36.100> I<00:04:36.130> mean<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.880> teleport<00:04:37.360> area<00:04:37.690> behind

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
you I mean in the teleport area behind

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.700 
you I mean in the teleport area behind
the<00:04:38.610> double<00:04:39.610> tap<00:04:39.760> machine<00:04:40.090> so<00:04:40.990> if<00:04:41.350> you<00:04:41.530> leave

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
the double tap machine so if you leave

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.310 
the double tap machine so if you leave
that<00:04:41.950> stairs<00:04:42.310> closed<00:04:42.730> they<00:04:43.540> will<00:04:43.720> not<00:04:43.900> spawn

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
that stairs closed they will not spawn

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.230 
that stairs closed they will not spawn
behind<00:04:44.500> you<00:04:44.890> another<00:04:45.460> thing<00:04:45.730> I<00:04:45.850> would<00:04:46.030> suggest

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
behind you another thing I would suggest

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.750 
behind you another thing I would suggest
is<00:04:46.570> that<00:04:46.600> you<00:04:46.810> do<00:04:47.080> not<00:04:47.260> use<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:48.040> rig<00:04:48.370> on<00:04:48.580> too

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
is that you do not use the rig on too

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.340 
is that you do not use the rig on too
much<00:04:48.970> because<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.540> is<00:04:49.600> not<00:04:49.840> very<00:04:49.870> good<00:04:50.200> for

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
much because it is not very good for

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.950 
much because it is not very good for
points<00:04:50.890> if<00:04:51.310> you<00:04:51.430> use<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:51.610> flames<00:04:52.030> or<00:04:52.330> you<00:04:52.780> will

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
points if you use the flames or you will

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.750 
points if you use the flames or you will
gather<00:04:53.170> up<00:04:53.380> those<00:04:53.530> points<00:04:53.980> much<00:04:54.220> faster

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
gather up those points much faster

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.000 
gather up those points much faster
because<00:04:54.970> I<00:04:55.300> zeno<00:04:55.660> teleport<00:04:56.380> in<00:04:56.530> and<00:04:56.650> turn<00:04:56.860> on

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
because I zeno teleport in and turn on

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.760 
because I zeno teleport in and turn on
fences<00:04:57.430> costs<00:04:57.669> a<00:04:57.910> lot<00:04:58.120> of<00:04:58.300> points<00:04:58.720> to<00:04:59.320> really

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
fences costs a lot of points to really

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.800 
fences costs a lot of points to really
need<00:04:59.950> to<00:04:59.980> conserve<00:05:00.669> your<00:05:01.180> points<00:05:01.630> basically

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
need to conserve your points basically

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.620 
need to conserve your points basically
if<00:05:02.380> you<00:05:03.250> do<00:05:03.460> have<00:05:03.700> any<00:05:03.820> trouble<00:05:04.300> getting<00:05:04.330> these

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
if you do have any trouble getting these

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.960 
if you do have any trouble getting these
guns<00:05:04.930> at<00:05:05.140> the<00:05:05.230> start<00:05:05.500> what<00:05:05.919> you<00:05:06.070> can<00:05:06.370> do<00:05:06.640> and

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
guns at the start what you can do and

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.780 
guns at the start what you can do and
it's<00:05:07.720> equally<00:05:08.500> as<00:05:08.680> effective<00:05:08.890> up<00:05:09.490> until

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
it's equally as effective up until

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.560 
it's equally as effective up until
around<00:05:09.880> Rome<00:05:10.419> 20<00:05:11.020> again<00:05:11.320> it<00:05:11.590> just<00:05:12.100> use<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.880> SCG

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
around Rome 20 again it just use the SCG

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.930 
around Rome 20 again it just use the SCG
and<00:05:13.870> keep<00:05:14.650> doing<00:05:14.950> the<00:05:15.070> same<00:05:15.100> thing<00:05:15.580> over<00:05:15.730> and

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
and keep doing the same thing over and

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.810 
and keep doing the same thing over and
over<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.900> only<00:05:17.290> thing<00:05:17.470> that<00:05:17.650> you<00:05:17.800> will<00:05:18.130> get

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
over the only thing that you will get

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.990 
over the only thing that you will get
caught<00:05:19.180> what<00:05:19.390> eventually<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:20.140> the<00:05:20.350> ammo<00:05:20.530> as<00:05:21.010> it

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
caught what eventually is the ammo as it

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.520 
caught what eventually is the ammo as it
only<00:05:22.150> has<00:05:22.330> a<00:05:22.360> certain<00:05:22.660> amount<00:05:22.840> of<00:05:23.020> ammo<00:05:23.200> and

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
only has a certain amount of ammo and

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.470 
only has a certain amount of ammo and
there<00:05:23.770> are<00:05:23.980> lots<00:05:24.130> and<00:05:24.430> lots<00:05:24.640> of<00:05:24.760> zombies<00:05:24.940> so

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
there are lots and lots of zombies so

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.600 
there are lots and lots of zombies so
you<00:05:26.290> have<00:05:26.440> to<00:05:26.590> keep<00:05:26.770> that<00:05:27.010> money<00:05:27.280> when<00:05:27.490> you're

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
you have to keep that money when you're

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.700 
you have to keep that money when you're
spending<00:05:27.970> the<00:05:28.000> points<00:05:28.510> on<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:28.720> electric

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
spending the points on the electric
