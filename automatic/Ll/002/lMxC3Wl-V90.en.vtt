00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.110 
so I bought this um main trimmer and
dinner<00:02:12.900> because<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:14.010> have<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.490> have<00:02:14.580> them<00:02:14.970> a

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
dinner because I have it I have them a

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.980 
dinner because I have it I have them a
polling<00:02:15.569> comb<00:02:16.400> but<00:02:17.400> like<00:02:18.300> some<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.840> horses

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
polling comb but like some of the horses

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.110 
polling comb but like some of the horses
at<00:02:19.290> my<00:02:19.380> barn<00:02:19.590> don't<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:20.940> my

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
at my barn don't like it and so my

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.490 
at my barn don't like it and so my
trainer<00:02:21.360> when<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.750> went<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.050> clinic<00:02:22.200> there

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
trainer when I went to a clinic there

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.960 
trainer when I went to a clinic there
she<00:02:22.770> recommend<00:02:23.190> getting<00:02:23.340> one<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.670> these<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:25.140> um

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
she recommend getting one of these so um

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.940 
she recommend getting one of these so um
so<00:02:26.970> basically<00:02:27.000> how<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.660> works<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.200> over<00:02:28.680> here

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
so basically how this works is over here

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.430 
so basically how this works is over here
it<00:02:29.070> goes<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.730> leg-up<00:02:30.330> comb<00:02:30.750> file<00:02:31.140> and

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
it goes on like a leg-up comb file and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.130 
it goes on like a leg-up comb file and
then<00:02:31.980> over<00:02:32.459> here<00:02:32.490> on<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.880> side<00:02:32.940> there's<00:02:33.780> kind

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
then over here on this side there's kind

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.630 
then over here on this side there's kind
of<00:02:34.170> like<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.530> blade<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.250> between<00:02:35.520> these

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
of like this blade in between these

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.660 
of like this blade in between these
combs<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.209> you've<00:02:36.660> uses<00:02:37.140> exactly<00:02:37.670> exactly

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
combs and you've uses exactly exactly

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.120 
combs and you've uses exactly exactly
how<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.060> would<00:02:39.239> use<00:02:39.330> pulling<00:02:40.020> cone<00:02:40.200> except

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
how you would use pulling cone except

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.830 
how you would use pulling cone except
instead<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.730> like<00:02:41.850> pulling<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.570> hair<00:02:42.750> from

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
instead of like pulling the hair from

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.390 
instead of like pulling the hair from
its<00:02:43.020> roots<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.470> would<00:02:43.620> kind<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.830> like<00:02:43.950> cut<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.370> a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
its roots it would kind of like cut it a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.509 
its roots it would kind of like cut it a
little<00:02:44.520> bit<00:02:44.850> on<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.810> blade<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.980> seriously

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
little bit on the blade and I seriously

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.250 
little bit on the blade and I seriously
recommend<00:02:47.700> these<00:02:48.120> getting<00:02:48.810> these<00:02:48.959> three

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
recommend these getting these three

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.259 
recommend these getting these three
horse<00:02:49.470> doesn't<00:02:49.709> like<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.190> cooling<00:02:50.610> home<00:02:50.790> or

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
horse doesn't like the cooling home or

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.570 
horse doesn't like the cooling home or
like<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.320> wouldn't<00:02:52.650> recommend<00:02:52.860> I'm<00:02:53.250> just

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
like I wouldn't recommend I'm just

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.560 
like I wouldn't recommend I'm just
cutting<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.090> straight<00:02:54.390> across<00:02:54.600> because<00:02:56.570> it

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
cutting it straight across because it

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.690 
cutting it straight across because it
makes<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.050> harder<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.709> braid<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.340> message

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
makes it harder to braid the message

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.280 
makes it harder to braid the message
like<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.060> horses<00:03:00.390> my<00:03:00.690> name's<00:03:00.840> really<00:03:01.140> long

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
like the horses my name's really long

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.710 
like the horses my name's really long
