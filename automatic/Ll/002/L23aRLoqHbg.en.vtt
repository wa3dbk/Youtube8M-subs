00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.540
 the fonts today we end up 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.860
 bigger bodies of the ex because that has 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.269
 been a lot of people and legs 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.500
 it's often a muscle that people 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.420
 careless is yet one of the most 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.470
 important why because it's the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.150
 must he produce his first 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.130
 more festo so it's good for 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.779
 the whole body for success for the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.930
 question it's a bit the bump the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.289
 construction of the degueuli sculptor in 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.330
 more tests at the beginning I had the ex 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.949
 opr it makes a difference so 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.660
 neglect for people the boys that's 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.180
 left early for warm up so 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.370
 we make 2,500 m2 of average carpets 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.020
 intensity then built on 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.820
 squares or what the headdresses simply 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.770
 because it encompasses most of 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.850
 dirty people and warms up a very good 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.829
 nervous market than the other exercises 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.210
 of legs so savor as much the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.160
 initial hairstyles so that's why 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.559
 we advise you to start your 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.850
 records of legs with squats or 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.559
 just for the squats we go with 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.510
 four sets of 8 to 10 repetitions 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.609
 then let's go for llech more 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.620
 the most classy and an exercise that your 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.210
 and all the people a little bit more 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.500
 quads anyway you're not especially if 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.060
 proof that you are trying to actress 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 wanted any price see which point you 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.420
 can put a lot on this exercise 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.560
 the problem-free for the reader is 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.100
 the same as for squats on there 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.540
 goes with 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.200
 four sets of eight to ten criteria 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.640
 young people with the extensions a being 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.130
 human who works a lot a lot 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.200
 the quads 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.630
 - to skate definitely kimmel who 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.820
 burns me yesterday's highest so for 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.829
 this exercise we go with three series 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.090
 from eight to ten repetitions including six 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.710
 strangers quickly and that they were at 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.020
 short energy is sluggish at times 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.729
 max happened something they go 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.929
 really betrayed the quads a disagreement 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.820
 that's what will ask the most 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.409
 of energy in my opinion me if that which me 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.390
 hurts the most people because I 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.250
 meaning like that so then we go there 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.340
 with milk heart we will make super 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.840
 7 with molars so the same lakers 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.490
 thing all the time in the same 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.619
 fork that we want to keep so four 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.119
 sets of 8 to 10 repetitions that you 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.380
 go superficial crack so keep 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.689
 you energy but you experience at 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.549
 maximum for the reader we will go there 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.899
 with calves for the same wheels 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.539
 thing at the threshold and so we go 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.189
 with case for good strength is against 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.750
 at the level of the repetitions the calves on 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.099
 can go with a little later mu who 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.259
 want to recover fast enough so 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.750
 we can go small 15 repetition 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.670
 So that's it for direct curling 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.390
 is not so much to do at least one 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.060
 times per week 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.370
 if you are able enough motivated to go 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.019
 0-2 concerning his canton he says at 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.310
 very important beginning that will generate 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.329
 a lot of room to stÃ©phane do not hesitate 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.190
 not to do the longest anymore 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.600
 easy people of fun that is high 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.519
 of the bridge that the child was alive that's 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.230
 to say yes at first if it's louis 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.519
 also as in China the next day but 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.750
 if paula because you'll see that at 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.910
 over time you will take a liking to 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.620
 to make people you go better you 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.850
 told what to back up your course is 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.880
 really a big motivator 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.319
 I find before the progression to 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.239
 leg level that well laughed he 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.980
 shine eventually fly off in full 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.989
 believe me you 're happy to arrive 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.299
 the gene sry example and effect especially at 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.739
 put the family exercise from strong to 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.299
 ends too much to four repetitions of 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.900
 squats I was a lot more than 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.160
 usually 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.389
 that 's what gave me and who gave me 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.920
 restored taste makes the train 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.150
 legs do not hesitate go to the maximum 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.920
 from time to time with six legs 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.049
 officers like the Belgian everything while 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.819
 motivating then the squats believe - yes we 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.170
 can find pleasure in times and 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.760
