we get down to provide first corner and

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.270 
we get down to provide first corner and
it's<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.199> long<00:01:04.350> race<00:01:04.500> too<00:01:04.739> isn't<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> yeah

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
it's a long race too isn't it yeah

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.190 
it's a long race too isn't it yeah
exactly<00:01:05.479> I've<00:01:06.479> had<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.630> few<00:01:06.869> years<00:01:07.110> of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
exactly I've had a few years of

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.600 
exactly I've had a few years of
experience<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.680> long<00:01:07.890> races<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.400> looking

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
experience in long races and looking

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.190 
experience in long races and looking
after<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> tires<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> think<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.780> should<00:01:09.810> know

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
after the tires so I think I should know

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.020 
after the tires so I think I should know
when<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.920> push<00:01:11.189> him<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.640> too<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:11.970> it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
when to push him and not too so it

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.190 
when to push him and not too so it
should<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:12.210> good<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.780> you've<00:01:12.900> had<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.049> little

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
should be good and you've had a little

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.080

bit<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.380> experience<00:01:13.770> here<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.400> think<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.970> work

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
bit of experience here I think it work

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.280 
bit of experience here I think it work
and<00:01:15.240> still<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.540> having<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.840> yeah<00:01:16.080> I've<00:01:16.170> had<00:01:16.229> a
