00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.240
Lateral transfibular ankle fusion is an open
surgical procedure that fuses, or joins, the

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.170
ankle bones together.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.030
The ankle is the joint that connects the leg
and the foot.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:38.730
The ankle joint includes the two lower leg
bones, called the tibia and the fibula, and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.690
the ankle bone, called the talus.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.269
Together the ends of the tibia and the fibula
create a mortis, or slot, for the talus which

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.449
forms the bottom of the ankle joint.

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.170
Tissues called ligaments and tendons support
the ankle bones.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.270
Ligaments attach bones to bones, and tendons
attach muscles to bones.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.159
The ankle joint allows the foot to move up
and down.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.299
Articular cartilage on the ends of bones is
a smooth gliding covering that allows fluid

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.240
joint movement.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.119
Ankle fusion, also known as arthrodesis, is
a surgical procedure that joins the ankle

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.840
bones together so they no longer move or rub
against each other.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.430
Doctors may recommend this procedure for conditions
that lead to severe ankle joint damage and

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.179
pain.

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:49.130
The most common condition is osteoarthritis,
also known as degenerative joint disease.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.130
In the late stage of osteoarthritis cartilage
covering the ends of the bones has worn away

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.140
exposing bare bone.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.009
This, along with the growth of boney projections
called bone spurs, causes swelling, pain,

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.970
and limited movement of the joints.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.900
Another condition that may require ankle fusion
is rheumatoid arthritis, where the patientâ€™s

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.730
own immune system attacks the joints.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.769
Any condition that destroys the joint surface,
such as a severe bone infection or death of

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:35.400
bone tissue also known as osteonecrosis, may
also require fusion of the ankle joint.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.909
The procedure will begin with an incision
on the outer, or lateral, side of the ankle.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.750
Next, the surgeon will remove the bottom part
of the fibula.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.350
This will allow the surgeon to see the tibia
and the talus bones of the ankle joint.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.580
Cartilage and damaged bone will be removed
from the bottom surface of the tibia.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.870
This will also be done to the top surface
of the talus.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.739
Then, two or three metal guide pins will be
placed through the bones of the ankle joint.

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.090
The surgeon will use the guide pins to place
hollow screws, which will hold the bones in

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.360
place.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.879
Bone graphed tissue from the part of the fibula
that was removed will be placed around the

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.260
joint.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.540
Then the rest of the removed fibula will be
attached to the side of the fused ankle with

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.159
two screws.

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.489
Finally, the incision will be closed with
sutures.

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.209
After ankle fusion the patient will no longer
be able to move the ankle joint.

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.670
However, fusion removes the pain caused by
arthritic surfaces rubbing together and other

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.790
joints in the foot continue to allow movement.
