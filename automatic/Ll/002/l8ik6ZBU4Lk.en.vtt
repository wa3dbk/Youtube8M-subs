primer before you put them on just so

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.250 
primer before you put them on just so

you<00:05:20.350> place<00:05:20.560> them<00:05:20.710> down<00:05:20.860> colors<00:05:21.580> pigmented<00:05:22.210> and

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
you place them down colors pigmented and

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.050 
you place them down colors pigmented and
it'll<00:05:22.930> really<00:05:23.670> show<00:05:25.920> and<00:05:26.920> I<00:05:27.610> know<00:05:27.670> that<00:05:27.940> it
