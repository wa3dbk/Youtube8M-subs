00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.390
 good friends, counting on the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.900
 mention of today's times sometimes 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.220
 let's go according to a roast beef burrito 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.260
 which is different then to others 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.179
 burritos is not other than us 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.489
 like we've taken before and what 

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:37.949
 we have done repeatedly so 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.469
 it seems we will occupy a package of 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.100
 tortillas of those grandotas of the great 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.350
 us for donkeys the grated cheese 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.920
 pico de gallo this recipe is already the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.129
 we put if they remember and also potatoes to 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.620
 the French either fried or baked 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.899
 gone as I told you before 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.579
 we are going to use we are using a 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.350
 beef steak 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.760
 is what are you seeing times 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.589
 short screens and which one we are cooking 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.970
 it is only an insect to prevent it 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.520
 making meat without starch dress 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.070
 beef and they're going to put it here in 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.700
 a frying pan appointment and have it go to session 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.080
 with pepper salt as you like a 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.520
 Once we have our meat ready 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.990
 our command that we are heating up 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.390
 our tortilla for our burrito 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.700
 Yes now let's go with the step 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.840
 fun of all that is to do our 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.840
 burrito true 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.970
 in this case I put the cheese first not 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.420
 I will explain why, because 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.450
 tortilla is hot because I put the 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.010
 meat second because meat too 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.130
 it is hot after having 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.370
 done we started it in squares like 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.440
 are watching 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.620
 we split it in small squares like being 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.620
 seeing 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.770
 then you can see burrito is not for you 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.500
 also after we add our 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.180
 french fries which we are just now 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.290
 pulling out of our oven because I the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.270
 I bake them not be cold one thing 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.940
 very important is if you want 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.680
 you can add the beans is that it's 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.600
 As I tell you, it's not a burrito like 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.030
 all that are beans and rice and all 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.030
 this is different ok and the truth is that 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:32.460
 that is to say ready good as well what 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.520
 filled with chips or chips 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.890
 baked to taste 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.220
 between less than 6 are used with potatoes 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.520
 it's better that way they fatten less and our 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.110
 tasty pico de gallo 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.150
 which already teaches them to be previously 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.430
 and use a spoon since I have a 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.820
 fork we are here doing all the 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.530
 quickie we do not want to stop going up 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.020
 it's the recipe because everything we eat 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.310
 they ask us for the recipe so here we are 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.630
 another recipe and that's how we have our 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.940
 all the ingredients as I say 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.190
 they can use rice beans and everything 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.380
 carries a common burrito but in this case 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.550
 this is not a common burrito first 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.710
 we fold from the edges 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.110
 we fold the edges we pass them to 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.870
 center and then we take the burrito and 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.490
 we go around 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.270
 and we keep thinking 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.090
 until our burrito is formed 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:34.810
 so excellent so fun here 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.400
 our roast burrito was our 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.400
 style like we like 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:46.140
 a quick thing that we're going to share with you 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.390
 once it's done 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:55.010
 a car lies 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:58.010
 a knife of your shadow appears there 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.010
 plugging 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:06.410
 from the formentera walls like this to 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:12.460
 people 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.460
 so you do not get half 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.139
 one thing and then so this time the 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.509
 cheese is melted 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:26.050
 that was on the top because the 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:26.580
 cheese the meat the potatoes and the peak of 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.840
 rooster 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.050
 that 's how our burrito is 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.479
 true the truth is really quite 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.939
 Well , I recommend them a lot to 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.229
 who likes the chips and how they 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:40.509
 I say I have to fry the really 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.539
 you just have to bake them I hope that 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:45.460
 this time you like it be your liking 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.830
 and then leave your comments your photos 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.240
 and they make them to the people of mexico maybe 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.370
 They do not have this idea they will love it 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.779
 friends are never left from selling them that 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.580
