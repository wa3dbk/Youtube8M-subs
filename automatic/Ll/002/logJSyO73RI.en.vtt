00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.799
 let's see let's remember a little bit to 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.779
 all of you what we have taught you 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.670
 let's wait a little while 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.770
 I am going to say we are tropicana and you 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.600
 respond yes strong so that people 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.050
 know that it has been a lot of people I will 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:23.230
 record this part we are not tropicana 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:27.509
 I do not know if seeing the top ones 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.509
 they left alone and tropicana 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.660
 you take them to the people 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.430
 here the lady is sleeping is going to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.430
 to sing in tropicana 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.110
 we will do one thing 6th sector in the center 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.570
 of reflection on the other side of Wallace 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.399
 this is going to see that in loud shout he 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.699
 we're going to get another poster with another 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.110
 position and another uniform seems to them 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:57.260
 have beach he starts to you by your side 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.260
 to see this strong side we are tropicana 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.080
 there is to see we win we do not want 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.320
 but because there are more people than the average 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.870
 so good 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.870
 to see us we are tropicana 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.520
 about more or less 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.820
 let's do it for example pure bolivarista 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.820
 Yes or no 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.270
 or else we are tropicana 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.720
 and that says now if I'm going to put them together 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.720
 to the three if we listen loud we are 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.720
 tropicana 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.860
 thank you very much dear friends we have 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.690
 remembered beautiful songs like 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.910
 example the rosary of my mother is 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:50.210
 they agree if pretty eyes do not see what 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.030
 poison that has not wanted to take poison to 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.550
 see raise the hand who has not wanted 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.920

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.290

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.860

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.660
 remembered another nice song that said 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.820

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.380

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.750

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.220

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.500
