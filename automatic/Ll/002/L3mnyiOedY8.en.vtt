00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 Hi guys, how are you? Come on, guys. Come on. 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.490
 then our next chat series 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.650
 how to make money with crafts is 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.549
 We already talked about the other videos about 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.289
 how to get an idea and how to buy 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.359
 material to put this idea into 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.880
 practice and now I'll talk about the first 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.970
 step to start doing the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.320
 thing works out right then you know of 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.510
 some points 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.130
 first you need to have a 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.630
 space your a table for you a space 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.719
 well lit and airy know one 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.090
 comfortable chair is looks silly 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.640
 But how will you work there? 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.820
 You must not be in pain. 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.450
 If you can get work to work 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.700
 huh 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.760
 working at home sometimes 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.050
 distracts with some tasks, right? 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.300
 Suddenly you are there working and have 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.719
 what stop to do something then 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.210
 creating a routine is something also very 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.989
 very important for your day to 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.630
 to render 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.030
 and for you to be able to work from home 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.880
 huh I know many for many of 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.450
 You who have children do not end up becoming a 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.640
 complicated because the child requires 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.460
 attention, we know it but always 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.380
 has a quieter time, right? 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.830
 live with the child in the state school 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.619
 Uniting I do not know but try to work 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.710
 At this time you know to focus on 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.950
 you give the best of themselves in that part're 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.299
 it is another very common thing that happens 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.720
 people have to stop work 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.880
 to search for our product to 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.460
 smudge brush that option that where 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.130
 Is he? 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.020
 happened to me too but if you 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.820
 has is an organized space know is always 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.720
 that you go to work you separate the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.420
 material 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.750
 here I paint have been caught ink 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.479
 fabric grips the fabric brushes know 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.969
 picks up the container with water washcloth 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.369
 Clean the goalkeeper to mix the colors 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.080
 Leave everything in front of your hand to 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.100
 not have to interrupt because if the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.680
 sexy fabric ink can not smoke 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.800
 It's all wrong, so it's legal to 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.240
 organization knows that you 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.440
 chose you 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.050
 the ideal is you have a room your knows one 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.680
 space your neighbors even 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.940
 because you give the key ready but it is 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.340
 I know there are is in small spaces 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.890
 where sometimes in your house you have only one 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.090
 table is where the family makes the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.070
 meals, then avoid working. 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.700
 next meal year because you 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.890
 get to work the thing starts at 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.740
 April the job has to stop for 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.500
 not only serve lunch so that 's cool 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.570
 Do you have isolated schedules? 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.480
 your schedule 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.550
 working at home is a delight 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.960
 comfortable is you have is is a comfort 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.510
 Nice you can stop and make your 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.020
 snack is very good but there is another side 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.180
 who has some pitfalls knows sometimes 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.640
 If you want to rest a little more at 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.290
 Sometimes you end up distracting yourself with a 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.930
 another task, right? 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.000
 It is important that you have a 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.750
 discipline as if working 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.590
 a company is then're a company 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.570
 six to eight hours a day, I do not know 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.590
 depends on the activity is not so cool 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.270
 do crafts if you like an hour 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.970
 that you dedicate yourself 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.840
 you will do well know then 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.780
 just look, it's okay, I'll go 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.670
 spend an hour two or three hours or 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.950
 more time does not matter 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.730
 But at that time you devote yourself 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.530
 he does a good job, he understands that 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.730
 there you see your work render 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.530
 It's cool, too, when you pick up 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.020
 an order 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.110
 let's suppose the person orders you 30 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.610
 boxes and give you a deadline to 15 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.330
 days 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.640
 How many hours do I work a day when 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.280
 The boxes I can make each day have 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.590
 slap your work out 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.300
 You do not leave the client at hand, right? 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.500
 so you have to do this calculation 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.720
 Do you know how the flow work understood? 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.060
