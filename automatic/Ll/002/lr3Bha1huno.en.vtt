00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 well these are from two to a new video 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.700
 well you know yesterday we had the detail 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.290
 how good if we buy a game of 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.750
 this generation for example of 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.490
 playstation3 and then we want to acquire 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.590
 the next generation version of 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.690
 playstation 4 then we will receive it 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.789
 a digital download for a price 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.560
 much lower it seems that it has 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.420
 detailed for example the call of duty 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.130
 the decalogue has detailed it 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.960
 activision as I say and well I think 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.480
 that if we buy the version of 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.760
 playstation 3 the precision 4 digital 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.830
 we will leave for only 10 euros 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.230
 well here will be ten euros in the US 10 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.329
 good dollars you already know so good a 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.980
 great a great price the jargon if I the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.890
 I really hope that all companies 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.079
 do the same thing for that low price and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.079
 we can acquire the anp to both 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.030
 versions and above all we will not wait for 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.920
 see what more developers say because 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.149
 it would be pretty good too you know 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.489
 that will serve watch 2 for this 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.170
 generation is in the following as 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.629
 I say also battlefield of this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.800
 kind of game that the truth is that 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.640
 it's worth it to talk like 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.440
 stopped balloons 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.780
 for two platforms and that the second 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.970
 be so low price so good 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.200
 we will see also as I say for 6-4 crisis 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.990
 at the same price because the truth that 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.200
 It could be a great big incentive because 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.390
 the truth a good person people 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.470
 you know you are thinking if you buy the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.720
 version of this generation of the 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.400
 next and we are having 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.690
 They will be having enough reservation 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.640
 low will not be waiting to see what 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.550
 version offers more version offers less 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.750
 and really, I think that not all 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.490
 the developers do not notice the 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.649
 companies I think doing this 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.140
 not only will they win 60 euros to win 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.229
 70 60 of the game you bought in play 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.270
 3 and ten euros more on top of you for the 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.399
 precision version 4 and I do not think they 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.380
 it costs a lot to say with which 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.910
 well the truth as I say a great 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.190
 incentive and we will see to see what it is that 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.770
 happens I do not know if in xbox also happen what 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.020
 same I suppose if something something will do 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.759
 I suppose that also and I suppose that 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.710
 same price with which it is good to touch 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.420
 wait and nothing for now we have that 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.460
 Confirmation of captives that will cost 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.899
 ten euros more insurance for the next 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.640
 generation so good nothing else 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.900
 kids this has been all in the give 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.900
 in the next upcoming video
