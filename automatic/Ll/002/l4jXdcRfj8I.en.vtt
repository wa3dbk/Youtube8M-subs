00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
so let's go ahead and see how well it

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.229 
so let's go ahead and see how well it
works

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
works

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.210 
works
like<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.959> go<00:02:17.080> ahead<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.440> show<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.680> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
like to go ahead and show you the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.610 
like to go ahead and show you the
compass<00:02:18.790> really<00:02:19.150> quick<00:02:19.390> right<00:02:19.720> there<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.200> it

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
compass really quick right there and it

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.860 
compass really quick right there and it
is<00:02:20.739> pointing<00:02:21.129> north<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:22.390> can<00:02:22.510> see<00:02:22.690> how

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
is pointing north and you can see how

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.460 
is pointing north and you can see how
that<00:02:23.049> adjusts

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.899 

continues<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.500> point<00:02:26.829> north<00:02:27.189> as<00:02:27.489> I<00:02:27.549> turn<00:02:29.909> the

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
continues the point north as I turn the

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.039 
continues the point north as I turn the
device<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.390> might<00:02:31.510> have<00:02:31.689> to<00:02:31.780> give<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:31.989> a

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
device you might have to give it a

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.229 
device you might have to give it a
little<00:02:32.170> tap<00:02:32.439> there<00:02:32.470> but<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.159> accurate<00:02:33.430> so

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
little tap there but it is accurate so

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.119 
little tap there but it is accurate so
that's<00:02:34.420> really<00:02:34.629> nice<00:02:34.870> nice<00:02:35.500> little<00:02:35.769> touch<00:02:35.950> of

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
that's really nice nice little touch of

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.520 
that's really nice nice little touch of
you're<00:02:36.250> out<00:02:36.280> there<00:02:36.549> camping<00:02:37.060> or<00:02:37.659> again<00:02:38.049> in<00:02:38.260> a

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
you're out there camping or again in a

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.640 
you're out there camping or again in a
survival<00:02:39.010> situation<00:02:40.079> go<00:02:41.079> ahead<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.470> unscrew

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
survival situation go ahead and unscrew

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.890 
survival situation go ahead and unscrew
this<00:02:42.159> now<00:02:42.340> there<00:02:42.519> is<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.700> black<00:02:43.329> coating<00:02:43.689> on

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
this now there is a black coating on

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.420 
this now there is a black coating on
here<00:02:44.109> that<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.319> got<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.829> scrape<00:02:45.099> off

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
here that you got to have to scrape off

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.630 
here that you got to have to scrape off
before<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.879> starts<00:02:46.239> working<00:02:47.129> as<00:02:48.129> far<00:02:48.370> as<00:02:48.459> this

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
before it starts working as far as this

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.330 
before it starts working as far as this
the<00:02:49.390> part<00:02:49.930> that's<00:02:50.140> left<00:02:50.290> would<00:02:50.769> you<00:02:50.890> take<00:02:51.250> it

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
the part that's left would you take it

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.429 
the part that's left would you take it
off<00:02:51.430> magnesium<00:02:52.030> ah<00:02:52.120> it's<00:02:52.480> black<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.140> if<00:02:53.349> you

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
off magnesium ah it's black and if you

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.009 
off magnesium ah it's black and if you
put<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.739> down<00:02:53.769> it's<00:02:54.099> very<00:02:54.189> easy<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.819> lose<00:02:55.209> so

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
put it down it's very easy to lose so

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.470 
put it down it's very easy to lose so
you<00:02:56.049> might<00:02:56.349> want<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.739> like<00:02:56.970> maybe<00:02:57.970> put

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
you might want to like maybe put

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.080 
you might want to like maybe put
something<00:02:58.690> bright<00:02:59.109> on<00:02:59.319> there<00:02:59.730> now<00:03:00.730> one<00:03:00.940> thing

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
something bright on there now one thing

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.819 
something bright on there now one thing
I<00:03:01.239> did<00:03:01.420> notice<00:03:01.599> is<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:01.959> there's<00:03:02.319> one<00:03:02.590> edge

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
I did notice is that there's one edge

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.440 
I did notice is that there's one edge
that's<00:03:03.129> a<00:03:03.250> little<00:03:03.489> smoother<00:03:03.879> on<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.150> striker

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
that's a little smoother on the striker

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.379 
that's a little smoother on the striker
than<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.870> other<00:03:05.049> and<00:03:05.319> one<00:03:05.620> side<00:03:05.889> has<00:03:06.159> a

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
than the other and one side has a

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.460 
than the other and one side has a
rougher<00:03:07.389> edge<00:03:07.569> so<00:03:07.870> you'll<00:03:08.019> want<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.290> make<00:03:08.349> sure

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
rougher edge so you'll want to make sure

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.110 
rougher edge so you'll want to make sure
you<00:03:08.709> have<00:03:08.859> that<00:03:08.950> rougher<00:03:09.310> edge<00:03:09.489> toward<00:03:10.000> the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
you have that rougher edge toward the

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.240 
you have that rougher edge toward the
magnesium<00:03:10.750> bar<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.739> can<00:03:11.889> see<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.159> I

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
magnesium bar and you can see that I

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.160 
magnesium bar and you can see that I
scrape<00:03:12.519> some<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.819> that<00:03:12.970> paint<00:03:13.239> off<00:03:13.359> so<00:03:14.019> let's

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
scrape some of that paint off so let's

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.259 
scrape some of that paint off so let's
go<00:03:14.319> ahead<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.650> have<00:03:14.889> some<00:03:15.189> like<00:03:15.549> hey<00:03:15.790> like

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
go ahead I have some like hey like

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.869 
go ahead I have some like hey like
dried-up<00:03:16.810> grass<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.470> leaves<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.099> some<00:03:18.579> sticks

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
dried-up grass of leaves and some sticks

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.729 
dried-up grass of leaves and some sticks
down<00:03:19.090> there<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.420> try<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.599> be<00:03:19.780> realistic<00:03:20.170> if<00:03:20.500> not

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
down there to try to be realistic if not

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.420 
down there to try to be realistic if not
I<00:03:20.769> have<00:03:21.599> something<00:03:22.599> that<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:22.900> foolproof<00:03:23.769> if<00:03:24.189> I

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
I have something that is foolproof if I

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.879 
I have something that is foolproof if I
can't<00:03:24.760> get<00:03:24.879> this<00:03:25.090> going<00:03:25.540> so<00:03:26.260> again<00:03:26.560> I'm<00:03:26.769> going
