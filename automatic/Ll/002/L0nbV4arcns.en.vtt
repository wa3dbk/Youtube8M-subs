00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
this guy here we have it looks like the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.160 
this guy here we have it looks like the
micro<00:02:05.070> USB<00:02:05.610> cable<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.750> one<00:02:06.930> here<00:02:07.110> is

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
micro USB cable and this one here is

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.559 
micro USB cable and this one here is
actually<00:02:07.950> white<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.670> little<00:02:08.879> bit<00:02:09.060> departure

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
actually white a little bit departure

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.900 
actually white a little bit departure
from<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.750> usual<00:02:09.840> dark<00:02:10.679> colored<00:02:11.099> ones<00:02:11.310> we<00:02:11.790> see

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
from the usual dark colored ones we see

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.380 
from the usual dark colored ones we see
with<00:02:12.030> most<00:02:12.300> devices<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.020> have

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
with most devices so you have

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.740 
with most devices so you have
at<00:02:13.450> secondly<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.740> have<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:15.430> USB<00:02:16.090> charger<00:02:16.630> now

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
at secondly you have the USB charger now

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.630 
at secondly you have the USB charger now
this<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.020> pretty<00:02:17.230> interesting<00:02:17.319> not<00:02:18.310> only<00:02:18.459> does

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
this is pretty interesting not only does

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.000 
this is pretty interesting not only does
it<00:02:18.700> have<00:02:18.850> one<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.300> features<00:02:19.750> two<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:20.709> that's

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
it have one it features two so that's

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.980 
it have one it features two so that's
pretty<00:02:21.220> nifty<00:02:21.400> so<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.480> can<00:02:22.660> charge<00:02:22.870> two

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
pretty nifty so that you can charge two

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.770 
pretty nifty so that you can charge two
devices<00:02:23.230> simultaneously<00:02:23.830> we<00:02:24.790> imagine<00:02:25.300> you

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
devices simultaneously we imagine you

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.300 
devices simultaneously we imagine you
can<00:02:25.930> see<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.230> motorola<00:02:26.620> branding<00:02:27.130> right

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
can see the motorola branding right

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.880 
can see the motorola branding right
there<00:02:27.490> as<00:02:27.640> well<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.750> last<00:02:28.990> thing<00:02:29.290> last

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
there as well and the last thing last

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.220 
there as well and the last thing last
piece<00:02:30.250> here<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.640> just<00:02:31.330> looks<00:02:31.690> like<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.930> sim

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
piece here is just looks like the sim

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.330 
piece here is just looks like the sim
removal<00:02:32.440> tool<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.780> it's<00:02:34.780> actually<00:02:34.959> like<00:02:35.920> that

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
removal tool and it's actually like that

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.120 
removal tool and it's actually like that
so<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:37.390> could<00:02:37.630> use<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.380> actually<00:02:38.440> take<00:02:38.920> off

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
so you could use it to actually take off

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.760 
so you could use it to actually take off
the<00:02:39.480> ability<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.630> nano<00:02:40.840> SIM<00:02:41.230> slot<00:02:41.530> right<00:02:41.709> here

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
the ability to nano SIM slot right here

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.610 
the ability to nano SIM slot right here
so<00:02:42.300> basically<00:02:43.300> you've<00:02:43.720> got<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:44.080> put<00:02:44.350> it<00:02:44.470> in

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
so basically you've got to put it in

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.650 
so basically you've got to put it in
like<00:02:44.890> so<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.840> pop<00:02:46.840> out<00:02:47.200> comes<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.860> sim<00:02:48.520> card

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
like so and pop out comes the sim card

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.240 
like so and pop out comes the sim card
yeah<00:02:49.660> it's<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.870> nano-sim<00:02:50.380> right<00:02:50.650> there<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.190> you

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
yeah it's a nano-sim right there so you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.030 
yeah it's a nano-sim right there so you
have<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:51.820> so<00:02:52.720> that's<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:52.959> quick<00:02:53.200> unboxing<00:02:53.440> of

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
have that so that's a quick unboxing of

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.009 
have that so that's a quick unboxing of
the<00:02:54.190> handset<00:02:54.430> I'm<00:02:54.790> going<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.209> go<00:02:55.300> through<00:02:55.570> the
