once again I'm back it's Justin from

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.950 
once again I'm back it's Justin from
guitar<00:00:04.770> made<00:00:04.920> easy<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.400> guitar<00:00:06.359> music<00:00:06.390> calm

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
guitar made easy and guitar music calm

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.320 
guitar made easy and guitar music calm
and<00:00:07.290> today<00:00:08.250> I'm<00:00:08.340> going<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.550> talk<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.120> about

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
and today I'm going to talk to you about

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.530 
and today I'm going to talk to you about
vibrato<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.550> probably<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.300> and

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
vibrato and this is probably this and

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.209 
vibrato and this is probably this and
bends<00:00:12.780> are<00:00:13.019> probably<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.410> hardest<00:00:13.440> part<00:00:14.040> of

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
bends are probably the hardest part of

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.829 
bends are probably the hardest part of
learning<00:00:14.940> your<00:00:15.000> licks<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.509> learning<00:00:15.750> your

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
learning your licks and learning your

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.460 
learning your licks and learning your
individual<00:00:16.609> no<00:00:17.609> tricks<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.300> legs<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.080> how<00:00:19.380> to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
individual no tricks and legs and how to

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.929 
individual no tricks and legs and how to
play<00:00:19.619> solos<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.310> stuff<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.789> because

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
play solos and stuff like that because

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.480 
play solos and stuff like that because
the<00:00:21.060> vibrato<00:00:21.420> has<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:22.260> right<00:00:22.490> okay

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
the vibrato has to be just right okay

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.450 
the vibrato has to be just right okay
and<00:00:23.519> everybody<00:00:24.119> does<00:00:24.990> different<00:00:25.859> vibrato

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
and everybody does different vibrato

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.849 
and everybody does different vibrato
techniques<00:00:27.080> everybody<00:00:28.080> sounds<00:00:28.439> different

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
techniques everybody sounds different

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.130 
techniques everybody sounds different
it's<00:00:28.949> really<00:00:29.310> hard<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.789> imitate<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.510> lot<00:00:31.050> of

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
it's really hard to imitate a lot of

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.170 
it's really hard to imitate a lot of
those<00:00:31.260> famous<00:00:31.529> guys<00:00:31.859> because<00:00:32.309> their<00:00:32.820> vibrato

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
those famous guys because their vibrato

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.030 
those famous guys because their vibrato
is<00:00:33.300> really<00:00:33.570> quick<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:34.710> really

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
is really quick or it's just really

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.220 
is really quick or it's just really
different<00:00:35.250> they<00:00:35.520> learn<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> different<00:00:35.940> way<00:00:36.230> it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
different they learn a different way it

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.130 
different they learn a different way it
all<00:00:37.380> depends<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.210> basically<00:00:39.210> what<00:00:39.450> vibrato<00:00:39.840> is

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
all depends so basically what vibrato is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.709 
all depends so basically what vibrato is
is<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:41.399> when<00:00:41.640> you're<00:00:41.760> plucking<00:00:42.420> an

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
is it's when you're plucking an

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.720 
is it's when you're plucking an
individual<00:00:43.530> note<00:00:43.739> or<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> couple<00:00:44.129> notes<00:00:44.399> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
individual note or a couple notes and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.150 
individual note or a couple notes and
you're<00:00:45.420> wiggling<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.890> gives<00:00:47.070> that

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
you're wiggling it so that it gives that

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.130 
you're wiggling it so that it gives that
sound<00:00:47.579> almost<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.420> if<00:00:48.660> your<00:00:48.870> guitar

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
sound almost that as if your guitar

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.160 
sound almost that as if your guitar
singing<00:00:49.500> almost<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.629> your<00:00:51.629> guitar<00:00:51.809> is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
singing almost that if your guitar is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.709 
singing almost that if your guitar is
creating<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.739> voice<00:00:52.949> okay<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.449> hear

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
creating a voice okay so if you hear

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.540 
creating a voice okay so if you hear
that's<00:00:55.020> what<00:00:55.170> happens<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.680> pluck<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.070> when

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
that's what happens when I pluck it when

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.430 
that's what happens when I pluck it when
I<00:00:56.610> pluck<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.940> string<00:00:57.000> obviously<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.320> I

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
I pluck a string obviously but if I

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.179 
I pluck a string obviously but if I
wiggle<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.010> that's<00:01:01.460> vibrato<00:01:02.460> okay<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:05.070> can

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
wiggle it that's vibrato okay you can

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.890 
wiggle it that's vibrato okay you can
kind<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.430> hear<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:07.820> okay<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.630> when<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.810> do

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
kind of hear it okay so when I do

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.570 
kind of hear it okay so when I do
vibrato<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.619> I'm<00:01:10.740> when<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.100> hitting<00:01:11.310> let's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
vibrato and I'm when I'm hitting let's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.859 
vibrato and I'm when I'm hitting let's
say<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:11.850> any<00:01:12.090> note<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.510> I'm<00:01:12.570> practicing

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
say just any note and I'm practicing

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.289 
say just any note and I'm practicing
vibrato<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:14.220> I'm<00:01:14.340> doing<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.939> I'm<00:01:15.270> just

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
vibrato what I'm doing is I'm just

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.530 
vibrato what I'm doing is I'm just
wiggling<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.380> little<00:01:17.100> bit<00:01:17.369> okay<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.299> can

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
wiggling it a little bit okay you can

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.910 
wiggling it a little bit okay you can
kind<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.810> get<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> feel<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.650> try<00:01:19.860> it

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
kind of get a feel for it if you try it

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.870 
kind of get a feel for it if you try it
out<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> faster<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> wiggle<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.979> more<00:01:23.250> kind

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
out so the faster I wiggle the more kind

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.039 
out so the faster I wiggle the more kind
of<00:01:23.939> out<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> control<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.570> sounds<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.900> kind<00:01:25.020> of

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
of out of control it sounds it kind of

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.420 
of out of control it sounds it kind of
sounds<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.320> Angus<00:01:25.619> Young<00:01:25.799> he<00:01:26.040> actually

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
sounds like Angus Young he actually

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.830 
sounds like Angus Young he actually
Wiggles<00:01:26.790> extremely<00:01:27.540> fast

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
Wiggles extremely fast

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.899 
Wiggles extremely fast
when<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.930> comes<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.259> vibrato<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.890> lot<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> lot

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
when it comes to vibrato a lot of a lot

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.600 
when it comes to vibrato a lot of a lot
of<00:01:33.030> really<00:01:33.450> good<00:01:33.570> guitarists<00:01:34.140> do<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.040> like

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
of really good guitarists do it like

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.429 
of really good guitarists do it like
just<00:01:35.820> crazy<00:01:36.090> fast<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.900> sounds<00:01:37.200> good<00:01:37.290> it's

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
just crazy fast and it sounds good it's

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.280 
just crazy fast and it sounds good it's
in<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> key<00:01:38.460> with<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> rhythm<00:01:39.110> but<00:01:40.110> how

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
in it's in a key with the rhythm but how

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.020 
in it's in a key with the rhythm but how
I<00:01:40.320> would<00:01:40.500> practice<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.729> would<00:01:41.880> just

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
I would practice this is I would just

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.679 
I would practice this is I would just
make<00:01:42.420> little<00:01:42.720> movements<00:01:44.149> almost<00:01:45.149> like<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
make little movements almost like a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.620 
make little movements almost like a
quarter<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.649> step<00:01:46.920> Bend<00:01:47.450> almost<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.600> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
quarter of a step Bend almost like a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.499 
quarter of a step Bend almost like a
maybe<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.140> half<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:50.070> half<00:01:50.310> step<00:01:50.640> Bend<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.420> I'm

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
maybe a half of a half step Bend so I'm

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.980 
maybe a half of a half step Bend so I'm
not<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.899> when<00:01:52.770> I'm<00:01:52.890> bending<00:01:53.840> that's<00:01:54.840> it

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
not going when I'm bending that's it

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.760 
not going when I'm bending that's it
that's<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.290> whole<00:01:55.439> step<00:01:58.430> that's<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.579> half<00:01:59.729> step

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
that's a whole step that's a half step

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.929 
that's a whole step that's a half step
it's<00:02:01.770> almost<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.280> almost<00:02:02.490> even<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.909> a

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
it's almost it's almost even like a

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.370 
it's almost it's almost even like a
quarter<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.479> or<00:02:03.659> half<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.229> it's

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
quarter that or half of that so it's

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.249 
quarter that or half of that so it's
like

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.990 

okay<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.319> that's<00:02:10.619> basically<00:02:11.009> what<00:02:11.580> my<00:02:11.730> broto

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
okay so that's basically what my broto

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.270 
okay so that's basically what my broto
is<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:13.200> how<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.410> practice<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.010> there's<00:02:14.190> a

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
is and how to practice that there's a

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.350 
is and how to practice that there's a
couple<00:02:14.459> different<00:02:14.790> ways<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:14.970> can<00:02:15.150> create

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
couple different ways you can create

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.050 
couple different ways you can create
vibrato<00:02:15.750> um<00:02:16.290> that's<00:02:16.860> one<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:17.819> just

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
vibrato um that's one is if you just

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.990 
vibrato um that's one is if you just
kind<00:02:18.269> of<00:02:18.330> wiggle<00:02:18.690> your<00:02:18.930> fingers<00:02:19.459> okay<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.670> use

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
kind of wiggle your fingers okay and use

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.420 
kind of wiggle your fingers okay and use
your<00:02:21.150> thumb<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.420> brace<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.870> fretboard

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
your thumb to brace the fretboard

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.759 
your thumb to brace the fretboard
another<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:24.569> go<00:02:24.720> back<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.140> forth<00:02:25.440> like

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
another is to go back and forth like

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.900 
another is to go back and forth like
that<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:29.010> kind<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.340> hear<00:02:29.549> it<00:02:29.670> on<00:02:29.730> this

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
that you can kind of hear it on this

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.759 
that you can kind of hear it on this
probably<00:02:30.420> with<00:02:30.569> this<00:02:30.870> electric<00:02:31.260> guitar<00:02:31.590> not

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
probably with this electric guitar not

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.920 
probably with this electric guitar not
being<00:02:32.010> plugged<00:02:32.190> in<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.239> webcam<00:02:33.629> and<00:02:33.780> all

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
being plugged in and the webcam and all

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.360 
being plugged in and the webcam and all
um<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.379> probably<00:02:34.650> can't<00:02:34.860> hear<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.040> very<00:02:35.160> well

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
um you probably can't hear it very well

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.220 
um you probably can't hear it very well
but<00:02:35.879> if<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.090> push<00:02:36.360> down<00:02:36.540> really<00:02:36.569> hard<00:02:36.810> and

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
but if I push down really hard and

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.559 
but if I push down really hard and
wiggle<00:02:37.549> it's<00:02:38.549> almost<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:38.970> violinist

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
wiggle it's almost like a violinist

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.150 
wiggle it's almost like a violinist
creating<00:02:40.019> that<00:02:40.110> vibrato<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.739> he<00:02:40.799> creates

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
creating that vibrato that he creates

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.250 
creating that vibrato that he creates
when<00:02:41.340> he<00:02:41.430> pushes<00:02:41.760> down<00:02:41.880> like<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:42.540> it's

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
when he pushes down like that so it's

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.020 
when he pushes down like that so it's
kind<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.500> hard<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.680> hear<00:02:43.890> right<00:02:44.040> now<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:44.790> it's

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
kind of hard to hear right now but it's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.030 
kind of hard to hear right now but it's
there<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:46.110> another<00:02:46.620> kind<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:48.769> when<00:02:49.769> you're

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
there so another kind is when you're

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.539 
there so another kind is when you're
when<00:02:50.879> you're<00:02:51.000> bending<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:52.680> do<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:52.860> vibrato<00:02:53.280> and

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
when you're bending to do a vibrato and

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.490 
when you're bending to do a vibrato and
a<00:02:53.579> bend<00:02:53.819> okay<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.569> really<00:02:55.019> tough

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
a bend okay so this is a really tough

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.289 
a bend okay so this is a really tough
part<00:02:56.069> I<00:02:56.250> think<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.549> is<00:02:56.670> one<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:56.940> toughest

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
part I think this is one of the toughest

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.210 
part I think this is one of the toughest
part<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.629> learning<00:02:58.500> this<00:02:58.709> stuff<00:02:58.829> out<00:02:59.129> of

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
part of learning this stuff out of

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.259 
part of learning this stuff out of
everything<00:02:59.489> so<00:03:00.329> when<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.840> bend<00:03:02.150> when<00:03:03.150> you're

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
everything so when you bend when you're

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.350 
everything so when you bend when you're
at<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.510> very<00:03:03.930> top<00:03:04.200> your<00:03:04.470> Bend<00:03:05.120> go<00:03:06.120> down<00:03:06.329> a

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
at the very top your Bend go down a

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.210 
at the very top your Bend go down a
little<00:03:06.720> bit<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.140> that's<00:03:07.590> where<00:03:07.799> you<00:03:07.860> wiggle

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
little bit and that's where you wiggle

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.509 
little bit and that's where you wiggle
so<00:03:08.879> you're<00:03:09.630> at<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.810> very<00:03:09.840> top<00:03:10.170> go<00:03:10.709> down<00:03:10.950> back

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
so you're at the very top go down back

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.370 
so you're at the very top go down back
to<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.790> very<00:03:11.940> top<00:03:12.120> down<00:03:12.420> back<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.139> the<00:03:13.230> very

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
to the very top down back to the very

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.860 
to the very top down back to the very
top<00:03:13.620> down<00:03:13.859> back<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.549> very<00:03:14.730> top<00:03:14.940> down<00:03:15.090> so

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
top down back to the very top down so

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.870 
top down back to the very top down so
I'm<00:03:16.139> bending<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.530> note<00:03:16.739> I'm<00:03:16.950> letting<00:03:17.639> it<00:03:17.700> go<00:03:17.760> a

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
I'm bending a note I'm letting it go a

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.090 
I'm bending a note I'm letting it go a
little<00:03:18.060> bit<00:03:18.299> down<00:03:18.450> just<00:03:19.290> about<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.650> quarter

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
little bit down just about that quarter

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:28.690 
little bit down just about that quarter
of<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.280> half-step

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:37.160 

if<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:29.819> can<00:03:29.970> hear<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.209> that<00:03:30.420> well<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:37.020> is

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
if you can hear it that well so this is

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.510 
if you can hear it that well so this is
really<00:03:37.410> important<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.770> get<00:03:37.860> down<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.069> lot<00:03:38.400> of

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
really important to get down a lot of

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.970 
really important to get down a lot of
people<00:03:38.790> will<00:03:38.910> kind<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.780> know<00:03:39.900> be<00:03:40.170> really

people will kind of you know be really
sloppy<00:03:41.430> on<00:03:41.760> their<00:03:41.880> vibrato<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.569> can<00:03:42.690> hear

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
sloppy on their vibrato and you can hear

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.910 
sloppy on their vibrato and you can hear
in<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.050> music<00:03:43.380> um<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.420> couple<00:03:45.420> guys<00:03:45.540> who<00:03:45.870> are
