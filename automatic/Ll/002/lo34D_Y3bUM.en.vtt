00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
bulldoze are like an SCV but there's

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.120 
bulldoze are like an SCV but there's
just<00:00:30.810> not<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:30.990> much<00:00:31.349> money<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.769> eSports

right<00:00:32.340> now<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.550> can't<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.030> defacing

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
right now we can't just be defacing

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.080 
right now we can't just be defacing
bulldozers<00:00:34.260> what<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:34.980> need<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.280> those<00:00:35.760> things

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
bulldozers what we need is those things

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.819 
bulldozers what we need is those things
from<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.360> movie<00:00:36.600> aliens<00:00:37.050> where<00:00:37.290> she's<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
from the movie aliens where she's in the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.799 
from the movie aliens where she's in the
giant<00:00:38.280> suit<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:38.910> if<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.090> could<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.270> buy<00:00:39.570> one

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
giant suit so if we could just buy one

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.049 
giant suit so if we could just buy one
of<00:00:39.840> those<00:00:40.250> is<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.550> play<00:00:41.670> cost<00:00:41.879> more

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
of those is that that play cost more

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.330 
of those is that that play cost more
