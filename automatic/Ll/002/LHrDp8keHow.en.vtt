00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
as far as I'd wanted to I was hoping to

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.129 
as far as I'd wanted to I was hoping to
have<00:00:08.849> it<00:00:08.880> run<00:00:09.090> off<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.360> real<00:00:09.480> gas<00:00:09.690> tank<00:00:09.990> today

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
but as you can see I still have my

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.970 
but as you can see I still have my
auxilary<00:00:12.599> fuel<00:00:12.929> tank<00:00:13.170> on<00:00:13.320> there<00:00:13.880> and<00:00:15.980> still

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
auxilary fuel tank on there and still

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.320 
auxilary fuel tank on there and still
have<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.160> little<00:00:17.310> bit<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.490> tuning<00:00:17.850> left<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.180> do

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
have a little bit of tuning left to do

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.609 
have a little bit of tuning left to do
but<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.720> have<00:00:19.199> got<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:20.180> the<00:00:21.320> pilot<00:00:22.320> screws

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
but I have got the the pilot screws

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.130 
but I have got the the pilot screws
adjusted<00:00:23.100> where<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.279> think<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.670> happy<00:00:24.140> seems

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
adjusted where I think it's happy seems

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.890 
adjusted where I think it's happy seems
to<00:00:25.260> run<00:00:25.410> pretty<00:00:25.619> good<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.130> off<00:00:26.310> idle<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:27.000> think

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
to run pretty good just off idle I think

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.410 
to run pretty good just off idle I think
my<00:00:27.990> next<00:00:28.199> step<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.619> going<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.859> be<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.420> adjust

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
my next step is going to be to adjust

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.749 
my next step is going to be to adjust
the<00:00:30.810> pilot<00:00:31.199> or<00:00:31.380> putting<00:00:32.130> smaller<00:00:32.460> set<00:00:32.669> of

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
