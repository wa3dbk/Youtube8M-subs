00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 so people we have fourth wednesday 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.400
 February 2015 can be filed quickly 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.880
 my battery is on, i have to smile 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.719
 at 1 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.000
 and it's about amino acids today 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.670
 and also specifically direction 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.699
 essential amino acids of the body 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.600
 needs yes or consists of I believe 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.070
 20 different amino acids by the way 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.510
 In short, I have these things 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.890
 So study if I was then 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.240
 in between made mistakes and 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 someone knows better i like it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.170
 improve then we improve with that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.969
 text comments on about my video 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.399
 some of them are essential that means 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.789
 that means the body can do that 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.649
 do not produce yourself 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.399
 whereas other amines are so amino acids 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.570
 if they are missing from other amino acids 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.579
 These can be converted 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.110
 essential amino acids you have to 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.649
 but to lead from the outside 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.820
 otherwise if you have that permanently 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.250
 neglects certain 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.120
 deficiencies or even tougher ones 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.350
 Side Effects 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.960
 Now I'll get to the point quickly 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.439
 why I specifically take this up now 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.060
 I did that a few months ago 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.009
 or made a video over a year ago 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.810
 Regarding ramadan and muscle building now 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.490
 People need to be very strong 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.509
 Religious ones feel 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.250
 a little reserved 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.140
 I never said you should not 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.150
 train during ramadan or as well 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.799
 The question was always many have me 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.320
 asked how is it with ramadan and 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.700
 Muscle building or strength building there must 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.439
 I 'll be back, of course 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.979
 repeat because I still have it now 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.380
 a lot to read and learned 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.600
 Definitely it is so if you go directly after 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.600
 not enough amino acids to train 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.159
 you take directly to you immediately 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.750
 After that, I will become deficient 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.299
 you in one of the next videos too 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.020
 explain how you do that with certain 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.079
 symptoms but the body needs 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.850
 look at the training you destroy 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.830
 muscle tissue or general 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.880
 tissue or muscle tissue in 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.610
 smallest microscopic how can you 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.320
 that's what they say are so small 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.640
 Muscle injuries must be in the body 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.000
 which repair immediately or 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.090
 also refill its glycogen stores 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.800
 and that's what amino acids need 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.300
 You do not get around that means you 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.520
 can not somehow because you ramada 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.620
 do exercise and then think yes 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.600
 to nibble creatures for ten hours and 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.570
 what to eat then still happens 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.670
 somehow yes because I had some big ones 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.650
 youtuber seen here and here we come 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.110
 back again you know 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.850
 you can do your videos that way 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.130
 as many thumbs up as possible 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.690
 of religious people or you can 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.280
 Do it that way or hate it 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.070
 or thumb down gets 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.050
 Let's say that because they are in theirs 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.160
 feel religious feelings hurt because 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.200
 I said 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.850
 because you 're so hardcore during ramadan 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.150
 training or muscle building is more likely 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.650
 unlikely to impossible because you 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.420
 can not exercise and ten hours 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.770
 Eat later eight hours later 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.780
 or so also from me five 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.940
 hours later because the body is direct 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.250
 after that these amino acids are needed now 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.019
 we get to the point gets the body 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.989
 he does not start that on his own 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.030
 to break down body tissue then this 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.769
 make the repair again 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.100
 to refill or repair 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.300
 He also takes it from the blood plasma like that 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.800
 as I have read this in now 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.390
 several articles like i said 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.080
 someone is lying down who knows better 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.540
 do not improve 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.750
 The body is taken from the blood plasma 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.640
 partially amino acids located out 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.019
 abdominal muscle or muscle tissue or 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.160
 body protein from sources and 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.300
 then repairs the broken 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.250
 gone 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.380
 of course it can happen now 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.970
 you're kind of a guy in the long run 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.980
 He then thinks well I'm hard now 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.630
 I can exercise, but I can eat too 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.519
 later sometime and so it fits 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.290
 and so if you then make the permanent 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.010
 It may be that you, for example, house 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.720
 case get 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.239
 So if you are a little bit kind of 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.370
 hair loss so I'm not talking now 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.530
 of these worst hair loss of 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.480
 because of anabolic steroids or something like that 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.070
 take can hair loss as I said also 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.340
 be genetic as it can 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.470
 but also that you are skinny 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.060
 war on hair because certain 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.030
 amino acids are not enough for you 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.310
 that is when you take place 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.470
 protein-rich protein-rich food 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.830
 somehow candy is all the time 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.699
 it be that you know I'm not thinner 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.199
 sh get as you know so do the 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.820
 that must be in a separate video that 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.040
 is a complex subject that must be 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.690
 separate video as I said and now 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.610
 come on come on 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.590
 The body builds as I said your own 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.330
 Substances also from the blood plasma 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.280
 and then it can be like me 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.430
 I read that white 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.010
 suffer from blood corpuscles and that 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.440
 the body and generally the immune system 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.600
 it suffers from that too in the long run 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.760
 more susceptible to certain 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.600
 illnesses or certain symptoms 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.370
 having 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.320
 that means what do I know some people 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.660
 then get herpes faster or how 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.919
 Anyway, I 'm there 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.870
 now through for two hours 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.570
 various articles and also test and 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.370
 so read on studies that is 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.810
 what stuck in my head 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.340
 is 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.630
 the essential as I said you have to 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.150
 to lead from the outside 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.440
 that is, by the way, and he is very important 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.410
 very important that may be in 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.720
 my headline also on it because 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.530
 I constantly turkey myself everywhere 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.070
 turkey meat turkey turkey turkey ever to 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.450
 if you are about general if you have yours 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.400
 protein sources constantly on a variety 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.870
 yes because that reduces you somewhere in 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.910
 any magazine or somewhere 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.320
 have taken up that then you constantly 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.880
 because you think you are bodybuilder now 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.450
 or do it fitness that you constantly 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.700
 turkey meat turkey breast turkey turkey where you 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.070
 the one reads everywhere heard everywhere 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.169
 That can happen if you are so one-sided 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.900
 always choose your source of protein that you 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.960
 then certain amino acids from too little 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.750
 That means it's super important 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.900
 that you have different kinds of protein pro 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:07.530
 day per week you take tuna 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.150
 milk beef and turkey chicken and 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.950
 so on and so on or on my own 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.500
 also vegetarian with mix 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.210
 that means reduce your protein sources 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.690
 not always just on a variety 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:21.080
 can he be that you some 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:24.139
 amino acids too little abbekommt 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.780
 Some amino acids are normal 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.400
 people not essential that he is 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.909
 she does not have to lead from the outside 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:35.050
 with athletes or with certain at 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:39.020
 certain diseases how is that called 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.969
 not diseases but metabolism 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.979
 but because certain 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:43.969
 metabolic diseases or at 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:46.520
 It can be extreme athletes 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:49.009
 certain amino acids are the normal ones 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.590
 people do not additionally like trying 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.819
 have to ingest that then 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.530
 be necessary that is athletes or 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:57.590
 certain sick people need to 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.819
 then certain amino acids increase 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.930
 but I'll take you there 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.610
 maybe a few more videos too 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.650
 Do that for now 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.409
 I think so, and I hope so 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.580
 I added the most important one together 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:09.110
 all thanks for cooking and the 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.610
 Days continue and think of the 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.610
 are support thank you watch
