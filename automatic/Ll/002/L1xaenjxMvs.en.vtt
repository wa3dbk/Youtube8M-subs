00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
often our bodies are in some way a

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.289 
often our bodies are in some way a
prison<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:39.159> and<00:02:39.459> we're<00:02:39.670> trapped<00:02:39.969> within

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
them and at some point if if we evolved

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.420 
them and at some point if if we evolved
to<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.299> certain<00:02:43.659> level<00:02:43.870> we<00:02:44.500> kind<00:02:44.739> of<00:02:44.829> graduate

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
to a certain level we kind of graduate

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.629 
to a certain level we kind of graduate
out<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:45.939> our<00:02:46.060> body<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.920> we<00:02:47.920> get<00:02:48.280> the

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
out of our body and we get the

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.309 
out of our body and we get the
opportunity<00:02:49.299> to<00:02:49.719> go<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.260> different

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
opportunity to go on to a different

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.770 
opportunity to go on to a different
level<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:52.180> that's<00:02:52.329> something<00:02:52.540> that<00:02:52.659> really

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
level and that's something that really

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.409 
level and that's something that really
helped<00:02:53.260> me<00:02:53.499> and<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.739> think<00:02:54.010> that's<00:02:54.419> something

helped me and I think that's something

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.670 
helped me and I think that's something
that<00:02:55.599> with<00:02:55.840> meditation<00:02:56.319> we<00:02:56.799> can<00:02:56.829> help<00:02:57.219> to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
that with meditation we can help to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.039 
that with meditation we can help to
quiet<00:02:59.680> our<00:02:59.919> mind<00:03:00.310> long<00:03:00.790> enough<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.870> realize
