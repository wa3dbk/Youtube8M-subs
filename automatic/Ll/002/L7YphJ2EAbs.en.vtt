your<00:03:35.699> own<00:03:35.790> hug<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:36.449> they<00:03:36.600> score<00:03:36.840> by<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.019> 6.5<00:03:37.650> I

think<00:03:37.949> it's<00:03:38.040> fair<00:03:38.160> enough<00:03:38.370> because<00:03:39.150> they<00:03:39.269> had

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
think it's fair enough because they had

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:40.430 
think it's fair enough because they had
fun<00:03:39.540> for<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.720> little<00:03:39.810> bit

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
fun for a little bit

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.220 
fun for a little bit
just<00:03:40.590> for<00:03:40.710> a<00:03:40.740> little<00:03:40.890> bit<00:03:41.960> so<00:03:42.960> that's

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
just for a little bit so that's

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.470 
just for a little bit so that's
basically<00:03:43.470> why<00:03:44.430> my<00:03:45.420> sort<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.410> low<00:03:46.650> score<00:03:47.480> you

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
basically why my sort of low score you

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.090 
basically why my sort of low score you
could<00:03:48.660> have<00:03:48.780> been<00:03:48.810> done<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.440> better<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:50.010> be

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
could have been done it better to be

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.820 
could have been done it better to be
perfectly<00:03:50.460> honest<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.180> try<00:03:52.020> to<00:03:52.080> modify<00:03:52.650> the

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
perfectly honest so try to modify the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.370 
perfectly honest so try to modify the
levels<00:03:53.190> themselves<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.940> idea<00:03:54.180> was<00:03:54.330> good<00:03:54.870> but

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
levels themselves the idea was good but

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.920 
levels themselves the idea was good but
the<00:03:56.040> application<00:03:56.610> itself<00:03:56.700> fail<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.840> be

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
the application itself fail to be

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.300 
the application itself fail to be
perfectly<00:03:58.290> on<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.500> that's<00:03:58.650> why<00:03:58.830> they<00:03:59.070> I

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
perfectly on it that's why they I

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.700 
perfectly on it that's why they I
provide<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.090> score<00:04:00.420> are<00:04:00.570> not<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:01.250> higher<00:04:02.250> one
