00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.609
 the big fight between chuck norris against 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.460
 they are goku it will be broadcast tonight 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.469
 instead, let's see this shit later 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.480
 to see how this series is going wrong 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.040
 received by some of my colleagues and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.260
 that it's been a while since 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.300
 I continued with none of my specials 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.430
 I think it's time for me to put 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.410
 give a well-deserved criticism to this 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.420
 series but eye a good time them 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.279
 I clarify to people who do not like this 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.380
 version that to me yes and therefore my 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.359
 intention will explain why I 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.430
 like I do not understand your refusal against 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.010
 They not believe this but I will 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.140
 expose their failures if so is this series 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.210
 if it has true failures but they are not 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.280
 the fallacies with which their hated 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.040
 they use them to highlight the pseudo bad 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.660
 which is the series at the beginning when I saw 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.820
 the announcement of the new series of 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.039
 looney tunes I could not feel if not more 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.199
 that a little disappointment not because there 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.539
 been like the trailer of this other thing 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.430
 but because the trailer of the commercial was 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.800
 shorter than the graphics quality of the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.690
 video game df also what they showed me 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.789
 it was just a segment of the coyote and the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.470
 roadrunner in three of that gave me very 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.590
 bad spine because although it does not 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.570
 I have problems with animation 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.579
 many excellent series in 3-day 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.670
 the looney tunes they saw no need 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.710
 a series of 3-d my fear was 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.110
 how much I saw his second trailer in which 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.360
 they showed the traditional animation in 2d 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.430
 this is where he applied that the animation 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.320
 It seemed decent I started to see the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.590
 first episode and my reaction was a 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.750
 great satisfaction now is when he settled 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.729
 really and I wonder about this 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.740
 those users do not like the series 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.539
 and that's why they feel that the lunnis are no longer 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.100
 they are what they are 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.440
 In the beginning they must know something 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.299
 these series although it is not the best thing that 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.130
 It has derived from looney tunes is 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.959
 comes very close to being the equivalent of what 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.869
 that really should be in this 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:51.000
 time most of the haters of 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.039
 series are what they call nostalgia fap or 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.929
 it makes people who live in the past 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.539
 claiming that there is nothing decent about 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.549
 the current television and right now they 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.470
 I will say why these series and is passable and 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.539
 They should not be based on short films 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.140
 originals to say that this series is 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.729
 bad the original short films 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.890
 they were to make fun of someone or something 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.050
 of either fictional characters from the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.780
 same series as all those times 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.720
 I never beat box or real characters 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.430
 as adolfo hitler at present of the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.800
 format of the original short films 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.720
 would be taken for evil since the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.760
 series that are used and mocked 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.800
 someone or something are mediocre and their only 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.290
 exist is to resort to making fun of what 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.150
 alien without any specific reason what 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.340
 which does not represent any achievement and does not 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.680
 provokes comedy rather disappointment at 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.450
 know that their creators are so lacking 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.760
 of ideas that tend to make fun of 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.500
 pseudo innocent characters of course 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.660
 there are exceptions that do know well how 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.000
 satirize without getting cliché but 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.000
 I can count on these serious penalties with 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.510
 one hand to what we pass to the factor 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.540
 strong of the series its format the format 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.250
 of the sitcom series this format despite 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.380
 that currently lacks all 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.780
 originality can be created good 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.790
 series with him I will not deny that we have had 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.800
 really bad series with this format that 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.140
 border on the ridiculous and jokes that do not 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.880
 just cause you to laugh but 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.350
 rather of which they laugh at the 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.360
 spectator for having done them 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.730
 wasting time and spitting 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.769
 in the face of his intelligence 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.989
 but there are also sitcom series that 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.610
 they excel by creating comical situations and 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.739
 not stupid who know how to balance 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.049
 very well the ideas that the writers 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.690
 put to create a program that if it's worth 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.970
 it's worth seeing what brings us to the 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.190
 program sitcom that I should say if 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.349
 he knows how to handle his subjects very well 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.480
 despite the odd exception, such as 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.970
 made of the 3d animation of the coyote and the 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.560
 Correcaminos is despite the fact that 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.709
 retaining the essence of their 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.569
 original short films is a change 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.370
 which do not have the need to 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.200
 do and therefore is what can be done 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.090
 call as the worst part of the program 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.690
 thank goodness that in the second season 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.220
 this segment was removed another defect 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.590
 of the series would undoubtedly be their 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.900
 occasional mature jokes that are not 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.269
 strong but certainly as the case of 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.390
 3d segment do not need these 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.250
 jokes to provoke comedy other thing 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.959
 that the program is very grateful 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.269
 the reinterpretation that they gave to 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.190
 all the characters here once again 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.229
 I remind you that I would not like to see a 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.180
 shameless copy of the original lunnis 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.039
 because I can already see them 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.480
 when I want in their broadcasts and 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.910
 consequently no 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.400
 that recycle only improving the 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.410
 animation but the new 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.690
 personalities of the characters are 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.880
 very well developed clear that I do not 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.920
 I refer to everyone since the case of 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.770
 what is unfortunate since they returned it a 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.720
 extremely cliché character and I do not 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.820
 liked nothing to see him as the subject of 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.590
 which everyone abuses by their goodwill 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.810
 but no doubt other cases are 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.580
 exceptional such as lola which of 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.560
 a character introduced by more 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.720
 lazy and vulgar fun services for 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.670
 Sophie Lycos went on to become a 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.770
 true looney tunes the looney tunes 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.900
 they're supposed to be crazy characters 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.970
 that make us laugh is to say the lunnis 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.130
 they were created to be funny and not 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.170
 Beyond that, very few liked it 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.850
 lunatics unleashed because convert to 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.610
 the lunnis in the league of justice 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.950
 he would never make us laugh also is 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.080
 this series is more of an adaptation if 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.790
 they listened well this series is a 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.190
 adaptation of the looney originals 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.140
 tunes to the 21st century as I explained 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.570
 previously the original lunnis 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.640
 they would become outdated it is noted that in 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.530
 this series the adapt the personalities 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.480
 of the lunnis was something to be applauded and 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.230
 more by changing cliché personalities and 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.970
 convert 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.120
 in characters with a development 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.710
 true although that itself is not a 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.990
 series that stands out at the level of 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.530
 great hits but it would happen like 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.120
 a common sitcom explained why 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.220
 which is a series fairly 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.410
 known is because it is a 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.480
 adaptation of the same luli is to say 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.460
 if it were an independent series, not the 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.250
 we would take this into account and we would only say 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.170
 that it's okay if we talked about the 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.630
 animation we can say that it's fine 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.910
 I understand that many people have complained 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.860
 of how they left because because I too 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.900
 he dislikes his new approach but at 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.000
 Look like the radical change in the image 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.520
 of the characters was only in the 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.650
 main characters characters like 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.870
 the rooster claudio or pp have changes of 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.670
 very unnoticed image to what I 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.650
 I wonder how they could not give it 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.780
 improvements not so notorious to all 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.880
 characters and something that is not epic of the 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.940
 lunnis is his animation but of course 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.470
 it is for the criterion of each one 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.910
 To date I want you to include 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.070
 more of the characters that he gives me 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.530
 curiosity how they adapt them 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.020
 remember that the original works do not 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.750
 translate but adapt according to the 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.490
 type of audience that is targeted at 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.690
 conclusion of the looney tunes show 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.430
 It is undoubtedly one of the best 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.800
 adaptations that I've seen of some 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.200
 franchise that should have had a better 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.060
 welcomed by the fans, the 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.040
 I consider the best adaptation of the 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.530
 looney tunes after the tiny toons and 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.240
 I definitely recommend it , it's really 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.090
 a healthy comedy xd 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.930
 he gave her a 75 with noticing her as good 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:05.490
 and recommended more not outstanding 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.380
 well up to here the third part of 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.330
 special do not hurry that then 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.000
 I will continue with this special and with the 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:15.480
 others until next time and enjoy your 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.250
 high vacation and certainly not not 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.070
 I'm going to give you my opinion on the 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.930
 songs of the program because 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.770
 simply because it is already criterion of 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.770
 everyone the musical taste
