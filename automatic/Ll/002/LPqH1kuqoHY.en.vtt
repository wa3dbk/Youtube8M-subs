so<00:00:02.490> as<00:00:02.610> I<00:00:02.639> mentioned<00:00:03.090> in<00:00:03.210> class<00:00:03.389> we<00:00:03.750> won't

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
so as I mentioned in class we won't

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.509 
so as I mentioned in class we won't
really<00:00:04.230> be<00:00:04.440> focusing<00:00:05.009> very<00:00:05.069> much<00:00:05.339> on<00:00:05.759> my<00:00:06.569> attic

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 
really be focusing very much on my attic

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.400 
really be focusing very much on my attic
recombination<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:09.300> we're<00:00:09.510> going<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.840> instead

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
recombination and we're going to instead

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.379 
recombination and we're going to instead
talk<00:00:11.300> more<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.480> deep<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.900> depth<00:00:13.380> about<00:00:13.679> the

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
talk more in deep in depth about the

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.019 
talk more in deep in depth about the
mitotic<00:00:15.470> recombination<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.770> why<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.789> might

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
mitotic recombination and why that might

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.450 
mitotic recombination and why that might
happen<00:00:19.670> mitotic<00:00:20.840> recombination<00:00:21.840> and

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
happen mitotic recombination and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.689 
happen mitotic recombination and
replication<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:24.029> going<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:25.310> or<00:00:26.310> during

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
replication is going to or during

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.830 
replication is going to or during
replication<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.480> going<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.720> take<00:00:27.900> care<00:00:28.109> of

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
replication is going to take care of

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.540 
replication is going to take care of
bulky<00:00:30.840> addicts<00:00:31.380> or<00:00:31.650> single<00:00:31.980> strand<00:00:32.250> Nicks

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
bulky addicts or single strand Nicks

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.080 
bulky addicts or single strand Nicks
when<00:00:33.329> these<00:00:33.840> are<00:00:34.280> encountered<00:00:35.280> by<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.610> DNA

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
when these are encountered by the DNA

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.139 
when these are encountered by the DNA
replication<00:00:36.719> machinery<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.950> can't<00:00:38.579> continue

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
replication machinery it can't continue

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.350 
replication machinery it can't continue
on<00:00:39.329> through<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.890> stops<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.120> I

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
on through and so it stops so I think I

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.770 
on through and so it stops so I think I
used<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.930> phrase<00:00:43.170> freaks<00:00:43.620> out<00:00:44.239> in<00:00:45.239> lecture

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
used the phrase freaks out in lecture

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.840 
used the phrase freaks out in lecture
and<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:47.010> need<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.280> actually<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
and so we need to actually have a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.880 
and so we need to actually have a
mechanism<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.600> fix<00:00:48.840> these<00:00:49.079> if<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:49.590> haven't

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
mechanism to fix these if they haven't

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.310 
mechanism to fix these if they haven't
been<00:00:50.059> previously<00:00:51.059> fixed<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
been previously fixed and so this is to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.430 
been previously fixed and so this is to
keep<00:00:52.500> replication<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.960> first<00:00:55.199> one

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
keep replication going so the first one

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.080 
keep replication going so the first one
that<00:00:55.559> we've<00:00:55.739> got<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.190> replication<00:00:56.820> fork

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that we've got is replication fork

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.260 
that we've got is replication fork
restart<00:00:57.539> by<00:00:57.690> homologous<00:00:58.109> recombination<00:00:58.949> and

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
restart by homologous recombination and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.209 
restart by homologous recombination and
this<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.870> result<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> collapsed<00:01:01.829> fork

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
this is the result of a collapsed fork

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.280 
this is the result of a collapsed fork
this<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.390> when<00:01:03.539> there's<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.780> Knick<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
this is when there's a Knick on the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.780 
this is when there's a Knick on the
template<00:01:04.650> strand<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> Nick<00:01:05.670> on

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
template strand so if we have a Nick on

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.370 
template strand so if we have a Nick on
the<00:01:05.850> template<00:01:06.240> strand<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.810> case<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.260> a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the template strand in this case it's a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.080 
the template strand in this case it's a
lagging<00:01:07.770> strand<00:01:08.070> we're<00:01:08.549> gonna<00:01:08.640> wind<00:01:08.909> up<00:01:09.030> with

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
lagging strand we're gonna wind up with

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.120 
lagging strand we're gonna wind up with
what<00:01:09.420> looks<00:01:09.630> exactly<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.409> double<00:01:10.740> strand

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
what looks exactly like a double strand

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.090 
what looks exactly like a double strand
break<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.570> case<00:01:12.869> though<00:01:13.200> we're<00:01:13.979> not

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
break here in this case though we're not

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.190 
break here in this case though we're not
dealing<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.820> homologous<00:01:15.540> strand<00:01:15.960> we're

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
dealing with homologous strand we're

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.630 
dealing with homologous strand we're
dealing<00:01:16.560> with<00:01:16.680> another<00:01:17.009> strand<00:01:17.490> that's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
dealing with another strand that's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.260 
dealing with another strand that's
already<00:01:17.850> been<00:01:18.030> synthesized<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.549> fix<00:01:20.850> this

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
already been synthesized so to fix this

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.679 
already been synthesized so to fix this
we<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:22.049> our<00:01:22.460> double<00:01:23.460> strand<00:01:23.729> break<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.240> we

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
we have our double strand break here we

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.499 
we have our double strand break here we
start<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:25.229> with<00:01:25.439> strand<00:01:25.950> invasion<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.759> just

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
start out with strand invasion and just

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.840 
start out with strand invasion and just
orient<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.680> blue<00:01:29.040> strand<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.549> still<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
orient you the blue strand is still the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.219 
orient you the blue strand is still the
blue<00:01:30.030> strand<00:01:30.240> these<00:01:30.509> two<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.079> been

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
blue strand these two just have been

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.920 
blue strand these two just have been
flipped<00:01:31.530> from<00:01:31.740> here<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> here<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.810> we<00:01:33.810> have

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
flipped from here to here so we have

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.530 
flipped from here to here so we have
strand<00:01:34.259> invasion<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.210> doing

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
strand invasion and what this is doing

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.130 
strand invasion and what this is doing
is<00:01:37.020> its<00:01:37.259> using<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.509> complementary<00:01:39.509> strand<00:01:39.869> so

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
is its using the complementary strand so

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020 
is its using the complementary strand so
just<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> reminder<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.159> complementary

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
just as a reminder this is complementary

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.330 
just as a reminder this is complementary
to<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.840> here<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:44.159> is

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
to this here just as this is

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.749 
to this here just as this is
complementary<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.619> is

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
complementary to this and this is

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.889 
complementary to this and this is
complementary<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.659> is

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
complementary to this and this is

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.600 
complementary to this and this is
complementary<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.130> important<00:01:50.520> for

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
complementary to this it's important for

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.880 
complementary to this it's important for
us<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.790> recognize<00:01:51.450> those<00:01:51.810> because<00:01:52.619> we're<00:01:52.770> not

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
us to recognize those because we're not

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.620 
us to recognize those because we're not
using<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.280> homologous<00:01:53.880> strand<00:01:54.210> we're<00:01:54.420> using

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
using a homologous strand we're using

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.719 
using a homologous strand we're using
the<00:01:54.990> other<00:01:55.140> template<00:01:55.649> strand<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.070> fix<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.490> so

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the other template strand to fix it so

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.149 
the other template strand to fix it so
here<00:01:57.390> are<00:01:57.570> three<00:01:57.840> prime<00:01:58.110> end<00:01:58.350> will<00:01:58.649> invade

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
here are three prime end will invade

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.810 
here are three prime end will invade
down<00:01:59.790> here<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.479> we'll<00:02:01.049> add<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.460> we'll

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
down here and we'll add on that we'll

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.080 
down here and we'll add on that we'll
use<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.450> now<00:02:03.930> bottom<00:02:04.710> strand<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.490> which

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
use this now bottom strand here which

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.839 
use this now bottom strand here which
formerly<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.229> was<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.740> double-stranded<00:02:08.729> DNA

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
formerly it was in double-stranded DNA

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.140 
formerly it was in double-stranded DNA
with<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:10.020> we'll<00:02:10.229> use<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.830> as<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.039> template<00:02:11.610> to

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
with it we'll use that as a template to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.300 
with it we'll use that as a template to
make<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> bit<00:02:12.750> more

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
make a bit more

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.850 
make a bit more
to<00:02:13.760> synthesize<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.300> bit<00:02:14.599> more<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.870> DNA<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:15.530> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
to synthesize a bit more of DNA on the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.830 
to synthesize a bit more of DNA on the
three<00:02:16.069> prime<00:02:16.310> end<00:02:16.340> all<00:02:17.239> right<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:17.569> this<00:02:17.660> is

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
three prime end all right so this is

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.440 
three prime end all right so this is
originally<00:02:18.500> where<00:02:18.739> our<00:02:18.920> strand<00:02:19.340> break<00:02:19.670> was<00:02:19.910> so

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
originally where our strand break was so

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.930 
originally where our strand break was so
we<00:02:20.599> have<00:02:20.810> an<00:02:21.140> invasion<00:02:21.530> creation<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.760> D

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
we have an invasion creation of the D

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.570 
we have an invasion creation of the D
loop<00:02:23.209> from<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.989> new<00:02:24.380> strand<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.069> then

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
loop from the new strand and then

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.170 
loop from the new strand and then
extension<00:02:26.209> of<00:02:26.330> this<00:02:26.480> one<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:28.610> causes<00:02:29.150> a

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
extension of this one this causes a

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.150 
extension of this one this causes a
Holliday<00:02:29.660> Junction<00:02:30.230> which<00:02:30.410> will<00:02:30.650> need<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.890> be

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
Holliday Junction which will need to be

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.470 
Holliday Junction which will need to be
fixed

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
fixed

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.809 
fixed
or<00:02:32.540> resolved<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:33.739> we<00:02:33.980> have<00:02:34.130> resolution<00:02:34.700> of

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
or resolved and so we have resolution of

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.309 
or resolved and so we have resolution of
Holliday<00:02:35.209> Junction<00:02:35.630> there's<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.900> little<00:02:36.170> bit

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
Holliday Junction there's a little bit

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.830 
Holliday Junction there's a little bit
of<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:36.620> new<00:02:36.769> strand<00:02:37.300> or<00:02:38.300> sorry<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.690> old

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
of the new strand or sorry the old

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.809 
of the new strand or sorry the old
strand<00:02:39.140> that's<00:02:39.349> now<00:02:39.590> associated<00:02:40.459> with<00:02:40.610> this

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
strand that's now associated with this

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.630 
strand that's now associated with this
new<00:02:41.540> strand<00:02:41.900> here<00:02:42.230> we<00:02:42.709> have<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.130> crossing

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
new strand here we have the crossing

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.380 
new strand here we have the crossing
over<00:02:43.790> or<00:02:44.230> homologous<00:02:45.230> recombination<00:02:46.390> event

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
over or homologous recombination event

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.800 
over or homologous recombination event
here<00:02:47.840> which<00:02:48.260> winds<00:02:48.980> up<00:02:49.100> getting<00:02:49.310> us<00:02:49.670> back<00:02:50.420> to

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
here which winds up getting us back to

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.960 
here which winds up getting us back to
this<00:02:50.959> point<00:02:51.230> where<00:02:51.590> we<00:02:51.769> now<00:02:51.980> are<00:02:52.010> connected<00:02:52.730> to

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
this point where we now are connected to

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.229 
this point where we now are connected to
our<00:02:53.239> original<00:02:53.480> template<00:02:54.140> strand<00:02:54.440> here<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:56.030> so

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
our original template strand here and so

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.720 
our original template strand here and so
this<00:02:56.780> means<00:02:57.110> now<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.769> we<00:02:57.890> can<00:02:58.069> continue<00:02:58.580> on

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
this means now that we can continue on

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.449 
this means now that we can continue on
with<00:02:59.030> our<00:02:59.319> replication<00:03:00.319> from<00:03:00.980> this<00:03:01.250> three

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
with our replication from this three

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.610 
with our replication from this three
prime<00:03:01.670> end<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.120> in<00:03:02.660> our<00:03:02.840> lagging<00:03:03.019> strand<00:03:03.500> we

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
prime end and in our lagging strand we

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.140 
prime end and in our lagging strand we
just<00:03:03.799> laid<00:03:03.950> down<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.130> new<00:03:04.340> primer<00:03:04.640> here<00:03:04.940> and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
just laid down a new primer here and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.870 
just laid down a new primer here and
then<00:03:05.299> continue<00:03:05.690> with<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.500> synthesis<00:03:07.310> so

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
then continue with the synthesis so

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.089 
then continue with the synthesis so
that's<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.299> replication<00:03:08.750> fork<00:03:08.900> restart<00:03:09.680> based

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
that's a replication fork restart based

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.280 
that's a replication fork restart based
on<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.610> nick<00:03:10.940> in<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.330> template<00:03:11.750> strand<00:03:11.870> that

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
on a nick in the template strand that

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.960 
on a nick in the template strand that
winds<00:03:12.680> up<00:03:12.739> causing<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.250> double<00:03:13.489> strand<00:03:13.730> break

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
winds up causing a double strand break

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.970 
winds up causing a double strand break
and<00:03:14.209> then<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.569> actual<00:03:15.170> fixing<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.799> is

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
and then the actual fixing of it is

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.199 
and then the actual fixing of it is
almost<00:03:16.730> exactly<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.209> same<00:03:19.090> restart<00:03:20.090> by

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
almost exactly the same restart by

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.940 
almost exactly the same restart by
homologous<00:03:20.630> recombination<00:03:21.470> when<00:03:21.680> there's<00:03:21.890> a

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
homologous recombination when there's a

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.340 
homologous recombination when there's a
stalled<00:03:22.340> fork<00:03:22.670> fork<00:03:23.329> so<00:03:23.630> this<00:03:23.810> is<00:03:24.019> when

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
stalled fork fork so this is when

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.259 
stalled fork fork so this is when
there's<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.650> big<00:03:24.890> bulky<00:03:25.310> addict<00:03:25.700> potentially

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
there's a big bulky addict potentially

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.530 
there's a big bulky addict potentially
right<00:03:26.450> here<00:03:26.870> this<00:03:27.140> is<00:03:27.200> our<00:03:27.530> addict<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:29.299> it

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
right here this is our addict and so it

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.380 
right here this is our addict and so it
stops<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:31.250> this<00:03:31.519> case<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:32.060> leading

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
stops the in this case the leading

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.020 
stops the in this case the leading
strand<00:03:32.750> from<00:03:33.109> being<00:03:33.410> able<00:03:33.530> to<00:03:33.709> make<00:03:34.370> more<00:03:34.609> DNA

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
strand from being able to make more DNA

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.009 
strand from being able to make more DNA
in<00:03:35.390> this<00:03:35.870> direction<00:03:36.519> so<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:38.150> replication<00:03:38.930> is

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
in this direction so the replication is

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.080 
in this direction so the replication is
stopped<00:03:39.319> here<00:03:39.590> now<00:03:39.829> what's<00:03:40.549> important<00:03:40.970> to

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
stopped here now what's important to

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.759 
stopped here now what's important to
remember<00:03:41.209> is<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:41.630> this<00:03:41.989> is<00:03:42.230> in<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.440> same

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
remember is that this is in the same

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.069 
remember is that this is in the same
place<00:03:43.220> on<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.639> DNA<00:03:44.060> strand<00:03:44.420> it's<00:03:44.600> not<00:03:44.780> moving

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
place on the DNA strand it's not moving

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.590 
place on the DNA strand it's not moving
around<00:03:45.319> on<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.739> DNA<00:03:46.100> strand<00:03:46.459> this<00:03:47.209> is<00:03:47.420> the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
around on the DNA strand this is the

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.979 
around on the DNA strand this is the
same<00:03:47.870> base<00:03:48.400> because<00:03:49.400> we<00:03:50.030> start<00:03:50.600> out<00:03:50.780> with<00:03:50.930> a

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
same base because we start out with a

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.500 
same base because we start out with a
branch<00:03:51.319> migration<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:52.340> so<00:03:52.459> this<00:03:52.910> which<00:03:53.269> used

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
branch migration and so this which used

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.539 
branch migration and so this which used
to<00:03:53.660> be<00:03:53.810> in<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.109> open<00:03:54.319> part<00:03:54.889> of<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.069> fork<00:03:55.340> is

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
to be in the open part of the fork is

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.710 
to be in the open part of the fork is
now<00:03:55.730> Aria<00:03:56.569> kneeled<00:03:57.290> back<00:03:57.889> here<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:58.760> this<00:03:59.420> bit

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
now Aria kneeled back here so this bit

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.930 
now Aria kneeled back here so this bit
is<00:03:59.930> this<00:04:00.319> part<00:04:00.620> that<00:04:00.799> we're<00:04:00.980> seeing<00:04:01.220> here<00:04:01.340> and

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
is this part that we're seeing here and

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.720 
is this part that we're seeing here and
what<00:04:02.239> happens<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:02.900> that<00:04:02.930> as<00:04:03.410> this<00:04:03.980> strand<00:04:04.430> and

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
what happens is that as this strand and

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.020 
what happens is that as this strand and
this<00:04:05.090> strand<00:04:05.450> Rhea<00:04:06.260> Neil<00:04:06.590> for<00:04:07.519> this<00:04:07.700> branch

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
this strand Rhea Neil for this branch

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.110 
this strand Rhea Neil for this branch
migration<00:04:08.720> this<00:04:09.470> strand<00:04:09.889> and<00:04:10.220> this<00:04:10.790> strand

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
migration this strand and this strand

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.539 
migration this strand and this strand
the<00:04:11.540> newly<00:04:11.930> synthesized<00:04:12.530> strands<00:04:13.100> have

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
the newly synthesized strands have

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.879 
the newly synthesized strands have
sequence<00:04:14.500> sequences<00:04:15.500> that<00:04:15.709> are

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
sequence sequences that are

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.949 
sequence sequences that are
complementary<00:04:16.669> to<00:04:16.820> one<00:04:17.000> another<00:04:17.359> because

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
complementary to one another because

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.529 
complementary to one another because
they're<00:04:18.139> based<00:04:18.410> off<00:04:18.680> of<00:04:19.150> sequences<00:04:20.150> that<00:04:20.180> are

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
they're based off of sequences that are

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.450 
they're based off of sequences that are

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
complementary to one another in the this

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.219 
complementary to one another in the this
template<00:04:22.880> strand<00:04:23.180> in<00:04:23.330> this<00:04:23.479> template<00:04:23.930> strand

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.230 
template strand in this template strand
so<00:04:24.860> as<00:04:25.130> this<00:04:25.700> part

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
so as this part

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.450 
so as this part
here<00:04:26.449> Rio<00:04:26.960> nails<00:04:27.229> with<00:04:27.440> this<00:04:27.620> part<00:04:27.949> here

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
here Rio nails with this part here

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.300 
here Rio nails with this part here
there's<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:29.120> bit<00:04:29.419> of<00:04:29.449> sequence<00:04:30.020> here<00:04:30.560> that<00:04:31.009> can

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
there's a bit of sequence here that can

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.790 
there's a bit of sequence here that can
really<00:04:31.539> see<00:04:32.539> Qin<00:04:32.750> here<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.259> that's<00:04:33.500> how<00:04:33.740> we

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
really see Qin here and that's how we

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.180 
really see Qin here and that's how we
wind<00:04:34.160> up<00:04:34.340> with<00:04:34.940> this<00:04:35.360> part<00:04:35.810> in<00:04:36.050> here<00:04:36.620> so<00:04:37.039> we've

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
wind up with this part in here so we've

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.100 
wind up with this part in here so we've
got<00:04:37.340> a<00:04:37.370> bit<00:04:37.580> of<00:04:37.699> a<00:04:37.789> three<00:04:38.030> prime<00:04:38.240> over<00:04:38.509> cane<00:04:38.870> or

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
got a bit of a three prime over cane or

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.900 
got a bit of a three prime over cane or
started<00:04:39.770> five<00:04:39.949> prime<00:04:40.250> overhang

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
started five prime overhang

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.240 
started five prime overhang
because<00:04:41.509> there<00:04:41.720> was<00:04:41.870> no<00:04:42.050> stalling<00:04:42.620> on<00:04:42.830> the

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
because there was no stalling on the

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.650 
because there was no stalling on the
lagging<00:04:43.669> strand<00:04:44.020> so<00:04:45.020> this<00:04:45.349> is<00:04:45.560> where<00:04:45.830> our

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
lagging strand so this is where our

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.680 
lagging strand so this is where our
leading<00:04:47.660> strand<00:04:47.990> installed<00:04:48.729> so<00:04:49.729> this<00:04:50.060> these

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
leading strand installed so this these

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.260 
leading strand installed so this these
base<00:04:50.960> pairs<00:04:51.229> here<00:04:51.650> are<00:04:52.150> complementary<00:04:53.150> to

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
base pairs here are complementary to

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.240 
base pairs here are complementary to
these<00:04:53.449> base<00:04:53.720> pairs<00:04:53.960> here<00:04:54.410> so<00:04:54.740> I<00:04:54.770> hope<00:04:55.009> that

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
these base pairs here so I hope that

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.800 
these base pairs here so I hope that
Orient's<00:04:55.759> you<00:04:55.880> a<00:04:55.910> little<00:04:56.180> bit<00:04:56.300> better<00:04:56.449> to<00:04:56.660> what

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
Orient's you a little bit better to what

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.589 
Orient's you a little bit better to what
we're<00:04:56.900> talking<00:04:57.229> about<00:04:57.319> here<00:04:57.789> so<00:04:58.789> once<00:04:59.300> this

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
we're talking about here so once this

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.260 
we're talking about here so once this
has<00:04:59.900> this<00:05:00.470> branch<00:05:00.979> migration<00:05:01.580> has<00:05:01.789> occurred

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
has this branch migration has occurred

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.629 
has this branch migration has occurred
there's<00:05:02.810> now<00:05:03.020> a<00:05:03.050> little<00:05:03.590> bit<00:05:03.830> of<00:05:03.889> a<00:05:04.039> five-prime

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
there's now a little bit of a five-prime

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.839 
there's now a little bit of a five-prime
overhang<00:05:05.150> that<00:05:05.479> this<00:05:06.259> leading<00:05:06.800> strand<00:05:07.460> can

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
overhang that this leading strand can

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.140 
overhang that this leading strand can
use<00:05:08.150> as<00:05:08.360> a<00:05:08.419> template<00:05:09.139> to<00:05:09.710> make<00:05:10.069> more<00:05:10.370> DNA<00:05:10.729> and

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
use as a template to make more DNA and

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.659 
use as a template to make more DNA and
what<00:05:11.750> is<00:05:11.900> actually<00:05:12.530> happening<00:05:13.009> here<00:05:13.069> is<00:05:13.430> we're

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
what is actually happening here is we're

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.420 
what is actually happening here is we're
making<00:05:14.000> more<00:05:14.449> DNA<00:05:14.750> that's<00:05:15.199> complementary<00:05:16.099> to

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
making more DNA that's complementary to

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.089 
making more DNA that's complementary to
this<00:05:16.669> lagging<00:05:17.479> strand<00:05:17.900> that's<00:05:18.770> also

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
this lagging strand that's also

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.790 
this lagging strand that's also
complementary<00:05:19.849> to<00:05:20.120> this<00:05:20.300> sequence<00:05:20.690> here<00:05:21.289> that

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
complementary to this sequence here that

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.999 
complementary to this sequence here that
goes<00:05:22.009> over<00:05:22.729> that<00:05:22.970> bulky<00:05:23.479> addict<00:05:23.960> okay<00:05:24.470> so<00:05:24.530> this

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 
goes over that bulky addict okay so this

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.020 
goes over that bulky addict okay so this
is<00:05:25.370> going<00:05:25.699> to<00:05:25.909> basically<00:05:26.120> leapfrog<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.770> whole

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
is going to basically leapfrog the whole

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.760 
is going to basically leapfrog the whole
replication<00:05:29.030> machinery<00:05:29.479> over<00:05:29.569> this<00:05:30.050> bed<00:05:30.349> here

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
replication machinery over this bed here

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.089 
replication machinery over this bed here
so<00:05:31.759> what<00:05:32.240> happens<00:05:32.719> then<00:05:33.020> is<00:05:33.320> instead<00:05:33.949> of

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
so what happens then is instead of

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.480 
so what happens then is instead of
having<00:05:34.340> the<00:05:34.789> branch<00:05:35.750> migration<00:05:36.469> where<00:05:36.710> these

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
having the branch migration where these

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.480 
having the branch migration where these
parts<00:05:38.060> anneal<00:05:38.419> now<00:05:38.719> we<00:05:38.780> have<00:05:39.199> the<00:05:39.620> reverse<00:05:40.250> of

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
parts anneal now we have the reverse of

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.040 
parts anneal now we have the reverse of
that<00:05:40.550> branch<00:05:40.969> migration<00:05:41.570> so<00:05:41.750> it's<00:05:41.870> going<00:05:41.990> to

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
that branch migration so it's going to

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.439 
that branch migration so it's going to
migrate<00:05:42.259> this<00:05:42.650> way<00:05:42.889> and<00:05:43.159> we<00:05:43.669> wind<00:05:43.940> up<00:05:44.090> getting

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
migrate this way and we wind up getting

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.350 
migrate this way and we wind up getting
the<00:05:44.990> reopening<00:05:45.650> of<00:05:45.860> our<00:05:46.039> replication<00:05:46.759> fork<00:05:47.210> to

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
the reopening of our replication fork to

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.120 
the reopening of our replication fork to
where<00:05:47.509> it<00:05:47.630> had<00:05:47.750> been<00:05:47.900> opened<00:05:48.169> before<00:05:48.289> the<00:05:48.919> only

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
where it had been opened before the only

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.100 
where it had been opened before the only
difference<00:05:49.460> now<00:05:49.550> is<00:05:49.699> that<00:05:50.180> whereas<00:05:50.630> we<00:05:50.659> had

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
difference now is that whereas we had

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.080 
difference now is that whereas we had
stalled<00:05:51.500> our<00:05:51.710> replication<00:05:52.190> machinery<00:05:52.820> right

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
stalled our replication machinery right

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.770 
stalled our replication machinery right
here<00:05:53.539> at<00:05:54.020> the<00:05:54.169> beginning<00:05:54.710> of<00:05:54.919> this<00:05:55.539> diagram<00:05:56.539> up

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
here at the beginning of this diagram up

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.219 
here at the beginning of this diagram up
here<00:05:57.259> now<00:05:58.009> we<00:05:58.669> don't<00:05:58.849> have<00:05:59.000> to<00:05:59.360> even<00:05:59.479> deal<00:05:59.900> with

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
here now we don't have to even deal with

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.920 
here now we don't have to even deal with
this<00:06:00.500> bulky<00:06:01.490> addict<00:06:01.880> because<00:06:02.419> the

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
this bulky addict because the

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.899 
this bulky addict because the
replication<00:06:03.440> machinery<00:06:04.039> is<00:06:04.219> going<00:06:04.460> to<00:06:04.610> start

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:04.909 
replication machinery is going to start

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:06.909 
replication machinery is going to start
beyond<00:06:05.569> it<00:06:05.780> and<00:06:05.930> then<00:06:06.110> we<00:06:06.259> can<00:06:06.349> just<00:06:06.560> have<00:06:06.740> the

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
beyond it and then we can just have the

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:12.399 
beyond it and then we can just have the
replication<00:06:07.400> fork<00:06:07.580> continue<00:06:08.509> on<00:06:11.289> finally<00:06:12.289> we

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409 
replication fork continue on finally we

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:14.950 
replication fork continue on finally we
have<00:06:12.620> something<00:06:13.250> about<00:06:13.520> double<00:06:14.419> strand<00:06:14.630> break

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
have something about double strand break

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.499 
have something about double strand break
repair<00:06:14.990> without<00:06:15.669> homology<00:06:16.669> so<00:06:17.000> in<00:06:17.389> our

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
repair without homology so in our

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:19.570 
repair without homology so in our
previous<00:06:17.900> versions<00:06:18.650> we've<00:06:18.889> talked<00:06:19.400> about

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
previous versions we've talked about

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.999 
previous versions we've talked about
that<00:06:20.060> it<00:06:20.300> has<00:06:20.800> recombination<00:06:21.800> no

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.009 
that it has recombination no

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:23.920 
that it has recombination no
recombination<00:06:22.819> but<00:06:22.969> it's<00:06:23.150> always<00:06:23.330> using<00:06:23.840> a

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
recombination but it's always using a

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.260 
recombination but it's always using a
homologous<00:06:24.530> sequence<00:06:25.400> in<00:06:25.610> order<00:06:25.819> to<00:06:26.090> actually

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
homologous sequence in order to actually

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.959 
homologous sequence in order to actually
repair<00:06:26.990> the<00:06:27.530> double<00:06:27.800> strand<00:06:28.069> break<00:06:28.370> and<00:06:28.580> in

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:28.969 
repair the double strand break and in

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:32.490 
repair the double strand break and in
this<00:06:29.120> case<00:06:29.440> we're<00:06:30.440> going<00:06:30.620> to<00:06:30.740> be<00:06:31.009> using<00:06:31.789> no

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
this case we're going to be using no

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.640 
this case we're going to be using no
homologous<00:06:33.940> sequence<00:06:34.940> to<00:06:35.210> help<00:06:35.409> so<00:06:36.409> we<00:06:36.529> think

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
homologous sequence to help so we think

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.560 
homologous sequence to help so we think
of<00:06:36.770> this<00:06:36.919> as<00:06:37.159> being<00:06:37.370> in<00:06:37.880> a<00:06:37.969> case<00:06:38.210> where<00:06:38.419> there's

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
of this as being in a case where there's

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.180 
of this as being in a case where there's
no<00:06:38.750> home

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
no home

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.640 
no home
or<00:06:39.580> micro<00:06:40.270> homology<00:06:40.840> of<00:06:41.020> less<00:06:41.200> than<00:06:41.230> ten

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
or micro homology of less than ten

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.130 
or micro homology of less than ten
nucleotides<00:06:42.690> it's<00:06:43.690> also<00:06:43.870> called

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
nucleotides it's also called

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.230 
nucleotides it's also called
illegitimate<00:06:44.740> recombination<00:06:45.100> which<00:06:46.030> i<00:06:46.180> think

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
illegitimate recombination which i think

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.270 
illegitimate recombination which i think
is<00:06:46.540> really<00:06:46.690> funny<00:06:47.140> but<00:06:47.890> that's<00:06:48.040> because

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
is really funny but that's because

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.950 
is really funny but that's because
there's<00:06:48.490> no<00:06:48.640> homology<00:06:49.180> used<00:06:49.450> for<00:06:49.780> this

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
there's no homology used for this

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.410 
there's no homology used for this
recombination<00:06:50.850> so<00:06:51.850> non-homologous<00:06:52.390> end

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.420 
recombination so non-homologous end

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.290 
recombination so non-homologous end
joining<00:06:52.870> is<00:06:53.500> it<00:06:54.100> begins<00:06:54.490> with<00:06:54.700> of<00:06:54.940> course<00:06:55.090> our

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
joining is it begins with of course our

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.330 
joining is it begins with of course our
double-stranded<00:06:55.930> break<00:06:56.170> and<00:06:56.440> so<00:06:56.620> this<00:06:57.190> is

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
double-stranded break and so this is

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.680 
double-stranded break and so this is
just<00:06:57.520> showing<00:06:57.760> you<00:06:57.910> that<00:06:58.000> there's<00:06:58.150> a<00:06:58.420> double

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
just showing you that there's a double

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.660 
just showing you that there's a double
strand<00:06:58.960> break<00:06:59.260> and<00:06:59.470> there's<00:06:59.980> proteins<00:07:00.460> that

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:00.670 
strand break and there's proteins that

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.940 
strand break and there's proteins that
are<00:07:00.730> going<00:07:00.940> to<00:07:01.120> recognize<00:07:01.510> these<00:07:01.930> ends<00:07:02.470> just

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950 
are going to recognize these ends just

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.920 
are going to recognize these ends just
as<00:07:03.130> in<00:07:03.310> our<00:07:03.430> normal<00:07:03.640> double<00:07:04.420> strand<00:07:04.750> break

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
as in our normal double strand break

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.510 
as in our normal double strand break
repair<00:07:04.960> only<00:07:05.590> these<00:07:05.740> are<00:07:05.890> different<00:07:06.130> proteins

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
repair only these are different proteins

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.480 
repair only these are different proteins
so<00:07:07.210> it's<00:07:07.450> the<00:07:07.630> Kuh<00:07:07.900> proteins<00:07:08.440> the<00:07:08.770> COO<00:07:09.040> kayuu

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.490 
so it's the Kuh proteins the COO kayuu

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.030 
so it's the Kuh proteins the COO kayuu
proteins<00:07:10.240> will<00:07:10.540> bind<00:07:10.570> to<00:07:10.930> the<00:07:11.050> ends<00:07:11.440> and<00:07:11.590> it'll

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040 
proteins will bind to the ends and it'll

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.660 
proteins will bind to the ends and it'll
bring<00:07:12.280> it<00:07:12.460> close<00:07:12.730> together<00:07:13.560> once<00:07:14.560> the<00:07:15.130> ends
