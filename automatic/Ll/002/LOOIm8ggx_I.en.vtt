alright<00:00:01.680> so<00:00:01.979> we're<00:00:02.399> back<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.570> got<00:00:03.720> my

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
alright so we're back and I got my

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.519 
alright so we're back and I got my
thermal<00:00:04.350> paste<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:04.890> it's<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.220> tube<00:00:05.460> of<00:00:06.529> arctic

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
thermal paste and it's a tube of arctic

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.320 
thermal paste and it's a tube of arctic
silver<00:00:08.840> that<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.900> had<00:00:10.139> lying<00:00:10.440> around<00:00:11.330> white

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
silver that I had lying around white

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.620 
silver that I had lying around white
white<00:00:15.529> there<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:16.619> go<00:00:16.760> yea<00:00:17.760> high<00:00:18.150> density

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
white there we go yea high density

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.400 
white there we go yea high density
thermal<00:00:19.640> I've<00:00:20.640> always<00:00:20.850> been<00:00:21.510> told<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:22.199> you

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
thermal I've always been told that you

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.880 
thermal I've always been told that you
need<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.680> be<00:00:22.710> wary<00:00:23.010> with<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.430> stuff<00:00:23.699> because

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
need to be wary with this stuff because

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.769 
need to be wary with this stuff because
it<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.180> conductive<00:00:27.180> um<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:29.449> don't<00:00:30.449> know<00:00:30.660> if

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
it is conductive um I don't know if

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.430 
it is conductive um I don't know if
that's<00:00:30.990> true<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.470> never<00:00:31.500> tested<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.480> but<00:00:33.480> it's

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that's true I never tested it but it's

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.810 
that's true I never tested it but it's
so<00:00:34.649> silver<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:36.200> so<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.230> guess<00:00:37.820> polysynthetic

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
so silver on it so I guess polysynthetic

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.220 
so silver on it so I guess polysynthetic
sober<00:00:39.390> though<00:00:39.510> look<00:00:39.719> what<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> hell<00:00:40.110> does

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
sober though look what the hell does

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.700 
sober though look what the hell does

silver<00:00:49.700> suspended<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.820> plastic<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:53.360> don't

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
silver suspended in plastic but I don't

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.920 
silver suspended in plastic but I don't
know<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:55.309> think<00:00:56.309> silver<00:00:57.000> silver<00:00:57.570> should<00:00:57.809> be

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
know I think silver silver should be

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.950 
know I think silver silver should be
conductive<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:59.420> imagine<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.539> would<00:01:00.629> be<00:01:00.780> one

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
conductive I imagine that would be one

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.959 
conductive I imagine that would be one
of<00:01:01.079> its<00:01:01.199> properties<00:01:01.739> what<00:01:02.340> would<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.879> in

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
of its properties what would it be in

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:21.780 
of its properties what would it be in
the<00:01:03.000> middle

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.280 

there<00:01:22.790> are<00:01:22.910> so<00:01:23.090> many<00:01:23.240> different<00:01:23.360> schools<00:01:24.080> of

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
there are so many different schools of

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.530 
there are so many different schools of
thought<00:01:24.350> for<00:01:25.100> a<00:01:25.130> barn<00:01:25.610> thermal<00:01:26.030> paste<00:01:26.270> it's

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
thought for a barn thermal paste it's

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.240 
thought for a barn thermal paste it's
ridiculous<00:01:27.200> like<00:01:27.500> you<00:01:28.340> could<00:01:28.550> never<00:01:28.760> get<00:01:30.250> two

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
ridiculous like you could never get two

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.920 
ridiculous like you could never get two
people<00:01:31.730> to<00:01:31.940> agree<00:01:32.350> on<00:01:33.350> how<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.650> do<00:01:33.890> it<00:01:34.040> I

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
people to agree on how to do it I

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.230 
people to agree on how to do it I
personally<00:01:35.930> don't<00:01:36.560> have<00:01:36.860> an<00:01:37.010> opinion<00:01:37.340> because

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
personally don't have an opinion because

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.050 
personally don't have an opinion because
i<00:01:38.270> haven't<00:01:38.570> been<00:01:39.280> applying<00:01:40.280> thermal<00:01:40.640> paste

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
i haven't been applying thermal paste

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.940 
i haven't been applying thermal paste
long<00:01:41.450> enough<00:01:41.780> i've<00:01:41.960> only<00:01:42.140> had<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.560> apply<00:01:42.830> a

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
long enough i've only had to apply a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.930 
long enough i've only had to apply a
three<00:01:43.430> or<00:01:43.550> four<00:01:43.820> times<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:45.160> those<00:01:46.160> for<00:01:46.820> our

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
three or four times and those for our

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.990 
three or four times and those for our
systems<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.780> i<00:01:48.050> haven't<00:01:49.040> gotten<00:01:49.369> to<00:01:49.520> torture

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
systems that i haven't gotten to torture

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.859 
systems that i haven't gotten to torture
test<00:01:50.300> I<00:01:51.820> tested<00:01:52.820> them<00:01:52.940> regularly<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.570> I<00:01:53.750> knew

test I tested them regularly and I knew

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.400 
test I tested them regularly and I knew
they<00:01:54.020> perform<00:01:54.500> well<00:01:54.800> regularly<00:01:55.399> but<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:56.410> didn't

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
they perform well regularly but I didn't

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.430 
they perform well regularly but I didn't
set<00:01:57.740> him<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:58.040> prime<00:01:58.340> 95<00:01:58.790> for<00:01:59.479> seven<00:01:59.840> hours<00:01:59.930> with

set him a prime 95 for seven hours with

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.380 
set him a prime 95 for seven hours with
an<00:02:00.590> aggressive<00:02:00.890> overclock<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.940> see<00:02:02.180> whether

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
an aggressive overclock to see whether

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.230 
an aggressive overclock to see whether
or<00:02:02.570> not<00:02:02.690> it<00:02:02.869> would<00:02:02.960> hold<00:02:03.170> up<00:02:03.410> and<00:02:04.070> even<00:02:05.000> if<00:02:05.090> I

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
or not it would hold up and even if I

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.540 
or not it would hold up and even if I
did<00:02:05.270> I<00:02:05.540> wouldn't<00:02:05.899> exactly<00:02:06.110> be<00:02:06.560> sure<00:02:06.979> if<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:07.399> was

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
did I wouldn't exactly be sure if it was

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.520 
did I wouldn't exactly be sure if it was
the<00:02:07.850> thermal<00:02:08.239> paste<00:02:08.479> I<00:02:08.660> was<00:02:08.840> dealing<00:02:09.050> with<00:02:09.380> it

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
the thermal paste I was dealing with it

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.420 
the thermal paste I was dealing with it
was<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.770> problem<00:02:10.040> of<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.429> core<00:02:12.130> it's<00:02:13.130> just

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
was the problem of the core it's just

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.930 
was the problem of the core it's just
all<00:02:13.610> kinds<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.860> problems<00:02:15.860> with<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.520> testing

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
all kinds of problems with the testing

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.460 
all kinds of problems with the testing
methodology<00:02:17.570> that<00:02:17.600> you<00:02:17.840> would<00:02:17.959> have<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.260> deal

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
methodology that you would have to deal

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:28.690 
methodology that you would have to deal
with<00:02:26.140> my<00:02:27.140> guys<00:02:27.380> still<00:02:27.769> going<00:02:27.980> at<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.280> with<00:02:28.430> his

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
with my guys still going at it with his

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:38.440 
with my guys still going at it with his
would

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.229 

actually<00:02:39.379> I'll<00:02:39.530> probably<00:02:39.560> take<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.099> dry<00:02:41.000> one

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
actually I'll probably take a dry one

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.860 
actually I'll probably take a dry one
and<00:02:41.830> scoop<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:42.950> off<00:02:43.099> with<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:43.610> first<00:02:44.060> oh<00:02:44.480> it's

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
and scoop it off with this first oh it's

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.309 
and scoop it off with this first oh it's
got<00:02:44.989> a<00:02:45.050> raised<00:02:45.379> amount<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:47.420> make<00:02:47.599> contact<00:02:47.870> with
