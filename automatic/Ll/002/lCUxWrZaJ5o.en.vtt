00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.759
 like three bigger pieces if you go to the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.759
 mouth other noise 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.850
 well I'm talking about statements in 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.380
 The latest edition of Paula Magazine comes 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.330
 margarita javier to our juliette 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.770
 beautiful binoche 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.880
 beautiful as you put today and here background 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:37.130
 to absolutely talk about everything that 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.130
 television is macho 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.310
 and it was one of brutal honesty a 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.750
 brutal honesty interview but it's 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.790
 that I am honest brutal because I do not 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.680
 I have nothing to hide but because that 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.270
 this critic so much in mind that 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.910
 we were amazed because on twitter 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.110
 has generated high high reaction but 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.790
 I think it's because of that 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.040
 brutal honesty seeing that they criticized 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.010
 americans tell a bit because it was what 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.650
 what was a drop of broken 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.600
 some project to the bronze that gave 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.729
 back to the people how can you say that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.200
 it's good to start with the fact that 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.570
 I supposedly referred to myself in bad 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.270
 terms to other drivers 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.950
 obviously that what I explained to the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.600
 people who in five hours of interviews 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.160
 five hours he swore and I do not know how I 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.320
 I sat down but I was already drinking tea with 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.050
 lady with the with the journalist and 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.330
 I finally told him so many things about 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.000
 put them on three sheets and then 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.649
 obviously I would like him to go to 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.200
 juanjo sinus and what I say that average 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.840
 night was a fantastic thing 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.490
 and then they killed her but there are people who 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.430
 he is also compared to juliette 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.619
 binoche in this photo shoot of the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.619
 super paula magazine 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.770
 as for example asks the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.209
 journalist never married you say no 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.220
 but I lived with someone for five years 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.349
 myths like I say I'm separated because 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.860
 it's anti conquest to say you're single 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.319
 at 40 degrees a problem has happened to you 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.700
 they do not eat me I always say that I am 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.680
 single because I do not have any 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.299
 link when with this gentleman let's say I 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.310
 I'm single now but do not say 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:32.310
 You have something this girl but you 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.920
 you are clearly an intense woman more 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.660
 cerebral clear and super cerebral let's say 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.670
 but also when your trade 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.480
 I'm out now for example on Fridays 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.959

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.959
 free 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.690
 let's see 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.830
 something 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.300
 gypsy 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:38.210
 no man do not make a blind date 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.830
 It was not known like that, I remember a 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.930
 restaurant a role but to see a 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.910
 movie gives clamorous thanks to god that 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.910
 he likes but that with cool is the 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.640
 ideal situation we like the appointment so much 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.550
 romantic idea of ​​truth if we were going in 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.370
 anyone walking and conversing a good 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.980
 night after daisy with what attire 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.050
 you went as well as imagining yourself walking 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.050

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.560
 finally until the appointment was quick 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.450
 man for example if you are 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.300
 having a drink and a man this one wants 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.280
 know me the daisy and it's coming 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.159
 it would be his first sentence he would have for 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.310
 that you the institutional conscience hopefully 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:34.759
 something funny not manufactured and something 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.979
 totally natural and strange not 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.979
 I made those things, factory, not me alone 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.240
 morning 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.020
 how to take water lessons we have the 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.020
 statement studies look 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.419
 if I keep a bottle of drink at 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.479
 side that for me sex has to be 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:02.310
 with clear kisses with wind I do not want no 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.310
 but with the drink he loses 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:17.080
 nothing else 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:21.870
 the technique of life for this 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.870
 this program is called money like this 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.800
 why are they so again are 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.319
 fragments of the walk towards her 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.410
 I preferred morning sex, I like it 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:41.430
 but she preferred it and she very thrown 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.430
 I preferred everything 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.220
 daisies had a good time yesterday 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.220
 Gypsy curse was seen 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:00.340
