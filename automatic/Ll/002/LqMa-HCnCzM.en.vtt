 But with such a straightforward 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.990
 poster order guards would like it 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.399

 own goal he is available for journalists and 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.339
 kind of ready to answer any questions but 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.159
 when it comes to using 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.169

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:14.029
 the future can 19 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:15.189
 less than the CEC 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:16.519
 revealed about two hundred thousand 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.749
 invalid subscription lists this 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:20.489
 when one person made his 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.819
 autograph and for two and even my heterosexuals 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.339

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:26.139
 who by law don't even possess 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.479
 suffrage and yet companies 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.229
 initiative group recognized as successful 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.129
 failed 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.519
 what kidnapping initiatives 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:35.719
 about holding a republican 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:37.809
 referendum 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:40.809
 5 million 16 thousand signatures collected 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.799
 or 55 and 2 tenths of a percent 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.269
 the total number of citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.680
 and eligible to participate in 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.849
 republican referendum 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.179
 it is 25 times more than required by law 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:59.039
 and it was done as it turned out not just 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.929
 So 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:02.929
 in my announce and 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.039
 they wanted us 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.959
 most members of our society so 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.799
 to convince our next step 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.069
 president about the need 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.499
 holding a referendum 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.979
 convince the president is really worth 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.639
 he is against such an initiative 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.539
 at the same time access to Nazarbayev is ready and 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.610
 continue to govern the country but do it 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.439
 intends through elections they 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:25.780
 referendum but the desire of the head 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.129
 states don't count when people want 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:30.069
 so decided in the country's parliament it 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.059
 joint meeting of the Majilis and the Senate 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:34.379
 by majority vote deputies may 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:35.629
 overcome disagreements 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.029
 president by this legal right they 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:39.649
 benefited preferences can 

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:42.719
 be taken unanimously 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:44.550
 if we proceed from that 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.289
 that democracy in more people 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.520
 more than five million votes 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.330
 collected in support of the referendum more than 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.469
 eloquent fact expression of this 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:56.669
 categories and we are elected by the people 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.059
 we can not ignore our opinions 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:01.620
 voters 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.630
 such deputies are dishonoring the country 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.560
 in the eyes of the world community 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.960
 declare that people of moslems of kazakhstan 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.120

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.530
 public democracy 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.510
 the organization requires immediate 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.240
 resignation of parliament and a strong supporter 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.750

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.780

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.150
 portraits of those people 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.500
 really just a week to yourself 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.690
 impartial and to a certain extent 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.780
 but if certain moral damage 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.850
 Kazakhstan society is a virus 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.650
 The last meeting of the US ambassador to

 democratic voice of their country 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:58.749
 they should have more choices than 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:00.909
 just say yes or no some question 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:01.689

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:19.770
 these are our internal 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.169
 but in our inner nobody 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.520
 has the right to interfere 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.470
 in the same way the scales of the pros and cons 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.530
 lean in one way to the other 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.110
 the party decided to make its own contribution 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.199
 Nur Otan authorities announced the creation of 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.919
 coalition of democratic forces 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:35.960

 some opposition parties 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:47.460
 I'm like a politician 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.039
 but aside 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.439
 for each his own 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.490

 he is legal too so i 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:04.419
 not so easy 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:06.939
 if I agreed with our opinion 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:08.469
