00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the hydrometer will float let's begin

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.389 
the hydrometer will float let's begin
with<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> product<00:01:01.590> from<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> southwestern

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
with a product from the southwestern

with a product from the southwestern
United<00:01:02.789> States<00:01:14.390> as<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.409> this

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
United States as you can see this

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.080 
United States as you can see this
product<00:01:17.009> barely<00:01:17.400> registers<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
product barely registers on the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.090 
product barely registers on the

and one

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.910 
and one
this<00:01:21.570> demonstrates<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.259> there<00:01:22.470> are<00:01:22.590> few<00:01:22.890> if

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
this demonstrates that there are few if

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.649 
this demonstrates that there are few if
any<00:01:23.070> minerals<00:01:23.759> found<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.270> product

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
any minerals found in this product

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.359 
any minerals found in this product
because<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.049> liquid<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.740> diluted<00:01:25.979> with

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
because the liquid is so diluted with

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:35.690 
because the liquid is so diluted with
water<00:01:33.470> now<00:01:34.470> let's<00:01:34.770> measure<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.220> sample<00:01:35.579> from

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
water now let's measure the sample from

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:45.260 
water now let's measure the sample from
the<00:01:35.820> northwestern<00:01:36.420> United<00:01:36.689> States

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.160 

we<00:01:46.270> can<00:01:46.390> see<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.870> mineral

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
we can see that the mineral

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.110 
we can see that the mineral
concentration<00:01:47.800> is<00:01:47.950> slightly<00:01:48.550> higher<00:01:48.760> in<00:01:48.970> this

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
concentration is slightly higher in this

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.190 
concentration is slightly higher in this
product<00:01:49.510> with<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.660> measurement<00:01:50.020> of

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
product with a measurement of

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.010 
product with a measurement of
approximately<00:01:51.130> 1<00:01:51.370> although<00:01:52.300> this<00:01:52.630> liquid

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
approximately 1 although this liquid

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.780 
approximately 1 although this liquid
definitely<00:01:53.500> has<00:01:53.650> a<00:01:53.680> better<00:01:53.980> mineral<00:01:54.370> content

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
definitely has a better mineral content

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.190 
definitely has a better mineral content
than<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:54.970> competitor<00:01:55.450> from<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.690> Southwest

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
than the competitor from the Southwest

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.680 
than the competitor from the Southwest
the<00:01:56.770> product<00:01:57.160> is<00:01:57.250> still<00:01:57.370> very<00:01:57.880> low<00:01:58.180> in<00:01:58.330> overall

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
the product is still very low in overall

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.310 
the product is still very low in overall
minerals<00:02:00.120> now<00:02:01.120> let's<00:02:01.360> measure<00:02:01.510> our<00:02:01.840> product

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
minerals now let's measure our product

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:28.590 
minerals now let's measure our product
pure<00:02:03.070> fulvic<00:02:03.580> minerals<00:02:26.910> as<00:02:27.910> we<00:02:28.120> can<00:02:28.270> see<00:02:28.480> this

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
pure fulvic minerals as we can see this

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.510 
pure fulvic minerals as we can see this
is<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.900> much<00:02:29.140> more<00:02:29.380> potent<00:02:29.770> product<00:02:30.010> measuring

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
is a much more potent product measuring

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.040 
is a much more potent product measuring
about<00:02:30.700> 80<00:02:31.030> on<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.330> hydrometer

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
about 80 on the hydrometer

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.020 
about 80 on the hydrometer
this<00:02:32.650> indicates<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.340> pure<00:02:33.640> full<00:02:33.850> of

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
this indicates that pure full of

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.270 
this indicates that pure full of
minerals<00:02:34.209> is<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:35.110> much<00:02:35.350> more<00:02:35.560> potent<00:02:35.920> product

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
minerals is a much more potent product

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.120 
minerals is a much more potent product
compared<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.760> its<00:02:36.880> competitors<00:02:37.920> what<00:02:38.920> this

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
compared to its competitors what this

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.949
