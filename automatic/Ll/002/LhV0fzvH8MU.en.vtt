the the airport engine is designed to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.819 
the the airport engine is designed to
run<00:00:38.190> cool<00:00:38.520> water<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.480> know<00:00:39.629> from<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> sea<00:00:40.170> so

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
run cool water you know from the sea so

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.670 
run cool water you know from the sea so
it's<00:00:41.340> always<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:42.660> know<00:00:42.690> running<00:00:43.079> nice<00:00:43.410> and

pistons and all that sort of stuff so

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.720 
pistons and all that sort of stuff so
it's<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.350> bit<00:00:52.500> more<00:00:52.649> tricky<00:00:52.920> when<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.370> put<00:00:53.579> it

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it's a bit more tricky when you put it

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.920 
it's a bit more tricky when you put it
into<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.300> setup<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.890> they<00:00:56.070> did<00:00:56.930> did

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
into this setup and what they did did

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.010 
into this setup and what they did did
around<00:00:58.289> Kim<00:00:59.070> they<00:00:59.820> made<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.420> magnesium

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
around Kim they made up a magnesium

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.820 
around Kim they made up a magnesium
belly<00:01:01.410> pan<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.070> which<00:01:02.789> was<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.409> long<00:01:04.409> tray

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
belly pan and which was like a long tray

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.730 
belly pan and which was like a long tray
and<00:01:05.220> that's<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.360> motor<00:01:06.570> sat<00:01:06.900> Bolton<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.500> top

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and that's the motor sat Bolton on top

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.980 
and that's the motor sat Bolton on top
of<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.820> gearbox<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> back

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
of that and the gearbox it's on the back

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.609 
of that and the gearbox it's on the back
of<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:11.299> that<00:01:12.299> motor<00:01:12.659> pan<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.320> filled

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
of it and that that motor pan is filled

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.789 
of it and that that motor pan is filled
with<00:01:13.770> water<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.210> holds<00:01:15.420> about<00:01:15.720> about<00:01:16.470> five

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
with water so it holds about about five

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.160 
with water so it holds about about five
five<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.610> half<00:01:17.640> liters<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.270> know<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.049> it's

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
five and a half liters you know so it's

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.020 
five and a half liters you know so it's
a<00:01:19.259> fair<00:01:19.680> amount<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.950> water<00:01:20.130> trying<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.759> keep<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
a fair amount of water trying to keep it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.780 
a fair amount of water trying to keep it
cool<00:01:22.580> see<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:25.070> two<00:01:26.070> cylinders<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.670> the

inlet<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.869> that's<00:02:10.080> driven

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
inlet but that's driven

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.600 
inlet but that's driven
it<00:02:11.810> has<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.349> drive<00:02:12.620> at<00:02:12.769> right<00:02:12.950> angles<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.400> the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
it has to drive at right angles to the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.210 
it has to drive at right angles to the
crankshaft<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.480> instead<00:02:15.349> of<00:02:15.500> using<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.860> bevel

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
crankshaft and instead of using a bevel

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.399 
crankshaft and instead of using a bevel
gear<00:02:16.459> they<00:02:16.670> used<00:02:16.909> a<00:02:17.030> basically<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.540> simple<00:02:18.080> idea

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
gear they used a basically a simple idea

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.320 
gear they used a basically a simple idea
with<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.830> toothed<00:02:19.069> valve<00:02:19.870> just<00:02:20.870> running

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
with the toothed valve just running

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.030 
with the toothed valve just running
around<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.659> couple<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:23.989> rollers<00:02:24.200> through<00:02:24.680> 90

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
around a couple of rollers through 90

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.920 
around a couple of rollers through 90
degrees<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.760> get<00:02:25.879> the<00:02:26.030> drive<00:02:26.299> to<00:02:26.599> the<00:02:26.720> belt

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
degrees to get the drive to the belt

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.740 
degrees to get the drive to the belt
yeah<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:28.280> they<00:02:28.459> render<00:02:28.879> two<00:02:29.060> into<00:02:29.269> one<00:02:29.299> exhaust

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
yeah so they render two into one exhaust

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.110 
yeah so they render two into one exhaust
pipes<00:02:30.049> because<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.190> was<00:02:31.310> more<00:02:31.489> convenient

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
pipes because that was more convenient

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.150 
pipes because that was more convenient
if<00:02:32.269> you<00:02:32.390> rent<00:02:32.629> for<00:02:32.989> probably<00:02:33.799> wouldn't<00:02:34.010> have

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
if you rent for probably wouldn't have

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.580 
if you rent for probably wouldn't have
any<00:02:34.310> room<00:02:34.580> but<00:02:35.299> I<00:02:35.360> don't<00:02:35.629> think<00:02:35.870> they<00:02:36.019> found<00:02:36.379> a

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
any room but I don't think they found a

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.059 
any room but I don't think they found a
great<00:02:36.799> difference<00:02:37.069> in<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:38.860> difference<00:02:39.860> in

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
great difference in the difference in

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.289 
great difference in the difference in
pay<00:02:40.310> our<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.700> know<00:02:40.819> if<00:02:40.970> you've<00:02:41.090> got<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.239> short

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
pay our you know if you've got a short

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.420 
pay our you know if you've got a short
man<00:02:41.989> orthotic<00:02:42.500> probably<00:02:42.829> doesn't<00:02:43.099> make<00:02:43.220> too

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
man orthotic probably doesn't make too

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.479 
man orthotic probably doesn't make too
much<00:02:43.459> difference<00:02:46.569> yeah<00:02:47.620> but<00:02:48.620> another<00:02:49.250> thing

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
much difference yeah but another thing

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.069 
much difference yeah but another thing
too<00:02:49.760> was<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.060> if<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.599> look<00:02:50.750> at<00:02:50.870> those

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
too was that if you look at those

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.800 
too was that if you look at those
exhaust<00:02:51.530> pipe<00:02:51.799> see<00:02:52.129> that<00:02:52.940> one<00:02:53.150> stage<00:02:53.450> Kim

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
exhaust pipe see that one stage Kim

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.890 
exhaust pipe see that one stage Kim
tried<00:02:54.170> them<00:02:54.640> hooked<00:02:55.640> up<00:02:55.849> to<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.209> throttle<00:02:56.569> and

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
tried them hooked up to the throttle and

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.949 
tried them hooked up to the throttle and
as<00:02:57.799> you<00:02:58.010> make<00:02:58.190> exhaust<00:02:58.609> pipes<00:02:58.940> longer<00:02:59.510> gives

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
as you make exhaust pipes longer gives

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.490 
as you make exhaust pipes longer gives
more<00:03:00.500> low<00:03:00.739> damp<00:03:01.040> air<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:02.480> short<00:03:02.959> them<00:03:03.109> up<00:03:03.290> it

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
more low damp air and short them up it

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.369 
more low damp air and short them up it
makes<00:03:04.099> it<00:03:04.280> very<00:03:04.370> hard<00:03:04.700> ER<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.390> Kim<00:03:06.019> had<00:03:06.230> it

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
makes it very hard ER and Kim had it

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.949 
makes it very hard ER and Kim had it
hooked<00:03:06.650> up<00:03:06.890> with<00:03:07.069> a<00:03:07.129> set<00:03:07.430> up<00:03:07.579> on<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.720> throttle

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
hooked up with a set up on the throttle

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.729 
hooked up with a set up on the throttle
which<00:03:09.859> as<00:03:10.069> you<00:03:10.220> turned<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.640> on<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:11.140> he<00:03:12.140> pulled

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
which as you turned it on it he pulled

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.619 
which as you turned it on it he pulled
the<00:03:12.859> pipes<00:03:13.099> forward<00:03:13.640> and<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:13.910> gave<00:03:14.209> it<00:03:14.359> really

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
the pipes forward and it gave it really

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.379 
the pipes forward and it gave it really
good<00:03:14.780> pair<00:03:15.019> up<00:03:15.290> top<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:16.239> unfortunately<00:03:17.239> it

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
good pair up top and unfortunately it

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.520 
good pair up top and unfortunately it
was<00:03:17.510> very<00:03:17.750> heavy<00:03:18.049> on<00:03:18.169> the<00:03:18.319> throttle<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:20.530> if

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
was very heavy on the throttle and if

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.140 
was very heavy on the throttle and if
you<00:03:21.829> were<00:03:21.919> doing<00:03:22.069> it<00:03:22.250> today<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.609> do<00:03:22.910> with<00:03:23.030> an

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
you were doing it today you do with an

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.379 
you were doing it today you do with an
electric<00:03:23.540> servomotor<00:03:23.959> you<00:03:24.440> know<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.940> I

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
electric servomotor you know and I

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.720 
electric servomotor you know and I
suppose<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:27.680> could<00:03:27.859> probably<00:03:28.130> only<00:03:28.340> do<00:03:28.609> it

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
suppose you could probably only do it

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.979 
suppose you could probably only do it
with<00:03:28.849> this<00:03:28.970> type<00:03:29.269> of<00:03:29.419> motor<00:03:29.630> with<00:03:29.870> the

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
with this type of motor with the

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.500 
with this type of motor with the
straight<00:03:30.319> head<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.769> pipes<00:03:31.010> on<00:03:31.370> other<00:03:32.060> bikes

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
straight head of pipes on other bikes

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.509 
straight head of pipes on other bikes
with<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.870> curves<00:03:33.200> pipe<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:33.889> to<00:03:33.950> be<00:03:34.160> probably<00:03:34.459> a

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
with the curves pipe so to be probably a

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.460 
with the curves pipe so to be probably a
little<00:03:34.579> bit<00:03:34.819> awkward<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.209> do<00:03:35.480> because<00:03:36.380> you

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
little bit awkward to do because you

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.780 
little bit awkward to do because you
couldn't<00:03:36.739> shorten<00:03:37.160> that<00:03:37.310> have<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.519> be<00:03:37.669> in<00:03:37.730> a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
couldn't shorten that have to be in a

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.089 
couldn't shorten that have to be in a
straight<00:03:38.090> line<00:03:38.359> and<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:39.680> course<00:03:39.889> they're

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
straight line and of course they're

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.800 
straight line and of course they're
doing<00:03:40.370> that<00:03:40.489> now<00:03:40.700> with<00:03:40.910> pal<00:03:41.150> valves<00:03:41.569> getting

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
doing that now with pal valves getting

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.220 
doing that now with pal valves getting
the<00:03:41.900> same<00:03:42.139> effect<00:03:42.349> you<00:03:42.709> know<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:44.510> even<00:03:44.840> so<00:03:45.079> we

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
the same effect you know that even so we

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.870 
the same effect you know that even so we
can<00:03:45.410> still<00:03:45.680> adjust<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:46.130> pipes<00:03:46.370> in<00:03:46.609> and<00:03:46.760> out

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
can still adjust the pipes in and out

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.940 
can still adjust the pipes in and out
you<00:03:47.389> know<00:03:47.419> for<00:03:47.780> whichever<00:03:48.019> circuit<00:03:48.560> we<00:03:48.650> wanted

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
you know for whichever circuit we wanted

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.949 
you know for whichever circuit we wanted
to<00:03:49.040> go<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.250> be<00:03:50.150> nice<00:03:50.329> a<00:03:50.359> bit<00:03:50.599> a<00:03:50.870> pair<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.290> them

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
to go to be nice a bit a pair of them

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.569 
to go to be nice a bit a pair of them
but<00:03:53.959> it's<00:03:54.139> good<00:03:54.379> you<00:03:54.620> know<00:03:54.739> like<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.129> racing

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
but it's good you know like the racing

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.460 
but it's good you know like the racing
really<00:03:55.760> because<00:03:56.269> when<00:03:56.419> you<00:03:56.540> go<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.750> meetings<00:03:57.319> I

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
really because when you go to meetings I

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.199 
really because when you go to meetings I
mean<00:03:57.500> it's<00:03:57.769> fantastic<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.579> see<00:03:58.790> some<00:03:59.000> of<00:03:59.090> these

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
mean it's fantastic to see some of these

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.559 
mean it's fantastic to see some of these
old<00:03:59.450> bikes<00:03:59.629> out<00:03:59.959> there<00:04:01.209> because<00:04:02.209> they're

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
old bikes out there because they're

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.240 
old bikes out there because they're
fairly<00:04:02.750> unique<00:04:03.169> they're<00:04:03.410> all<00:04:03.530> different<00:04:03.859> you
