00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.260 
minute what are images by the menu order
so<00:01:59.979> this<00:02:00.159> is<00:02:00.310> our<00:02:00.490> menu<00:02:00.880> that<00:02:01.030> we're<00:02:01.119> talking

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
so this is our menu that we're talking

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.029 
so this is our menu that we're talking
about<00:02:01.689> okay<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:04.390> then<00:02:04.990> we<00:02:05.110> could<00:02:05.259> do<00:02:05.799> it<00:02:05.920> by

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
about okay and then we could do it by

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.250 
about okay and then we could do it by
title<00:02:06.459> or<00:02:06.580> date<00:02:06.789> etc<00:02:07.259> just<00:02:08.259> leave<00:02:08.440> menu<00:02:08.739> order

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
title or date etc just leave menu order

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
title or date etc just leave menu order
typically<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.349> think<00:02:11.590> this<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:11.739> set<00:02:12.130> to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
typically I think this is set to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.650 
typically I think this is set to
ascending<00:02:12.790> so<00:02:13.000> let's<00:02:13.150> go<00:02:13.269> ahead<00:02:13.299> and<00:02:13.420> leave

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
ascending so let's go ahead and leave

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.330 
ascending so let's go ahead and leave
that<00:02:13.720> for<00:02:14.260> now<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.709> means<00:02:14.859> it<00:02:15.010> will<00:02:15.100> start

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
that for now so that means it will start

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.860 
that for now so that means it will start
at<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.489> bottom<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.970> ascend<00:02:16.359> up<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:16.750> this

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
at the bottom and ascend up so this

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.930 
at the bottom and ascend up so this
should<00:02:17.290> be<00:02:17.320> our<00:02:17.470> first<00:02:17.920> image<00:02:18.310> in<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.549> gallery

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
should be our first image in the gallery

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.080 
should be our first image in the gallery
and<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:20.160> gallery<00:02:21.160> columns<00:02:21.579> how<00:02:21.730> many<00:02:21.910> columns

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
and the gallery columns how many columns

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.349 
and the gallery columns how many columns
do<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.480> want<00:02:23.549> typically<00:02:24.549> I<00:02:24.640> said<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:25.030> think

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
do you want typically I said I think

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:26.729 
do you want typically I said I think
this<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.510> set<00:02:25.780> for<00:02:25.989> three<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:26.410> we'll<00:02:26.530> go<00:02:26.680> ahead

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
this is set for three so we'll go ahead

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.130 
this is set for three so we'll go ahead
and<00:02:26.829> leave<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.329> okay<00:02:28.329> so<00:02:28.390> let's<00:02:28.660> insert<00:02:28.959> the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
and leave that okay so let's insert the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.949 
and leave that okay so let's insert the
gallery<00:02:30.900> okay<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:31.959> here<00:02:32.530> you'll<00:02:33.310> notice<00:02:33.519> that

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
gallery okay so here you'll notice that

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.479 
gallery okay so here you'll notice that
you<00:02:34.959> do<00:02:35.140> not<00:02:35.290> actually<00:02:35.650> see<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.010> representation

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
you do not actually see a representation

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.370 
you do not actually see a representation
of<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:36.970> gallery<00:02:37.420> even<00:02:37.810> though<00:02:37.930> we're<00:02:38.079> in<00:02:38.109> a

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
of the gallery even though we're in a

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.800 
of the gallery even though we're in a
WYSIWYG<00:02:38.799> editor<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:39.850> is<00:02:40.030> all<00:02:40.209> that<00:02:40.389> you<00:02:40.540> will

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
ever see and if we go to the HTML view

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.229 
ever see and if we go to the HTML view
will<00:02:44.769> see<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.040> short<00:02:45.280> code<00:02:45.430> for<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.030> that's

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
will see the short code for it so that's

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.750 
will see the short code for it so that's
our<00:02:46.389> gallery<00:02:46.750> shortcode<00:02:47.609> remember<00:02:48.609> we

can change the order around up here if
you<00:03:31.599> like<00:03:32.250> let's<00:03:33.250> change<00:03:33.489> some<00:03:33.700> things<00:03:33.730> down

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
you like let's change some things down

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.670 
you like let's change some things down
here<00:03:34.299> let's<00:03:34.480> switch<00:03:34.720> this<00:03:34.870> from<00:03:35.049> image<00:03:35.470> file

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
here let's switch this from image file

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.059 
here let's switch this from image file
to<00:03:35.980> attachment<00:03:36.579> page<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.959> now<00:03:38.139> when<00:03:38.470> someone

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
to attachment page so now when someone

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.460 
to attachment page so now when someone
clicks<00:03:39.220> on<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.549> thumbnail<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.870> go<00:03:41.019> to<00:03:41.079> a<00:03:41.200> page

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
clicks on a thumbnail to go to a page

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.440 
clicks on a thumbnail to go to a page
that<00:03:41.500> looks<00:03:41.739> like<00:03:41.950> another<00:03:42.340> blog<00:03:42.670> page<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.420> you

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
that looks like another blog page so you

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.180 
that looks like another blog page so you
know<00:03:43.989> definitely<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.470> you're<00:03:44.709> on<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:44.980> blog

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
know definitely that you're on the blog

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.740 
know definitely that you're on the blog
at<00:03:45.459> that<00:03:45.609> point<00:03:46.769> keep<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.920> menu<00:03:48.190> order<00:03:48.400> and

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
at that point keep the menu order and

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.059 
at that point keep the menu order and
let's<00:03:49.750> change<00:03:49.959> this<00:03:50.109> from<00:03:50.260> sending<00:03:50.920> to

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
let's change this from sending to

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.460 
let's change this from sending to
descending<00:03:51.940> so<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.690> means<00:03:52.870> we<00:03:53.109> should<00:03:53.290> start

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
descending so that means we should start

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.530 
descending so that means we should start
at<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.650> top<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:53.889> descend<00:03:54.459> down<00:03:54.700> alright<00:03:55.299> so

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
at the top and descend down alright so

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.229 
at the top and descend down alright so
this<00:03:55.690> is<00:03:55.900> should<00:03:56.200> be<00:03:56.319> the<00:03:56.470> first<00:03:57.090> image<00:03:58.090> that

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
this is should be the first image that

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.809 
this is should be the first image that
