people<00:00:13.889> come<00:00:14.100> to<00:00:14.160> your<00:00:14.400> website<00:00:14.610> from<00:00:15.360> an

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
people come to your website from an

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.660

iPhone or an iPod or an iPad iPhones and

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.029 
iPhone or an iPod or an iPad iPhones and
iPads<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.539> different<00:00:22.050> sized<00:00:22.259> screens<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.009> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
iPads have different sized screens so a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.339 
iPads have different sized screens so a
standard<00:00:23.580> screen<00:00:24.119> website<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.869> not<00:00:25.169> always

standard screen website is not always
suitable<00:00:26.119> to<00:00:27.119> view<00:00:27.390> because<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.320> information

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
suitable to view because the information

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.349 
suitable to view because the information
is<00:00:28.830> too<00:00:29.070> small<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.609> need<00:00:29.759> to<00:00:29.880> zoom<00:00:30.089> in<00:00:30.210> and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
is too small and you need to zoom in and

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.990 
is too small and you need to zoom in and
out<00:00:30.449> or<00:00:30.689> there's<00:00:30.900> lots<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.199> scrolling

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
out or there's lots of scrolling

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.330 
out or there's lots of scrolling
involved<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.860> want<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.160> make<00:00:35.220> a
