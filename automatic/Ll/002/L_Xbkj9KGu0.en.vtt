00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.580
 how about friends welcome in this video 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.400
 let's see how to identify how to know 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.039
 I loved her the direction of our sun 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.700
 and xperia z the address more than 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.949
 big traits is then let's say the DNA of 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.640
 our phone means that it is a 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:30.460
 address that the manufacturer put in the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.830
 telephone at the time of manufacture 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.630
 and that is unique to each device or 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.710
 be there are not two phones with the 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.770
 same mac address good we're going to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:47.329
 applications adjustments and in adjustment we 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:50.149
 we go to wifi on wifi we have here 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.370
 this little button with three squares 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.739
 we press that it seems that it is nothing but 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.079
 we press and it puts advanced good we go 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.609
 advanced and advanced we have here 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:04.030
 the mac address which is a series of 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.030
 numbers and letters 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.950
 the bad exagente that is called and that they are going to 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.290
 identify our phone our 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.119
 mobile device the computer is useful or 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.030
 you have to know the address plus it's useful 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.490
 for when we are on a wifi network that 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.770
 is controlled by how it has 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.780
 authorization for more then nothing with this 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.820
 process we know our mac is the 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.790
 we tell the administrator of that wifi network 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.770
 or who controls that access point of 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.330
 wifi network so that it adds our 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.540
 more direction and that is any of the 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.580
 authorized to that network that as I say for 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.979
 some network that we are going to enter by the 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.970
 that we have at home in our 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.480
 router we can 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.910
 configure the router and do that only 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.970
 can access the wifi network and a series 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:54.030
 of mac addresses and that one of them 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.100
 be ours of course and good 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.980
 securing well enough what is the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.380
 access to the wifi network so that they do not enter 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.960
 other intruders or people who are not from 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.550
 our environment so good I hope that 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.410
 This is useful to know in the 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.110
 direction plus what and how to identify them 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:14.010
 and it's good to say that we have done this 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.890
 4.2.2 elche with living for 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.750
 experience and nothing more friends I hope that 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.750
 it is useful and until the next video
