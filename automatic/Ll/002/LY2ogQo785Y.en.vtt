00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
have been terrorized by the al-qaeda I

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.490 
have been terrorized by the al-qaeda I
think<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:41.550> it<00:03:42.550> shows<00:03:42.790> what<00:03:43.060> a<00:03:43.090> nuts<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.660> put

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
think that it shows what a nuts to put

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.080 
think that it shows what a nuts to put
that<00:03:44.650> in<00:03:44.800> a<00:03:44.860> game<00:03:45.100> especially<00:03:45.670> with<00:03:46.030> the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
that in a game especially with the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.080 
that in a game especially with the
controversy<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:47.190> EA<00:03:48.190> are<00:03:48.610> gonna<00:03:48.820> deal<00:03:49.060> with

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
controversy that EA are gonna deal with

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.550 
controversy that EA are gonna deal with
and<00:03:49.450> I<00:03:49.510> think<00:03:49.540> that's<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.990> thing<00:03:50.140> we<00:03:50.290> need<00:03:50.320> to

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
and I think that's the thing we need to

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.590 
and I think that's the thing we need to
remember<00:03:50.830> is<00:03:51.130> that<00:03:51.760> there<00:03:51.940> are<00:03:52.209> going<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.480> be

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
remember is that there are going to be

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.840 
remember is that there are going to be
