soon<00:01:42.420> as<00:01:42.540> they<00:01:42.630> kill<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:42.990> guy<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.229> guy's

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
soon as they kill this guy this guy's

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.810 
soon as they kill this guy this guy's
going<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.829> get<00:01:43.950> antsy<00:01:44.189> he's<00:01:44.340> going<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.579> go<00:01:44.670> like

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
going to get antsy he's going to go like

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.700 
going to get antsy he's going to go like
this<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:45.659> he's<00:01:45.810> going<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.049> probably<00:01:46.290> smoke

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
this then he's going to probably smoke

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.230 
this then he's going to probably smoke
the<00:01:46.799> doors<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.340> he<00:01:47.520> did<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.030> you'll

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the doors just like he did and you'll

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.789 
the doors just like he did and you'll
just<00:01:48.869> peek<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.380> shoot<00:01:49.500> them<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.740> back

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
just peek out and shoot them in the back

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.639 
just peek out and shoot them in the back
so<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.670> you're<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.820> lurker<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.649> that

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
so if you're the lurker in that

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.139 
so if you're the lurker in that
situation<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.340> look<00:01:53.549> your<00:01:53.700> teammates<00:01:54.000> got

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
situation like look your teammates got

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.969 
situation like look your teammates got
that<00:01:54.329> kill<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.630> cat<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.530> that's<00:01:55.649> probably

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
that kill on cat and that's probably

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.440 
that kill on cat and that's probably
exactly<00:01:56.130> what<00:01:56.490> would<00:01:56.700> happen<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.180> let<00:01:57.329> your

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
exactly what would happen so let your

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.660 
exactly what would happen so let your
teammates<00:01:57.780> initiate<00:01:58.290> first<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.829> those<00:01:59.399> four

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
teammates initiate first in those four

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.550 
teammates initiate first in those four
befores<00:02:00.030> unless<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.540> see<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.869> golden

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
befores unless you see like a golden

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.469 
befores unless you see like a golden
opportunity<00:02:01.729> but<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:03.030> had<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> great

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
opportunity but you had a great

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.090 
opportunity but you had a great
opportunity<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.140> had<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> good<00:02:04.530> read<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.950> come

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
opportunity you had a good read to come

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.800 
opportunity you had a good read to come
out<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:05.280> but<00:02:06.149> then<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.420> should<00:02:06.479> have<00:02:06.689> just

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
out here but then you should have just

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.119 
out here but then you should have just
hid<00:02:07.020> behind<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.380> blue<00:02:07.530> bin<00:02:07.649> as<00:02:07.829> soon<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.069> you

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
hid behind the blue bin as soon as you

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.830 
hid behind the blue bin as soon as you
saw<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.550> could<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.629> almost

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
saw that you could have and I almost

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.910 
saw that you could have and I almost
guarantee<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.229> would<00:02:10.410> want<00:02:10.619> that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
guarantee you would want that

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.010 
guarantee you would want that
so<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:12.090> doesn't<00:02:12.300> make<00:02:12.360> much<00:02:12.510> sense<00:02:12.569> if<00:02:12.900> you're

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
so it doesn't make much sense if you're

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.180 
so it doesn't make much sense if you're
going<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.200> be<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.349> main<00:02:13.530> opera<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:13.890> your<00:02:14.040> team

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
going to be the main opera on your team

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.370 
going to be the main opera on your team
for<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.610> go<00:02:14.700> along<00:02:14.849> every<00:02:15.300> round<00:02:15.480> like

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
for you to go along every round like

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.339 
for you to go along every round like
you're<00:02:16.560> severely<00:02:16.890> limited<00:02:17.489> right<00:02:18.170> if<00:02:19.170> you're

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
you're severely limited right if you're

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.690 
you're severely limited right if you're
the<00:02:19.440> main<00:02:19.590> operator<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.010> want<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.250> be<00:02:20.340> able<00:02:20.459> to

the main operator you want to be able to

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.800 
the main operator you want to be able to
control<00:02:21.120> map<00:02:21.360> control<00:02:21.810> with<00:02:22.050> your<00:02:22.140> team<00:02:22.349> and

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.050 
for them or get them to a spot where
they<00:02:31.530> could<00:02:31.680> easily<00:02:31.830> execute<00:02:32.520> on<00:02:32.700> their<00:02:32.880> own

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
they could easily execute on their own

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.030 
they could easily execute on their own
and<00:02:33.360> then<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.600> cover<00:02:33.780> them<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.260> then<00:02:34.800> play

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
and then you cover them and then play

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.580 
and then you cover them and then play
post<00:02:35.280> point<00:02:35.580> positions<00:02:35.989> but<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.140> go<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.410> long

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
post point positions but you go in long

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.100 
post point positions but you go in long
a<00:02:37.620> every<00:02:38.040> round<00:02:38.250> with<00:02:38.430> off<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:39.030> just<00:02:39.420> pretty

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
a every round with off is just pretty

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.190 
a every round with off is just pretty
nonsensical<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.010> need<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.720> be<00:02:42.720> with<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.170> team

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
nonsensical you need to be with the team

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.570 
nonsensical you need to be with the team
more<00:02:43.650> if<00:02:43.830> you're<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.130> be<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.370> made

like a pet peeve of mine when people do
all<00:03:32.340> run<00:03:32.579> site<00:03:32.790> like<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.030> doesn't<00:03:33.180> take<00:03:33.359> for

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
all run site like it doesn't take for

people to plan it only takes one person
so<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.000> gotta<00:03:36.359> have<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.630> proper<00:03:36.989> spacing<00:03:37.230> so

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
so you gotta have that proper spacing so

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.110 
so you gotta have that proper spacing so
after<00:03:37.920> watching<00:03:38.190> your<00:03:38.400> teesside<00:03:38.730> like<00:03:38.940> you

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
after watching your teesside like you

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.390 
after watching your teesside like you
hit<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.510> majority<00:03:40.019> of<00:03:40.049> your<00:03:40.260> shots<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:41.250> have

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
hit the majority of your shots you have

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.250 
hit the majority of your shots you have
a<00:03:41.430> good<00:03:41.670> shot<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.510> problem<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:42.959> you're

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
a good shot the problem that you're

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.740 
a good shot the problem that you're
having<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.859> your<00:03:44.130> positioning<00:03:44.609> you're<00:03:45.299> not<00:03:45.540> in

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
having is your positioning you're not in

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.270 
having is your positioning you're not in
spots<00:03:46.109> that<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.410> could<00:03:46.650> really<00:03:46.859> impact<00:03:47.130> the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
spots that you could really impact the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.699 
spots that you could really impact the
game<00:03:47.519> like<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.880> should<00:03:48.120> be<00:03:48.239> able<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.930> kind

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
game like you should be able to and kind

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.170 
game like you should be able to and kind
of<00:03:49.739> take<00:03:49.920> over<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.370> you're<00:03:50.760> kind<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.030> playing

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
of take over it you're kind of playing

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.809 
of take over it you're kind of playing
spots<00:03:51.630> were<00:03:51.870> like<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:53.370> could<00:03:53.519> just<00:03:53.609> have<00:03:53.790> a

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
spots were like you could just have a

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.000 
spots were like you could just have a
lurker<00:03:54.090> play<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.709> be<00:03:55.709> much<00:03:55.980> more<00:03:56.190> successful

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
lurker play and be much more successful

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.229 
lurker play and be much more successful
so<00:03:59.010> your<00:03:59.160> positioning<00:03:59.609> needs<00:03:59.790> like<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.000> lot<00:04:00.209> of

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
so your positioning needs like a lot of

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.330 
so your positioning needs like a lot of
work<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:01.590> got<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.739> put<00:04:01.890> yourself<00:04:01.980> in

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
work you got to put yourself in

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.280 
work you got to put yourself in
positions<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.120> succeed<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.660> help<00:04:04.049> the<00:04:04.140> team

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
positions to succeed and help the team

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.370 
positions to succeed and help the team
as<00:04:04.410> much<00:04:04.530> as<00:04:04.650> possible<00:04:05.030> I<00:04:06.030> try<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:07.019> look<00:04:07.200> at<00:04:07.350> a

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
as much as possible I try to look at a

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.770 
as much as possible I try to look at a
demo<00:04:07.590> of<00:04:07.739> like<00:04:07.980> nes<00:04:08.459> or<00:04:08.790> our<00:04:09.030> op<00:04:09.209> guides<00:04:09.510> on

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
demo of like nes or our op guides on

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.870 
demo of like nes or our op guides on
dust2<00:04:10.109> teesside<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.889> things<00:04:11.010> like<00:04:11.130> that<00:04:11.190> so

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
dust2 teesside and things like that so

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.080 
dust2 teesside and things like that so
to<00:04:11.940> really<00:04:12.269> get<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.829> feel<00:04:13.829> of<00:04:13.859> what<00:04:14.579> other<00:04:14.790> plays

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
to really get a feel of what other plays

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.969 
to really get a feel of what other plays
you<00:04:15.269> should<00:04:15.420> be<00:04:15.480> making<00:04:15.660> so<00:04:16.350> this<00:04:16.560> piss<00:04:16.799> around

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
you should be making so this piss around

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.780 
you should be making so this piss around
was<00:04:17.280> like<00:04:17.430> pretty<00:04:17.820> poorly<00:04:18.180> played<00:04:18.539> by<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:18.810> um

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.700 
was like pretty poorly played by you um
it<00:04:21.480> shows<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.050> have<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.200> lack<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.410> like

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
it shows that you have a lack of like

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.480 
it shows that you have a lack of like
understanding<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:24.890> when<00:04:25.890> people<00:04:26.250> could<00:04:26.400> be

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
understanding of when people could be

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.100 
understanding of when people could be
where<00:04:26.730> because<00:04:27.330> right<00:04:27.540> at<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.750> start<00:04:27.960> of<00:04:28.020> the

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
where because right at the start of the

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.570 
where because right at the start of the
round<00:04:28.230> you<00:04:28.530> should<00:04:28.680> have<00:04:28.770> just<00:04:28.890> jumped<00:04:29.250> and

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
round you should have just jumped and

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.780 
round you should have just jumped and
like<00:04:29.940> watch<00:04:30.180> palm<00:04:30.450> tree<00:04:30.660> here<00:04:31.520> but<00:04:32.520> instead
