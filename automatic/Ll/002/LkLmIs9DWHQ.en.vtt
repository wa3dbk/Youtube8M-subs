00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.250

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.190
 The aim of the game is to increase the number of yours 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.150

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.730
 there are pluses and 16 special ones 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.199
 Action cards also make this game 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.590
 unique a writer is drawn 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.370
 this distributes the cards and records 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.710
 the predictions as well as points in each 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.050
 the players receive the ten rounds 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.750
 less and less cards in the first round 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.890
 There are ten cards for everyone in the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.309
 second round nine 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.320
 the third night and so on 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.690
 surplus cards come as a stack in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.539
 the middle of the table becomes the top card 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.370
 Uncovered the color of this card 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.829
 determined for the next stitches of this 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.829
 Round the trump color so in this 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.570
 case yellow it is an action kathi you 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.510
 you just think another one 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.520
 After every player has his own 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.400
 he has to look at hand cards now 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.159
 make a prediction how important he is in 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.250
 this round will make it starts 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.740
 player left of the donor cards 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:24.409
 All predictions are recorded 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.979
 For example, I'm okay, but okay 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.040
 here we go 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.970
 each player plays three for one card 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.659
 in the middle of the table these cards are the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.450
 engraving 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.789
 at 10 hand cards can exactly 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.859
 ten stitches are made at new 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.880
 of course there are nine cards 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:48.429
 stitches in the round and so on the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.280
 first card moving to the middle of the table 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.649
 will pretend which color is served 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.990
 must be served means all 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.240
 subsequent players must have a card 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.500
 play out the same color as has 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.109
 the first card only if you do not have one 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:10.000
 then you have a different color 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:11.579
 play trump or put an action 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.459
 play cards 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:18.849
 a trump is every map of the tower color 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:22.230
 So the color next to the pile in 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:25.720
 the center of the table is yellow in this case 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.870
 a card of the dream color wins against 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.940
 each card of a different color the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.459
 Trump color can turn in every round 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.090
 change and even suddenly through 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.370
 action cards win the sting 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.560
 card with the highest value in the 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.910
 Required color green was required 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.370
 So here's the 13 have one or 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.489
 more players 1 teams played wins 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.849
 the highest trump card itself a one 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.370
 in trend color is higher than a 13 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.840
 Stitches obtained in a different color 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.450
 be separated in front of the winner 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.459
 This also starts with the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.680
 play out the next card for the 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.139
 next stitch we come now to the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.030
 action cards still play this game 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:18.439
 make it more sexy 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:20.989
 the 5 - 5 of the players can be the 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:23.860
 contains one of the two cards 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.409
 in the evaluation corresponding points 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.349
 this card is called without trump because if 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.720
 this card is played there for 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.629
 this sound no tone color 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.049
 that is already played trumps are 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.750
 normal cards and after the engraving 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:45.440
 is another new trump have 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.659
 uncovered trump change 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:54.440
 It immediately becomes a new trump though 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:56.599
 Definitely the joker for the joker came from 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.280
 Players can choose a color that they can 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.930
 Of course, the current trump, too 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.940
 his 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.150
 The joker is in the chosen color 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.159
 always the highest card after all 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.859
 Nobody played anymore 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:12.950
 cards on the hand will have the 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:15.859
 Stitches compared to the prediction 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.859
 for each won stich receives the 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:23.750
 players a plus point so in this 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:26.539
 case 3 will be the plus minus five cards 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.139
 In this case, note five 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:33.169
 Plusp agrees the prediction receives 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.389
 the player has ten pluses 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.240
 he does not get five 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.300
 minus points 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.220
 the play ends after ten rounds and 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.550
 then the player wins the then 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.000
 has collected most points 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:53.699
 only say who is cool can win 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.699
 and now enjoy the game
