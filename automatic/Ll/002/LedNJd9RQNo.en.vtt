 have been prepared a video of tricks and 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.390
 Tips for the Samsung Galaxy 4 Go 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.390
 with the video 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.170
 during the galaxy 94 presentation it 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.610
 highlighted some of its most important functions 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.439
 relevant as the fingerprint detector 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.540
 fingerprints on the rhythm sensor 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.490
 cardiac but personally none of 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.140
 them more than willing to buy it but in 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.360
 change when investigating and discovering that the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.520
 note 4 saves very interesting functions 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.739
 my opinion changed slightly that's why the 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.660
 today I discovered 8 tricks that 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.350
 they will help you day to day with your 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.350
 device 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.500
 for many the screen of 4 can 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.030
 be something big as a solution the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.100
 software if samsung allows us to 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.600
 operate the screen with one hand what 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.300
 first thing we have to do is activate 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.010
 this option through the settings menu 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.239
 operation screen with one hand once 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.980
 activated you just have to slide 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.659
 quickly the right finger to 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.040
 left and right again and 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.379
 a screen will automatically appear 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.030
 small with the same content and 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.100
 we can adjust it to the size that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.580
 we want to feel a little more 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.580
 comfortable 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.060
 this feature to help 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.009
 squeeze the last drop of the battery in 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.720
 the most extreme situations this does 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.759
 that the screen will put on colorful colors 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.140
 gray and restricts applications 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.299
 available for a number of elements 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.130
 essential to activate this mode only 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.049
 we have to go energy saving settings 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.330
 we touch in energy saving mode to 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.689
 ultra and we activate the switch so 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.689
 easy 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.800
 the galaxy template no 4 can be 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.930
 turn on without a touch we just have to 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.090

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.030
 sure that more than one has happened to him 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.580
 designing photos of the gallery has 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.500
 cast some shameful little scene 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.240
 to avoid this kind of situations what 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.040
 better to hide these images and the 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.110
 videos that are a little more personal 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.880
 this is possible in galaxy no 4 to 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.290
 through private mode this can be 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.070
