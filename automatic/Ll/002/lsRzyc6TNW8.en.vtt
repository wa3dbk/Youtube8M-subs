00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.340
 before I thought that even when I will be 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.040
 old I would have continued to roll like 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:42.870
 a crazy but now I respect the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:43.890
 code of the road as friends and well 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.880
 hello everyone knows what she wants 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.170
 say come together for a new 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.400
 load linking video was at 5 years old 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.170
 line so this time I'm going to you 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.130
 learn to drive properly as 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.230
 you could see in the intro of the 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.030
 video him bernard yielded to temptation 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.890
 and now leads as his great 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.540
 parents so they respect the code of 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.250
 the road ie stops and fires 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.900
 red the pedestrians and even the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.970
 flashing so it's proving it 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.510
 is not a fail or a troll or whatever 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.980
 it's other 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.510
 because we can not put the 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.020
 blinkers so first of all you 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.520
 should be sure to be good at 1.09 and at 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.050
 put last position 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.210
 so in terms of updating 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.890
 1.09 we'll see if later that will be 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.870
 patched or not but for now we are 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.420
 well in 1.09 and I'm going to realize this 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.010
 glitch for you so show it watch so 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.750
 also have a shitty vehicle because 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.640
 even if you miss anyway it's okay 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.660
 remove all your vehicles I say good 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.130
 all your vehicles 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.510
 so if that's the case when you come back 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.130
 online and you have no more 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.330
 vehicles at all I advise you to 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.390
 press the button directly 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.400
 turn off your ps3 so here I you 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.710
 explains the manipulation to do I'm going 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.210
 make advanced start here make me a background 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.890
 black like that as if you come out of 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.750
 your garage during this time there you 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.910
 go playstation store and you 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.930
 are going to do ps is safe management of 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.400
 account you're going to do triangle for 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.370
 to accuse then increases 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.890
 connections which I repeat start advanced 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.960
 l1 to go on playstation store you 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.280
 go grow for hockey and you 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.410
 then go make peace is 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.510
 connections so once you have 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.510
 does all the error messages you 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.090
 press ok and bah so you go 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.069
 reappear in gta in story mode 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.360
 you go to your garage you go 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.739
 take any vehicle 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.420
 why I took the aspect of heart 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.129
 here is the kéké here it is funny 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.379
 great so you take any 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.730
 vehicle you go out with and there you 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.640
 you are getting closer to your 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.300
 garage there marked right arrow for 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.680
 get into your garage you do 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.480
 right and while loading you 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.890
 are you going to connect it's good at this 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.320
 moment there you will connect 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.700
 so there I was in the garage of 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.950
 franklin but it works with any 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.270
 what another garage I think of myself not 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.250
 amused to test with any high 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.130
 range no longer who has that michael and 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.310
 dreamer of other possible tried but 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.660
 i did with franklin so there you 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.730
 are going to have the loads etc 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.980
 you will pick up your vehicle for 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.540
 come out of your garage and during this 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.260
 time you're going to ask someone to 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.880
 invite you 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.010
 so for me it was my sister because 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.960
 I can not play with everyone 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.640
 I can not play with anyone else 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.970
 than my sister because I have a connection of 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.500
 shit 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.600
 so here again you will do 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.340
 right arrow and during the 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.480
 loading 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.970
 no before you will join 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.020
 the invitation is normally you see 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.000
 bottom right is marked 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.680
 download of the current session 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.510
 so it's during this message that 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.280
 you will bomb the right arrow 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.630
 is actually while you're going to be 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.520
 in the garage like this in the 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.230
 loading the garage there will 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.240
 message are you sure you want to leave 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.220
 you will do ok so if you have 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.010
 well done normally your view will be 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.570
 in the garage and not outside and there you 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.440
 go very indented to the triangle 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.150
 you are not a button level 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.640
 triangle to get out of your vehicle 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.500
 online is normally when you go 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.270
 get in and well your player is going 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.970
 start driving normally 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.520
 so this is not a fake like you 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.959
 see there there is flashing but you 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.330
 see that I'm going to do several 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.320
 sequences and the player will continue to 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.540
 ride normally 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.239
 as if I respect the rules of the road 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.340
 so unfortunately there are delays 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.450
 of inactivity while your player is 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.580
 well driving 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.160
 so what happens in reality is 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.590
 that you are drunk influence of 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.050
 inactivity you are actually in boots 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.239
 while you're driving 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.680
 so if this glitch video will have you 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.330
 please feel free to comment and 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.590
 why not share it 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.790
 as for me I will send him another 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.530
 times the glitch hack and do so he 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.850
 handed over I said and I still held a 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.459

 world
