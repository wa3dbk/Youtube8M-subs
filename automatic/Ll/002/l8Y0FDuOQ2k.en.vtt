first<00:00:28.949> which<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.580> not<00:00:29.730> how<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.910> covered<00:00:30.269> it

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
first which is not how I covered it

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.870 
first which is not how I covered it
recently<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.650> think<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.550> way<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
recently this is the think the way the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.400 
recently this is the think the way the
stones<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.329> done<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:34.700> in<00:00:35.700> D<00:00:35.880> minor<00:00:36.180> okay<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
stones have done it in D minor okay the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.200 
stones have done it in D minor okay the
reason<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.920> don't<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.730> way<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:38.969> when

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
reason I don't do it this way is when

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.610 
reason I don't do it this way is when
you're<00:00:39.300> playing<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.629> solo<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.260> bit<00:00:40.410> hard

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
you're playing it's solo it's a bit hard

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.180 
you're playing it's solo it's a bit hard
to<00:00:40.739> get<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:45.500> speaker<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.680> incorporate<00:00:47.070> that

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
to get that speaker to incorporate that

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.430 
to get that speaker to incorporate that
little<00:00:47.460> run<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.910> your<00:00:48.180> strum<00:00:48.539> which<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.140> kind

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
little run in your strum which is kind

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.260 
little run in your strum which is kind
of<00:00:49.500> key<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.340> song<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:50.940> need<00:00:51.120> it
