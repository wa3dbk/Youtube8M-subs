00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.730 

now<00:00:02.500> we'll<00:00:02.739> look<00:00:02.860> at<00:00:03.010> the<00:00:03.100> spermatic<00:00:03.670> cord<00:00:03.699> in

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
now we'll look at the spermatic cord in

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.469 
now we'll look at the spermatic cord in
the<00:00:05.740> developing<00:00:06.189> embryo<00:00:06.370> the<00:00:06.879> migrating

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:07.479 
the developing embryo the migrating

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:09.450 
the developing embryo the migrating
testes<00:00:08.019> pushes<00:00:08.650> its<00:00:08.800> way<00:00:08.980> through<00:00:09.309> the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
testes pushes its way through the

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.329 
testes pushes its way through the
abdominal<00:00:09.940> wall<00:00:10.089> and<00:00:10.299> into<00:00:10.719> the<00:00:10.839> scrotum

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:11.339 
abdominal wall and into the scrotum

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.680 
abdominal wall and into the scrotum
creating<00:00:12.339> the<00:00:12.460> inguinal<00:00:12.670> canal<00:00:12.969> as<00:00:13.330> it<00:00:13.540> does

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
creating the inguinal canal as it does

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.040 
creating the inguinal canal as it does
so<00:00:13.929> the<00:00:14.639> testes<00:00:15.639> drags<00:00:15.940> behind<00:00:16.120> itself<00:00:16.720> its

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
so the testes drags behind itself its

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.529 
so the testes drags behind itself its
own<00:00:17.350> blood<00:00:17.590> vessels<00:00:18.070> and<00:00:18.250> the<00:00:18.820> vas<00:00:18.970> deferens

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
own blood vessels and the vas deferens

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.109 
own blood vessels and the vas deferens
and<00:00:19.810> it<00:00:20.680> carries<00:00:21.010> along<00:00:21.250> as<00:00:21.430> a<00:00:21.460> covering<00:00:21.880> a

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.730 
and it carries along as a covering a
little<00:00:22.599> of<00:00:22.840> each<00:00:23.019> layer<00:00:23.289> that<00:00:23.470> it<00:00:23.590> goes

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
little of each layer that it goes

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.730
