00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.060
 in the afternoon we were having to 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.460
 get this 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.770
 but we do not even know how to play alone 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.110
 come out they will triumph like we did 10 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.110
 years but the public was waiting 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.339
 bouquets guys tap into something good 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.090
 I'm a big pink stone once 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.090
 against this planet 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.100
 cody 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.320
 and effective crossed hands now inhabit 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.320
 zones is only so dangerous what there is 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.460
 fields of doors 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.450
 the food 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.280
 quality 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.280

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.130
 peterson 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.280

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:46.740
 they have been of my people tell me of 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.740
 his life finally vanishes 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.810
 combined 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.260
 if it is not forgotten 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.079
 you can stop friend 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.319
 we can explain it we did playback 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.290
 listen to them like we seriously think that 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.570
 We could order some shirts and come to 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.610
 have a band but it turns out that playing 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.980
 music is very difficult we stay 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.940
 stuck in the dream and for a moment 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.840
 It was real but it ended and the playback was not 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.460
 it's fine so the band disintegrates 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.980
 because you'll all goes well we 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.050
 cheated with the playback hey we 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.950
 We came back rich and famous with the playback 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.590
 want no part of it does not hurt 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.920

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.310

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.460
 I do not want to ruin the surprise 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.120

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.630
 Yes very good 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.590

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.590
 distressed
