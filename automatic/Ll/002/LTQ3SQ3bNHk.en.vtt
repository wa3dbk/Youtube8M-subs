 interesting because they are resistant to diseases he also pulled himself together for 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.020
 compensate for the loss of production in the year that's but three waves 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.389
 that's the secret to having 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:18.389

 militants have dropped which you have a better irrigation plan of 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.919
 strawberries third to shoot it simply does not prevent the growth of 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.319
 weed weeds no weeding no chemical weed control 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.550
 nor manual the strawberries that will sit on it 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.669
 will be able to be consumed as is since the euro no contact with the 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:49.539

 no decay so what are you waiting for a president just you 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.479
 have laid out a small growth square spread of the edges 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.279
 on the Breton side presumed and then replanted 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.499
 your plan simply did not flap the edges 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:03.729
 and we continue 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.729
 planting distances grumble 20 to 25 centimeters 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.709
 I invite you to note that the feet in a few clicks on this little sound 

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:13.330
