00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.519
 to listen to the producer of the game that 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.260
 I was sitting here watching the video 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.239

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.920

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.569
 another he saw not know what will 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.189
 well she does not ask a question if 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.870
 Very serious, as I have already shown. 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.370
 the guys I wanted to die when I arrived 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.129
 in that last forest he stole merry 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.709
 because I think it takes us 60 and the body 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.859
 That boss got me down then leads 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.239

 the man just left the gameplay here 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.409
 from blog born what did you think of 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.299
 gameplay what are the main differences 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.310
 What did you notice there? 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.870
 in the other games of the series sounds then in 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.340
 I'm not really a big player of the 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.129
 souza series I do not have as much property 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.290
 So to make this comparison, but I 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.419
 playing two sensational buoys at 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.900
 gameplay is very cool as you 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:29.419
 Can you understand the fast game is the 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.849
 times the game takes to be very smooth 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:34.129
 Nee and I liked it so much a good climate 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.699
 Stupid I think it will do justice to 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.699
 trophy name 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:05.200

 database jorge you just left 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.250
 here's what you found of gameplay 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.320
 Our animal game I'm a fan of the franchise 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.790
 So I was already with 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.000
 very high expectations for vodafone 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.430
 I had already played in Brazil game show né 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.250
 and I really liked it here I did not spend anything 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.960
 I'm not new but I 'm fond of it. 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.970
 I tried another bild this time, it's just that 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.210
 I got to try one on the bvs 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.280
 I tested another bild now another weapon and the 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.900
 I liked it a lot, I thought it was cool. 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.360
 I already started playing I died a lot 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.220
 but a little bit I'm getting the hang of it 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.790
 already played the other games of the series or 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.230
 Not then, but not many years ago. 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.590
 ago I played a playstation game 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.360
 called night black tears that I do not know 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.800
 why reminded me too think that the 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:00.490
 thematic also is not hunters of everything and 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:04.590
 It was what attracted me to 2 born elsie 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:10.560
 athletic a very similar footprint try 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.560
 taking the high expectation so well is not 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.200
 much better than moniz this was the 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.580
