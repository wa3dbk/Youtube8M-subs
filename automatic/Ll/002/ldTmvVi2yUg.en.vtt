00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
on the back of the tractor this is

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.550 
on the back of the tractor this is
what's<00:04:33.639> called<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.180> cable<00:04:34.750> control<00:04:35.169> unit

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
what's called the cable control unit

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.909 
what's called the cable control unit
this<00:04:36.310> acts<00:04:36.610> basically<00:04:36.940> as<00:04:37.479> a<00:04:37.509> winch<00:04:37.900> in<00:04:38.350> fact<00:04:38.800> a

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
this acts basically as a winch in fact a

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.980 
this acts basically as a winch in fact a
lot<00:04:39.100> of<00:04:39.220> guys<00:04:39.400> will<00:04:39.699> often<00:04:40.030> call<00:04:40.270> this<00:04:40.479> a<00:04:40.690> winch

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
lot of guys will often call this a winch

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.110 
lot of guys will often call this a winch
but<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.800> correct<00:04:42.009> term<00:04:42.280> for<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:42.550> is<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.699> cable

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
but the correct term for it is a cable

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.170 
but the correct term for it is a cable
control<00:04:43.509> unit<00:04:44.280> basically<00:04:45.280> all<00:04:45.430> this<00:04:45.610> does<00:04:45.669> is

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
control unit basically all this does is

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.620 
control unit basically all this does is
reel<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:47.020> cable<00:04:47.380> in<00:04:47.560> for<00:04:48.100> reel<00:04:48.370> out<00:04:48.699> you<00:04:49.479> can

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
reel the cable in for reel out you can

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.150 
reel the cable in for reel out you can
see<00:04:49.810> where<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.020> cable<00:04:50.320> is<00:04:50.440> reel<00:04:50.680> around<00:04:51.010> the
