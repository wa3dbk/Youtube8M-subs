00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.480
 Ed? 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.360
 Oh, Mr. Allen. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 I was immersed in my memories. It reminds me of things. 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.520
 I offer you a drink? 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.320
 I would like, Frank, but I'm a little in a hurry ... 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.680
 I insist. 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.520
 After all, it is the traditional role of the father of the bride. 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.680
 - What do you mean ? - To keep the groom away from the exit. 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.080
 No, I just wanted to get some fresh air. 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.880
 Your best tequila, crushed ice. Come a second. 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.400
 - Is it tequila? - Nothing for me, thank you. 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.440
 Okay, he'll take a double. 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.240
 I realize we do not know each other very well, Ed. 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400
 You and Jesse live away from my wife and me, but do not be afraid, 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.600
 you can talk to me. 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.760
 I have nothing to confide, sir. 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.400
 Doubts ? 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.600
 No, no doubts. I have no doubt in my mind. 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.920
 That's true, no doubt. 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.680
 Yes. 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.360
 You know what ? 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.680
 Why do not we draw up a small list? 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.200
 Let's start with doubt # 1. 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.560
 I have no. 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.200
 No, that I can swear to you, none. Number one is "none". 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.320
 Force yourself a little, you can certainly find. 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.240
 Let's talk about history with Jake Lee. 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.360
 - Did she tell you about it? - Two weeks last year. 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.200
 I thought it was a week? 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.720
 One ... two ... or the time of Lent ... that's not the question. 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.120
 That's not why you're eyeing the way out. 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.360
 Jake Lee is an excuse. 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.600
 Tell me something, Ed. 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.800
 You love it ? 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.760
 Yes. Yes of course. 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.240
 So maybe you ask yourself 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.560
 why your love is not pure and constant. 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.120
 Why all these highs and lows, these certainties and doubts? 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.160
 Why a thing that seems so desirable to you at a moment 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.880
 can cause you such discomfort the next moment?
