now that the mung beans are tender we're

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.029 
now that the mung beans are tender we're
going<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.530> strain<00:00:49.860> them<00:00:51.620> now<00:00:52.620> we're<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:52.949> to

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
going to strain them now we're going to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.880 
going to strain them now we're going to
add<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> sugar<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.789> mung<00:00:54.059> bean<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:55.649> we're

alike now we're going to make the dole

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.750 
alike now we're going to make the dole
by<00:01:01.379> combining<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.010> glutinous<00:01:02.489> rice<00:01:02.579> flour

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
by combining the glutinous rice flour

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.320

with<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.690> sugar<00:01:05.810> give<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> mix<00:01:08.330> then

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
with the sugar give this a mix then

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.070 
with the sugar give this a mix then
we'll<00:01:09.540> add<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.720> water<00:01:11.450> just<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:12.659> at<00:01:13.049> a

time and then give it a stir until it

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.240 
time and then give it a stir until it
forms<00:01:18.780> into<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> Hills<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.770> suppose<00:01:20.040> like

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
forms into a Hills just suppose like

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.980 
forms into a Hills just suppose like
this<00:01:22.520> now<00:01:23.520> we'll<00:01:23.759> pick<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.000> piece<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.630> we'll

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
this now we'll pick a piece and we'll

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.899 
this now we'll pick a piece and we'll
roll<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.320> into<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.400> golf<00:01:26.850> ball-sized<00:01:28.909> just

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
roll it into a golf ball-sized just

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.429 
roll it into a golf ball-sized just
using<00:01:30.329> your<00:01:30.450> palm<00:01:30.659> until<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.200> nice<00:01:31.409> and

process for the rest of the mixture now

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.370 
process for the rest of the mixture now
we're<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> take<00:01:42.570> one<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.780> our<00:01:42.930> balls<00:01:43.170> of

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
we're going to take one of our balls of

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.550 
we're going to take one of our balls of
dough<00:01:44.450> we're<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.750> hollow<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.290> out<00:01:46.380> in

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
dough we're going to hollow it out in

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.539 
dough we're going to hollow it out in
the<00:01:46.680> center<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.939> bit<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:49.549> it's

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
the center just a bit like this so it's

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.109 
the center just a bit like this so it's
a<00:01:50.670> cup<00:01:50.909> shape<00:01:51.240> similar<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.939> now<00:01:53.939> we'll

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
a cup shape similar to this now we'll

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.940 
a cup shape similar to this now we'll
add<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.299> scoop<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> mung<00:01:55.020> bean<00:01:55.229> paste<00:01:55.560> make

add a scoop of the mung bean paste make

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.340 
add a scoop of the mung bean paste make
sure<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.250> good<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.549> dry<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.210> cool<00:01:57.659> and

sure it's good and dry and cool and

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
sure it's good and dry and cool and
we'll<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.100> put<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.790> center<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.329> the

we'll just put it in the center of the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.280 
we'll just put it in the center of the
dough<00:02:01.969> now<00:02:02.969> we'll<00:02:03.180> fold<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.600> back<00:02:03.840> over

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
dough now we'll fold this back over

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.700 
dough now we'll fold this back over
until<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.159> becomes<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.579> ball<00:02:05.759> shape<00:02:06.090> again<00:02:06.710> just

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
until it becomes a ball shape again just

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.479 
until it becomes a ball shape again just
gently<00:02:09.110> now<00:02:10.110> we're<00:02:10.349> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.619> gently<00:02:10.920> roll<00:02:11.250> it

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
gently now we're going to gently roll it

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.729 
gently now we're going to gently roll it
and<00:02:11.610> smooth<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.450> out<00:02:12.569> just<00:02:13.110> above<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:13.709> this

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
and smooth it out just above like this

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.000 
and smooth it out just above like this
not<00:02:14.220> too<00:02:14.489> much<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.660> we'll<00:02:15.930> set<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.319> aside<00:02:16.440> and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
not too much and we'll set it aside and

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.570 
not too much and we'll set it aside and
repeat<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:17.610> for<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.879> rest<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.330> balls

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
repeat this for the rest of the balls

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.400 
repeat this for the rest of the balls
next<00:02:20.580> we're<00:02:21.030> going<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.360> get<00:02:21.870> one<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.200> balls

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
next we're going to get one of the balls

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.020 
next we're going to get one of the balls
and<00:02:22.830> we're<00:02:23.099> going<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.340> give<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.760> spray

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
and we're going to give it a spray

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.510 
and we're going to give it a spray
before<00:02:24.690> we<00:02:25.110> dip<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.349> in<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.590> sesame<00:02:26.010> seed<00:02:26.280> and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
before we dip it in the sesame seed and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.880 
before we dip it in the sesame seed and
this<00:02:27.239> will<00:02:27.420> enable<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.900> sesame<00:02:28.319> seeds<00:02:28.590> to

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
this will enable the sesame seeds to

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.050 
this will enable the sesame seeds to
stick<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:31.739> then<00:02:32.610> we're<00:02:32.760> just<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:33.000> to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
stick to it and then we're just going to
