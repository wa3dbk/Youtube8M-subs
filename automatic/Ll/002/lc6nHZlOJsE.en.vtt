battery<00:04:25.150> his<00:04:25.540> company<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.050> specialized<00:04:26.710> in

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
battery his company is specialized in

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.920 
battery his company is specialized in
high-tech<00:04:27.310> products<00:04:27.820> they<00:04:28.330> evaluated

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
high-tech products they evaluated

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.600 
high-tech products they evaluated
various<00:04:29.350> systems<00:04:29.740> before<00:04:29.950> choosing<00:04:30.370> this

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
various systems before choosing this

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.480 
various systems before choosing this
solution<00:04:33.330> this<00:04:34.330> sort<00:04:34.780> of<00:04:34.810> emotion<00:04:35.490> when

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
solution this sort of emotion when

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.770 
solution this sort of emotion when
you're<00:04:36.610> sort<00:04:36.820> of<00:04:36.880> like<00:04:37.000> doing<00:04:37.210> this<00:04:37.330> thing<00:04:37.540> is

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
you're sort of like doing this thing is

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.930 
you're sort of like doing this thing is
a<00:04:37.990> very<00:04:38.350> very<00:04:38.530> small<00:04:38.710> muscle<00:04:39.220> motion<00:04:39.370> to<00:04:39.700> using

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
a very very small muscle motion to using

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.270 
a very very small muscle motion to using
only<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.180> very<00:04:40.480> small<00:04:40.660> subset<00:04:41.200> of<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.950> muscles

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
only a very small subset of the muscles

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.150 
only a very small subset of the muscles
of<00:04:42.370> your<00:04:42.520> body<00:04:42.670> so<00:04:43.300> in<00:04:43.690> our<00:04:44.350> case<00:04:44.380> we<00:04:44.920> have

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
of your body so in our case we have

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.980 
of your body so in our case we have
something<00:04:45.460> that's<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:45.700> same<00:04:45.910> size<00:04:46.180> but<00:04:46.720> it

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
something that's the same size but it

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.620 
something that's the same size but it
actually<00:04:47.140> allows<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:48.040> much<00:04:48.550> larger<00:04:49.060> motion<00:04:49.450> and

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
actually allows a much larger motion and

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.840 
actually allows a much larger motion and
because<00:04:50.590> of<00:04:50.620> that<00:04:50.800> you<00:04:51.250> can<00:04:51.340> actually<00:04:51.550> get

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
because of that you can actually get

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.280 
because of that you can actually get
much<00:04:52.150> more<00:04:52.360> efficiency<00:04:52.810> out<00:04:52.840> of<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.110> system

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
much more efficiency out of the system

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.460 
much more efficiency out of the system
in<00:04:53.980> addition<00:04:54.250> you<00:04:54.610> can<00:04:54.940> pull<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:55.360> like<00:04:55.480> this<00:04:55.720> or

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
in addition you can pull it like this or

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.680 
in addition you can pull it like this or
you<00:04:56.770> can<00:04:56.920> attach<00:04:57.160> it<00:04:57.340> to<00:04:57.370> your<00:04:57.520> foot<00:04:57.790> and<00:04:58.000> pull

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
you can attach it to your foot and pull

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.520 
you can attach it to your foot and pull
it<00:04:58.720> like<00:04:58.900> that<00:04:59.610> do<00:05:00.610> motions<00:05:00.970> like<00:05:01.060> this<00:05:01.270> or<00:05:02.020> in

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
it like that do motions like this or in

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.290 
it like that do motions like this or in
other<00:05:02.710> origin<00:05:03.160> one<00:05:03.400> gets<00:05:03.580> much<00:05:03.790> less<00:05:04.030> time

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
other origin one gets much less time

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.270 
other origin one gets much less time
with<00:05:04.510> Eve<00:05:05.260> is<00:05:05.470> dealing<00:05:05.860> with<00:05:05.980> the<00:05:06.100> last
