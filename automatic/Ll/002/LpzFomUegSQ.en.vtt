now<00:00:49.570> let's<00:00:49.720> look<00:00:49.839> at<00:00:49.960> sin<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.320> it<00:00:50.620> seems<00:00:50.980> to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
appear that the seven day Adventists

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.549 
appear that the seven day Adventists
actually<00:00:55.329> lived<00:00:55.629> longer<00:00:56.019> than<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.379> average

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
can i say this by a lot of the theory in

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.560 
can i say this by a lot of the theory in
science<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.580> presenting<00:01:24.909> to<00:01:24.970> you<00:01:25.030> today<00:01:25.060> yeah
