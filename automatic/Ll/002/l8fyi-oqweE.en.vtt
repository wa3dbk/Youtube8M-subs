00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.920
 here simply 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.760
 fly together 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.420
 and I think of you 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.420
 I saw it. 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:11.279
 here you can say of 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.430
 where he assumes you love arpeggios that they are 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.739
 that is 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.889
 be it 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:21.579
 right well 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.339
 yourself or me or not 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.189
 but dibase 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.999
 on no 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.259
 from a sequence of 1 3 5 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.199
 different applications between them 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.869
 that gives us the opportunity to believe hey to make mountain pastures 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:38.329
 in this case 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.599
 cost an old exercises I cover a lot of fanta argan conzano seminary 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.099
 where we look at left hand we should have this consecutio 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.099
 center 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:54.500
 I'm always 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.870

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.279
 cut 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:10.839
 away therefore 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.790
 think that 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.289
 I think in the blue I use this thing here in ok 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.429
 in jazz a 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:23.679
 it already exists it must be discounted however it upsets me and runs away from it 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.689
 the triads i'm into you feat. However 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:34.199
 ornate 12 playing we know very well how it works 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:37.619
 pears usually work well for those that 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.799
 very often the heart does not sound 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.869
 and I say this without writing false hypocrisy 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.799
 a lot of those who still let themselves take the metal hatch 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.159
 witty 80s at the end they make their hands go a lot but 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.840
 at the toll booth but unfortunately unfortunately 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.219
 they are good because they are simply availability of a 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:03.089
 a deal 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.589
 however it is easier to learn a mechanism 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:07.890
 that makes you send the head 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.979
 a sense of taste developed 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:13.759
 anyway i only want other things about acceleration e 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.819
 little about sound dictated by this type of su 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:22.550
 E'opportuni however to take it we look at the for which the sequence 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.360

 frame in the right hand 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.740
 this is the right thing for you to always remember down and go like a train

 obviously if you think a510 and 120 division 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:57.389
 of these checks 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:58.580
 movement then 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.360
 click 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.460
 accurate 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.830
 then use the price 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.400
 tearing sweep will be 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.159
 really very good 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:12.159
 what then will become tamarri dad 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.129
 it is more important to do it click 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:20.129
 because then in case you have to wait for it 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:26.830
 lacerations this sense then it becomes really clean 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.289
