to make a sudden incline about this size
right<00:01:04.379> here<00:01:04.650> um<00:01:05.659> just<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.810> sudden<00:01:07.140> incline<00:01:07.530> from

right here um just a sudden incline from

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.730 
right here um just a sudden incline from
what<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> wise<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.299> basically<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.439> tires

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740

what a wise so it basically the tires
hit<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.880> goes<00:01:12.090> down<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
back tires hit it which makes it rotate

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.440 
back tires hit it which makes it rotate

right so guys uh see you so we got the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.610 
right so guys uh see you so we got the
steady<00:03:02.560> incline<00:03:02.980> right<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:05.110> decent

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
steady incline right so this is a decent

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.590 
steady incline right so this is a decent
inclined<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:09.280> what<00:03:09.550> am<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:09.700> like<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:09.970> use<00:03:10.180> when<00:03:10.570> I

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
inclined so what am I like to use when I

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.680 
inclined so what am I like to use when I
make<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.830> 180<00:03:11.830> jump<00:03:12.130> is<00:03:12.340> actually<00:03:13.209> like<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.570> use

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
make a 180 jump is actually like to use

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.380 
make a 180 jump is actually like to use
the<00:03:13.810> runner<00:03:14.380> right<00:03:14.620> so<00:03:15.160> what<00:03:15.550> you<00:03:15.640> do<00:03:15.850> is<00:03:15.880> turn

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
the runner right so what you do is turn

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.370 
the runner right so what you do is turn
it<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:16.660> way<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:18.060> use<00:03:19.060> this<00:03:19.540> bottom<00:03:20.019> corner

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
it this way and use this bottom corner

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.550 
it this way and use this bottom corner
right<00:03:20.980> here<00:03:21.010> use<00:03:21.700> this<00:03:21.910> corner<00:03:22.380> that's<00:03:23.380> what<00:03:23.530> I

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
right here use this corner that's what I

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.170 
right here use this corner that's what I
use<00:03:23.769> for<00:03:23.800> most<00:03:24.190> of<00:03:24.310> my<00:03:24.370> jumps<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.910> don't<00:03:25.060> really

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
use for most of my jumps I don't really

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.880 
use for most of my jumps I don't really
like<00:03:25.300> to<00:03:25.540> use<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.720> side<00:03:26.050> because<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.680> kind<00:03:26.860> of

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
like to use a side because it kind of

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.250 
like to use a side because it kind of
screws<00:03:27.130> everything<00:03:27.400> up<00:03:27.640> so<00:03:28.480> what<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.110> could

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
screws everything up so what you could

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.850 
screws everything up so what you could
do<00:03:29.440> is<00:03:29.680> dis<00:03:30.280> soo<00:03:30.459> this<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.900> what<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.560> was<00:03:32.739> like

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
do is dis soo this so what it was like

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.930 
do is dis soo this so what it was like
before<00:03:33.040> is<00:03:34.590> about<00:03:35.590> it<00:03:36.070> could<00:03:36.250> be<00:03:36.370> about<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:36.640> two

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
before is about it could be about a two

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.630 
before is about it could be about a two
degree<00:03:37.120> incline<00:03:37.900> maybe<00:03:38.260> three<00:03:39.160> clicks<00:03:39.459> of

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
degree incline maybe three clicks of

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.060 
degree incline maybe three clicks of
five<00:03:39.820> degrees<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:40.900> about<00:03:41.140> that<00:03:41.320> much<00:03:41.590> that

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
five degrees so about that much that

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.220 
five degrees so about that much that
seems<00:03:42.280> about<00:03:42.400> right<00:03:42.550> and<00:03:43.019> what's<00:03:44.019> going<00:03:44.170> to

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
seems about right and what's going to

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.650 
seems about right and what's going to
happen<00:03:44.620> is<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.489> front<00:03:45.760> tires<00:03:45.880> like<00:03:46.330> said

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
happen is the front tires like said

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
should do a 180 so we'll see what

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.590 
should do a 180 so we'll see what
happens<00:03:50.940> alright<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:54.040> dance<00:03:54.340> we<00:03:54.580> should<00:03:54.820> all

experiment make sure you guys get the

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.290 
experiment make sure you guys get the
first<00:04:26.510> jump<00:04:26.840> that<00:04:27.020> your<00:04:27.200> work<00:04:27.320> on<00:04:28.060> right<00:04:29.060> the

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
first jump that your work on right the

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.110 
first jump that your work on right the
first<00:04:29.540> time<00:04:29.630> because<00:04:30.280> whatever<00:04:31.280> that<00:04:31.850> that

first time because whatever that that
your<00:04:32.630> first<00:04:32.870> jump<00:04:33.080> sets<00:04:33.440> a<00:04:33.560> tempo<00:04:33.820> all<00:04:34.820> right

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.870 

as<00:05:32.090> you<00:05:32.330> see<00:05:32.570> here<00:05:32.930> yeah<00:05:33.590> that's<00:05:33.980> something

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
as you see here yeah that's something

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.650 
as you see here yeah that's something
wrong<00:05:35.330> so<00:05:35.600> I<00:05:35.630> admit<00:05:36.080> it's<00:05:36.260> either<00:05:36.530> not<00:05:37.660> steep

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
wrong so I admit it's either not steep

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.390 
wrong so I admit it's either not steep
enough<00:05:38.870> or<00:05:39.550> its<00:05:40.550> to<00:05:41.680> gradual<00:05:42.680> it<00:05:42.920> needs<00:05:43.160> to<00:05:43.280> be

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
enough or its to gradual it needs to be

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.300 
enough or its to gradual it needs to be
more<00:05:43.550> sudden<00:05:44.140> so<00:05:45.140> it<00:05:45.680> could<00:05:45.830> be<00:05:45.860> one<00:05:46.160> of<00:05:46.190> those

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
more sudden so it could be one of those

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.780 
more sudden so it could be one of those
two<00:05:46.580> things<00:05:46.820> let's<00:05:47.750> try<00:05:47.930> this<00:05:51.430> I<00:05:52.430> don't<00:05:52.700> think

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
two things let's try this I don't think

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.770 
two things let's try this I don't think
that<00:05:53.330> will<00:05:53.480> work<00:05:53.710> try<00:05:54.710> it<00:05:54.770> who<00:05:55.280> knows<00:05:55.780> anything

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
that will work try it who knows anything

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:03.310 
that will work try it who knows anything
can<00:05:56.930> happen<00:06:00.460> so<00:06:01.460> again<00:06:01.760> guys<00:06:01.940> as<00:06:02.360> probably

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
can happen so again guys as probably

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.060 
can happen so again guys as probably

the 180 right there um so as you can see

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.820 
the 180 right there um so as you can see
just<00:06:13.580> keep<00:06:14.120> experimenting<00:06:14.750> what<00:06:15.470> you<00:06:15.590> want<00:06:15.770> to

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
do is go from a steady incline to all of

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.470 
do is go from a steady incline to all of
a<00:06:21.200> sudden<00:06:21.530> just<00:06:21.860> a<00:06:22.010> huge<00:06:22.310> incline<00:06:22.700> that<00:06:23.270> will

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
a sudden just a huge incline that will

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.990 
a sudden just a huge incline that will
make<00:06:23.660> your<00:06:23.840> Mongoose<00:06:24.260> spin<00:06:24.860> so<00:06:25.460> the<00:06:25.580> test<00:06:25.760> one

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
make your Mongoose spin so the test one

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.120 
make your Mongoose spin so the test one
more<00:06:26.090> time<00:06:26.300> see<00:06:26.630> if<00:06:26.660> it<00:06:26.780> works<00:06:27.080> again<00:06:27.410> always

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
more time see if it works again always

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.400 
more time see if it works again always
guys<00:06:28.520> uh<00:06:28.550> if<00:06:29.060> you<00:06:29.180> if<00:06:29.450> something<00:06:29.810> works<00:06:30.200> for

you<00:06:30.500> make<00:06:31.340> sure<00:06:31.370> you<00:06:31.610> test<00:06:31.790> it<00:06:31.940> multiple<00:06:32.270> times

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
you make sure you test it multiple times

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.880 
you make sure you test it multiple times
to<00:06:32.660> make<00:06:32.840> sure<00:06:32.900> it<00:06:33.110> happens<00:06:33.260> every<00:06:33.740> time

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:33.890 
to make sure it happens every time

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.800 
to make sure it happens every time
because<00:06:34.160> not<00:06:34.970> every<00:06:35.270> time<00:06:35.480> is<00:06:35.630> going<00:06:35.720> to

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
because not every time is going to

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.950 
because not every time is going to
happen

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
a lot of people make jumps like that see

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.510 
a lot of people make jumps like that see
you<00:06:40.139> there<00:06:40.289> you<00:06:40.410> go<00:06:40.530> again<00:06:41.180> it<00:06:42.180> works<00:06:42.500> twice

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520

might wrap up this tutorial on how to
make<00:06:53.910> the<00:06:54.120> 180<00:06:54.509> jump<00:06:55.340> yep<00:06:56.340> alright<00:06:56.910> so<00:06:57.300> it

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:57.449 
make the 180 jump yep alright so it

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:00.080 
make the 180 jump yep alright so it
looks<00:06:57.599> pretty<00:06:57.780> good<00:06:58.050> that's<00:06:58.949> three<00:06:59.880> in<00:06:59.970> a<00:07:00.060> row
