00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.840 
lying so Suzanne I didn't really cover
these<00:01:40.560> because<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.369> glowstone<00:01:41.729> in

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
these because you know the glowstone in

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.069 
these because you know the glowstone in
this<00:01:41.970> texture<00:01:42.240> pack<00:01:42.390> isn't<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.750> bad<00:01:42.899> but<00:01:42.930> you

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
this texture pack isn't that bad but you

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.450 
this texture pack isn't that bad but you
guys<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.530> cover<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.009> you're<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
guys can cover it if you're in the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.920 
guys can cover it if you're in the
default<00:01:44.790> text<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.119> back<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.659> I'm<00:01:45.780> probably

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
default text you back and I'm probably

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.749 
default text you back and I'm probably
gonna<00:01:46.140> go<00:01:46.380> quickly<00:01:46.920> over<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
gonna go quickly over this in the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.270 
gonna go quickly over this in the
default<00:01:48.210> touch<00:01:48.360> back<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.780> second<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.860> as

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
default touch back in a second and as

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.499 
default touch back in a second and as
you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.729> got<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> nice<00:01:51.030> little<00:01:51.240> study

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
you can see we got a nice little study

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.539 
you can see we got a nice little study
area<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.590> sort<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> bush

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
area here with sort of like a bush

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.340 
area here with sort of like a bush
dancer<00:01:53.909> kind<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.360> secluded<00:01:54.840> his<00:01:54.990> area<00:01:55.290> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
dancer kind of like secluded his area of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.499 
dancer kind of like secluded his area of
it<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:56.009> as<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.340> come<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.820> last<00:01:56.850> room<00:01:57.299> here

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
it so as we come to the last room here

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.209 
it so as we come to the last room here
we<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.840> see<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.530> probably<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
we can see that this is probably the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.219 
we can see that this is probably the
best<00:01:59.700> one<00:02:00.000> probably<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.689> best<00:02:00.869> one<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.020> you

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
best one probably the best one that you

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.810 
best one probably the best one that you
should<00:02:01.409> probably<00:02:01.530> build<00:02:01.860> because<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.640> just

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
should probably build because I just

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.370 
should probably build because I just
wanted<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.060> have<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> few<00:02:03.689> different<00:02:03.990> designs

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
wanted to have a few different designs

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.359 
wanted to have a few different designs
because<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.680> know<00:02:04.770> people<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:05.219> different

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
because you know people like different

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.100 
because you know people like different
things<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.149> one<00:02:06.450> type<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.719> room<00:02:06.930> and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
things in just like one type of room and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.169 
things in just like one type of room and
as<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.799> guys<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.129> see<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
as you guys can see here we have the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.790 
as you guys can see here we have the
same<00:02:09.450> sort<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.810> light<00:02:09.989> source<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.470> believe<00:02:10.649> that

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
same sort of light source I believe that

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.740 
same sort of light source I believe that
that's<00:02:10.979> quite<00:02:11.190> modern<00:02:11.459> I'm<00:02:11.550> quite<00:02:11.760> nice<00:02:11.970> also

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
got a nice study area here though I

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.760 
got a nice study area here though I
didn't<00:02:16.840> want<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:17.020> turn<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.260> painting<00:02:17.590> around

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
didn't want to turn the painting around

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.080 
didn't want to turn the painting around
but<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.010> needed<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.310> rule<00:02:18.459> behind<00:02:18.819> here<00:02:19.000> and

but I needed to rule behind here and

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.490 
but I needed to rule behind here and
obviously<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.360> couldn't<00:02:19.420> do<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:19.720> because<00:02:19.930> we

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
obviously I couldn't do that because we

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.199 
obviously I couldn't do that because we
have<00:02:20.620> this<00:02:20.740> is<00:02:20.890> set<00:02:21.040> up<00:02:21.160> but<00:02:21.819> yeah<00:02:21.940> we<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.180> a
