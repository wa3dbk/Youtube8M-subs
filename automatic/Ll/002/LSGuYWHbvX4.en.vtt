crime

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.109 

I<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:23.159> at<00:01:23.219> this<00:01:23.310> level<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.759> drills<00:01:24.000> have

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
I think at this level that drills have

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.420 
I think at this level that drills have
their<00:01:24.329> mirror<00:01:24.719> game<00:01:25.049> situations<00:01:25.770> more

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
their mirror game situations more

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.190 
their mirror game situations more
closely<00:01:26.729> than<00:01:26.969> they<00:01:27.090> would<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.299> say<00:01:27.719> 12<00:01:28.079> an

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
closely than they would at say 12 an

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200 
closely than they would at say 12 an
hour<00:01:28.289> or<00:01:28.590> 7-under<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.280> think<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.880> while

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
hour or 7-under I think that while

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270 
hour or 7-under I think that while
there's<00:01:30.420> still<00:01:30.479> skill<00:01:30.930> based<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.500> execution

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
there's still skill based in execution

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.429 
there's still skill based in execution
they<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.479> complexity<00:01:34.140> that's

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
they have to have a complexity that's

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.710 
they have to have a complexity that's
relative<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.039> game<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:35.729> want<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.149> increase

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
relative to the game we want to increase

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.319 
relative to the game we want to increase
the<00:01:37.049> level<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.590> thinking<00:01:38.009> increase<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.880> tempo

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
the level of thinking increase the tempo

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.319 
the level of thinking increase the tempo
and<00:01:39.570> increase<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.619> tactical<00:01:41.579> awareness<00:01:41.729> of

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and increase the tactical awareness of

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.600 
and increase the tactical awareness of
all<00:01:42.569> our<00:01:42.780> players<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.619> they're<00:01:43.799> prepared<00:01:44.340> to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
all our players so they're prepared to

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.850 
all our players so they're prepared to
move<00:01:44.759> through<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> system<00:01:45.409> if<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.649> necessary

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
move through the system if the necessary

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.950 
move through the system if the necessary
tools<00:01:47.520> learned<00:01:47.880> at<00:01:48.030> previous<00:01:48.450> levels<00:01:48.840> are

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
tools learned at previous levels are

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.200 
tools learned at previous levels are
there<00:01:49.259> more<00:01:49.950> time<00:01:50.220> could<00:01:50.429> be<00:01:50.490> dedicated<00:01:50.789> to

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
there more time could be dedicated to

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.859 
there more time could be dedicated to
