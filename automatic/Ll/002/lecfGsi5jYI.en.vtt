00:00:01.863 --> 00:00:03.934
 I will do it for you, Frodo! 

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:06.530
 I'll be the one to carry the Ring now! 

00:00:11.998 --> 00:00:17.028
 The one who carries the Ring, the one who wears the Ring ... 

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:22.726
 he stands in front of his destiny ... 

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:28.125
 looking in the eyes of darkness and despair ... 

00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:33.338
 that rise up and shrink with hate. 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:44.139
 Oh! I can feel how you change as we approach the big ovens ... 

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:47.737
 in which in ancestral times you were forged and shaped. 

00:00:49.644 --> 00:00:52.003
 The Mount of Destiny. 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.003
 I could claim you, Ring! 

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:05.203
 It would be Samwise the Strong! 

00:01:06.803 --> 00:01:11.861
 The one who carries the Ring, the one who wears the Ring ... 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.625
 He hears a voice that urges him ... 

00:01:17.747 --> 00:01:22.843
 and it fills him with thoughts that echo in his mind. 

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:27.957
 And tells... 

00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:33.708
 "Beware of power, because it is unknown. 

00:01:33.922 --> 00:01:39.230
 Beware of the power that was simple; now it has grown. 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.945
 Take care, you who carry the Ring. 

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:50.080
 The final power has not yet manifested. " 

00:01:50.218 --> 00:01:55.608
 The one who carries the Ring, the one who wears the Ring ... 

00:01:55.608 --> 00:02:01.286
 through forces that tempt you to resist ... 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.519
 must undertake the search to finish ... 

00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:12.195
 with the dark era that death has kissed. 

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:17.394
 The one who carries the Ring, the one who wears the Ring. 

00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:23.947
 Beware the one who wears the Ring. 

00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:35.153
 Greetings, Samsagaz the Strong! Greetings, Conqueror! 

00:02:35.815 --> 00:02:40.344
 Greetings, King of War! Hero of the Era! 

00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:45.070
 To the dark tower! To Barad-Dur! 

00:02:56.007 --> 00:03:01.826
 I claim you, Barad-Dur! You do not belong to Sauron anymore! 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.187
 Greetings, Samsagaz the Strong! The sun shines only for you! 

00:03:17.538 --> 00:03:22.585
 And now I claim the entire Valley of Gorgoroth! 

00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:29.232
 That this desolation, this damn plan of Sauron ... 

00:03:29.232 --> 00:03:34.490
 the Dark Lord, this desert of untold horrors ... 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.035
 infested with Orcs, bloom and live! 

00:03:39.142 --> 00:03:43.623
 Long live Samshagaz the Strong! 

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:48.277
 Samwise the Strong! 

00:03:59.847 --> 00:04:05.694
 Here are the gardens of my delight. 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.703
 I will transform the world! 

00:04:20.396 --> 00:04:27.172
 Everything could be mine if I just claimed you, Ring. 

00:04:33.112 --> 00:04:37.112
 Noooooo! 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
