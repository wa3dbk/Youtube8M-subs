00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.890 
probably not made for cutting oaks or
heavy<00:01:32.130> duty<00:01:32.220> stuff<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.329> what<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.689> do<00:01:33.869> is

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
heavy duty stuff so but what you do is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.450 
heavy duty stuff so but what you do is
is<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.439> cut<00:01:34.590> any<00:01:34.770> laminate<00:01:35.220> or<00:01:35.280> anything

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
is if you cut any laminate or anything

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.830 
is if you cut any laminate or anything
that's<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> deteriorate<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
that's really going to deteriorate the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.330 
that's really going to deteriorate the
teeth<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.320> use<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.829> some<00:01:37.979> laminate

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
teeth and I use it for some laminate

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.069 
teeth and I use it for some laminate
hardwood<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:39.060> obviously<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.720> need<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
hardwood so obviously I need to get a

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.499 
hardwood so obviously I need to get a
new<00:01:40.200> one<00:01:40.320> after<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.740> leave<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.189> okay<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.060> so

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
new one after we leave so okay and so

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.910 
new one after we leave so okay and so
let's<00:01:42.720> talk<00:01:42.840> about<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> other<00:01:43.259> attachments

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920

use those I haven't yet but I actually

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.889 
use those I haven't yet but I actually
have<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.939> project<00:01:48.119> coming<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.540> where<00:01:48.689> I'm<00:01:48.750> gonna

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
have a project coming up where I'm gonna

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.960 
have a project coming up where I'm gonna
have<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.740> lot<00:01:49.860> better<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.430> less

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
have to it's a lot better and less

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.600 
have to it's a lot better and less
abrasive<00:01:51.540> than<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.140> big<00:01:52.530> heavy<00:01:52.770> sander<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.399> cut

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
abrasive than a big heavy sander to cut

with this little thing you can put it on

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.230 
with this little thing you can put it on
the<00:01:55.890> pad<00:01:56.070> because<00:01:56.399> obviously<00:01:56.880> your<00:01:57.030> sands

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
with this you're not really digging into

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.380 
with this you're not really digging into
the<00:01:59.159> finish<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.610> hardwood<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> little

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the finish of a hardwood for a little

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.300 
the finish of a hardwood for a little
repair<00:02:00.719> it'd<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:01.020> great<00:02:01.259> okay<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:01.920> you're<00:02:02.219> all

about doing a job that's really tight

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.959 
about doing a job that's really tight

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
make a big mess or really get too heavy

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.800 
make a big mess or really get too heavy
digging<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.729> something<00:02:09.119> with<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.300> bigger<00:02:09.539> tool

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
digging in something with a bigger tool

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.140 
digging in something with a bigger tool
this<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.259> perfect<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.950> great<00:02:11.280> repair<00:02:11.970> tool

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
this is perfect it's a great repair tool

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.400 
this is perfect it's a great repair tool
right<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.810> would<00:02:12.930> think<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.140> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
right and I would think that the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.320 
right and I would think that the
would<00:02:13.590> really<00:02:13.860> do<00:02:14.310> some<00:02:14.490> nice<00:02:14.640> detail<00:02:15.060> work

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
would really do some nice detail work

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.310 
would really do some nice detail work
for<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.600> as<00:02:15.690> well<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:16.020> say<00:02:16.170> with

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
for you as well like say with

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.020 
for you as well like say with
transitions<00:02:17.010> yep<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.370> few<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.820> little

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
transitions yep a few in that little

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.640 
transitions yep a few in that little
transition<00:02:18.450> obviously<00:02:18.930> straight<00:02:19.200> cuts<00:02:19.440> easy

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
transition obviously straight cuts easy

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.380 
transition obviously straight cuts easy
but<00:02:19.890> if<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.070> had<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.340> L<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.790> little<00:02:21.090> end<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.330> a

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
but if you had to L a little end of a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.200 
but if you had to L a little end of a
transition<00:02:21.960> out<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:23.550> know<00:02:23.670> door<00:02:23.970> jamb<00:02:24.180> or

condos<00:02:32.010> downtown<00:02:32.630> they<00:02:33.630> don't<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:34.680> not<00:02:34.830> easy

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
condos downtown they don't it's not easy

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.500 
condos downtown they don't it's not easy
to<00:02:35.100> bring<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.310> whole<00:02:35.430> table<00:02:35.640> saw<00:02:35.910> upstairs<00:02:36.300> so

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
to bring the whole table saw upstairs so

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.180 
to bring the whole table saw upstairs so
this<00:02:36.660> worked<00:02:36.870> out<00:02:37.020> perfect<00:02:37.530> okay<00:02:37.950> what<00:02:38.100> about

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
this worked out perfect okay what about

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.430 
this worked out perfect okay what about
the<00:02:38.370> battery<00:02:38.670> life<00:02:38.900> its<00:02:39.900> comparable<00:02:40.290> with

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
the battery life its comparable with

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.840 
the battery life its comparable with
every<00:02:40.650> other<00:02:40.740> one<00:02:40.890> I've<00:02:41.040> used<00:02:41.070> this<00:02:41.640> one

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
every other one I've used this one

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.370 
every other one I've used this one
probably<00:02:42.390> will<00:02:42.510> go<00:02:42.600> for<00:02:42.780> about<00:02:42.900> four<00:02:43.140> or<00:02:43.230> five

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
probably will go for about four or five

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.140 
probably will go for about four or five
hours<00:02:43.410> with<00:02:43.890> heavy<00:02:44.070> use<00:02:44.190> but<00:02:44.760> they<00:02:44.910> give<00:02:45.060> you

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
hours with heavy use but they give you

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.030 
hours with heavy use but they give you
two<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:45.870> easy<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.200> have<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.530> second<00:02:46.920> one

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
two so it's easy to have the second one

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.550 
two so it's easy to have the second one
going<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:48.660> worked<00:02:48.870> out<00:02:49.020> pretty<00:02:49.080> well<00:02:49.380> I

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
going and it worked out pretty well I

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.140 
going and it worked out pretty well I
never<00:02:49.770> really<00:02:50.220> ran<00:02:50.340> into<00:02:50.640> an<00:02:50.730> issue<00:02:50.790> where<00:02:51.120> I

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
never really ran into an issue where I

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.520 
never really ran into an issue where I
just<00:02:51.270> didn't<00:02:51.630> have<00:02:51.720> any<00:02:51.780> power<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.380> was

waiting around so okay and I see it's
got<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.360> battery<00:02:55.140> gauge<00:02:55.320> honor<00:02:55.530> peasant<00:02:55.860> yep

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
got a battery gauge honor peasant yep

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.430 
got a battery gauge honor peasant yep
absolutely<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.880> one's<00:02:57.120> actually<00:02:57.900> shows<00:02:58.230> up

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
absolutely this one's actually shows up

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.620 
absolutely this one's actually shows up
right<00:02:59.250> away<00:02:59.370> goes<00:02:59.910> off<00:03:00.120> in<00:03:00.240> about<00:03:00.390> three

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
right away goes off in about three

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.160 
right away goes off in about three
seconds

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
seconds

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.240 
seconds
which<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.440> better<00:03:01.590> than<00:03:01.770> some<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.100> other

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
which is better than some of the other

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.650 
which is better than some of the other
models<00:03:02.490> where<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:02.880> actually<00:03:02.970> have<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.300> hold<00:03:03.510> a

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
models where you actually have to hold a

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.720 
models where you actually have to hold a
button<00:03:03.930> or<00:03:04.350> push<00:03:04.650> something<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.250> one<00:03:05.460> kind

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
button or push something this one kind

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.830 
button or push something this one kind
of<00:03:05.790> let<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.000> know<00:03:06.120> right<00:03:06.270> away<00:03:06.420> where<00:03:06.690> you're

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
of let you know right away where you're

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.480 
of let you know right away where you're
at<00:03:06.900> okay<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.560> see<00:03:07.740> like<00:03:07.920> it's<00:03:08.310> got<00:03:08.460> a

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
at okay and I see like it's got a

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.070 
at okay and I see like it's got a
variable<00:03:09.000> speed<00:03:09.210> right<00:03:09.510> here<00:03:09.660> what<00:03:09.810> speed

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
variable speed right here what speed

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.840 
variable speed right here what speed
were<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.350> running<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.680> at<00:03:10.770> I<00:03:10.950> always<00:03:11.520> ran<00:03:11.700> it

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
were you running it at I always ran it

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.430 
were you running it at I always ran it
at<00:03:11.940> max<00:03:12.150> speed<00:03:12.270> but<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.720> guess<00:03:13.020> if<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.290> have<00:03:13.410> a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
at max speed but I guess if you have a

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.990 
at max speed but I guess if you have a
real<00:03:13.710> finite<00:03:14.130> job<00:03:14.370> or<00:03:14.550> you're<00:03:14.670> not<00:03:14.760> real

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
real finite job or you're not real

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.790 
real finite job or you're not real
familiar<00:03:15.180> with<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.600> hand<00:03:15.810> tool<00:03:16.020> you<00:03:16.440> could<00:03:16.590> turn

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
familiar with a hand tool you could turn

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.740 
familiar with a hand tool you could turn
it<00:03:16.980> down<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.370> it's<00:03:17.550> a<00:03:17.670> lot<00:03:17.880> less<00:03:18.360> abrasive

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
it down and it's a lot less abrasive

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.060 
it down and it's a lot less abrasive
especially<00:03:19.680> if<00:03:19.740> you're<00:03:19.890> like<00:03:20.040> a

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
especially if you're like a

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.770 
especially if you're like a
do-it-yourselfer<00:03:21.000> or<00:03:21.030> something<00:03:21.420> like<00:03:21.570> that

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
do-it-yourselfer or something like that

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.140 
do-it-yourselfer or something like that
alright<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:22.920> if<00:03:23.340> somebody<00:03:23.640> came<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.060> and

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
alright so if somebody came to you and

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
one so it's like this pretty much had a

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.050 
one so it's like this pretty much had a
little<00:03:52.590> bit<00:03:52.740> of<00:03:52.770> all<00:03:52.950> everything<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.970> the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
little bit of all everything that the

little bit of all everything that the
other<00:03:54.180> ones<00:03:54.360> didn't<00:03:54.720> necessarily<00:03:54.840> all<00:03:55.410> have

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
other ones didn't necessarily all have

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.410 
other ones didn't necessarily all have
so<00:03:56.070> all<00:03:56.340> in<00:03:56.490> all<00:03:56.550> it<00:03:56.700> was<00:03:56.790> a<00:03:56.820> pretty<00:03:56.910> good<00:03:57.240> deal
