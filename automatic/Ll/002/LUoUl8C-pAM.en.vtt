 create a book your see American that 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.970
 it's called breaking rights that the truth 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.710
 is that not for the creating book taxi os 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.689
 I leave your channel and your video a little bit more 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.829
 down like the other here so anything I 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.509
 the truth is that when it comes 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.430
 channel that month because it turned out very 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.960
 curious all this about making a rainbow 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.670
 with covers at first the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.219
 I really said that this is because the 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.660
 truth is that I saw it a bit strange 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.329
 I saw the idea a little bit 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.670
 I do not know let's say it's weird and then when 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.980
 I saw the tag and I saw how beautiful two are 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.840
 books together of the rainbow and such 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.700
 The truth is that I was encouraged to do so 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.410
 that nothing starts with good time and 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.750
 I hope you like the first color is 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.390
 the color red I have chosen blood magic 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.970
 discredited is this the book what 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.010
 matter in this trip is the tenderloin so 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.410
 this is the fungus that you see it can not 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.000
 be more lame I speak a little bit of 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.830

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.070

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.290
 but I've talked less than a little bit like that 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.630
 Well , nothing happens the second 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.850
 color is the orange picked secrets of 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.530
 the separ this is the second book of the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.490
 saga little liars the color of 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.770
 cover is the same as there is 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.270
 back cover and spine so the tenderloin 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.110
 because it has a beautiful orange and I 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.300
 I love you I recommended it this is this 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.009
 Friday I recommended it the good saga the 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.390
 first, more good, but let's talk about 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.729
 the whole saga I leave you also the link 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.810
 here to the video so you can see it and 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.729
 I comment 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.079
 this fantastic room that I do not 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.409
 I will speak because I spoke in this video and 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.479
 I put it on you see it until the third color 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.890
 is the yellow I have chosen the first 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.960
 book of the salamander agency of 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.399
 they won their javier pelegrÃ­n long is that 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.850
 it has racked my brains to find 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.100
 a yellow book because I have four to 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.899
 at the most and I was not convinced by any 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.729
 that I found this one that received it 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.409
 long ago and I still have not read it 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.569
 we were orange end that has here some 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.310
 little things but the truth is that 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.810
 when I showed them all together and 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.459
 you will see how well the fourth colors are 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.110
 the green and chosen rumors of rooms and 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.940
 apartment this would be the fourth part 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.890
 of the saga little liars the same 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.450
 that in the other book of the saga they have 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.000
 all the same color in the book and it's a 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.430
 pistachio green but it's true purpose and 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.060
 out and well then it looks good then now 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.700
 I show you the fifth color I guess 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.010
 It's turquoise but as I do not know, it calls 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.099
 of weird blue so the book that 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.110
 chosen for weird blue is from ironkey in 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.180
 the first book in the yuri saga 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.450
 peanut portals very precious os 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.370
 you leave orgasmic I suffer a lot because it is 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.230
 so beautiful that 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.450
 and now 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.640
 so good has a color 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.470

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.680
 Loin because it is beautiful and I suffer to see 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.540
 the back cover because it's beautiful and 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.360
 I also suffer because I could not read it 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.030
 still then I suffer even more so 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.950
 that as you can see my life is like a tumblr 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.260
 of fang irle is like suffering 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.629
 continuous 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.159
 and I want to cry the next to last color 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.530
 because I lost the account and now 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.170
 I do not know if it is the fourth eighth 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.670
 color is the color blue I have chosen the 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.560
 the second part of the closure of 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.090
 magic of amanda hocking this book what 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.409
 I have pending besides that when I 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.000
 I read the first one says that the second one 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.319
 Valera the next month but how 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.269
 I have here well then I teach it that 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.269
 It's beautiful I remember that I have it 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.010
 to read and so to see if what 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.780
 dusted a little off the shelf like 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.730
 the first one I did not like I do not get excited 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.430
 I do not have much to do in the second 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.950
 but I promised myself to read a book 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.269
 in the saga a month and good has already happened 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.280
 unread March of the saga so what 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.560
 I'll have to read in April if I do not 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.299
 I put for May but good because 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.260
 I explain I do not know if I should tell 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:59.450
 in an email books or something like that 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.549
 and the last color that would be the color 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.620
 purple I suppose unless I have a 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.250
 strange color we will call purple to 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.569
 dry 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.430
 they are threatened to fill their 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.250
 world xi who pronounced his return is 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.750
 weird but I do not know I do not have something in me 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.840
 room I'm too lazy to go downstairs 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.019
 down and I pronounce weird because I can not 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.380
 drink water and I also suffer as with 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.510
 Julie Kagawa and I suffer a lot is the third 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.850
 part of four and one of the fourth in the 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.100

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.150
 on the spine and well now I'm going to pass 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.370
 to teach all the books how they are 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.310
 that are beautiful the truth that this is 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.680
 which is that they are beautiful we did good 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.630

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.130
 upside down but good they are prices 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.419
 we did if you see something that is more 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.979
 fuzzy that I'm fuzzy that the 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.620
 russian dairy books is because I have a 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.990
 canon and when he records a video 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.669
