00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.309 

now<00:00:01.410> for<00:00:02.510> the<00:00:03.510> diagonal<00:00:04.230> cube<00:00:05.600> well<00:00:06.600> first<00:00:07.080> off

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
now for the diagonal cube well first off

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.020 
now for the diagonal cube well first off
you<00:00:07.500> need<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.710> truncate<00:00:08.780> the<00:00:10.849> octahedron<00:00:11.849> and

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
you need to truncate the octahedron and

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.000 
you need to truncate the octahedron and
there'll<00:00:12.660> be<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.809> link<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.410> my<00:00:13.500> video

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:28.970 

now<00:00:17.010> first<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.640> might<00:00:17.789> think<00:00:27.140> now<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.680> this

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
now first you might think now in this

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.550 
now first you might think now in this
build<00:00:29.359> the<00:00:30.359> magnetic<00:00:30.900> poles<00:00:31.109> become

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
build the magnetic poles become

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.910 
build the magnetic poles become
extraordinarily<00:00:32.480> important<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.590> don't

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
extraordinarily important if you don't

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.889 
extraordinarily important if you don't
have<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> firm<00:00:35.550> grasp<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:36.149> how<00:00:36.360> thing<00:00:36.630> that

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
have a firm grasp on how thing that

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.020 
have a firm grasp on how thing that
pulls<00:00:37.170> aligned<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.070> can't<00:00:38.520> keep<00:00:38.700> track<00:00:38.969> of

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
pulls aligned and can't keep track of

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.680 
pulls aligned and can't keep track of
them<00:00:39.350> good<00:00:40.350> luck<00:00:40.969> because<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.180> magnetic

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
them good luck because the magnetic

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.750 
them good luck because the magnetic
poles<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.500> very<00:00:43.800> strong<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.520> get

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
poles on this get very strong and get

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.729 
poles on this get very strong and get
very<00:00:45.059> fussy<00:00:46.489> they<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.550> not<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.140> be<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
very fussy they do not like to be in the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.490 
very fussy they do not like to be in the
configuration<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.820> diagonal<00:00:51.350> but<00:00:52.350> they

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
configuration of a diagonal but they

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.660 
configuration of a diagonal but they
will<00:00:52.710> fit<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.649> truncate<00:00:56.100> all<00:00:56.370> of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
will fit so you just truncate all of

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.099 
will fit so you just truncate all of
them<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> same<00:00:57.210> amount<00:00:59.510> and<00:01:00.510> I'll<00:01:00.750> see<00:01:00.899> it's

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
them the same amount and I'll see it's

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.189 
them the same amount and I'll see it's
starting<00:01:01.879> it<00:01:02.879> wants<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.359> slide<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.049> all

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
starting it wants to slide and do all

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.990 
starting it wants to slide and do all
this<00:01:04.350> crazy<00:01:04.680> stuff<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:07.520> that's<00:01:08.520> kind<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.760> cool

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
this crazy stuff so that's kind of cool

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.050 
this crazy stuff so that's kind of cool
oh<00:01:11.030> well

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.300 

okay<00:01:16.060> there<00:01:16.390> it<00:01:16.510> is<00:01:16.630> yeah<00:01:16.810> all<00:01:17.680> right<00:01:17.890> so<00:01:18.159> now

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
okay there it is yeah all right so now

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.660 
okay there it is yeah all right so now
we<00:01:18.460> have<00:01:18.940> a<00:01:19.240> truncated<00:01:20.080> octahedron<00:01:23.670> remember

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
we have a truncated octahedron remember

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.250 
we have a truncated octahedron remember
how<00:01:24.760> many<00:01:24.820> sides<00:01:25.090> offhand<00:01:25.570> it'll<00:01:25.810> be<00:01:25.930> in<00:01:26.050> the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
how many sides offhand it'll be in the

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.840 
how many sides offhand it'll be in the
details<00:01:26.890> but<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.960> now<00:01:29.830> you<00:01:29.890> can<00:01:30.190> see<00:01:30.369> that<00:01:30.580> you

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
details but so now you can see that you

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.770 
details but so now you can see that you
have<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.150> start<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:32.550> a<00:01:33.550> diagonal<00:01:34.390> cube<00:01:34.869> here

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
have the start of a diagonal cube here

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.920 
have the start of a diagonal cube here
on<00:01:37.780> these<00:01:38.020> sides<00:01:38.350> here<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:41.820> how<00:01:42.820> might<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:43.900> ask

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
on these sides here so how might you ask

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.320 
on these sides here so how might you ask
do<00:01:44.830> you<00:01:44.860> manage<00:01:45.190> to<00:01:45.869> add<00:01:46.869> tips<00:01:47.289> to<00:01:47.440> that<00:01:47.619> well

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
do you manage to add tips to that well

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:57.139 
do you manage to add tips to that well
it's<00:01:49.330> actually<00:01:49.509> very<00:01:50.259> challenging<00:01:52.830> all<00:01:53.830> right

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.350 

so<00:01:58.149> here<00:01:58.420> we've<00:01:58.570> got<00:01:58.780> my<00:01:58.990> tube<00:01:59.700> ready<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.880> go<00:02:01.000> my

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
so here we've got my tube ready to go my

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.340 
so here we've got my tube ready to go my
coil<00:02:02.250> now<00:02:03.250> what<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.610> want<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.910> do<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.350> better

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
coil now what you want to do is better

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.810 
coil now what you want to do is better
if<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.560> kind<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:05.950> remember<00:02:06.280> this<00:02:06.490> as<00:02:06.670> you're

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
if you kind of remember this as you're

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.820 
if you kind of remember this as you're
making<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.270> but<00:02:07.390> I<00:02:07.450> didn't<00:02:07.780> think<00:02:08.380> about<00:02:08.530> that

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
making it but I didn't think about that

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.400 
making it but I didn't think about that
is<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:10.360> remember<00:02:10.810> what<00:02:11.200> Pole<00:02:11.590> is<00:02:11.830> aware<00:02:12.130> okay

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
is to remember what Pole is aware okay

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.870 
is to remember what Pole is aware okay
you<00:02:14.410> want<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.620> know<00:02:14.709> what<00:02:14.920> direction<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
you want to know what direction the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.970 
you want to know what direction the
entire<00:02:16.209> thing<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.690> wrapping<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:20.590> find<00:02:20.860> out

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
entire thing is wrapping so you find out

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.920 
entire thing is wrapping so you find out
just<00:02:21.280> by<00:02:21.489> testing<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.060> out<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.390> seeing<00:02:22.600> what

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
just by testing it out and seeing what

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.259 
just by testing it out and seeing what
goes<00:02:23.049> where<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:24.070> now<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.400> think<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.090> this

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
goes where and so now I think that this

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.630 
goes where and so now I think that this
is<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.600> top<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.070> gonna<00:02:27.370> be<00:02:27.489> the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
is the top and this is gonna be the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.789 
is the top and this is gonna be the
bottom<00:02:27.880> maybe<00:02:28.470> I'll<00:02:29.470> see<00:02:29.650> here<00:02:31.290> it's<00:02:32.290> this<00:02:32.620> is

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
bottom maybe I'll see here it's this is

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.199 
bottom maybe I'll see here it's this is
the<00:02:32.920> hardest<00:02:33.190> part<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.519> actually<00:02:33.730> figuring

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
the hardest part is actually figuring

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.620 
the hardest part is actually figuring
out<00:02:34.360> what<00:02:34.690> goes<00:02:34.959> where<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:35.380> anyway<00:02:36.030> but<00:02:37.030> figure

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
out what goes where so anyway but figure

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.370 
out what goes where so anyway but figure
out<00:02:37.780> what<00:02:37.989> direction<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.769> stuff<00:02:38.980> goes<00:02:39.220> in

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
out what direction the stuff goes in

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.979 
out what direction the stuff goes in
okay<00:02:42.930> yeah<00:02:44.070> like<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.160> said<00:02:45.190> it's<00:02:45.549> not<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:46.630> part

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
okay yeah like I said it's not this part

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.170 
okay yeah like I said it's not this part
is<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:50.320> just<00:02:50.560> miserable<00:02:50.829> so<00:02:51.640> there's

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
is the it's just miserable so there's

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.720 
is the it's just miserable so there's
that<00:02:52.480> little<00:02:52.780> deal<00:02:53.019> and<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:54.160> gotta<00:02:54.340> have<00:02:54.400> that

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
that little deal and you gotta have that

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.699 
that little deal and you gotta have that
mesh<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.600> then<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.840> gotta<00:02:55.989> have<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.440> mesh

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
mesh and then you gotta have that mesh

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.620 
mesh and then you gotta have that mesh
then<00:02:57.519> you've<00:02:57.700> got<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.940> find<00:02:58.090> some<00:02:58.269> way<00:02:58.299> to<00:02:58.420> hold

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
then you've got to find some way to hold

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.250 
then you've got to find some way to hold
that<00:02:58.810> down<00:02:59.610> there<00:03:00.780> instead<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.870> sliding<00:03:02.049> up

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
that down there instead of sliding up

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.979 
that down there instead of sliding up
like<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.530> wants<00:03:02.769> to<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.910> then<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.750> want<00:03:04.900> to

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
like it wants to and then you want to

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.110 
like it wants to and then you want to
have<00:03:05.079> it<00:03:05.200> mesh<00:03:05.380> again<00:03:05.560> well<00:03:06.400> actually<00:03:06.610> here

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
have it mesh again well actually here

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.349 
have it mesh again well actually here
now<00:03:07.530> this<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:09.100> trickiest<00:03:09.640> part<00:03:09.670> this<00:03:10.090> one

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
now this is the trickiest part this one

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.599 
now this is the trickiest part this one
it's<00:03:11.079> going<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.320> end<00:03:11.560> off<00:03:11.769> with<00:03:11.799> just<00:03:12.340> one

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
it's going to end off with just one

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.920 
it's going to end off with just one
sphere<00:03:12.970> on<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.209> tips<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:14.440> as<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.160> can<00:03:15.340> see

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
sphere on the tips and as you can see

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.569 
sphere on the tips and as you can see
it's<00:03:16.930> not<00:03:17.440> fun

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.970 

so<00:03:22.579> just<00:03:23.209> sit<00:03:23.540> there<00:03:23.719> and<00:03:23.900> dick<00:03:24.530> around<00:03:24.799> with

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
so just sit there and dick around with

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.679 
so just sit there and dick around with
it<00:03:25.129> until<00:03:25.189> you<00:03:25.430> can<00:03:25.579> figure<00:03:25.730> out<00:03:25.879> but<00:03:26.150> it's

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:26.689 
it until you can figure out but it's

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.679 
it until you can figure out but it's
just<00:03:26.810> miserable<00:03:27.200> oh<00:03:27.560> I<00:03:27.799> had<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:28.519> anyway

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:29.689 
just miserable oh I had it anyway

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.229 
just miserable oh I had it anyway
so<00:03:30.379> some<00:03:30.680> of<00:03:30.799> them<00:03:30.980> end<00:03:31.189> with<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.670> small

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
so some of them end with a small

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.800 
so some of them end with a small
triangle<00:03:32.540> of<00:03:32.840> just<00:03:33.049> three<00:03:33.319> of<00:03:33.409> them<00:03:34.569> very<00:03:35.569> nice

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
triangle of just three of them very nice

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.309 
triangle of just three of them very nice
very<00:03:36.230> convenient<00:03:37.060> but<00:03:38.060> this<00:03:38.239> one<00:03:38.420> doesn't<00:03:38.599> so

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
very convenient but this one doesn't so

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.050 
very convenient but this one doesn't so
you<00:03:39.620> just<00:03:40.220> have<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.430> get<00:03:40.549> a<00:03:40.579> feel<00:03:40.760> for<00:03:40.790> what

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
you just have to get a feel for what

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.210 
you just have to get a feel for what
size<00:03:41.269> does<00:03:41.569> what<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.840> then<00:03:45.049> you<00:03:45.799> have<00:03:46.129> to

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
size does what and then you have to

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.039 
size does what and then you have to
figure<00:03:46.400> it<00:03:46.609> out<00:03:46.730> all<00:03:47.000> over<00:03:47.030> again<00:03:47.540> what

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
figure it out all over again what

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.619 
figure it out all over again what
direction<00:03:48.379> is<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:48.769> going<00:03:49.129> oh<00:03:49.340> boy<00:03:49.639> fun<00:03:49.939> fun<00:03:50.239> fun

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
half a cube how about that that'd work

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.560 
half a cube how about that that'd work
better<00:04:39.860> it<00:04:40.550> doesn't<00:04:40.849> if<00:04:41.060> you<00:04:41.120> don't<00:04:41.180> like<00:04:41.449> it
