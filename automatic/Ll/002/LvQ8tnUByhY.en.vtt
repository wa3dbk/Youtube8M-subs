00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.890 
that's what helps the weight issue okay
well<00:02:32.849> what<00:02:33.000> we<00:02:33.120> do<00:02:33.299> I<00:02:33.599> slide<00:02:34.379> this<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.870> the

back of this this piece here and when
you<00:02:43.170> slide<00:02:43.439> it<00:02:43.620> down<00:02:43.799> you'll<00:02:44.220> hear<00:02:44.430> some

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
you slide it down you'll hear some

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.339 
you slide it down you'll hear some
clicks<00:02:46.579> like<00:02:47.579> that<00:02:47.819> that's<00:02:48.750> not<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:48.989> break-in

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
clicks like that that's not a break-in

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.830 
clicks like that that's not a break-in
that's<00:02:49.970> actually<00:02:50.970> some<00:02:51.180> ridges<00:02:51.540> on<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:51.690> back

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
that's actually some ridges on the back

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.619 
that's actually some ridges on the back
and<00:02:52.379> it's<00:02:53.250> holding<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.790> in<00:02:53.909> place

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
and it's holding it in place

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.750 
and it's holding it in place
I<00:02:54.659> actually<00:02:55.319> prefer<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:56.250> have<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.579> thumb

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
I actually prefer to have the thumb

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.000 
I actually prefer to have the thumb
plate<00:02:57.060> quite<00:02:57.420> far<00:02:57.659> down<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.139> to<00:02:58.379> do<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:58.769> I

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
plate quite far down and to do this I

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.819 
plate quite far down and to do this I
put<00:02:59.760> my<00:02:59.819> hands<00:03:00.239> in<00:03:00.359> position<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:03.720> use<00:03:04.650> my

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
put my hands in position and I I use my

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.759 
put my hands in position and I I use my
thumb<00:03:05.159> to<00:03:05.370> actually<00:03:05.730> push<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.000> down<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:07.470> help

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
thumb to actually push it down to help

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.119 
thumb to actually push it down to help
push<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.879> down<00:03:09.000> into<00:03:09.180> position<00:03:09.389> there<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.170> as

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
push it down into position there and as

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:17.270 
push it down into position there and as
you<00:03:11.280> can<00:03:11.400> say<00:03:14.420> that's<00:03:15.420> how<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.139> have<00:03:16.769> my<00:03:16.950> elbow

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
you can say that's how I have my elbow

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.900 
you can say that's how I have my elbow
and<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:17.790> my<00:03:17.910> hands<00:03:18.329> are<00:03:18.449> in<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.599> lovely<00:03:19.910> open

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
and so my hands are in a lovely open

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.909 
and so my hands are in a lovely open
position<00:03:21.629> and<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.930> weight<00:03:22.139> is<00:03:22.379> being<00:03:22.560> taken

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
position and the weight is being taken

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.909 
position and the weight is being taken
on<00:03:23.459> this<00:03:24.090> part<00:03:24.419> of<00:03:24.599> my<00:03:24.750> thumb<00:03:25.049> rather<00:03:25.440> than<00:03:25.739> the

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
on this part of my thumb rather than the

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:33.349 
on this part of my thumb rather than the
very<00:03:26.040> end<00:03:26.400> bit<00:03:27.590> like<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.859> I<00:03:32.060> prefer<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.239> have

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
very end bit like that I prefer to have

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.330 
very end bit like that I prefer to have
it<00:03:33.480> slightly<00:03:33.750> lower<00:03:34.079> down<00:03:34.319> you<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:34.769> adjust<00:03:35.099> it

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
it slightly lower down you can adjust it

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.270 
it slightly lower down you can adjust it
but<00:03:35.909> you<00:03:36.030> always<00:03:36.470> must<00:03:37.470> slide<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.980> completely

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
but you always must slide it completely

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.149 
but you always must slide it completely
down<00:03:38.909> to<00:03:39.180> take<00:03:39.389> it<00:03:39.569> off<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:40.530> doesn't<00:03:40.769> you<00:03:41.010> don't

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
down to take it off it doesn't you don't

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.589 
down to take it off it doesn't you don't
want<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.370> go<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.609> other<00:03:41.699> way<00:03:42.169> like<00:03:43.169> this<00:03:43.349> okay

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
want to go the other way like this okay

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.399 
want to go the other way like this okay
so<00:03:45.599> we<00:03:46.019> slide<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.500> on<00:03:46.620> like<00:03:46.859> that<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:48.569> then

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
so we slide it on like that and then

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.599 
so we slide it on like that and then
push<00:03:49.889> it<00:03:50.099> down<00:03:50.220> into<00:03:50.400> place<00:03:51.169> like<00:03:52.169> this<00:03:52.609> now

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
push it down into place like this now

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.110 
push it down into place like this now
when<00:03:54.569> I<00:03:54.599> first<00:03:55.049> tried<00:03:55.500> this<00:03:56.159> thumb<00:03:56.489> rest<00:03:56.790> it

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
when I first tried this thumb rest it

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.960 
when I first tried this thumb rest it
felt<00:03:57.569> incredibly<00:03:58.560> bulky<00:03:59.069> because<00:03:59.609> as<00:03:59.760> you<00:03:59.849> can

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
felt incredibly bulky because as you can

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.939 
felt incredibly bulky because as you can
see<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.419> another<00:04:01.280> about<00:04:02.280> another<00:04:03.209> centimeter

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949 
see you another about another centimeter

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.469 
see you another about another centimeter
maybe<00:04:04.949> half<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.340> centimeter<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:05.909> a<00:04:06.060> centimeter

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
maybe half a centimeter to a centimeter

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:12.530 
maybe half a centimeter to a centimeter
away<00:04:07.129> from<00:04:08.129> your<00:04:08.790> initial<00:04:09.659> position<00:04:10.400> but<00:04:11.540> it's

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
away from your initial position but it's

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.080 
away from your initial position but it's
strange<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:13.109> it<00:04:13.799> does<00:04:14.129> actually<00:04:14.340> feel<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:14.819> lot

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
strange that it does actually feel a lot

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.819 
strange that it does actually feel a lot
more<00:04:15.120> comfortable<00:04:15.419> because<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.169> opens<00:04:16.590> your

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
more comfortable because it opens your

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.789 
more comfortable because it opens your
hands<00:04:17.310> up<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:18.419> this<00:04:18.570> sort<00:04:18.989> of<00:04:19.049> position<00:04:19.500> rather

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
hands up to this sort of position rather

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.409 
hands up to this sort of position rather
than<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.190> being<00:04:20.459> flat<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:21.719> I<00:04:21.900> can<00:04:22.079> find<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:24.210> I

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
than it being flat and I can find that I

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.570 
than it being flat and I can find that I
can

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
can

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.300 
can
attack<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.479> lower<00:04:26.629> register<00:04:26.930> a<00:04:27.530> lot<00:04:27.770> easier

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
attack the lower register a lot easier

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:35.080 
attack the lower register a lot easier
than<00:04:28.849> I<00:04:29.000> did<00:04:29.180> previously<00:04:33.610> it's<00:04:34.610> incredibly

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
than I did previously it's incredibly

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.170 
than I did previously it's incredibly
comfortable<00:04:35.629> I'm<00:04:36.530> very<00:04:37.310> impressed<00:04:37.639> with<00:04:37.879> it

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
comfortable I'm very impressed with it

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.070 
comfortable I'm very impressed with it
and<00:04:38.500> I<00:04:39.500> am<00:04:40.120> I'm<00:04:41.120> sad<00:04:41.389> that<00:04:41.419> there<00:04:41.690> wasn't<00:04:41.960> any

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
and I am I'm sad that there wasn't any

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.379 
and I am I'm sad that there wasn't any
other<00:04:42.289> reviews<00:04:42.740> out<00:04:42.949> then<00:04:43.159> I<00:04:43.190> thought<00:04:43.580> well<00:04:44.030> if

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
other reviews out then I thought well if

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.619 
other reviews out then I thought well if
I<00:04:44.509> do<00:04:44.569> it<00:04:44.780> myself<00:04:44.900> then<00:04:45.440> at<00:04:45.590> least<00:04:45.710> if<00:04:45.979> people

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
I do it myself then at least if people

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.600 
I do it myself then at least if people
want<00:04:47.629> to<00:04:47.720> look<00:04:48.080> up<00:04:48.349> this<00:04:48.620> particular<00:04:49.190> one

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
want to look up this particular one

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.100 
want to look up this particular one
though<00:04:49.879> there<00:04:50.210> are<00:04:50.330> different<00:04:50.750> ones<00:04:50.900> those

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
though there are different ones those

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.129 
though there are different ones those
attitude<00:04:51.620> 1<00:04:52.220> 2<00:04:52.490> &amp;<00:04:52.669> 3<00:04:52.699> you<00:04:52.879> think<00:04:53.210> but<00:04:53.870> this<00:04:54.020> is

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
attitude 1 2 &amp; 3 you think but this is

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.730 
attitude 1 2 &amp; 3 you think but this is
for<00:04:54.379> oboe<00:04:54.889> and<00:04:54.919> clarinet<00:04:55.669> and<00:04:56.740> it's

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
for oboe and clarinet and it's

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.180 
for oboe and clarinet and it's
definitely<00:04:58.099> worth<00:04:59.020> trying<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.349> out<00:05:00.530> if<00:05:00.919> you've

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
definitely worth trying it out if you've
