00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.620
 the highlight in the leadership was left in the 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.930
 field of Cartagena which is now the 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.280
 new leader of the second division b the 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.529
 party was marked by the 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.210
 effectiveness of local speech 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.820
 soccer of the real jaén was the one of 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.490
 always touch the ball with consistency and 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.380
 the one of the rival was another the cartagena 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.390
 I played without transition between lines but 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.240
 has players that define and 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.610
 maximize their chances 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.680
 this is the best example 1 to 0 in the 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.559
 first approach to door the match 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.910
 it began to complicate those of Manuel 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.159
 warrior tried but sometimes 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.559
 was missing true and others like in this 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:47.229
 nando action the jienenses felt the 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.940
 impotence of wanting and not being able to 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.070
 Cartagena had no complexes to be 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.409
 dominated he defended himself with order and with 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.049
 Few attack actions would solve 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.900
 the match on this play would come on 2 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:01.570
 to 0 the jienenses put the game and the 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.089
 Cartagena scored the goals with 2 to 0 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.590
 you get to rest the real bus jaén 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.090
 with the reaction in the second part and 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.250
 had chances to get into the 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.590
 match but once again missed the 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.630
 aim the real jaén was from more to less 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.850
 until you reach the final stretch of the 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.130
 match in which the letters 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.320
 could do some more goal only the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.659
 excellent performance of toni garcía avoided 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.619
 a more bulky defeat in the past 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.720
 moments of the shock that we have lost 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.729
 a battle but not the war than 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.299
 we have to fight these six weeks and 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.850
 that I'm going to have a lot to say that 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.729
 the one that we lost in albacete gives the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.610
 feel like this we already something 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.130
 later cut off - hook and follow 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.649
 well and look and they have won and the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.360
 feeling that they may have is that they are going to 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.700
 stay first I do not know if it's going to be anything 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.990
 that's coming from there are going to be luck issues 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.509
 win in our field are again 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.220
 leaders not the team will rest tomorrow and 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.229
 starting on Wednesday you will think of the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.229
 next match at home against rust
