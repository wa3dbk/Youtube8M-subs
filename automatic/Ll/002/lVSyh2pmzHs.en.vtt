00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.609
 characters for mortal kombat x los 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.980
 night maps would be more and more 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.679
 close to battlefield 4 all that and more in 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.509

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.830
 get to the streets of the saints on the 27th 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.539
 of this month you will have to wait for a 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.369
 little more since I think that being decided 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.830
 give a couple more months to launch 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.359
 of gta 5 for pc and good was expected 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.670
 in two ways since you know 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.119
 electronic arts or delay hard line as well 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.600
 that rockstar had to delay gta 7 to 5 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.649
 will arrive on March 24 for pc this 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.480
 week has also revealed a 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.670
 succulent trailer of avenger 6 voltron 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.230
 this time we can see some of the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.760
 new characters although the center of 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.440
 video is based on the skill between 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.510
 Bruce Manel and Tony Stark in their new 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.510
 costume called cool pasteur avenger am 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.129
 a troll will arrive in May of this year in 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.510
 other movie news if you remember them 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.250
 I've been talking about the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.230
 movie of his squat where this week 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.789
 tom hardy who was confirmed to 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.469
 the role of read flag was removed from the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.210
 cast having too many problems of 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.170
 schedule compatibility between your 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.539
 multiple projects 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.519
 apparently the people of the brilog have 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.020
 shared a lot with the people of use already 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.000
 what a week the director of uncharted 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.159
 said that it is likely that the game will not 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.780
 will reach 60 frames per second if 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.280
 is that this affects the experience of 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.000
 player 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.890
 personally does not make like a game 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.450
 running at 60 fps can affect the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.979
 one player experience but good 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.810
 now you know what they mean when 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.969
 people tell them to avoid bad 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.710
 together now going to the games of 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.450
 fight this week we could see in action 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.130
 to the other new characters revealed 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.750
 for mortal kombat x that in this case 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.520
 they are with sides like the ones in front in a 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.990
 previous video that actually has 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.759
 some more years while maintaining the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.219
 classic fighting style with a few 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.929
 new additions quite interesting the 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.909
 another character is the wanted and sensual 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.679
 prince will continue to envelop the saga 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.060
 strangely since supposedly there would be 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.649
 dead in the previous delivery of mortal 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.509
 kombat but as I always said the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.979
 creator of mortal kombat ed boon si 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.630
 they want a character to come back to 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.520
 the saga will come back anyway 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.159
 mortal kombat x will arrive in April this 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.509
 year on the other hand and as far as he tells me 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.009
 for the film the rumored maps 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.959
 nocturnal could be more and more 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.250
 about several thousand four these weeks 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.929
 the developers of dais the already 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.610
 They published some photos that show us 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.899
 the work they've done it now 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.450
 killed him in shifts that probably 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.250
 let's see in the cde for the moment only 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.780
 seen images of Jon Kyl sites and the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.579
 night maps once finished and at 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.500
 be approved they should get to the game 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.600
 final although without an announced date 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.180
 it can mean tomorrow how it can be 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.219
 in one year 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.689
 as you already know this week we will reveal 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.489
 more information about the beta for 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.349
 reflect line can be played on the 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.879
 hotwire modalities and conquest in two 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.319
 maps of which one of them is the 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.209
 that we can play in the previous beta 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.980
 which weapons can use practically 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.599
 all since there will be no limits for 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.430
 blockages in the beta nor will there be 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.079
 limit regarding how many ranges 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.150
 up but remember that all 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.889
 Progress will be eliminated from the beta and 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.930
 then in the final game everyone will start 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:47.810
 from scratch the beta of to fix it 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.879
