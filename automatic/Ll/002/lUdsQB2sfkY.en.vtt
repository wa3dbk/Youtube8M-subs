00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.569 
like I think a hundred different sense
than<00:01:41.229> we<00:01:41.350> were<00:01:41.469> so<00:01:41.649> excited<00:01:41.799> we<00:01:42.130> got<00:01:42.280> in<00:01:42.460> the

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
than we were so excited we got in the

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.279 
than we were so excited we got in the
mail<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:42.939> I<00:01:43.030> started<00:01:43.450> just<00:01:43.630> mixing<00:01:44.109> like<00:01:44.259> a

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
mail and I started just mixing like a

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.169 
mail and I started just mixing like a
chemist<00:01:44.740> we<00:01:45.039> started<00:01:45.369> experimenting<00:01:45.700> more

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
chemist we started experimenting more

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.029 
chemist we started experimenting more
with<00:01:46.359> essential<00:01:46.840> oils<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.350> that's<00:01:47.649> kind<00:01:48.009> of

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
with essential oils and that's kind of

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.440 
with essential oils and that's kind of
the<00:01:48.159> direction<00:01:48.280> that<00:01:48.579> we've<00:01:48.789> decided<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.329> move

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
the direction that we've decided to move

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.260 
the direction that we've decided to move
forward<00:01:49.509> with<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.859> essential<00:01:51.310> oils<00:01:51.609> are<00:01:51.789> pure

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
forward with the essential oils are pure

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.879 
forward with the essential oils are pure
botanical<00:01:52.749> extracts<00:01:53.259> so<00:01:53.499> they're<00:01:53.709> a<00:01:53.740> hundred

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:53.889 
botanical extracts so they're a hundred

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:55.830 
botanical extracts so they're a hundred
percent<00:01:54.159> natural<00:01:54.490> and<00:01:55.030> because<00:01:55.659> they're

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
percent natural and because they're

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.239 
percent natural and because they're
extracted<00:01:56.319> from<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.590> plant<00:01:56.619> they<00:01:57.100> also

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249 
extracted from the plant they also

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.099 
extracted from the plant they also
