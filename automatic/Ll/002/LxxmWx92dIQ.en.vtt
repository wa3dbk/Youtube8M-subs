00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.779 

I<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:23.680> the<00:00:23.800> music<00:00:24.130> in<00:00:24.250> this<00:00:24.279> game<00:00:24.460> it's

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
I like the music in this game it's

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.509 
I like the music in this game it's
really<00:00:25.090> cool<00:00:25.300> this<00:00:25.779> is<00:00:26.109> graviton<00:00:26.890> for<00:00:27.430> the

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
really cool this is graviton for the

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.779 
really cool this is graviton for the
ipod<00:00:28.000> a<00:00:28.390> tilt<00:00:29.019> and<00:00:29.289> glide<00:00:29.650> style<00:00:30.189> of<00:00:30.369> game<00:00:30.610> that

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
ipod a tilt and glide style of game that

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.090 
ipod a tilt and glide style of game that
you<00:00:30.910> play<00:00:31.180> using<00:00:31.599> the<00:00:31.689> accelerometer<00:00:32.050> in<00:00:32.650> your

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
you play using the accelerometer in your

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.210 
you play using the accelerometer in your
ipod<00:00:33.460> or<00:00:33.670> iphone<00:00:33.820> to<00:00:34.420> guide<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:35.220> spaceship

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
ipod or iphone to guide the spaceship

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.470 
ipod or iphone to guide the spaceship
thing<00:00:36.879> it's<00:00:37.570> like<00:00:37.660> a<00:00:37.720> space<00:00:38.110> tug<00:00:38.589> boat<00:00:38.890> or

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
thing it's like a space tug boat or

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:49.260 
thing it's like a space tug boat or
utility<00:00:40.480> machine<00:00:40.900> of<00:00:41.050> some<00:00:41.079> sort

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.330 

the<00:00:49.840> object<00:00:50.230> of<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.440> game<00:00:50.470> is<00:00:50.620> to<00:00:50.770> pick<00:00:51.040> up<00:00:51.190> the

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
the object of the game is to pick up the

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.240 
the object of the game is to pick up the
giant<00:00:51.610> glowing<00:00:52.090> thing<00:00:52.770> transport<00:00:53.770> it<00:00:53.860> safely

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
giant glowing thing transport it safely

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.100 
giant glowing thing transport it safely
through<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.640> level<00:00:55.060> until<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.840> very<00:00:55.990> end

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
through the level until the very end

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.830 
through the level until the very end
where<00:00:56.530> you<00:00:56.650> drop<00:00:56.890> it<00:00:57.040> off<00:00:57.480> seems<00:00:58.480> simple

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
where you drop it off seems simple

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:11.110 
where you drop it off seems simple
enough<00:00:59.110> you're<00:00:59.739> being<00:00:59.920> timed<00:01:00.310> so<00:01:01.090> be<00:01:01.210> careful

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.410 

and<00:01:12.120> these<00:01:13.520> accelerometer<00:01:14.520> based<00:01:14.790> games<00:01:15.150> are

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and these accelerometer based games are

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.130 
and these accelerometer based games are
a<00:01:15.450> living<00:01:15.930> hell<00:01:16.260> to<00:01:16.590> film<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.780> it<00:01:18.780> looks<00:01:19.050> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
a living hell to film so it looks a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.109 
a living hell to film so it looks a
little<00:01:19.290> sloppier<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.159> screen<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:20.940> then

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
little sloppier on screen here then

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.060 
little sloppier on screen here then
actually<00:01:21.690> does<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.440> very<00:01:22.650> nice<00:01:22.830> looking

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
actually does it's a very nice looking

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.300 
actually does it's a very nice looking
game<00:01:23.810> but<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> accelerometer<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.740> both<00:01:25.979> this

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
game but the accelerometer is both this

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.330 
game but the accelerometer is both this
game's<00:01:26.610> strength<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.509> its<00:01:27.660> weakness<00:01:28.340> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
game's strength and its weakness the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.190 
game's strength and its weakness the
ipod<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.700> very<00:01:30.030> unique<00:01:30.330> in<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.660> it<00:01:30.900> clearly

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
ipod is very unique in that it clearly

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.780 
ipod is very unique in that it clearly
responds<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.130> way<00:01:32.280> or<00:01:32.310> another<00:01:32.430> to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
responds in one way or another to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.540 
responds in one way or another to
gravity<00:01:33.470> so<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.650> play<00:01:34.800> these<00:01:34.920> cool<00:01:35.190> tilt

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
gravity so you can play these cool tilt

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.520 
gravity so you can play these cool tilt
games<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.450> wii<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.020> its<00:01:37.140> motion

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
games it's like the wii and its motion

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.340 
games it's like the wii and its motion
controlled<00:01:38.300> nunchuck<00:01:39.300> and<00:01:39.509> controller<00:01:40.020> it's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
controlled nunchuck and controller it's

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.560 
controlled nunchuck and controller it's
just<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:40.920> thing<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:42.000> quality<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
just it's thing the quality of the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.060 
just it's thing the quality of the
gameplay<00:01:42.899> depends<00:01:43.289> on<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> quality<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
gameplay depends on the quality of the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.430 
gameplay depends on the quality of the
controls<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.990> usually<00:01:45.990> turn<00:01:46.229> off

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
controls I usually turn off

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.680 
controls I usually turn off
accelerometer<00:01:47.340> controls<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.509> about

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
accelerometer controls and just about

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.550 
accelerometer controls and just about
every<00:01:48.930> game<00:01:49.140> where<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:51.170> but<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> whole

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
every game where I can but the whole

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.690 
every game where I can but the whole
point<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:52.979> game<00:01:53.039> is<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.340> use<00:01:53.550> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
point of this game is to use the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.100 
point of this game is to use the
accelerometer<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.539> it<00:01:54.630> was<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> little<00:01:54.840> tough

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
accelerometer so it was a little tough

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.850 
accelerometer so it was a little tough
for<00:01:55.140> me<00:01:55.440> it's<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.860> not<00:01:56.070> exactly<00:01:56.550> my<00:01:56.789> style<00:01:57.149> I

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
for me it's just not exactly my style I

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.260 
for me it's just not exactly my style I
like<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.070> game<00:01:59.280> concept<00:01:59.910> I<00:02:00.030> would<00:02:00.179> have

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
like the game concept I would have

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.090 
like the game concept I would have
preferred<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.690> play<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:01.289> buttons<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
preferred to play with buttons on the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.210 
preferred to play with buttons on the
screen<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:03.050> could<00:02:04.050> just<00:02:04.259> never<00:02:04.530> get<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
screen I could just never get the

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:13.020 
screen I could just never get the
tilting<00:02:05.789> right<00:02:06.240> with<00:02:06.840> graviton

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.930 

as<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:14.740> see<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.100> encounter<00:02:15.640> various

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
as you see you encounter various

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.970 
as you see you encounter various
obstacles<00:02:16.450> throughout<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.560> game<00:02:17.709> it's

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
obstacles throughout the game it's

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.309 
obstacles throughout the game it's
apparently<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.610> very<00:02:18.760> short<00:02:19.150> game<00:02:19.390> but<00:02:20.170> it's

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
apparently a very short game but it's

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.740 
apparently a very short game but it's
also<00:02:20.470> very<00:02:20.770> affordable<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:22.150> have<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.390> charge

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
also very affordable you have to charge

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.380 
also very affordable you have to charge
your<00:02:22.959> ball<00:02:23.200> at<00:02:23.410> times<00:02:23.680> with<00:02:23.950> colors<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.459> you

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
your ball at times with colors and you

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.030 
your ball at times with colors and you
can<00:02:25.540> destroy<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:25.930> easily<00:02:26.350> by<00:02:26.500> dropping<00:02:26.950> it

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
can destroy it easily by dropping it

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.070 
can destroy it easily by dropping it
into<00:02:27.220> lava<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.180> can<00:02:28.300> destroy<00:02:29.050> your

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
into lava and you can destroy your

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.809 
into lava and you can destroy your
spaceship<00:02:30.330> if<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.920> like<00:02:33.160> games<00:02:33.430> where<00:02:33.730> you

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
spaceship if you like games where you

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.670 
spaceship if you like games where you
control<00:02:34.030> what's<00:02:34.450> on<00:02:34.600> screen<00:02:34.750> by<00:02:35.110> tilting<00:02:35.410> your

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
control what's on screen by tilting your

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.650 
control what's on screen by tilting your
iPod<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.310> may<00:02:36.459> want<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.760> check<00:02:37.120> this<00:02:37.360> one<00:02:37.600> out

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
iPod you may want to check this one out

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.760 
iPod you may want to check this one out
if<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:39.160> accelerometer<00:02:39.940> infuriates<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.870> then

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
if the accelerometer infuriates you then

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.470 
if the accelerometer infuriates you then
there's<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.550> lot<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.700> other<00:02:42.880> games<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.300> choose

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
there's a lot of other games to choose

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.229 
there's a lot of other games to choose
from<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:46.890> found<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.010> controls<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.760> be<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.940> little

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
from I found the controls to be a little

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.970 
from I found the controls to be a little
fiddly<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:49.660> think<00:02:49.989> they<00:02:50.080> were<00:02:50.140> just<00:02:50.350> waited

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
fiddly I think they were just waited

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.490 
fiddly I think they were just waited
oddly<00:02:51.580> if<00:02:51.790> that<00:02:52.060> makes<00:02:52.300> any<00:02:52.420> sense<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:53.050> really

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
oddly if that makes any sense I really

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.960 
oddly if that makes any sense I really
would<00:02:53.680> have<00:02:53.769> preferred<00:02:54.130> buttons<00:02:54.459> because<00:02:54.670> I

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
would have preferred buttons because I

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.470 
would have preferred buttons because I
like<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.180> concept<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.940> challenge<00:02:58.330> in

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
like the concept and the challenge in

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.030 
like the concept and the challenge in
the<00:02:58.630> game<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:58.989> maneuvering<00:02:59.530> your<00:02:59.650> spaceship

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
the game is maneuvering your spaceship

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.550 
the game is maneuvering your spaceship
with<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:00.400> giant<00:03:01.000> thing<00:03:01.209> attached<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.380> it

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
with this giant thing attached to it

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.949 
with this giant thing attached to it
through<00:03:03.190> tight<00:03:03.430> spaces<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:04.209> there's<00:03:04.569> puzzles

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
through tight spaces and there's puzzles

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.509 
through tight spaces and there's puzzles
that<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.260> have<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.530> sort<00:03:05.739> of<00:03:05.800> figure<00:03:06.010> out<00:03:06.220> from

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
that you have to sort of figure out from

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:19.930 
that you have to sort of figure out from
time<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.910> time

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.729 

graviton<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.150> affordable<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.410> can<00:03:22.590> never

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
graviton is affordable and you can never

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.260 
graviton is affordable and you can never
really<00:03:22.980> go<00:03:23.250> wrong<00:03:23.280> with<00:03:23.610> flying<00:03:23.849> spaceships

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
really go wrong with flying spaceships

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.620 
really go wrong with flying spaceships
through<00:03:24.810> post-apocalyptic<00:03:25.709> worlds<00:03:26.450> if<00:03:27.450> it

through post-apocalyptic worlds if it

through post-apocalyptic worlds if it
looks<00:03:27.780> interesting<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.440> like<00:03:28.590> the

looks interesting and you like the

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.110 
looks interesting and you like the
