mm<00:00:01.650> all<00:00:02.010> right<00:00:02.070> part<00:00:02.700> three<00:00:03.000> welcome<00:00:03.510> back

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:03.950 
mm all right part three welcome back

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.460 
mm all right part three welcome back
okay<00:00:04.950> so<00:00:05.009> in<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.670> previous<00:00:05.850> video<00:00:06.330> we<00:00:07.200> talked

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
okay so in the previous video we talked

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.169 
okay so in the previous video we talked
about<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.919> step<00:00:08.160> build<00:00:08.400> tool<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.910> how<00:00:09.120> we

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
about the step build tool and how we

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.030 
about the step build tool and how we
could<00:00:09.420> literally<00:00:09.780> come<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.200> here<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.590> just

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
could literally come in here and just

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.910 
could literally come in here and just
draw<00:00:11.309> vertices<00:00:12.170> on<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.230> surface<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.889> our

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
draw vertices on the surface of our

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.359 
draw vertices on the surface of our
model<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.460> then<00:00:14.639> hold<00:00:14.940> down<00:00:15.089> shift<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:16.369> drag

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
model and then hold down shift and drag

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.019 
model and then hold down shift and drag
from<00:00:17.640> edge<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.910> edge<00:00:18.289> to<00:00:19.289> create<00:00:20.029> more

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
from edge to edge to create more

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.179 
from edge to edge to create more
polygons<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.900> edge<00:00:22.080> ring<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
polygons in that edge ring and the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.560 
polygons in that edge ring and the
reason<00:00:23.460> why<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.000> important<00:00:24.420> is

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
reason why this is so important is

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.970 
reason why this is so important is
because<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:25.080> video<00:00:25.289> games<00:00:25.529> you've<00:00:25.769> got<00:00:25.890> to

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
because in video games you've got to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.670 
because in video games you've got to
work<00:00:26.099> with<00:00:26.279> nice<00:00:26.580> clean<00:00:26.939> edge<00:00:27.269> rings<00:00:27.680> see

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
work with nice clean edge rings see

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.169 
work with nice clean edge rings see
these<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:28.980> these<00:00:29.279> little<00:00:29.550> guys<00:00:29.640> here<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
these little these little guys here the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.440 
these little these little guys here the
horizontal<00:00:30.750> lines<00:00:31.579> connected<00:00:32.579> by<00:00:32.700> nice<00:00:33.059> quads

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
horizontal lines connected by nice quads

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.360 
horizontal lines connected by nice quads
that<00:00:33.809> flow<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.260> ring<00:00:34.440> that's<00:00:34.770> an<00:00:35.010> entering

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that flow in a ring that's an entering

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.750 
that flow in a ring that's an entering
okay<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.380> those<00:00:37.380> guys<00:00:37.590> deform<00:00:38.129> well<00:00:38.430> they

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
okay and those guys deform well they

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.990 
okay and those guys deform well they
shade<00:00:39.090> well<00:00:39.360> they're<00:00:39.690> easier<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> UVW<00:00:40.860> map<00:00:41.100> all

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
shade well they're easier to UVW map all

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.970 
shade well they're easier to UVW map all
of<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.360> above<00:00:42.570> okay<00:00:43.260> instead<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.860> this

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
of the above okay instead of this

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.279 
of the above okay instead of this
horrible<00:00:44.660> tessellated<00:00:45.660> nightmare<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.079> I

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
horrible tessellated nightmare that I

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.840 
horrible tessellated nightmare that I
get<00:00:46.530> out<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.739> ZBrush<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.730> work

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
get out of ZBrush but we have to work

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.240 
get out of ZBrush but we have to work
with<00:00:48.030> ZBrush<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:49.379> order<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> use<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.070> virtual

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
with ZBrush in order to use the virtual

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.160 
with ZBrush in order to use the virtual
clay<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.090> actually<00:00:51.449> be<00:00:51.539> able<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.809> sculpt

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
clay to actually be able to sculpt

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.810 
clay to actually be able to sculpt
organic<00:00:52.590> characters<00:00:53.039> like<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.430> really

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
organic characters like this really

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.660 
organic characters like this really
quickly<00:00:54.170> if<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.320> had<00:00:55.469> tried<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.710> do<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.070> 3d

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
quickly if I had tried to do this in 3d

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.340 
quickly if I had tried to do this in 3d
max<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.300> would<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.660> would<00:00:57.750> take<00:00:57.930> me<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> rest

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
max it would it would take me the rest

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.349 
max it would it would take me the rest
of<00:00:58.410> my<00:00:58.469> life<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.039> ZBrush<00:00:59.430> it's<00:01:00.149> only<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
of my life but in ZBrush it's only a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.810 
of my life but in ZBrush it's only a
couple<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.780> days<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.170> whip<00:01:01.350> up<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.789> sort<00:01:02.789> of

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
couple of days to whip up a sort of

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.570 
couple of days to whip up a sort of
rough<00:01:03.149> basic<00:01:03.660> likeness<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.580> but

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
rough basic likeness like this but

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.190 
rough basic likeness like this but
anyways<00:01:05.880> let's<00:01:06.119> talk<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.600> extend<00:01:06.990> tool

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
anyways let's talk about the extend tool

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.740 
anyways let's talk about the extend tool
so<00:01:07.799> while<00:01:08.520> my<00:01:08.820> box

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
so while my box

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.230 
so while my box
0:01<00:01:10.110> object<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.920> still<00:01:11.130> selected<00:01:11.310> I'm<00:01:11.760> gonna

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
0:01 object is still selected I'm gonna

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.760 
0:01 object is still selected I'm gonna
come<00:01:12.390> down<00:01:12.540> here<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.810> click<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> extend

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
come down here and click on the extend

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.210 
come down here and click on the extend
tool<00:01:14.100> now<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.460> extended<00:01:15.119> tool<00:01:15.799> does<00:01:16.799> exactly

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
tool now the extended tool does exactly

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.800 
tool now the extended tool does exactly
what<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.610> sounds<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.060> does<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.479> come<00:01:18.689> in

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
what it sounds like it does if I come in

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.890 
what it sounds like it does if I come in
here<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.220> I<00:01:20.220> hold<00:01:20.610> down<00:01:20.790> shift<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.720> is

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
here and I hold down shift and this is

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.749 
here and I hold down shift and this is
very<00:01:22.080> critical<00:01:22.320> because<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.310> hold<00:01:23.520> down

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
very critical because what you hold down

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.780 
very critical because what you hold down
when<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.270> use<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.200> extent<00:01:25.560> 'l<00:01:25.770> has<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> big

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
when you use the extent 'l has a big

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.569 
when you use the extent 'l has a big
influence<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.450> how<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.470> creates<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:29.100> i<00:01:29.250> just

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
influence on how it creates if i just

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.350 
influence on how it creates if i just
hold<00:01:29.790> down<00:01:29.909> shift<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:31.040> I<00:01:32.040> pull<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.790> edge

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
hold down shift and I pull on this edge

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.039 
hold down shift and I pull on this edge
see<00:01:34.350> what<00:01:34.470> happens<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:35.090> grow<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> brand<00:01:36.540> new<00:01:36.720> quad

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
see what happens I grow a brand new quad

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.819 
see what happens I grow a brand new quad
and<00:01:38.540> it<00:01:39.540> should<00:01:39.840> be<00:01:39.960> noted<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.680> is

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
and it should be noted that it is

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.969 
and it should be noted that it is
adhering<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.390> surface<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.930> my<00:01:43.170> high<00:01:43.710> poly

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
adhering to the surface of my high poly

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.940 
adhering to the surface of my high poly
geometry<00:01:44.990> then<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.170> come<00:01:46.290> over<00:01:46.500> here<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
geometry then I can come over here and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.539 
geometry then I can come over here and
grab<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.579> edge<00:01:47.820> holding<00:01:48.479> down<00:01:48.659> shift<00:01:49.020> again

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
grab this edge holding down shift again

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.920 
grab this edge holding down shift again
pull<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.670> little<00:01:50.820> guy<00:01:51.060> out<00:01:51.090> now<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.899> a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
pull this little guy out now we have a

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.160 
pull this little guy out now we have a
problem<00:01:52.439> though<00:01:52.590> because<00:01:53.030> I<00:01:54.030> don't<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
problem though because I don't have the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.819 
problem though because I don't have the
intervening<00:01:56.270> polygon<00:01:57.270> right<00:01:57.479> here<00:01:57.750> well<00:01:58.619> to

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
intervening polygon right here well to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.149 
intervening polygon right here well to
build<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.219> guy<00:01:59.460> if<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.060> remember<00:02:00.450> correctly

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
build that guy if I remember correctly

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.350 
build that guy if I remember correctly
hold<00:02:02.159> down<00:02:03.079> ctrl<00:02:04.079> +<00:02:04.320> Alt<00:02:04.560> +<00:02:04.829> left<00:02:04.939> click<00:02:05.939> and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
hold down ctrl + Alt + left click and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.830 
hold down ctrl + Alt + left click and
drag<00:02:06.540> from<00:02:06.570> one<00:02:06.899> edge<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.560> other<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.009> boom

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
drag from one edge to the other and boom

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.010 
drag from one edge to the other and boom
it<00:02:09.840> builds<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:12.150> quad<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.840> in

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
it builds you the quad that is in

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.430 
it builds you the quad that is in
between<00:02:13.140> those<00:02:13.530> two

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
between those two

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.440 
between those two
but<00:02:16.440> what<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:16.680> we<00:02:16.770> get<00:02:16.920> up<00:02:17.070> here<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.580> we<00:02:18.270> want

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
but what if we get up here and we want

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.900 
but what if we get up here and we want
to<00:02:18.510> build<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.750> quad<00:02:19.050> in<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.740> section<00:02:20.220> but<00:02:20.850> we

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
to build a quad in this section but we

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.370 
to build a quad in this section but we
don't<00:02:21.180> have<00:02:21.390> another<00:02:21.660> edge<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.110> here<00:02:22.290> to

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
don't have another edge up here to

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.500 
don't have another edge up here to
connect<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.980> that's<00:02:23.910> simple

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
connect it to that's simple

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.320 
connect it to that's simple
don't<00:02:24.900> hold<00:02:25.110> down<00:02:25.320> any<00:02:25.590> buttons<00:02:25.980> click<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.120> one

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
don't hold down any buttons click on one

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.030 
don't hold down any buttons click on one
of<00:02:27.360> these<00:02:27.540> interior<00:02:28.320> vertices<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:29.160> drag<00:02:30.060> and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
of these interior vertices and drag and

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.630 
of these interior vertices and drag and
look<00:02:32.040> what<00:02:32.250> happens<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:33.720> create<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.610> whole<00:02:35.610> new

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
look what happens you create a whole new

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.490 
look what happens you create a whole new
quad<00:02:38.870> isn't<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:39.990> cool

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
quad isn't that cool

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.010 
quad isn't that cool
super<00:02:41.370> convenient<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:42.660> I'm<00:02:42.750> going<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.930> come

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
super convenient so I'm going to come

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.930 
super convenient so I'm going to come
over<00:02:43.080> here<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.380> do<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.890> same<00:02:44.280> thing<00:02:44.670> right

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
over here and do the same thing right

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.210 
over here and do the same thing right
here<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:46.110> if<00:02:46.200> you're<00:02:46.350> like<00:02:46.500> me<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:46.950> you're

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
here but if you're like me and you're

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.870 
here but if you're like me and you're
skeptical

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
skeptical

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.240 
skeptical
your<00:02:48.510> next<00:02:48.750> question<00:02:48.870> probably<00:02:49.680> would<00:02:50.100> be

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
your next question probably would be

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.790 
your next question probably would be
yeah<00:02:50.970> but<00:02:51.209> what<00:02:51.540> if<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:51.780> want<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.050> move<00:02:52.260> just<00:02:52.620> an

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
yeah but what if I want to move just an

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.370 
yeah but what if I want to move just an
individual<00:02:53.280> vertex<00:02:53.870> what<00:02:54.870> if<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.050> don't<00:02:55.230> want

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
individual vertex what if I don't want

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.870 
individual vertex what if I don't want
to<00:02:55.440> mess<00:02:55.650> up<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.980> fact<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:56.520> adhering

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
to mess up the fact that it's adhering

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.699 
to mess up the fact that it's adhering
to<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.120> surface<00:02:57.300> but<00:02:57.959> I've<00:02:58.110> put<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
to the surface but I've put it in the

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.580 
to the surface but I've put it in the
wrong<00:02:58.890> spot<00:02:59.090> that's<00:03:00.090> easy<00:03:00.360> too<00:03:00.660> if<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.380> want<00:03:01.530> to

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
wrong spot that's easy too if I want to

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.229 
wrong spot that's easy too if I want to
move<00:03:01.680> any<00:03:01.890> one<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.100> these<00:03:02.280> guys<00:03:02.489> let's<00:03:03.090> go

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
move any one of these guys let's go

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.250 
move any one of these guys let's go
ahead<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.480> look<00:03:03.570> at<00:03:03.660> him<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.989> front

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
ahead and look at him in a front

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.180 
ahead and look at him in a front
viewport<00:03:04.440> when<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:04.950> hit<00:03:05.100> F<00:03:06.709> my<00:03:07.709> computer<00:03:08.130> is

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
viewport when I hit F my computer is

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.000 
viewport when I hit F my computer is
gonna<00:03:08.280> freak<00:03:08.610> out<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.060> second<00:03:09.420> because<00:03:10.010> I'm

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
gonna freak out for a second because I'm

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.350 
gonna freak out for a second because I'm
really<00:03:11.280> pushing<00:03:11.610> my<00:03:11.730> luck<00:03:11.910> with<00:03:12.060> these<00:03:12.180> high

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
really pushing my luck with these high

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.290 
really pushing my luck with these high
poly<00:03:12.630> cages<00:03:13.110> all<00:03:13.350> right<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.920> I'm<00:03:14.820> recording

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
poly cages all right and I'm recording

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.440 
poly cages all right and I'm recording
that<00:03:15.570> slows<00:03:16.530> things<00:03:16.739> down<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.730> if<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.150> hold<00:03:18.269> down

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
that slows things down so if I hold down

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.050 
that slows things down so if I hold down
shift<00:03:18.510> ctrl<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.380> alt<00:03:19.920> at<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.549> exact<00:03:20.880> same

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
shift ctrl and alt at the exact same

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.140 
shift ctrl and alt at the exact same
time<00:03:21.330> all<00:03:21.570> three<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:22.019> those<00:03:22.110> guys<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:23.150> I

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
time all three of those guys and I

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.000 
time all three of those guys and I
left-click<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:24.840> drag<00:03:25.019> on<00:03:25.410> any<00:03:25.620> one<00:03:25.769> of<00:03:25.890> my

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
left-click and drag on any one of my

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.720 
left-click and drag on any one of my
vertices<00:03:26.310> look<00:03:26.790> at<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:28.400> can<00:03:29.400> reposition

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
vertices look at that I can reposition

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.789 
vertices look at that I can reposition
it<00:03:32.420> now<00:03:33.420> what<00:03:33.720> if<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.930> want<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.170> delete<00:03:34.500> one<00:03:34.739> of

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
it now what if you want to delete one of

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.850 
it now what if you want to delete one of
these<00:03:35.010> guys<00:03:35.390> just<00:03:36.390> hold<00:03:36.570> down<00:03:36.660> ctrl<00:03:37.260> click<00:03:37.650> on

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
these guys just hold down ctrl click on

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.350 
these guys just hold down ctrl click on
the<00:03:37.950> polygon<00:03:38.130> you<00:03:38.519> want<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.730> get<00:03:38.820> rid<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.260> boom

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
the polygon you want to get rid of boom

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.759 
the polygon you want to get rid of boom
ctrl<00:03:42.360> alt<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.930> drag<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:44.760> rebuild<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:48.769> from

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
ctrl alt and drag to rebuild it and from

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.070 
ctrl alt and drag to rebuild it and from
here<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.070> process<00:03:50.519> would<00:03:50.730> be<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:51.870> would

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
here the process would be that I would

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.770 
here the process would be that I would
build<00:03:52.290> out<00:03:52.530> all<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.549> polygons<00:03:54.030> associated

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
build out all of the polygons associated

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.600 
build out all of the polygons associated
with<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.049> entire<00:03:55.410> say<00:03:55.830> right<00:03:56.130> side<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.519> his

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
with the entire say right side of his

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.240 
with the entire say right side of his
head<00:03:57.260> then<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.290> would<00:03:58.530> come<00:03:58.739> in<00:03:58.920> when<00:03:59.070> that's

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
head then I would come in when that's

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.820 
head then I would come in when that's
done<00:03:59.519> zero<00:04:00.360> out<00:04:00.600> my<00:04:00.780> Center<00:04:01.110> vertices<00:04:01.530> and

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
done zero out my Center vertices and

done zero out my Center vertices and
apply<00:04:02.070> symmetry<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.000> I'm<00:04:03.720> ready<00:04:03.959> to<00:04:04.140> do

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
apply symmetry to it and I'm ready to do

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.600 
apply symmetry to it and I'm ready to do
my<00:04:04.410> normal<00:04:04.470> map<00:04:04.860> projection

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
my normal map projection

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.910 
my normal map projection
well<00:04:06.030> actually<00:04:06.420> I'm<00:04:06.810> ready<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.140> unwrap<00:04:07.560> my<00:04:07.799> low

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
well actually I'm ready to unwrap my low

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
well actually I'm ready to unwrap my low
poly<00:04:08.190> then<00:04:08.970> do<00:04:09.330> my<00:04:09.450> normal<00:04:09.780> map<00:04:09.930> projection

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
poly then do my normal map projection

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.400 
poly then do my normal map projection
which<00:04:11.940> I'm<00:04:12.090> also<00:04:12.269> planning<00:04:12.690> on<00:04:12.870> making<00:04:13.049> some

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
which I'm also planning on making some

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.710 
which I'm also planning on making some
video<00:04:13.650> tutorials<00:04:14.220> up<00:04:14.400> soon<00:04:14.640> as<00:04:14.820> well<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.209> just

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
video tutorials up soon as well I just

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.330 
video tutorials up soon as well I just
wanted<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.019> make<00:04:16.140> sure<00:04:16.200> that<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.890> mean<00:04:17.070> this<00:04:17.190> is

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
wanted to make sure that I mean this is

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.610 
wanted to make sure that I mean this is
a<00:04:17.370> really<00:04:17.609> powerful<00:04:17.880> tool<00:04:18.329> it's<00:04:19.169> really

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
a really powerful tool it's really

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.170 
a really powerful tool it's really
impressive<00:04:19.890> and<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.669> think<00:04:20.850> it's<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:21.000> little

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
impressive and I think it's a little

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.240 
impressive and I think it's a little
easier<00:04:21.570> than<00:04:21.780> doing<00:04:22.140> retopo<00:04:22.650> inside<00:04:23.130> of

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
easier than doing retopo inside of

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.279 
easier than doing retopo inside of
ZBrush<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:24.000> I'm<00:04:24.599> always<00:04:24.720> looking<00:04:24.900> for<00:04:25.200> ways

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
ZBrush and I'm always looking for ways

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.160 
ZBrush and I'm always looking for ways
to<00:04:25.440> make<00:04:25.710> your<00:04:26.099> lives<00:04:26.370> easier<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:27.030> my<00:04:27.180> life

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
to make your lives easier and my life

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.790 
to make your lives easier and my life

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
this will definitely speed up work on my
