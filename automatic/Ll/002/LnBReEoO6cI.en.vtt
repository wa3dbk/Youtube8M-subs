00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.650 
and then I'm going to show you how that
we're<00:02:15.620> going<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.860> gut<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.580> fuel<00:02:17.030> pump<00:02:17.390> we're

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
we're going to gut that fuel pump we're

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.810 
we're going to gut that fuel pump we're
going<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.840> gut<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.500> then<00:02:19.460> I'm<00:02:19.610> going<00:02:19.760> to

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
going to gut it and then I'm going to

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.460 
going to gut it and then I'm going to
show<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.000> how<00:02:20.210> to<00:02:20.300> remount<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.930> on<00:02:21.080> there<00:02:21.350> and

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
show you how to remount it on there and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.020 
show you how to remount it on there and
then<00:02:21.590> we're<00:02:21.740> going<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.920> use<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.370> vacuum<00:02:22.910> of

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
then we're going to use the vacuum of

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.380 
then we're going to use the vacuum of
the<00:02:23.180> engine<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:24.040> pump<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.220> pump<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:26.300> is

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
the engine to pump the pump and this is

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.670 
the engine to pump the pump and this is
going<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.600> call<00:02:26.750> it's<00:02:27.050> going<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.260> work<00:02:27.410> just

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
going to call it's going to work just

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.340 
going to call it's going to work just
fine<00:02:27.890> just<00:02:28.190> like<00:02:28.370> we<00:02:28.580> cantle<00:02:29.060> one<00:02:29.240> but<00:02:30.020> it's

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
fine just like we cantle one but it's

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.140 
fine just like we cantle one but it's
going<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.680> be<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.860> fraction<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.700> cost<00:02:31.940> of

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
going to be a fraction of the cost of

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.240 
going to be a fraction of the cost of
what<00:02:32.210> Kohler<00:02:32.630> wants<00:02:33.110> for<00:02:33.350> that<00:02:33.530> kit<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:34.100> go

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
what Kohler wants for that kit to go

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:45.280 
what Kohler wants for that kit to go
down<00:02:34.460> there<00:02:34.700> all<00:02:43.660> right<00:02:44.660> we're<00:02:44.870> going<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.080> take

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
down there all right we're going to take

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:55.140 
down there all right we're going to take
this<00:02:45.470> all<00:02:45.710> apart<00:02:46.960> take<00:02:47.960> them<00:02:48.140> four<00:02:48.380> screws<00:02:48.740> out

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.600 

take<00:02:56.150> this<00:02:56.360> out<00:02:56.690> take<00:02:57.380> that<00:02:57.560> spring<00:02:57.950> out<00:02:58.130> this

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
take this out take that spring out this

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.990 
take this out take that spring out this
is<00:02:58.730> all<00:02:58.850> junk<00:02:59.270> going<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.690> throw<00:02:59.840> all<00:03:00.050> that<00:03:00.260> way

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
is all junk going to throw all that way

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.650 
is all junk going to throw all that way
feel<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.030> screwdriver<00:03:03.940> pop<00:03:04.940> out<00:03:05.210> them<00:03:05.450> there

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
feel a screwdriver pop out them there

check<00:03:05.960> valves<00:03:06.500> we<00:03:07.100> don't<00:03:07.250> need<00:03:07.430> them<00:03:08.470> jump<00:03:09.670> the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
check valves we don't need them jump the

check valves we don't need them jump the
problem<00:03:11.120> with<00:03:11.240> this<00:03:11.390> tractor<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.980> we're

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
problem with this tractor that we're

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.450 
problem with this tractor that we're
doing<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:13.700> fuel<00:03:13.970> pump<00:03:14.240> replacement<00:03:14.390> is<00:03:15.460> this

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
doing this fuel pump replacement is this

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.240 
doing this fuel pump replacement is this
thing<00:03:16.730> got<00:03:16.910> hole<00:03:17.209> in<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:18.590> just<00:03:18.860> started

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
thing got hole in it and it just started

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.970 
thing got hole in it and it just started
pumping<00:03:19.550> gas<00:03:20.000> right<00:03:20.660> into<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.170> crankcase<00:03:21.560> of

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
pumping gas right into the crankcase of

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.190 
pumping gas right into the crankcase of
the<00:03:22.070> engine<00:03:22.520> and<00:03:22.670> filling<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.540> with<00:03:23.570> gas<00:03:23.900> and

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
the engine and filling it with gas and

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.000 
the engine and filling it with gas and
oil<00:03:25.390> so<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.600> pump<00:03:26.840> had<00:03:27.050> to<00:03:27.140> be<00:03:27.290> replaced<00:03:27.590> and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
oil so the pump had to be replaced and

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.930 
oil so the pump had to be replaced and
then<00:03:28.100> we're<00:03:28.250> going<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.459> take<00:03:28.580> one<00:03:28.760> of<00:03:28.790> these

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
then we're going to take one of these

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:36.190 
then we're going to take one of these
fittings<00:03:29.360> out<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:35.540> then<00:03:35.720> we're<00:03:35.870> going<00:03:35.959> to<00:03:36.050> put

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
fittings out and then we're going to put

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.030 
fittings out and then we're going to put
that<00:03:36.350> 1/8<00:03:36.800> pipe<00:03:37.100> plug<00:03:37.430> in<00:03:37.640> there<00:03:39.040> because

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
that 1/8 pipe plug in there because

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:48.220 
that 1/8 pipe plug in there because
that's<00:03:40.310> what<00:03:40.580> this<00:03:40.760> is<00:03:41.000> 1/8<00:03:41.600> pipe<00:03:41.930> thread<00:03:47.230> now

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
that's what this is 1/8 pipe thread now

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.660 
that's what this is 1/8 pipe thread now
this<00:03:48.440> is<00:03:48.590> where<00:03:48.800> we're<00:03:48.980> going<00:03:49.100> to<00:03:49.190> pick<00:03:49.370> up<00:03:49.550> the
