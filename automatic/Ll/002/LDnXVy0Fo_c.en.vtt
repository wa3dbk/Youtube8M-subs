00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.429
 what are the big differences 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.470
 drive between normal bike and 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.240
 Mountain biking is the mountain bike 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.869
 a definition of a terrain bike 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.930
 should also be moved there so in the 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.800
 forest or in high alpine terrain 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.429
 stands out because of the very 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.880
 is robust and sometimes just steep 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.440
 piece driven can be enticed pieces 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.079
 simply more resistant than normal 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.399
 trekking bikes or cross bikes and where 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.730
 is now the difference between one 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.690
 downhill bike and a mountain bike 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.920
 Mountain bikes become very many 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.610
 divided into different classes 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.210
 there are hotels that means without suspension 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.360
 behind 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.730
 there is full then there is 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.949
 the segment depending on how much travel 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.710
 ann foley has that mostly goes from 100 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.559
 I would be up to 200 at 200 mm 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.480
 at the downloader freeride bike how much 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.580
 I have to spend where you really good 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.530
 to get mountain bike and that comes 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.020
 then again on what kind of 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.939
 Driver I am if I always just now 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.210
 hard help arabia or the pulli driver 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.000
 at hp reasonable price meaningful 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.090
 price segment is to start with 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.200
 800 euro 900 euro in the direction of 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.479
 that then also hydraulic 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.299
 disc brakes aluminum frame air 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.670
 supported spring fork yes that makes 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.320
 already start to make sense and is full 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.829
 you have to say that is already a 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.579
 a bit higher at about 1800 at that time 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.250
 only really fun if I say okay 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.619
 now a mountainbike on how can 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.530
 I find out what the right bike 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.240
 for me, there you have to be 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.899
 first ask the question where to put it 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.030
 wants to drive 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.750
 which driver you want to be or already 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.329
 which is the area where I like the most 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.369
 to move the wheel where I am most often 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.540
 it does not use anything if a downhill bike 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.700
 from for example with the non uphill 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.049
 but now for example only 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.849
 flat hills in the area should be off 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.220
 always depending on where I am 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.500
 most used 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.880
 if I now my some bike 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.770
 All winter in the basement had been 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.910
 how do I bring that to you 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.330
 All in all, that's me then in spring 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.710
 really safe with it 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.570
 So of course it recommends itself 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:44.209
 The wheel wants to do it myself 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:47.560
 check it out still show it that way 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.240
 things like that are quick release fixed 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.190
 whether the tires are really fixed 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.180
 are 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.800
 Last autumn maybe in the car 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.810
 to be transported has forgotten 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.080
 to draw 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.760
 Control things like handlebars again 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.490
 with him you have to screw most of the time 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.630
 equipped brakes are very important 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.550
 as always pay attention to whether the pressure point 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:15.760
 Does not matter if they are really that way 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.760
 Feels like last fall 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.810
 reifenprofil check on worn 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.269
 Matures are no fun in the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:29.030
 terrain then and otherwise you can too 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:32.600
 I'll just look eight 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.130
 less 8 what was i for equipment 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.709
 when I'm on the road there is 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.540
 anything but a helmet on now 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.590
 I have to pay court china 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.690
 or in which first aid package the 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.360
 Maybe I should lead with me, yes 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.670
 So helmet is always recommended 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.580
 Riding a mountain bike without a helmet 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.220
 actually pretty risky it 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.200
 There are many different things there are 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.120
 also the protectors for example 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.950
 Elbow protectors joints are very 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.700
 important for the future 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.610
 you should not necessarily 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.440
 Damage gloves recommend them 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.930
 recommend depending on the type there is 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.519
 long with long fingers or short 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.860
 everyone can do that for themselves 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.239
 decide 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.609
 When helmet is important that you do not 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.410
 saving quality does not mean that 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.970
 be sure to take a helmet for 30 euros 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.870
 but he 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.780
 from 80 90 euro is already a good 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.730
 quality delivered 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.160
 otherwise there are various protectors 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.620
 then go downhill too 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.060
 are intended by stronger use is 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.610
 but then for big country drivers 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.330
 Touring drivers simply in the woods 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.740
 want to ride a mountain bike and know 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.870
 want to see nature already 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.930
 probably too much and it has too 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.300
 and you sweat very much then what 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.950
 you also need nature with me there 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.950
 Let's explain backpack prepared that way 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.360
 Similar to mine is tool 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.060
 It is always recommended there 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.490
 various multitool variants of 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.850
 various providers 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.680
 such things can never hurt for example one 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.900
 chain lock if the chain travels 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.670
 or I'll come over somewhere then 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.900
 Residents drive if now the 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.850
 you do not need to drive home 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.270
 a lot of time with who but now a trans 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.980
 currently makes time really with you 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.820
 of course for the mature 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:26.660
 We still have something for the hoses 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:29.200
 again a multi tool tire lift too 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:33.200
 quite useful to change the hose 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.620
 what else can not pump the air 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.260
 damage 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.110
 Nevertheless, after a bend on number 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.990
 For sure a small castle should go 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:46.310
 wants to go to lunch to the restaurant 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:48.290
 what food is always recommended 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.880
 but few then to really 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.950
 take first aid package with you 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.720
 especially if you are in the alpine terrain 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.190
 she should always be there with 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.110
 rescue blanket triangle gauze bandage 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.110
 plaster for the little things that 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.370
 important things should be there 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.290
 There are a lot of different things to do 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.260
 most crux are with one 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.520
 Drink break equipped depending on whether one 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.890
 now the weight that's two 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.200
 kilo on the back we say okay me 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.510
 take a backpack or I drink 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.840
 try water bottles on the wheel 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.840
 stow
