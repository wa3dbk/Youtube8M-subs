 An important tip a spacer can 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.530
 be adapted with plastic bottles of 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.780
 600 ml with the same effect as those manufactured 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.870
 just make a hole in the bottom of the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.640
 the adapted bottle can 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.840
 be used in the same way as the model 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.510

 before the mirror the first few times 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.050
 as all aerosolized medicinal products are 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.820
 It is advisable to test the 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.460
 inhaler before using it for the first time. 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.360
 and whenever the inhaler runs out of

 every month the liter is discarded 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.520
 throw away at the end of the works the space to 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.680
