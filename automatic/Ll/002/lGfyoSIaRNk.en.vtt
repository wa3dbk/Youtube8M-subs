just pretty much I recorded a long one
session<00:00:39.390> by<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.870> gameplay

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
session by the way for the gameplay

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.080 
session by the way for the gameplay
won't<00:00:40.320> get<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.530> other<00:00:40.680> way<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.890> fast<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.969> is

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
won't get this other way I fast this is

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.330 
won't get this other way I fast this is
a<00:00:42.180> really<00:00:42.510> really<00:00:42.629> fast<00:00:43.020> 41<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.770> 0<00:00:43.829> flawless

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
a really really fast 41 and 0 flawless

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.209 
a really really fast 41 and 0 flawless
nuclear<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:45.000> joined<00:00:45.329> late<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.620> lose<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
nuclear we joined late we do lose the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.610 
nuclear we joined late we do lose the
games<00:00:47.489> really<00:00:47.850> unfortunate<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.690> guess<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.379> could

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
games really unfortunate I guess I could

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.740 
games really unfortunate I guess I could
blame<00:00:49.829> myself<00:00:50.100> for<00:00:50.579> not<00:00:50.760> technically<00:00:51.329> hopping

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
blame myself for not technically hopping

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.380 
blame myself for not technically hopping
on<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.949> at<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.219> flick<00:00:53.760> at<00:00:54.000> some<00:00:54.180> point

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
on I was at the a flick at some point

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.270 
on I was at the a flick at some point
I'm<00:00:54.449> near<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.020> I'm<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.559> I'm<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
I'm near it and I'm just I'm just in the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.400 
I'm near it and I'm just I'm just in the
zone<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.879> getting<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.660> many<00:00:57.750> kills<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.230> going

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
zone of getting so many kills and going

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.020 
zone of getting so many kills and going
for<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.620> nuclear<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.190> I'm<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.579> just<00:00:59.640> I

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
for that nuclear so I'm like I just I

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.240 
for that nuclear so I'm like I just I
completely<00:01:00.600> disregard<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> flag<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:02.129> not

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
completely disregard the flag it's not

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.709 
completely disregard the flag it's not
because<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.550> didn't<00:01:02.789> want<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.000> win<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.600> was

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
because I didn't want to win it was

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.539 
because I didn't want to win it was
because<00:01:04.019> literally<00:01:04.589> when<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> was<00:01:05.070> playing<00:01:05.280> I

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
because literally when I was playing I

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.789 
because literally when I was playing I
couldn't<00:01:06.390> even<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> flag<00:01:07.080> wasn't<00:01:07.470> even<00:01:07.740> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
couldn't even see the flag wasn't even a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.380 
couldn't even see the flag wasn't even a
thought<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.070> my<00:01:08.250> mind<00:01:08.400> because<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.030> was<00:01:09.210> so

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
thought in my mind because I was so

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.820 
thought in my mind because I was so
close<00:01:09.510> nuclear<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.200> was<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.500> fast

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
close nuclear and it was going so fast

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.100 
close nuclear and it was going so fast
as<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.640> see<00:01:11.850> I'm<00:01:12.150> wrecking<00:01:12.450> shop<00:01:12.630> here<00:01:12.869> so

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
as you can see I'm wrecking shop here so

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.810 
as you can see I'm wrecking shop here so
we<00:01:13.590> join<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:13.950> there's<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.280> shit<00:01:14.430> talker<00:01:14.580> in

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
we join like there's a shit talker in

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.980 
we join like there's a shit talker in
the<00:01:14.880> lobby<00:01:15.060> which<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.509> didn't<00:01:15.689> actually<00:01:15.810> get

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the lobby which I didn't actually get

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.859 
the lobby which I didn't actually get
the<00:01:16.049> voice<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.500> because<00:01:16.860> i<00:01:17.070> was<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.340> party<00:01:17.549> chat

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
the voice of because i was in party chat

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.359 
the voice of because i was in party chat
but<00:01:18.869> um<00:01:19.049> yeah<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.040> good<00:01:20.220> game

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
but um yeah it was really good game

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.830 
but um yeah it was really good game
really<00:01:20.729> fun<00:01:20.970> game<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.270> nuclear<00:01:21.509> was<00:01:21.600> actually

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
really fun game the nuclear was actually

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.820 
really fun game the nuclear was actually
really<00:01:21.960> fast<00:01:22.200> i'm<00:01:22.380> probably<00:01:22.530> thought<00:01:22.710> would

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
really fast i'm probably thought would

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.170 
really fast i'm probably thought would
timer<00:01:23.040> up<00:01:23.280> once<00:01:23.670> i'm<00:01:23.880> done<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.090> this

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
timer up once i'm done with this

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.609 
timer up once i'm done with this
commentary<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:24.990> guys<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.290> how<00:01:25.409> fast

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
commentary so you guys can see how fast

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.740 
commentary so you guys can see how fast
nuclear<00:01:26.070> was<00:01:26.280> probably<00:01:27.030> when<00:01:27.180> my<00:01:27.270> fastest

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
nuclear was probably when my fastest

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.270 
nuclear was probably when my fastest
definitely<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.290> my<00:01:28.380> most<00:01:28.560> impressive<00:01:29.040> ones

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
definitely with my most impressive ones
