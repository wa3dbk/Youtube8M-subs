actual<00:00:25.150> series<00:00:25.689> in<00:00:25.869> the<00:00:25.960> nature<00:00:26.199> re<00:00:26.380> series

actual series in the nature re series

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.140 
actual series in the nature re series
and<00:00:27.070> we've<00:00:27.189> been<00:00:27.310> involved<00:00:27.580> for<00:00:27.820> many<00:00:28.029> many

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
and we've been involved for many many

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.929 
and we've been involved for many many
years<00:00:28.300> and<00:00:28.720> it<00:00:29.289> seemed<00:00:29.529> like<00:00:29.590> a<00:00:29.710> natural<00:00:30.009> for

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
years and it seemed like a natural for

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.479 
years and it seemed like a natural for
us<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:31.179> be<00:00:31.269> involved<00:00:31.570> in<00:00:31.960> nascar<00:00:32.680> and<00:00:33.129> off-road

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
us to be involved in nascar and off-road

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.820 
us to be involved in nascar and off-road
racing<00:00:34.030> because<00:00:34.239> those<00:00:34.660> those<00:00:35.440> types<00:00:35.680> of

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
racing because those those types of

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.740 
racing because those those types of
vehicles<00:00:35.949> typically<00:00:36.580> use<00:00:36.850> an<00:00:37.000> air<00:00:37.150> filter<00:00:37.360> and

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
vehicles typically use an air filter and

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.930 
vehicles typically use an air filter and
in<00:00:38.379> drag<00:00:38.620> racing<00:00:38.890> it's<00:00:39.190> a<00:00:39.280> little<00:00:39.489> bit<00:00:39.580> harder

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
in drag racing it's a little bit harder

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.240 
in drag racing it's a little bit harder
for<00:00:40.150> a<00:00:40.180> consumer<00:00:40.600> or<00:00:40.780> for<00:00:41.199> a<00:00:41.229> fan<00:00:41.530> or<00:00:41.559> even<00:00:42.100> for

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
for a consumer or for a fan or even for

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.820 
for a consumer or for a fan or even for
the<00:00:42.339> guys<00:00:42.489> in<00:00:42.790> drag<00:00:43.030> racing<00:00:43.330> to<00:00:44.260> consider<00:00:44.650> how

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
the guys in drag racing to consider how

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.170 
the guys in drag racing to consider how
important<00:00:45.250> an<00:00:45.339> air<00:00:45.430> filter<00:00:45.580> might<00:00:45.940> actually

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
important an air filter might actually

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.689 
important an air filter might actually
be<00:00:46.600> and<00:00:46.839> so<00:00:47.500> one<00:00:47.710> of<00:00:47.739> the<00:00:47.860> things<00:00:47.920> we<00:00:48.190> decided

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
be and so one of the things we decided

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.670 
be and so one of the things we decided
was<00:00:48.970> that<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.330> Pro<00:00:49.510> Stock<00:00:49.570> category<00:00:50.350> is

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
was that the Pro Stock category is

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.130 
was that the Pro Stock category is
really<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.159> ultimate<00:00:51.280> hot<00:00:51.729> rod<00:00:52.000> it<00:00:52.269> is<00:00:52.449> the

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
really the ultimate hot rod it is the

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.280 
really the ultimate hot rod it is the
class<00:00:53.440> that<00:00:53.710> runs<00:00:53.979> the<00:00:54.159> fastest<00:00:54.729> on<00:00:55.290> naturally

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
class that runs the fastest on naturally

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.740 
class that runs the fastest on naturally
aspirated<00:00:56.680> or<00:00:57.159> with<00:00:57.460> no<00:00:57.729> power<00:00:57.970> adders<00:00:58.420> no

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
aspirated or with no power adders no

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.799 
aspirated or with no power adders no
nitromethane<00:00:59.530> no<00:00:59.769> alcohol<00:01:00.309> no<00:01:00.640> blowers<00:01:01.600> no

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
nitromethane no alcohol no blowers no

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.530 
nitromethane no alcohol no blowers no
turbos<00:01:02.290> and<00:01:02.530> so<00:01:03.309> we<00:01:03.640> decided<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.150> that<00:01:04.269> was

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
turbos and so we decided that that was

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.719 
turbos and so we decided that that was
the<00:01:04.659> area<00:01:04.930> that<00:01:05.080> an<00:01:05.140> air<00:01:05.379> filter<00:01:05.619> as<00:01:06.040> you<00:01:06.610> can

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
the area that an air filter as you can

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.940 
the area that an air filter as you can
hear<00:01:06.790> an<00:01:07.210> air<00:01:07.479> filter<00:01:07.720> would<00:01:08.140> really<00:01:08.470> make<00:01:08.740> a

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
hear an air filter would really make a

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.999 
hear an air filter would really make a
difference<00:01:09.250> because<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:10.509> does<00:01:10.840> not<00:01:11.109> only<00:01:11.409> does

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
difference because it does not only does

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.709 
difference because it does not only does
it<00:01:12.039> lower<00:01:12.700> some<00:01:12.969> restriction<00:01:13.479> but<00:01:13.600> it

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
it lower some restriction but it

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.469 
it lower some restriction but it
actually<00:01:13.869> makes<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.289> air<00:01:14.469> more<00:01:14.710> linear<00:01:14.950> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
actually makes the air more linear and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.569 
actually makes the air more linear and
potentially<00:01:16.479> could<00:01:16.810> be<00:01:17.170> an<00:01:17.469> advantage<00:01:18.280> on<00:01:18.429> the

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
potentially could be an advantage on the

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.910 
potentially could be an advantage on the
racetrack<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.840> pro<00:01:20.200> stock<00:01:20.439> was<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.770> natural

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
racetrack so pro stock was the natural

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.060 
racetrack so pro stock was the natural
category<00:01:21.670> what<00:01:21.880> we<00:01:21.999> decided<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.509> do<00:01:22.749> was<00:01:23.679> to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
category what we decided to do was to

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.179 
category what we decided to do was to
not<00:01:24.189> only<00:01:24.399> support<00:01:24.789> the<00:01:25.210> sport<00:01:25.570> by<00:01:26.189> working

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
not only support the sport by working

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.029 
not only support the sport by working
inside<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.240> class<00:01:28.509> but<00:01:29.229> designing<00:01:29.710> some

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
inside of the class but designing some

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.039 
inside of the class but designing some
products<00:01:30.490> along<00:01:30.759> with<00:01:31.030> an<00:01:31.210> air<00:01:31.329> filter<00:01:31.539> that

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
products along with an air filter that

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.020 
products along with an air filter that
would<00:01:32.259> actually<00:01:32.439> work<00:01:33.009> and<00:01:33.310> translate<00:01:33.880> into

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
would actually work and translate into

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.770 
would actually work and translate into
higher<00:01:34.299> speeds<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.140> quicker<00:01:35.979> ETS<00:01:36.460> so<00:01:37.149> once<00:01:37.600> we

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
higher speeds and quicker ETS so once we

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.599 
higher speeds and quicker ETS so once we
chose<00:01:38.020> that<00:01:38.229> class<00:01:38.499> it<00:01:38.710> was<00:01:38.799> a<00:01:38.859> natural<00:01:39.069> for<00:01:39.579> us

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
chose that class it was a natural for us

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.090 
chose that class it was a natural for us
to<00:01:39.880> go<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.479> put<00:01:40.659> together<00:01:40.749> a<00:01:41.289> year<00:01:41.890> end

kan<00:01:47.140> has<00:01:47.259> developed<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:47.710> new<00:01:47.859> Pro<00:01:48.100> Stock<00:01:48.369> scoop

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
kan has developed a new Pro Stock scoop

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.879 
kan has developed a new Pro Stock scoop
that<00:01:49.479> we<00:01:49.630> believe<00:01:49.960> actually<00:01:50.200> is<00:01:50.499> going<00:01:50.619> to<00:01:50.679> set

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:50.889 
that we believe actually is going to set

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:53.249 
that we believe actually is going to set
the<00:01:51.039> trend<00:01:51.399> and<00:01:51.609> probably<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.179> bar<00:01:52.420> for<00:01:53.229> the

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
the trend and probably the bar for the

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.590 
the trend and probably the bar for the
future<00:01:53.710> on<00:01:53.950> what<00:01:54.189> intake<00:01:55.060> scoop<00:01:55.210> would<00:01:55.450> look

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
future on what intake scoop would look

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.739 
future on what intake scoop would look
like<00:01:55.749> in<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:55.990> Pro<00:01:56.139> Stock<00:01:56.200> category<00:01:57.569> well<00:01:58.569> from

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
like in the Pro Stock category well from

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.539 
like in the Pro Stock category well from
my<00:01:58.899> standpoint<00:01:59.229> K&amp;N<00:01:59.920> has<00:02:00.039> always<00:02:00.340> been<00:02:00.490> a

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
my standpoint K&amp;N has always been a

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.969 
my standpoint K&amp;N has always been a
worldwide<00:02:00.999> leader<00:02:01.240> in<00:02:01.389> performance<00:02:02.020> air

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
worldwide leader in performance air

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.800 
worldwide leader in performance air
filtration<00:02:03.459> and<00:02:03.939> that<00:02:04.090> gave<00:02:04.420> them<00:02:04.569> a<00:02:04.600> leg<00:02:04.780> up

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
filtration and that gave them a leg up

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.400 
filtration and that gave them a leg up

normally<00:02:08.860> aspirated<00:02:08.890> vehicle<00:02:09.670> is<00:02:09.850> a

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
normally aspirated vehicle is a

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.660 
normally aspirated vehicle is a
paramount<00:02:10.539> importance<00:02:11.080> oh<00:02:11.200> we've<00:02:11.410> got

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
paramount importance oh we've got

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.570 
paramount importance oh we've got
cylinder<00:02:12.670> walls<00:02:12.880> that<00:02:13.090> are<00:02:13.150> different<00:02:13.510> combos

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
cylinder walls that are different combos

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.990 
cylinder walls that are different combos
they<00:02:14.850> were<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> past<00:02:15.560> ring<00:02:16.760> piston<00:02:17.760> rings

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
they were in the past ring piston rings

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.640 
they were in the past ring piston rings
are<00:02:18.120> different<00:02:18.630> than<00:02:18.750> they<00:02:18.870> were<00:02:18.900> before<00:02:19.230> so

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
are different than they were before so

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.060 
are different than they were before so
they're<00:02:20.100> extremely<00:02:20.960> prone<00:02:21.960> to<00:02:22.200> abrasion<00:02:22.590> so

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
they're extremely prone to abrasion so

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.630 
they're extremely prone to abrasion so
air<00:02:23.250> filtration<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:24.140> important<00:02:25.280> kan<00:02:26.280> has<00:02:26.460> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
hood scoop that we've been working on so

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.240 
hood scoop that we've been working on so
there's<00:02:33.660> it's<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.290> multi-faceted<00:02:34.710> approach

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
there's it's a multi-faceted approach

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.040 
there's it's a multi-faceted approach
and<00:02:35.700> that's<00:02:36.090> part<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.480> really<00:02:36.570> interested

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
and that's part that really interested

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.750 
and that's part that really interested
me<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.350> they<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.250> have<00:02:38.340> minimal

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
me a they have to have minimal

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.570 
me a they have to have minimal
aerodynamic<00:02:39.540> drag<00:02:39.980> maximum<00:02:40.980> pressurization

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
aerodynamic drag maximum pressurization

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.880 
aerodynamic drag maximum pressurization
internally<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.600> then<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.200> distribution<00:02:43.830> of

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
internally and then the distribution of

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.820 
internally and then the distribution of
that<00:02:44.040> pressure<00:02:44.250> has<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.670> be<00:02:44.790> uniform<00:02:45.270> so<00:02:45.830> we've

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
that pressure has to be uniform so we've

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.040 
that pressure has to be uniform so we've
been<00:02:46.980> working<00:02:47.190> along<00:02:47.610> on<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.450> program<00:02:48.690> with

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
been working along on that program with

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.840 
been working along on that program with

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
K&amp;N for a number of months and we feel

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.970 
K&amp;N for a number of months and we feel
we're<00:02:51.030> going<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.240> have<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:52.050> hood<00:02:52.500> scoop<00:02:52.770> that

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
we're going to have a hood scoop that

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.250 
we're going to have a hood scoop that
will<00:02:53.130> probably<00:02:53.700> be<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.390> predominant<00:02:54.900> hood

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
will probably be the predominant hood

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.100 
will probably be the predominant hood
scoop<00:02:55.470> next<00:02:55.770> year<00:02:55.920> in<00:02:55.980> Pro<00:02:56.130> Stock<00:02:56.930> got<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.020> get

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
scoop next year in Pro Stock got to get

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.660 
scoop next year in Pro Stock got to get
that<00:02:58.230> air<00:02:58.380> into<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.680> engine<00:02:58.709> somehow<00:02:59.310> because

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
that air into the engine somehow because

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.220 
that air into the engine somehow because
it's<00:02:59.850> you<00:03:00.390> know<00:03:00.420> it's<00:03:00.540> how<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.870> engine

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
it's you know it's how the engine

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.650 
it's you know it's how the engine
breathes<00:03:01.500> but<00:03:01.770> it's<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.280> big<00:03:02.660> aerodynamic

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
breathes but it's a big aerodynamic

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.090 
breathes but it's a big aerodynamic
problem<00:03:03.990> we<00:03:04.110> have<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.440> big<00:03:04.590> old<00:03:04.740> hood<00:03:04.890> scoop

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
problem we have that big old hood scoop

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.890 
problem we have that big old hood scoop
sticking<00:03:05.459> up<00:03:05.580> there<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:05.940> really<00:03:06.150> any<00:03:06.300> any

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
sticking up there so really any any

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
advantage in the you know technology we

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.640 
advantage in the you know technology we
can<00:03:08.940> find<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.750> make<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.080> breakthrough<00:03:10.500> with<00:03:10.620> a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
can find and make it breakthrough with a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.949 
can find and make it breakthrough with a
hood<00:03:10.860> scoop<00:03:11.100> arrow<00:03:12.030> wise<00:03:12.300> that's<00:03:12.600> huge<00:03:12.810> to

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
hood scoop arrow wise that's huge to

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.390 
hood scoop arrow wise that's huge to
these<00:03:13.110> cars<00:03:13.350> arrow<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.830> very<00:03:14.010> important<00:03:14.370> to

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
these cars arrow is very important to

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.580 
these cars arrow is very important to
these<00:03:14.520> cars<00:03:14.820> and<00:03:15.120> that's<00:03:15.750> one<00:03:16.020> area<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.350> we

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
these cars and that's one area that we

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.470 
these cars and that's one area that we
can<00:03:16.860> mess<00:03:17.130> with<00:03:17.370> can't<00:03:17.910> really<00:03:18.090> mess<00:03:18.240> with<00:03:18.270> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
can mess with can't really mess with the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.940 
can mess with can't really mess with the
body<00:03:18.630> measurements<00:03:19.140> Andy<00:03:19.320> but<00:03:19.470> we<00:03:19.560> can't<00:03:19.800> mess

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
body measurements Andy but we can't mess

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.470 
body measurements Andy but we can't mess
with<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.190> hood<00:03:20.310> scoop<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:20.820> I<00:03:21.120> think<00:03:21.360> there's

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
with the hood scoop and I think there's

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.509 
with the hood scoop and I think there's
a<00:03:21.510> lot<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.630> gains<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.959> be<00:03:21.989> made<00:03:22.080> there<00:03:22.400> you<00:03:23.400> know

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
a lot of gains to be made there you know

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.550 
a lot of gains to be made there you know
we<00:03:23.670> we<00:03:23.940> fight<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:24.239> major<00:03:24.510> problem<00:03:25.019> with<00:03:25.140> certain

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
we we fight a major problem with certain

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.650 
we we fight a major problem with certain
cylinders<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.190> engine<00:03:26.550> being<00:03:27.090> leaner<00:03:27.420> or

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
cylinders in the engine being leaner or

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.000 
cylinders in the engine being leaner or
richer<00:03:28.019> or<00:03:28.050> wanting<00:03:28.410> more<00:03:28.530> timing<00:03:28.920> than

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
richer or wanting more timing than

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.650 
richer or wanting more timing than
others<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.430> all<00:03:29.550> comes<00:03:29.760> down<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:30.060> how<00:03:30.600> that

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
others and it all comes down to how that

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.900 
others and it all comes down to how that
air<00:03:30.959> stacks<00:03:31.290> up<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.650> had<00:03:31.739> hood<00:03:31.890> scoop<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.370> you

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
air stacks up and had hood scoop and you

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.220 
air stacks up and had hood scoop and you
know<00:03:33.030> if<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.209> air<00:03:33.360> cleaner<00:03:33.630> can<00:03:33.870> straighten

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
know if that air cleaner can straighten

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.050 
know if that air cleaner can straighten
things<00:03:34.380> out<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.890> make<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.640> air<00:03:35.730> distribution

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
things out and make the air distribution

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.360 
things out and make the air distribution
a<00:03:36.330> little<00:03:36.510> bit<00:03:36.630> cleaner<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.200> more<00:03:37.380> even<00:03:37.860> it's

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
a little bit cleaner and more even it's

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.310 
a little bit cleaner and more even it's
going<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.580> be<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.730> performance<00:03:39.180> gain<00:03:39.420> so<00:03:39.750> you

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
going to be a performance gain so you

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.949 
going to be a performance gain so you
know<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.650> looks<00:03:41.130> great<00:03:41.610> early<00:03:42.360> results<00:03:42.540> look

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
know it looks great early results look

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.320 
know it looks great early results look
like<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.410> lot<00:03:43.800> to<00:03:43.950> be<00:03:44.070> found<00:03:44.220> there<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:44.730> you

we<00:05:08.530> looked<00:05:08.800> for<00:05:09.039> was<00:05:09.400> a<00:05:09.430> racetrack<00:05:09.760> that<00:05:10.630> not

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
we looked for was a racetrack that not

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.810 
we looked for was a racetrack that not
only<00:05:10.870> would<00:05:11.110> provide<00:05:11.560> an<00:05:11.890> atmosphere<00:05:12.039> for<00:05:12.760> the

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
only would provide an atmosphere for the

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.909 
only would provide an atmosphere for the
K&amp;N<00:05:13.180> horsepower<00:05:13.330> challenge<00:05:14.140> but<00:05:14.740> it<00:05:14.830> would

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
K&amp;N horsepower challenge but it would

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.409 
K&amp;N horsepower challenge but it would
also<00:05:14.950> be<00:05:15.250> a<00:05:15.370> place<00:05:15.430> where<00:05:15.669> maybe<00:05:15.970> some<00:05:16.090> World

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
also be a place where maybe some World

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.000 
also be a place where maybe some World
Records<00:05:16.539> could<00:05:17.050> take<00:05:17.229> place<00:05:17.260> we<00:05:17.740> could<00:05:17.860> really

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
Records could take place we could really
