one<00:00:49.420> for<00:00:49.659> a<00:00:49.690> while<00:01:12.690> got<00:01:13.690> a<00:01:13.750> plane<00:01:14.050> that<00:01:14.260> this

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
one for a while got a plane that this

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.630 
one for a while got a plane that this
one<00:01:14.800> is<00:01:14.950> for<00:01:15.220> channels<00:01:15.700> I<00:01:16.830> probably<00:01:17.830> I<00:01:18.100> it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
one is for channels I probably I it

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.770 
one is for channels I probably I it
might<00:01:18.850> have<00:01:19.000> been<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.120> little<00:01:19.300> bit<00:01:19.480> easier<00:01:19.750> for

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
might have been a little bit easier for

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.500 
might have been a little bit easier for
me<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.110> learn<00:01:20.230> to<00:01:20.380> fly<00:01:20.500> on<00:01:20.800> three<00:01:21.130> channel<00:01:21.520> but

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
me to learn to fly on three channel but

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.080 
me to learn to fly on three channel but
since<00:01:23.080> I'm<00:01:23.290> limited<00:01:23.980> money<00:01:24.130> I<00:01:24.460> have<00:01:24.790> on<00:01:24.940> good

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
since I'm limited money I have on good

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.660 
since I'm limited money I have on good
money<00:01:25.300> I<00:01:25.600> got<00:01:26.500> one<00:01:26.710> that<00:01:26.800> I'd<00:01:26.950> be<00:01:27.100> able<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.370> kind

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
money I got one that I'd be able to kind

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.670 
money I got one that I'd be able to kind
of<00:01:27.790> grow<00:01:27.970> into<00:01:34.020> there's<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.110> three<00:01:35.320> channel<00:01:35.470> I

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
of grow into there's a three channel I

00:01:35.680 --> 00:02:10.890 
of grow into there's a three channel I
think<00:01:35.890> we'd<00:01:36.040> probably<00:01:36.070> get<00:01:36.430> boring<00:01:36.760> real<00:01:37.540> fast

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.070 

there<00:02:11.900> we<00:02:12.110> go

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
there we go

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.070

wltoys l9 39 airplane now I got the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.170 
wltoys l9 39 airplane now I got the
finding<00:02:18.530> fly<00:02:18.740> version<00:02:19.220> because<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:20.030> works

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
finding fly version because it works

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.910 
finding fly version because it works
with<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.650> wlv<00:02:21.650> 911<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:23.080> transmitters<00:02:24.080> you

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
with the wlv 911 and transmitters you

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.710 
with the wlv 911 and transmitters you
can<00:02:25.040> see<00:02:25.130> it's<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.370> same<00:02:25.550> thing<00:02:25.790> or<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.120> HLM

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
can see it's the same thing or the HLM

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.060 
can see it's the same thing or the HLM
transmitter<00:02:27.170> which<00:02:27.320> I<00:02:27.470> have<00:02:28.210> so<00:02:29.770> nice<00:02:30.770> little

break anything two batteries very cold

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.440 
break anything two batteries very cold
since<00:03:52.340> it's<00:03:52.490> been<00:03:52.610> outside<00:03:52.940> they<00:03:53.660> look<00:03:53.900> like

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
since it's been outside they look like

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.420 
since it's been outside they look like
doesn't<00:03:56.450> say<00:03:56.600> what<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.950> milliamp<00:03:57.950> hours<00:03:58.280> on

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
doesn't say what the milliamp hours on

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.160 
doesn't say what the milliamp hours on
this<00:03:58.580> but<00:03:58.850> I<00:03:58.880> think<00:03:59.210> they're<00:03:59.420> three<00:03:59.930> point

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
this but I think they're three point

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.370 
this but I think they're three point
seven<00:04:00.470> volt<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:01.300> I'm<00:04:02.300> pretty<00:04:02.750> sure<00:04:02.840> there<00:04:03.290> are

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
seven volt and I'm pretty sure there are

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.260 
seven volt and I'm pretty sure there are
a<00:04:03.440> hundred<00:04:03.710> billion<00:04:04.130> powers<00:04:04.670> either<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.240> or

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
a hundred billion powers either that or

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.270 
a hundred billion powers either that or
no<00:04:05.900> one<00:04:06.050> hundred<00:04:06.320> and<00:04:06.380> fifty<00:04:06.710> I<00:04:06.740> think<00:04:07.040> I'll

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
no one hundred and fifty I think I'll

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.650 
no one hundred and fifty I think I'll
have<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.490> check<00:04:07.700> I'm<00:04:07.880> not<00:04:08.000> sure<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:08.390> it's<00:04:08.540> not

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
have to check I'm not sure and it's not

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.300 
have to check I'm not sure and it's not

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
there's your servos for that go up into

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.400 
there's your servos for that go up into
here<00:05:04.940> you<00:05:05.890> have<00:05:06.890> your<00:05:07.220> roll

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
here you have your roll

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.890 
here you have your roll
servo<00:05:09.410> rudders<00:05:09.710> their<00:05:10.330> propeller<00:05:11.330> spins<00:05:11.660> very

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
servo rudders their propeller spins very

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.860 
servo rudders their propeller spins very
nice<00:05:12.460> you<00:05:13.460> can<00:05:13.580> see<00:05:13.760> your<00:05:13.910> battery<00:05:14.270> just<00:05:14.570> um

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
nice you can see your battery just um

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.400 
nice you can see your battery just um
goes<00:05:15.800> under<00:05:16.130> here<00:05:16.310> and<00:05:16.460> I<00:05:16.520> think<00:05:16.580> there's<00:05:16.940> a

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
goes under here and I think there's a

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.970 
goes under here and I think there's a
little<00:05:18.410> bit

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
little bit

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.870 
little bit
I<00:05:20.410> think<00:05:21.410> that's<00:05:21.620> velcro<00:05:22.070> with<00:05:22.280> just<00:05:22.520> a<00:05:22.640> cover

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
I think that's velcro with just a cover

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.930 
I think that's velcro with just a cover
over<00:05:23.000> in<00:05:23.450> there<00:05:23.660> off<00:05:23.780> to<00:05:23.810> pull<00:05:24.169> it<00:05:24.290> off<00:05:24.410> I<00:05:24.560> think

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
over in there off to pull it off I think

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.400 
over in there off to pull it off I think
or<00:05:25.940> some<00:05:26.180> double-sided<00:05:26.600> sticky<00:05:26.870> tape<00:05:26.990> on<00:05:27.260> that

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
or some double-sided sticky tape on that

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.920 
or some double-sided sticky tape on that
I'm<00:05:27.560> sure<00:05:28.120> what<00:05:29.120> I'll<00:05:29.210> figure<00:05:29.390> that<00:05:29.480> out<00:05:29.750> and

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
I'm sure what I'll figure that out and

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.870 
I'm sure what I'll figure that out and
here's<00:05:30.350> the<00:05:30.410> battery<00:05:30.950> plug<00:05:31.280> that<00:05:31.430> plugs<00:05:31.490> into

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
here's the battery plug that plugs into

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.420 
here's the battery plug that plugs into
them<00:05:32.090> and<00:05:32.300> you<00:05:33.020> can<00:05:33.169> see<00:05:33.320> the<00:05:33.470> antenna<00:05:34.100> right

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
them and you can see the antenna right

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:41.140 
them and you can see the antenna right
there<00:05:34.730> comes<00:05:35.330> out<00:05:36.190> so

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:06:00.530 

get<00:05:42.150> it<00:05:42.300> get<00:05:43.290> the<00:05:43.410> box<00:05:59.060> okay<00:06:00.060> there<00:06:00.270> you<00:06:00.390> go
