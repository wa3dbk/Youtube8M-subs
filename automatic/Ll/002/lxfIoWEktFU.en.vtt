00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and then try to fold into thirds as

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:49.490 
and then try to fold into thirds as
easily<00:01:35.909> as<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:39.560> one<00:01:43.579> one<00:01:44.579> fold<00:01:48.500> whoops

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
but then what you're gonna do is fold it

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.300 
but then what you're gonna do is fold it
out<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.460> way<00:04:00.640> see<00:04:01.420> how<00:04:02.200> low<00:04:02.260> like<00:04:02.650> that<00:04:02.950> but

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
out of the way see how low like that but

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.080 
out of the way see how low like that but
you<00:04:03.430> folded<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.090> out<00:04:04.210> of<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:04.390> way<00:04:04.540> now

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
you folded it out of the way now

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.050 
you folded it out of the way now
same<00:04:07.090> here<00:04:07.360> fold<00:04:08.020> it<00:04:08.170> out<00:04:08.260> of<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.470> way<00:04:10.530> so

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
same here fold it out of the way so

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.430 
same here fold it out of the way so
something<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.210> looks<00:04:13.450> like<00:04:13.510> this<00:04:13.840> but<00:04:14.170> you

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
something that looks like this but you

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.690 
something that looks like this but you
don't<00:04:14.500> want<00:04:14.770> any<00:04:14.950> of<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.160> extra<00:04:15.460> pieces

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
don't want any of the extra pieces

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.360 
don't want any of the extra pieces
hanging<00:04:16.090> up<00:04:16.360> so<00:04:16.900> we're<00:04:17.500> gonna<00:04:17.590> fold<00:04:17.830> that<00:04:17.950> part

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
hanging up so we're gonna fold that part

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.539 
hanging up so we're gonna fold that part
in<00:04:18.549> two<00:04:18.750> so<00:04:19.750> now<00:04:20.590> we're<00:04:20.799> gonna<00:04:20.920> do<00:04:21.160> is<00:04:21.340> now

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
in two so now we're gonna do is now

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.330 
in two so now we're gonna do is now
similar<00:04:22.270> like<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.720> top<00:04:23.050> well<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:23.950> can<00:04:24.100> do<00:04:24.280> at

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
similar like the top well you can do at

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:37.820 
similar like the top well you can do at
the<00:04:24.430> bottom<00:04:25.590> take<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.920> edge<00:04:27.100> and<00:04:27.700> fold<00:04:28.240> it<00:04:28.840> in

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.880 

there<00:04:38.830> see<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:41.080> now<00:04:41.710> it's<00:04:41.890> easier<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.370> tell

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
there see and now it's easier to tell

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.380 
there see and now it's easier to tell
because<00:04:44.890> I<00:04:45.040> got<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:45.340> yellow<00:04:45.610> right<00:04:46.030> there<00:04:47.250> so

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
because I got the yellow right there so

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:55.080 
because I got the yellow right there so
then<00:04:50.220> you're<00:04:51.220> gonna<00:04:51.340> fold<00:04:51.820> take<00:04:52.270> this<00:04:53.910> fold<00:04:54.910> it

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
then you're gonna fold take this fold it

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.840 
then you're gonna fold take this fold it
in<00:04:56.460> same<00:04:57.460> on<00:04:57.610> both<00:04:57.760> sides<00:04:59.490> here's<00:05:00.490> what<00:05:00.610> you<00:05:00.700> do

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
in same on both sides here's what you do

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.430 
in same on both sides here's what you do
now<00:05:01.060> you<00:05:01.720> folded<00:05:02.410> in<00:05:02.670> these<00:05:03.670> parts<00:05:04.090> in<00:05:04.330> so<00:05:05.320> it

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
now you folded in these parts in so it

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.170 
now you folded in these parts in so it
looks<00:05:05.770> like<00:05:05.890> a<00:05:05.920> point<00:05:07.290> that's<00:05:08.290> what<00:05:08.500> you<00:05:08.650> do

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
looks like a point that's what you do

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
same on both sides and then it's up to

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.890 
same on both sides and then it's up to
you<00:05:16.050> what<00:05:17.050> you<00:05:17.080> want<00:05:17.650> to<00:05:17.919> do<00:05:18.160> here<00:05:19.090> like<00:05:19.510> cut
