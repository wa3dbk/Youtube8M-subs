 the new era games playstation games 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.539
 3 playstation 4 and xbox one in media 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.949
 also digital and gay church our 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.710
 front on youtube's beauty channel 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.510
 Speak 98 with another video for you guys 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.720
 and in this video to talk again about 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.040
 resident evil or exactly as it is known 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.989
 by title and brought a talking video 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.450
 about a possible incentive that this 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.410
 announced in e3 2014 is in a few 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.570
 days 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.649
 capturing and now the name of the montado 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.440
 the game is not 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.989
 I had spoken there, I wanted to bring some 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.899
 thing you then I bring here and 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.350
 I had also spoken in that video that 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.570
 the user of a forum there is had said 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.070
 that we saw that was not going to be 17 to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:06.600
 to another name and number and that is to be 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:12.990
 one like me who follow the goal line 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:16.320
 Veronica revelations and it really does seem 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.130
 that will be because the image has left and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.110
 will see in the background image that shows a 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.020
 started the game logo is the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.840
 resident evil and ramsey of veronica 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.270
 that is, it is as if it were the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.500
 continuation of executive code veronica 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.990
 so it kind of activates the rumor that 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.820
 It had also come out that I commented on the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.350
 another video of the issue of having two 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.380
 characters who will return on occasion 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.049
 three characters two would not 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.970
 appeared a decade ago and one would be a 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.860
 new character I had quoted there 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.649
 also in that video that the character 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.799
 Could it be Claire Redfield? 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.920
 then it may be there that the return is 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.840
 even though this noise in veronica is 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.460
 size that is confirmed nothing is 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.079
 confirmed until now neither that video 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.659
 in this video that nothing is confirmed but 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.640
 that image then reinforced my 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.380
 rumor that the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.020
 goal is not the dilma 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.520
 I remember now the staff commented the 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.490
 saying that the dilma was in the recent or 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.830
 5 entered game 5 to be able to know this 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.260
 then there is the staff also commented here 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.240
 to rain what the staff said 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.130
 had as I spoke are two character is 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.540
 one is claire redfield another 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.460
 character that I'll take a look here 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:37.700
 now and another also who is new to the 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.770
 story then probably this new 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.190
 then nobody knows how it's going to be 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.530
 be a villain a guy who will be good 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.720
 in the story but the second character 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.860
 here I can see that the staff commented 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.840
 It was opened and was the perry and the rebeca 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.250
 Of course it also did not show up so they are 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.940
 three characters that do not appear much 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.730
 perry the time rebeca and then believes the 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.360
 People have to kind of wait, it's really 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.400
 to go out to e3 2013 and 2014 we can 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.460
 see what will really be confirmed if 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.040
 will be in frogs and veronica resented 7 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.780
 will have the incentive if you have the chance to 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.660
 Veronica Coast characters will be in the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.820
 game in which means that even waiting for 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.620
 see if it will be confirmed and 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.770
 basically this is hope you have 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.600
 liked the video show brought this rumor 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.660
 there to reinforce what I already had 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.540
 brought to you before is remembering 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.270
 that this is all here rumor in the video here 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.670
 then nothing had confirmed this 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.220
 image can be lie has address 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.290
 teaches resident evil point with barbarian 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:49.220
 who enter the address here the dot com 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.340
 a veronica shack appears something 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.620
 it does not look like anything out of the air 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.750
 then maybe it's true I do not know 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.840
 if the page is off the air because here it is with 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.520
 was actually dropped the guy with the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.709
 page fake I do not know, right? 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.350
 to drag myself to wait there as I already 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.260
 I spoke in the previous video of the receptive if 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.640
 something is left until the 9th to bring 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.100

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.590
 You may be checking out what's going on. 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.840
 have you again there at e3 2014 beauty 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.489
 anything related now form 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.000
 positive or any other game that the 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.320
 cost 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.510

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.040

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.810
 You see these people this for you. 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.760
 like this video do not forget to comment 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.430
 that you think is going to be really going 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.810
 being an old ranch unique because I 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.520
 would be coordinated by but a long time ago 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.830
 then in a book basically what was the 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.300
 the end did not have that talk after all 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.850
 here is because for those who have not read then 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.230
 ends up being the choice but that you 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.300
 think will it be even our 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.100
 skin comments on what you find in 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.930
 risk of poverty made my god until the 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.930
