00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
stack but I talked to a Devin game and

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.240 
stack but I talked to a Devin game and
he<00:00:20.490> said<00:00:20.850> they<00:00:21.600> are<00:00:21.630> supposed<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.470> like<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.160> I'm

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
he said they are supposed to like so I'm

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
they're supposed to have some fire on in

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.560 
they're supposed to have some fire on in
there<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.730> yeah<00:00:26.730> they'll<00:00:26.939> hopefully<00:00:27.330> be

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
there and yeah they'll hopefully be

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
there and yeah they'll hopefully be
fixed<00:00:27.930> sometime<00:00:28.199> soon

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
fixed sometime soon

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.660 
fixed sometime soon
ask<00:00:29.429> for<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> actual<00:00:30.890> combination<00:00:34.610> that<00:00:35.610> is

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
ask for the actual combination that is

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.150 
ask for the actual combination that is
it<00:00:38.570> again<00:00:39.570> my<00:00:39.930> armors<00:00:40.230> not<00:00:40.260> final<00:00:40.770> I'll

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
it again my armors not final I'll

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.709 
it again my armors not final I'll
probably<00:00:41.399> end<00:00:41.579> up<00:00:41.730> changing<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.300> shoulders

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
probably end up changing the shoulders

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.940 
probably end up changing the shoulders
chest<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.350> legs<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.010> rest<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.340> fine<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.120> guess

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
chest and legs the rest is fine I guess

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.660 
chest and legs the rest is fine I guess
as<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> animations<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:49.340> still<00:00:50.340> haven't

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
as for the animations I still haven't

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.049 
as for the animations I still haven't
seen<00:00:50.850> anyone<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:52.399> ranger<00:00:53.399> at<00:00:53.489> least<00:00:53.670> with

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
seen anyone with a ranger at least with

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.479 
seen anyone with a ranger at least with
frost<00:00:54.420> Fang<00:00:54.739> so<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.770> hadn't<00:00:56.160> seen<00:00:56.340> these

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
frost Fang so I hadn't seen these

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.450 
frost Fang so I hadn't seen these
animations<00:00:57.000> online<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.440> think<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:59.010> might

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
animations online so I think I might

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.420 
animations online so I think I might
want<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.670> show<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.910> guys

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:16.990 

of<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.090> one-two-three<00:01:08.690> skill<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:12.910> yeah

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.360 

cross<00:01:17.630> bangle<00:01:17.990> school<00:01:18.260> I<00:01:18.500> don't<00:01:19.070> know<00:01:19.130> if<00:01:19.250> the

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
cross bangle school I don't know if the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.210 
cross bangle school I don't know if the
other<00:01:19.490> videos<00:01:19.790> actually<00:01:20.540> shown<00:01:20.750> this<00:01:20.900> but<00:01:21.220> it

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
other videos actually shown this but it

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.490 
other videos actually shown this but it
first<00:01:23.180> off<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:23.630> get<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.930> course<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.320> mouth

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
first off you get of course the mouth

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.280 
first off you get of course the mouth
moves<00:01:25.150> just<00:01:26.150> slowly<00:01:26.630> though<00:01:26.750> it's<00:01:26.960> kind<00:01:27.260> of

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
moves just slowly though it's kind of

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.760 
moves just slowly though it's kind of
like<00:01:27.440> if<00:01:28.100> he<00:01:28.250> was<00:01:28.370> actually<00:01:28.760> frozen<00:01:29.680> one<00:01:30.680> of

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
like if he was actually frozen one of

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.970 
like if he was actually frozen one of
the<00:01:30.830> things<00:01:30.980> I<00:01:31.130> also<00:01:31.250> like<00:01:31.520> is<00:01:31.850> that<00:01:32.120> the<00:01:32.980> block

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
the things I also like is that the block

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.760 
the things I also like is that the block
of<00:01:34.100> ice<00:01:34.190> over<00:01:34.490> here<00:01:34.520> will<00:01:35.240> glow<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:36.500> know<00:01:36.620> the

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
of ice over here will glow you know the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.170 
of ice over here will glow you know the
little<00:01:37.070> fog<00:01:37.430> that<00:01:37.670> comes<00:01:37.850> out<00:01:38.000> of<00:01:38.030> it

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
little fog that comes out of it

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.780 
little fog that comes out of it
sometimes<00:01:39.110> it'll<00:01:39.410> glow<00:01:39.980> bright<00:01:40.280> white<00:01:40.550> I'm

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
sometimes it'll glow bright white I'm

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.640 
sometimes it'll glow bright white I'm
not<00:01:40.970> sure<00:01:41.150> exactly<00:01:41.420> what<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:42.440> know<00:01:42.530> what

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
not sure exactly what you know what

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.850 
not sure exactly what you know what
triggers<00:01:42.920> that<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.480> as<00:01:44.480> for<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.080> animations

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.560 

that's<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.010> one<00:01:49.190> skill

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.480 

the<00:01:53.900> two<00:01:54.110> skill<00:01:54.440> doesn't<00:01:54.650> really<00:01:54.950> quite<00:01:55.220> work

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
the two skill doesn't really quite work

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.860 
the two skill doesn't really quite work
on<00:01:55.700> this<00:01:56.110> dummy<00:01:57.790> but<00:01:58.790> like<00:01:59.630> it<00:01:59.840> doesn't

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
on this dummy but like it doesn't

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.080 
on this dummy but like it doesn't
actually<00:02:00.200> hit<00:02:00.530> them<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.670> I'll<00:02:01.730> show<00:02:01.910> you<00:02:02.000> that

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
actually hit them so I'll show you that

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.020 
actually hit them so I'll show you that
outside<00:02:02.480> in<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.690> second<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.730> would<00:02:04.730> be<00:02:04.850> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
outside in a second that would be the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.140 
outside in a second that would be the
three<00:02:05.240> skill<00:02:06.460> that's<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.700> four<00:02:07.940> skill<00:02:10.150> and

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
three skill that's the four skill and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:19.090 
three skill that's the four skill and
the<00:02:11.420> skill<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:17.000> yeah<00:02:17.720> that's<00:02:18.260> pretty<00:02:18.470> much<00:02:18.770> it

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
the skill and yeah that's pretty much it

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.620 
the skill and yeah that's pretty much it
I'll<00:02:19.370> go<00:02:19.550> outside<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:21.490> show<00:02:22.490> you<00:02:22.550> this<00:02:23.030> this

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
I'll go outside and show you this this

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.690 
I'll go outside and show you this this
will<00:02:24.170> be<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.500> two<00:02:24.770> skill<00:02:26.200> on<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.260> ax<00:02:27.710> just<00:02:28.550> you

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
will be the two skill on the ax just you

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.740 
will be the two skill on the ax just you
couldn't<00:02:29.630> see<00:02:29.870> before

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
couldn't see before

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.000 
couldn't see before
another<00:02:32.750> thing<00:02:32.990> it<00:02:33.110> actually<00:02:33.230> does<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.800> that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
another thing it actually does is that

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.790 
another thing it actually does is that
claw<00:02:34.340> device<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:35.030> see<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:36.500> actually

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
claw device that you see it actually

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.040 
claw device that you see it actually
stays<00:02:37.220> behind<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:37.970> well<00:02:38.300> it<00:02:38.570> stays<00:02:38.840> around

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
stays behind it well it stays around

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.130 
stays behind it well it stays around
where<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.440> get<00:02:39.620> hit<00:02:40.330> so<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.480> can<00:02:41.690> just<00:02:41.840> see<00:02:42.050> it

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
where you get hit so you can just see it

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.870 
where you get hit so you can just see it
when<00:02:42.320> he<00:02:42.350> was<00:02:42.500> moving<00:02:42.800> he<00:02:43.010> was<00:02:43.160> leaving<00:02:43.460> these

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
when he was moving he was leaving these

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.370 
when he was moving he was leaving these
little<00:02:44.150> clouds<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.570> ice<00:02:44.690> behind<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.230> that's

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
little clouds of ice behind and that's
