make a kill killing spree so what you
see<00:00:13.770> here<00:00:14.129> is<00:00:14.190> three<00:00:14.790> monitors<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.960> typical

see here is three monitors and a typical
life<00:00:16.500> an<00:00:16.680> arrangement<00:00:17.250> where<00:00:17.700> the<00:00:18.000> third

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
life an arrangement where the third

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.830 
life an arrangement where the third
input<00:00:18.599> is<00:00:19.080> different<00:00:19.950> than<00:00:20.099> the<00:00:20.279> last<00:00:20.520> two

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
input is different than the last two

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.659 
input is different than the last two
what<00:00:21.840> will<00:00:21.990> happen<00:00:22.380> with<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.770> mixed<00:00:23.220> inputs

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669 
what will happen with this mixed inputs

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.109 
what will happen with this mixed inputs
up<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.329> you'll<00:00:24.570> get<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.169> the<00:00:25.410> monitors

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
up is that you'll get to the monitors

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.940 
up is that you'll get to the monitors
that<00:00:27.119> won't<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:27.840> tearing<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.619> you'll<00:00:28.739> get<00:00:28.890> a

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
that won't have tearing and you'll get a

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.030 
that won't have tearing and you'll get a
third<00:00:29.250> monitor<00:00:29.520> that<00:00:29.970> does<00:00:30.239> have<00:00:30.509> tearing

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
third monitor that does have tearing

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.710 
third monitor that does have tearing
though<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.340> only<00:00:32.640> happens<00:00:33.059> if<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.420> set<00:00:33.690> your

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
though this only happens if you set your

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.780 
though this only happens if you set your
preferred<00:00:34.079> monitor<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.040> one<00:00:35.220> of<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.399> DVI

preferred monitor to one of the DVI
ports<00:00:36.390> if<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.309> third<00:00:38.610> monitor<00:00:38.969> set

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450

the display for it it won't have tearing

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.520 
the display for it it won't have tearing
on<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.880> DisplayPort<00:00:45.600> monitor<00:00:45.990> but<00:00:46.260> it'll

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
on the DisplayPort monitor but it'll

on the DisplayPort monitor but it'll
have<00:00:46.770> tearing<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.580> the<00:00:48.270> DVI<00:00:48.630> monitors<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
have tearing on the DVI monitors and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.880 
have tearing on the DVI monitors and
when<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.490> up<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> ante<00:00:51.270> 25<00:00:51.750> monitors<00:00:52.320> all

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
when you up the ante 25 monitors all

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.600 
when you up the ante 25 monitors all
using<00:00:53.370> adapters<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.360> different<00:00:55.079> monitors

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
using adapters and different monitors

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.300 
using adapters and different monitors
you<00:00:56.610> get<00:00:56.880> much<00:00:57.450> different<00:00:58.110> results<00:00:58.590> things

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
you get much different results things

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.170 
you get much different results things
that<00:00:59.520> don't<00:00:59.970> make<00:01:00.210> sense<00:01:00.540> I<00:01:01.370> have<00:01:02.370> VGA<00:01:02.910> monitor

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
that don't make sense I have VGA monitor

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.260 
that don't make sense I have VGA monitor
syncing<00:01:03.989> up<00:01:04.079> with<00:01:04.320> HDMI<00:01:05.009> monitors<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:08.270> just

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
syncing up with HDMI monitors and just

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.750 
syncing up with HDMI monitors and just
the<00:01:09.600> rules<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.290> engagement<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.610> been

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the rules of engagement have just been

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.390 
the rules of engagement have just been
blown<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.300> water<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.870> set<00:01:13.590> up<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:13.800> monitor

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
blown out the water I set up my monitor

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.610 
blown out the water I set up my monitor
so<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.360> three<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.900> middle<00:01:15.990> would<00:01:16.470> be

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
so that the three in the middle would be

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.500 
so that the three in the middle would be
identical<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:17.970> using<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.420> same

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
identical and all using the same

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.620 
identical and all using the same
connections<00:01:19.520> through<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.670> logic<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
connections through the logic of the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.440 
connections through the logic of the
first<00:01:21.930> section<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:22.950> video<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.940> three<00:01:24.420> of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
first section of this video all three of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.870 
first section of this video all three of
those<00:01:24.570> monitors<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.409> long<00:01:26.159> as<00:01:26.340> one<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.610> them

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
those monitors as long as one of them

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.670 
those monitors as long as one of them
was<00:01:27.150> picked<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.630> preferred<00:01:27.930> monitor

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
was picked as the preferred monitor

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.810 
was picked as the preferred monitor
should<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.549> had<00:01:29.850> no<00:01:30.210> care<00:01:30.540> whatsoever

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
should have had no care whatsoever

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.490 
should have had no care whatsoever
instead<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.060> seemed<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:33.659> AMD<00:01:34.140> driver

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
instead it seemed like the AMD driver

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.990 
instead it seemed like the AMD driver
just<00:01:35.250> picked<00:01:35.610> monitors<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> sync<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.229> not

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
just picked monitors a sync up and not

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.640 
just picked monitors a sync up and not
this<00:01:39.000> actually<00:01:39.570> makes<00:01:39.750> me<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.260> that<00:01:40.350> this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
this actually makes me think that this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.039 
this actually makes me think that this
is<00:01:40.830> not<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.040> hardware<00:01:41.549> issue<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.690> actually

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
is not a hardware issue and can actually

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.120 
is not a hardware issue and can actually
be<00:01:43.619> fixed<00:01:44.580> via<00:01:44.760> software<00:01:45.330> and<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.130> actually

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
be fixed via software and that actually

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.910 
be fixed via software and that actually
explains<00:01:47.460> why<00:01:48.180> Nvidia<00:01:48.630> got<00:01:49.080> this<00:01:49.290> right<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
explains why Nvidia got this right and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.359 
explains why Nvidia got this right and
doesn't<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> tearing<00:01:51.030> issue<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.840> TI

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
doesn't have a tearing issue like a TI

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.669 
doesn't have a tearing issue like a TI
excuse<00:01:53.369> me<00:01:53.490> AMD

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679

I'm going to throw a screen up here that

I'm going to throw a screen up here that

catalyst control center I the only thing
I<00:02:06.600> can<00:02:06.689> think<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.590> going<00:02:08.280> back<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.640> my<00:02:08.750> 5870

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
I can think of is going back to my 5870

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.070 
I can think of is going back to my 5870
eyefinity<00:02:10.379> 6<00:02:10.649> edition<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.660> using<00:02:12.660> all<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
eyefinity 6 edition and using all the

eyefinity 6 edition and using all the
same<00:02:13.319> adapters<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:14.129> these<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:15.180> even<00:02:15.360> then<00:02:15.720> I'm

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
same adapters on these but even then I'm

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.789 
same adapters on these but even then I'm
not<00:02:15.959> sure<00:02:16.170> if<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.769> issue<00:02:16.950> with<00:02:17.310> G<00:02:17.459> taken<00:02:17.819> care

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
not sure if the issue with G taken care
