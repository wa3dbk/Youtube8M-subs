00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
little you know packet here it almost

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.010 
little you know packet here it almost
looks<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.890> like<00:01:31.890> what<00:01:32.070> you'd<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
looks like like what you'd have in the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.760 
looks like like what you'd have in the
the<00:01:34.020> kool-aid<00:01:34.560> packets<00:01:34.829> or<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:37.380> Crystal

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the kool-aid packets or the the Crystal

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.069 
the kool-aid packets or the the Crystal
Light<00:01:37.799> packets<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:39.150> pour<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.540> directly<00:01:39.630> into

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
Light packets you pour it directly into

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.219 
Light packets you pour it directly into
the<00:01:40.200> juice<00:01:40.909> just<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.329> essentially<00:01:43.200> I

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the juice just like that essentially I

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.810 
the juice just like that essentially I
think<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.500> some<00:01:43.680> sort<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.009> yeast<00:01:44.310> mixture

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
think it's some sort of a yeast mixture

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.660 
think it's some sort of a yeast mixture
just<00:01:45.720> like<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.619> were<00:01:46.740> making<00:01:47.340> wine

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
just like you do if you were making wine

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.920 
just like you do if you were making wine
and<00:01:47.880> since<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.090> don't<00:01:48.180> need<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.479> shake<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.840> up

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and since you don't need to shake it up

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.440 
and since you don't need to shake it up
you<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.200> put<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.579> then

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
you just put it in just like that then

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.170 
you just put it in just like that then
you<00:01:51.960> put<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> topper<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.340> -<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.700> kind<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you put the topper on - it's kind of the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.490 
you put the topper on - it's kind of the
same<00:01:54.329> processes<00:01:55.020> as<00:01:55.170> making<00:01:55.770> one<00:01:56.159> so

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
same processes as making one so

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.070 
same processes as making one so
you<00:01:58.010> know<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:58.400> guess<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.180> would<00:01:59.300> be<00:01:59.450> what<00:02:00.050> I

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
you know I guess it would be what I

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.990 
you know I guess it would be what I
