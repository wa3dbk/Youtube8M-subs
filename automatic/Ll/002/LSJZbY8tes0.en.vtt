00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.970
 that the following constellation always 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.440
 It won ratmir premises on 1973 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.090
 are to enter plays radtour much 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.259
 because it is very remarkable because 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.030
 At first glance, it still looks 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.590
 A draw fortress from the ranger 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.400
 just stay forever on the long 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.470
 diagonal and then there is no direct 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.869
 in version for black more sources 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.179
 Bach's play Spielman Endgame preparation 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.920
 and romantics or so its 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.570
 detailed are when the five men 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.760
 kills games yes, normally it does not work 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.790
 Continue through normal invasion of the figures 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.110
 tower is not progressing 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.950
 but there is still a lever for it 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.890
 first of all, in the right one 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.690
 position do not bring any black 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.879
 egg white , on the other hand, can raise a game 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.739
 Now you have to get one 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.899
 little notice here is the important 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.710
 position king and tower so that's the one 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.000
 Runners in a sense something 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.830
 is dominated 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.030
 you have to know that as well 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.939
 I just in any position 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.439
 go play 65 and now wins g5 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.580
 I think this knowledge helps enormously 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.110
 on the board you would have certain 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.320
 cuff it so easily 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.729
 recognize 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.290
 The idea is now to build the static 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.020
 structured in every case dynamic 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.659
 Whatever happens will be black 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.290
 continues to lever and that wins in 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.290
 all life situations 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.740
 in the following, the tower is just the runner 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.740
 just think too high 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:03.960
 and black wins the g6 would be that 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.010
 misfortune in atom heart one can be there 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.570
 of course, everything to the last 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.740
 Remember detail and it plays 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.780
 little by itself you know it 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.640
 wins and then follows the thread 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:19.770
 then it will fit and here 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.120
 then decides the black freibauer 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.010
 the day 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.810
 The tower is simply much stronger 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.070
 it runs and it was the tower dominated 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:34.160
 Not only the runners but he stops 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:34.160
 now also g6 that several options 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:57.120
 the tournament 62 comply tempo to 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:03:08.630
 winning attacks and everything goes on 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:08.630
 on dull attack just too fast 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.250
 Thomas is said to be the runner 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:27.010
 superior to those they contend 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:27.010
 have already seen the final round 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.530
 something tough it might take with the f 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.900
 Farmers were now black around the structure 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.510
 to fuel his fowers here 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.180
 must give and only the hague farmers 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.950
 But he has luck to the 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.870
 dangerous corner to those of mine 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:04:04.450
 sight wrong so dangerous 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:04:05.709
 The white king feels insecure 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.660
 Now you have a little more against the game and 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.860
 fun was something rather black something 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.900
 less profit potential 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.310
 but it does not help the tower is always 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.310
 still to think about 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.190
 After that, 2 could just become a builder 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.489
 First picked up at the harbor and then 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.489
 everything is over 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.900
 Martin grip 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.670
 this one too was analyzed in detail 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.020
 already by several authors schÃ¶nners 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:56.630
 Solution it may be on now 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:59.530
 most convincing tower g7 and moderate and 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.530
 Once again, the tower can be its superiority 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.530
 play 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.860
 It's just too small for the runs 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.420
 that is deadly 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.870
 depending on wins black-yellow of the rating 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.870
 1 power 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:40.110
 and now the tower is behind and 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.099
 black also wins well 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.669
 certainly not everything in detail 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:46.169
 but I think this is important 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.880
 Constellation has always become the 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:53.729
 his characters should be attackers here 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:58.229
 Maneuvering positions shown and 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:00.449
 then b 65 play around the farmers structure 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:05.729
 to energize with the lever and how 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:08.930
 knows whatsoever beats then pry 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.930
 hereby h4 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:21.300
 and in this case with 11 4 and then 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.630
 The first won the knowledge helps believe 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.729
 I 'm always on the board too 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.699
 Of course you can get all the details 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:30.990
 may hardly remember though 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.060
 then you have at least chances in the 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.509
 village was also the black 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:41.190
 dull attack still to wear 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:43.409
 that should also help here 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:47.610
 So just enough potential for profit 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:49.889
 the board the static position 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.870
 hereby g5 crack 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.750
 yes that's this for I find 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.930
 Also fascinating again something like that 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.930
 everything
