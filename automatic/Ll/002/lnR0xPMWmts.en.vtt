00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.899
 big hello to everyone i'm actually 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.220
 really wanted to show you makeup 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.010
 some easy daytime but how 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.410
 You see the model as I came with large 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.330
 special eyelashes and more precisely with the remnants 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.820
 them and so I had a little bit 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.430
 replay it in the end I'll show you 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.570
 makeup in this video 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.550
 bright smoky colored pigments like 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.279
 You see my skin is a very good model 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.840
 so highlighter I do not regret it will 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.630
 very cool to look at the pictures 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.850
 what you see at the end of the video but for 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.670
 real life is certainly not very 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.890
 acceptable as a substrate loss i 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.489
 here used dark kayal 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.289
 it's for him and here the color is not really 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.480
 principled just so i chose 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.120
 brown and and i really like 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.890
 quality and it is very resistant therefore it 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.199
 need to very quickly shade it 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.610
 about which from he immediately grabs and then 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.610
 it is simply impossible to do 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.310
 for this makeup I use the bottom row 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.050
 seats with mosaic zoeva Smokey take 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.090
 the first shade is dirty pink and 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.080
 a brush for feathering put it on 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.080
 entire fold of the century 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.909
 then fourth so dark brown 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.780
 cold and the same brush highlighting 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.780
 outer corner of the eye 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.220
 Happenes 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.220
 on 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:15.580
 the third shade is it dark blue 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.580
 purple I stain the lower eyelid 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.730
 the fifth touch is ashy black i 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.430
 I increase the intensity of the outer corner 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.810
 eyes here, too, brush for shading 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.810
 only a little bit thinner 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.590
 Now I apply the pigment from mac to shades 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.650
 vanilla 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:52.860
 on the inner corners of the eyes and a little bit of them 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.860
 feather to the center of the moving century 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.550
 but 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.820
 if you are somewhere nakosyachili or shadow 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.560
 out of the box itâ€™s all possible 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.330
 correct as washing 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.330
 rubber brush for concealer 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.400
 now I take a very beautiful green 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:30.680
 pigment chameleon I have this company yes 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.329
 vinci but i know that in many other 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.579
 We also have such companies 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.480
 stories like nothing ever gives in and 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:40.569
 right finger stuffing it on the movable 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.569
 eyelid 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:57.379
 I paint over the mucous with the same kayal he 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.379
 for its only black 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.049
 on the lower eyelid tassels pencil apply 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.400
 dark purple pigment in this case 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.400
 I have a firm for him 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.729
 but here I did not want a little more 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:25.340
 add intensity to the outer corner 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.229
 my eyes really like me very much 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.569
 shading technique so that i can 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.889
 layering intensity depending on 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.889
 of how much i need it 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.300
 cream liner in the yard all personal 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.300
 belt 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.130
 actually i'm just thrilled with 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.190
 my girls eyebrows and I'm not at all 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.200
 I want to make her face clear 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.630
 cut eyebrows so I am the opposite 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.970
 enhance the effect of model eyebrows impart 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.840
 freedom im natural casual wine 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.840
 orderly 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:41.120
 glue bunches and colored lower eyelashes 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:43.819
 with lips is the same story that of 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.800
 eyebrows i don't want to weight them any 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:48.620
 clear for no clear lines 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.099
 intense colors so i just 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.280
 I apply a light shade and I shade 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:58.789
 its to zero to leave only a hint 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.069
 I put on a lipstick a little transparent 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:08.870
 shine on the center of the lips and stretch it 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:11.719
 corners but makeup is ready hope it 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.419
 I hope you like it 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:16.430

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.990
