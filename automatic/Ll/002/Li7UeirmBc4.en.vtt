00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.160 
macronutrients their body needs to take
in<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.850> certain<00:01:51.450> amount<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.689> proteins

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
in a certain amount of proteins

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.990 
in a certain amount of proteins
carbohydrates<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:53.040> fats<00:01:53.130> every<00:01:53.729> one<00:01:53.880> is

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
carbohydrates and fats every one is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.149 
carbohydrates and fats every one is
different<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.290> you're<00:01:55.470> looking<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.860> put<00:01:56.009> on

mass<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.000> calculate<00:01:57.240> from<00:01:57.960> your

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
mass you have to calculate from your

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
said that right up it by 20% what that's

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.709 
said that right up it by 20% what that's
gonna<00:02:04.439> do<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:04.860> gonna<00:02:05.009> ensure<00:02:05.610> right<00:02:06.509> and

ingestible and you're gonna be more

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.819 
ingestible and you're gonna be more
susceptible<00:03:03.579> on<00:03:04.569> your<00:03:04.750> organs<00:03:05.319> because<00:03:05.650> it's

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
ingestible it's gonna go to your stomach

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.750 
ingestible it's gonna go to your stomach

and your liver and attack your organs

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.619 
and your liver and attack your organs
like<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.930> people<00:03:11.829> take<00:03:12.099> it<00:03:12.250> anyway<00:03:12.629> people

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
like so people take it anyway people

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.409 
like so people take it anyway people
take<00:03:13.780> cocaine<00:03:14.139> ro<00:03:14.409> and<00:03:14.560> whatever<00:03:15.180> people<00:03:16.180> take

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:16.419

everything

my<00:03:21.030> own<00:03:21.090> thing<00:03:21.390> about<00:03:21.600> anavar<00:03:22.020> is<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.530> think

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
my own thing about anavar is I think

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.440 
my own thing about anavar is I think
it's<00:03:22.920> pretty<00:03:23.370> much<00:03:23.490> stupid<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.180> you're<00:03:24.300> going

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
it's pretty much stupid if you're going

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.240 
it's pretty much stupid if you're going
to<00:03:24.690> take<00:03:24.900> steroids<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.530> might<00:03:25.710> as<00:03:25.830> well<00:03:25.950> do<00:03:26.130> it

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
to take steroids you might as well do it

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.920 
to take steroids you might as well do it
the<00:03:26.370> safer<00:03:26.760> way<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.090> just<00:03:27.240> take<00:03:27.510> straight

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
the safer way and just take straight

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.140 
the safer way and just take straight
tests<00:03:28.350> right<00:03:28.950> because<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.280> bypasses<00:03:30.000> your

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
tests right because that bypasses your

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.720 
tests right because that bypasses your
