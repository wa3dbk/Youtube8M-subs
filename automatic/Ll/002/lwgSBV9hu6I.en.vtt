but it just kind of like urged me in a

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.150 
but it just kind of like urged me in a
weird<00:06:02.260> way<00:06:02.350> I<00:06:02.590> don't<00:06:02.650> know<00:06:02.830> I<00:06:02.860> was<00:06:03.070> like

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
weird way I don't know I was like

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.279

watching<00:06:03.340> it<00:06:03.580> I<00:06:03.669> just<00:06:03.880> felt<00:06:04.060> like<00:06:04.180> really<00:06:04.900> like

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
thought they could have just done better

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.570 
thought they could have just done better
at<00:06:09.100> like<00:06:09.490> I<00:06:10.080> know<00:06:11.080> they<00:06:11.950> could<00:06:12.010> have<00:06:12.190> done<00:06:12.310> so

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
at like I know they could have done so

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.650
