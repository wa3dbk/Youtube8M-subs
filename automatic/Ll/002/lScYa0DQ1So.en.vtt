00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 why is it a little alcohol me 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.890
 am mike and today we make the green 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.890
 we so let's start let's go 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.380
 and so it will let us first see what 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.849
 we need this drink and it 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.620
 first from the french what we have is 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.560
 sports drink I have this at a certain 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.550
 supermarkets and these all bother 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.699
 labor market but after harm 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.430
 work but in addition it all a you as a 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.619
 super something also lemon and lime 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.480
 back hello I'm maybe wondering 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.859
 why has it been very nationwide 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.630
 well boersma most of the time and looked at the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.480
 and we also need food 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.129
 a cutting board and knife and cocktail shaker 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.280
 a matrix or lunch and an ulcer there 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.129
 the grass and he immediately came one 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.780
 drink and so we start with the siku 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.789
 Grab your lemon and cut it in half 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.920
 a few one out of 11 and then cut 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.170
 once more inside what on the side 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.059
 and again and again you 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 the other way then this is 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.899
 there is no k'nex that all three in the glass 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.760
 once you know what they drop 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.379
 then would also do it again with 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.750
 lime so grab your book stand too 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.619
 again by 11 and age there in three 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.720
 pieces 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.000
 lg if we hear squeezed in the glass 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.500
 and the builder of that was going to fall 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.330
 as limes and lemons is going 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.490
 then to the sports drink package 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.049
 measuring cup that I tell you about the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.460
 blue sport I go three spots to 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.409
 throw matrix the three times 1 2 3 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.420
 if those three shows and quincey go then 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.659
 we move on to the ah step and that 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.100
 had two shot in a week and then too 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.710
 to view the machines at a before 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.060
 had two thirds shop in a glass so that 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.920
 is about to here 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.210
 no matter how one is in and like these three 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.830
 I sit in Duncan and then we go there 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.440
 song about secrets 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.390
 double bit one in country no voice 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.190
 heavy but still want that taste 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.340
 and that's why I do a little less than 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.810
 teaspoons of curry low belong to it anyway 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.030
 a little bit of life day 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.130
 then do it with ice in a fix load 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.990
 you ca n't get it but it came 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.310
 not to have provided 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.600
 enough actually study what do the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.910
 an arch bar and syrah course 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.130
 no other hearing anything else is one 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:12.750
 problem because those seconds long marchena 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.880
 to be postema and to pin it 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.860
 they put glass in the middle and grab it 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:24.030
 we say the jump so much and so too 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.190
 see to caress beautiful green color and 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.380
 exactly and then you can people 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.060
 attribute to the side and bleached 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.320
 green house 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.760
 and then it's time for me to do this 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.530
 go to taste and still a little 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.850
 there are also small blood vessels there 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.920
 but one does not dominate 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.440
 none most aware of the nas or weather 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.269

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.890
