fuselage<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.120> on<00:00:09.270> this<00:00:09.420> side<00:00:09.860> we've<00:00:10.860> got<00:00:10.889> a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
fuselage and on this side we've got a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.780 
fuselage and on this side we've got a
couple<00:00:11.429> openings<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:13.160> what<00:00:14.160> I'm<00:00:14.250> gonna<00:00:14.370> do<00:00:14.610> is

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790

millimeter drill which is about the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.540 
millimeter drill which is about the
right<00:01:46.910> size<00:01:47.180> is<00:01:47.860> pretty<00:01:48.860> tight<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.160> can<00:01:49.400> go<00:01:49.520> a

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
right size is pretty tight you can go a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.060 
right size is pretty tight you can go a
slightly<00:01:49.850> larger<00:01:50.180> if<00:01:50.510> you<00:01:50.570> want<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:51.050> and<00:01:51.320> then

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
slightly larger if you want to and then

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.219 
slightly larger if you want to and then
I<00:01:52.160> use<00:01:52.340> Gorilla<00:01:52.670> Glue<00:01:52.910> to<00:01:53.060> put<00:01:53.240> these<00:01:53.390> in<00:01:53.690> wrap

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
I use Gorilla Glue to put these in wrap

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.540 
seat this in a wing and I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:03.229> and<00:02:03.440> let<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:03.710> drive<00:02:04.009> good<00:02:04.220> and<00:02:04.369> solid

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
ahead and let that drive good and solid

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.400 
ahead and let that drive good and solid
so<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.360> only<00:02:05.479> thing<00:02:05.660> what<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.930> do<00:02:06.080> over<00:02:06.380> here

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
so the only thing what to do over here

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.490 
so the only thing what to do over here
on<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.770> fuselage<00:02:07.280> would<00:02:08.000> be<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.509> drill<00:02:09.410> the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
on the fuselage would be to drill the

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.120 
on the fuselage would be to drill the
holes<00:02:09.709> for<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.490> mounting<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.780> wing<00:02:12.130> to

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
holes for the mounting of the wing to

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.150 
holes for the mounting of the wing to
tie<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.370> tail<00:02:13.640> down<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:14.890> just<00:02:15.890> throw<00:02:16.010> out<00:02:16.100> in

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
tie the tail down so just throw out in

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.040 
tie the tail down so just throw out in
these<00:02:16.220> two<00:02:16.459> locations<00:02:17.090> go<00:02:17.660> ahead<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:17.930> measure

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
these two locations go ahead and measure

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.360 
these two locations go ahead and measure
that<00:02:18.290> out<00:02:18.350> find<00:02:18.740> out<00:02:18.860> where<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.010> thickest

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
that out find out where the thickest

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.420 
that out find out where the thickest
part<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.570> fuselage<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:21.590> I'll<00:02:22.280> go

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
part in the fuselage is and I'll go

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.310 
part in the fuselage is and I'll go
ahead<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.670> drill<00:02:22.820> those<00:02:22.940> out<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.390> I'll

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
ahead and drill those out and I'll

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.970 
ahead and drill those out and I'll
probably<00:02:24.560> use<00:02:24.739> quarter<00:02:25.310> 20<00:02:25.700> or<00:02:26.230> 1032<00:02:27.230> screws<00:02:27.739> I

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
probably use quarter 20 or 1032 screws I

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.740 
probably use quarter 20 or 1032 screws I
use<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> nylon<00:02:28.700> ball<00:02:29.150> those<00:02:29.390> are<00:02:29.540> probably

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
use a nylon ball those are probably

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.199 
use a nylon ball those are probably
better<00:02:30.200> off<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.739> think<00:02:31.190> they're<00:02:31.459> quarter<00:02:31.820> 20s

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
better off I think they're quarter 20s

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.690 
better off I think they're quarter 20s
and<00:02:32.510> that'll<00:02:33.110> work<00:02:33.140> out<00:02:33.380> really<00:02:33.650> great<00:02:33.890> so

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
and that'll work out really great so

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.370 
and that'll work out really great so
there<00:02:34.910> anything<00:02:35.090> left<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.420> do<00:02:35.570> now<00:02:35.600> is<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.230> do

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
there anything left to do now is to do

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.610 
there anything left to do now is to do
the<00:02:36.590> canopy<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.700> cockpit<00:02:38.209> know<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.140> cowlings

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
the canopy and cockpit know the cowlings

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.680 
the canopy and cockpit know the cowlings
and<00:02:39.920> we're<00:02:40.580> pretty<00:02:40.850> much<00:02:41.060> ready<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.360> go<00:02:41.450> with

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
and we're pretty much ready to go with

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
with Gorilla Glue to hold those in place

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.260 
with Gorilla Glue to hold those in place
really<00:03:56.450> well<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.830> couple<00:03:58.100> of<00:03:58.250> 632<00:03:58.910> screws

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
really well and a couple of 632 screws

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.960 
really well and a couple of 632 screws
so<00:03:59.540> I<00:03:59.600> can<00:03:59.900> very<00:04:00.770> easily<00:04:00.980> make<00:04:01.130> this<00:04:01.430> removable

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
so I can very easily make this removable

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.840 
so I can very easily make this removable
a<00:04:02.660> couple<00:04:03.260> of<00:04:03.320> pieces<00:04:03.530> of<00:04:03.680> wood<00:04:03.950> pinned<00:04:04.610> and

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
a couple of pieces of wood pinned and

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.240 
a couple of pieces of wood pinned and
I'll<00:04:05.810> put<00:04:06.050> a<00:04:06.110> hole<00:04:06.320> through<00:04:06.350> here<00:04:06.830> and<00:04:06.980> another

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
I'll put a hole through here and another

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.490 
I'll put a hole through here and another
brass<00:04:07.550> insert<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.240> the<00:04:08.300> wing<00:04:08.510> so<00:04:09.200> all<00:04:09.350> it

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
brass insert and the wing so all it

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.860 
brass insert and the wing so all it
takes<00:04:09.740> is<00:04:10.040> one<00:04:10.370> little<00:04:10.400> screw<00:04:10.970> take<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.720> out

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
takes is one little screw take it out

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.430 
takes is one little screw take it out
and<00:04:12.110> I<00:04:13.100> can<00:04:13.340> take<00:04:13.550> it<00:04:13.670> out<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:13.940> off<00:04:14.120> MA<00:04:14.420> so<00:04:15.170> that

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
and I can take it out and off MA so that

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.710 
and I can take it out and off MA so that
will<00:04:15.530> make<00:04:15.650> it<00:04:15.830> very<00:04:15.860> accessible<00:04:16.600> next<00:04:17.600> you

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
will make it very accessible next you

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.490 
will make it very accessible next you
got<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:18.160> simulated<00:04:19.630> trim<00:04:20.630> pieces<00:04:20.900> for<00:04:21.380> the

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.660 
RCZ 56 and get this at your local hobby
store<00:04:37.400> it's<00:04:37.850> just<00:04:38.570> canopy<00:04:39.290> glue<00:04:39.500> a<00:04:39.770> very<00:04:40.280> light

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
store it's just canopy glue a very light

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.420 
store it's just canopy glue a very light
a<00:04:41.180> white<00:04:41.840> glow<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.230> it<00:04:42.350> dries<00:04:42.590> transparent

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
a white glow and it dries transparent

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.390 
a white glow and it dries transparent
when<00:04:44.090> I<00:04:44.290> apply<00:04:45.290> it<00:04:45.350> I'll<00:04:45.680> just<00:04:45.890> go<00:04:46.100> ahead<00:04:46.190> and

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
when I apply it I'll just go ahead and

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.940 
when I apply it I'll just go ahead and
trim<00:04:46.550> this<00:04:46.610> out<00:04:46.940> with<00:04:47.210> some<00:04:47.500> masking<00:04:48.500> tape<00:04:48.560> to

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
trim this out with some masking tape to

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.810 
trim this out with some masking tape to
catch<00:04:49.250> any<00:04:49.460> runoff<00:04:49.760> of<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.360> glue<00:04:51.050> as<00:04:51.260> a<00:04:51.290> strong

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
catch any runoff of the glue as a strong

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.060 
catch any runoff of the glue as a strong
so<00:04:52.820> I<00:04:52.880> don't<00:04:53.060> get<00:04:53.180> any<00:04:53.330> on<00:04:53.480> the<00:04:53.720> under<00:04:54.650> covering

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
so I don't get any on the under covering

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.190 
so I don't get any on the under covering
so<00:04:55.850> that's<00:04:56.240> kind<00:04:56.480> of<00:04:56.510> where<00:04:56.690> we<00:04:56.810> are<00:04:56.840> right<00:04:57.140> now

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
so that's kind of where we are right now

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.110 
so that's kind of where we are right now
just<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.950> couple<00:04:58.160> little<00:04:58.400> odds<00:04:58.669> and<00:04:58.880> ends<00:04:59.000> to

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
just a couple little odds and ends to

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.420 
just a couple little odds and ends to
finish<00:04:59.480> up<00:04:59.630> take<00:05:00.410> it<00:05:00.590> out<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.800> back<00:05:01.040> go<00:05:01.400> ahead

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
finish up take it out the back go ahead

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.210 
finish up take it out the back go ahead
and<00:05:01.580> run<00:05:01.790> a<00:05:01.820> few<00:05:02.210> things<00:05:02.480> of<00:05:02.690> fuel<00:05:03.260> throw<00:05:03.530> it<00:05:03.650> so

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
and run a few things of fuel throw it so

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.460 
and run a few things of fuel throw it so
the<00:05:04.430> motor<00:05:04.640> is<00:05:04.820> all<00:05:05.030> broken<00:05:05.450> in<00:05:05.720> and<00:05:05.930> running

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
the motor is all broken in and running

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.550 
the motor is all broken in and running
reliably<00:05:06.710> and<00:05:07.750> I'll<00:05:08.750> go<00:05:08.930> ahead<00:05:08.990> and<00:05:09.200> fly<00:05:09.350> and

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
reliably and I'll go ahead and fly and

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.710 
reliably and I'll go ahead and fly and
get<00:05:09.740> some<00:05:09.980> more<00:05:10.400> video<00:05:10.760> out<00:05:10.910> to<00:05:10.940> you<00:05:11.180> so<00:05:11.630> you

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
get some more video out to you so you

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.360 
get some more video out to you so you
can<00:05:11.840> see<00:05:11.960> how<00:05:12.140> well<00:05:12.350> this<00:05:12.440> flies<00:05:12.740> with<00:05:13.010> a<00:05:13.040> super

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
can see how well this flies with a super

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.030 
can see how well this flies with a super
target<00:05:13.730> 3000<00:05:14.419> is<00:05:14.900> that<00:05:15.140> indicated<00:05:15.650> you<00:05:15.860> can

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
target 3000 is that indicated you can

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.600 
target 3000 is that indicated you can
use<00:05:16.190> any<00:05:16.430> motor<00:05:16.700> from<00:05:17.419> like<00:05:17.630> a<00:05:17.950> 122<00:05:18.950> stroke<00:05:19.370> on

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
use any motor from like a 122 stroke on

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.790 
use any motor from like a 122 stroke on
up<00:05:19.880> to<00:05:20.180> a<00:05:21.400> 160<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:22.720> they<00:05:23.720> fly<00:05:23.960> ideal<00:05:24.410> they<00:05:24.590> did

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
up to a 160 and they fly ideal they did

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.900 
up to a 160 and they fly ideal they did
that<00:05:24.919> with<00:05:25.100> a<00:05:25.130> Messerschmitt

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
that with a Messerschmitt

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.719 
that with a Messerschmitt
I<00:05:25.940> also<00:05:26.419> did<00:05:26.780> that<00:05:26.930> with<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.320> p-51<00:05:28.190> Mustang

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
I also did that with the p-51 Mustang

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.090 
I also did that with the p-51 Mustang
great<00:05:29.600> performance<00:05:30.260> now<00:05:30.440> when<00:05:30.620> you<00:05:30.680> use<00:05:30.800> a<00:05:30.830> big

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
great performance now when you use a big

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.100 
great performance now when you use a big
engine<00:05:31.460> like<00:05:31.490> this<00:05:31.790> bear<00:05:32.510> in<00:05:32.660> mind<00:05:32.870> you're

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
engine like this bear in mind you're

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.150 
engine like this bear in mind you're
going<00:05:33.169> to<00:05:33.290> be<00:05:33.380> putting<00:05:33.620> a<00:05:33.740> little<00:05:33.860> bit<00:05:34.010> more

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
going to be putting a little bit more

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.950 
going to be putting a little bit more
weight<00:05:34.400> in<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:34.610> front<00:05:34.850> end<00:05:35.060> so<00:05:35.240> you're<00:05:35.840> going

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
weight in the front end so you're going

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.050 
weight in the front end so you're going
to<00:05:35.990> have<00:05:36.229> to<00:05:36.380> counter<00:05:36.830> that<00:05:36.979> to<00:05:37.610> maintain<00:05:38.030> a

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
to have to counter that to maintain a

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.710 
to have to counter that to maintain a
proper<00:05:38.330> balance<00:05:38.900> and<00:05:38.960> I<00:05:39.050> have<00:05:39.260> mine<00:05:39.470> set<00:05:39.500> at

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
proper balance and I have mine set at

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.840 
proper balance and I have mine set at
110<00:05:41.720> millimeters<00:05:42.620> so<00:05:43.160> I'll<00:05:43.250> probably<00:05:43.460> wind<00:05:43.700> up

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
110 millimeters so I'll probably wind up

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.340 
110 millimeters so I'll probably wind up
having<00:05:44.120> to<00:05:44.210> put<00:05:44.300> a<00:05:44.360> couple<00:05:44.600> of<00:05:44.720> ounces<00:05:44.870> in<00:05:45.260> the

having to put a couple of ounces in the
tail<00:05:45.590> along<00:05:46.370> with<00:05:46.580> the

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
tail along with the

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.409 
tail along with the
pack<00:05:47.599> to<00:05:47.750> make<00:05:47.960> sure<00:05:48.080> I<00:05:48.139> maintain<00:05:48.650> that<00:05:48.680> bounce

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
pack to make sure I maintain that bounce

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.119 
pack to make sure I maintain that bounce
balance<00:05:50.419> point<00:05:50.780> so<00:05:51.289> I<00:05:51.319> know<00:05:51.590> it's<00:05:51.830> going<00:05:51.949> to<00:05:52.039> be

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:52.129 
balance point so I know it's going to be

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:53.860 
balance point so I know it's going to be
a<00:05:52.159> little<00:05:52.370> bit<00:05:52.460> heavier<00:05:52.789> with<00:05:53.599> a<00:05:53.629> bigger

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
a little bit heavier with a bigger

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.409 
a little bit heavier with a bigger
engine<00:05:54.110> but<00:05:54.889> should<00:05:55.400> balance<00:05:55.610> out<00:05:55.909> nice<00:05:56.210> with

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
engine but should balance out nice with

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.570 
engine but should balance out nice with
all<00:05:56.539> that<00:05:56.689> power<00:05:56.900> so<00:05:57.379> it'll<00:05:58.370> be<00:05:58.490> an

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
all that power so it'll be an

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.249 
all that power so it'll be an
interesting<00:05:58.669> project<00:05:59.330> to<00:05:59.659> see<00:05:59.810> how<00:05:59.960> well<00:06:00.139> it

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:00.259 
interesting project to see how well it
