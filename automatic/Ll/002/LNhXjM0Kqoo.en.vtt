to hair loss but the base causes tend to

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.330 
to hair loss but the base causes tend to
always<00:00:36.640> stand<00:00:37.060> back<00:00:37.360> down<00:00:37.720> to<00:00:38.020> nutrition<00:00:38.680> so

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340

then<00:00:56.890> we<00:00:57.010> look<00:00:57.160> at<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.850> plant<00:00:58.390> that's

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
then we look at the plant that's

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.780 
then we look at the plant that's
extracting<00:00:59.860> the<00:01:00.010> minerals<00:01:00.370> from<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.670> soil

extracting the minerals from the soil

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.590 
extracting the minerals from the soil
the<00:01:01.540> plants<00:01:01.720> have<00:01:02.440> been<00:01:03.000> had<00:01:04.000> pesticides

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
the plants have been had pesticides

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.020 
the plants have been had pesticides
using<00:01:05.140> chemicals<00:01:05.740> and<00:01:06.040> different<00:01:06.640> types<00:01:06.850> of

using chemicals and different types of
things<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:07.450> they're<00:01:07.570> always<00:01:07.719> harvested<00:01:08.499> a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
things and they're always harvested a

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.380 
things and they're always harvested a
lot<00:01:08.740> quicker<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.369> then<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.759> processed<00:01:10.240> and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
lot quicker and then the processed and

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
packaged by the time they reach us we

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.120 
packaged by the time they reach us we
then<00:01:13.119> cook<00:01:13.420> them<00:01:13.600> so<00:01:14.350> by<00:01:14.469> the<00:01:14.560> time<00:01:14.740> you<00:01:14.950> eat

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
try and find the food which we're

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.980 
try and find the food which we're
talking<00:01:24.700> about<00:01:24.850> I<00:01:24.880> don't<00:01:25.000> include<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.720> plant

very to provide your minerals it's

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.370 
very to provide your minerals it's
really<00:01:28.120> difficult<00:01:28.330> because<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:28.960> have<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.260> go

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
really difficult because you have to go

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.430 
really difficult because you have to go
back<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:29.890> say<00:01:30.040> where<00:01:30.700> am<00:01:30.850> i<00:01:30.970> buying<00:01:31.230> food<00:01:32.230> from

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
back and say where am i buying food from

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.100 
back and say where am i buying food from
some<00:01:33.400> people<00:01:33.700> might<00:01:33.820> say<00:01:34.120> they<00:01:34.720> local

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
some people might say they local

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.500 
some people might say they local
supermarket<00:01:35.830> we<00:01:36.520> say<00:01:36.700> okay<00:01:36.940> we<00:01:37.060> need<00:01:37.300> to<00:01:37.420> go

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
supermarket we say okay we need to go

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.450 
supermarket we say okay we need to go
and<00:01:37.690> then<00:01:37.780> in<00:01:37.900> our<00:01:38.050> so<00:01:38.440> where<00:01:38.680> was<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.010> food

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
and then in our so where was the food

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.910 
and then in our so where was the food
grown<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:41.020> that's<00:01:41.140> really<00:01:41.350> difficult<00:01:41.590> to

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
grown and that's really difficult to

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.920 
grown and that's really difficult to
trace<00:01:42.160> that<00:01:42.190> if<00:01:42.970> we're<00:01:43.210> going<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.450> local

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
trace that if we're going to local

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.140 
trace that if we're going to local
farmers<00:01:44.380> markets<00:01:44.860> then<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.550> game<00:01:45.760> you<00:01:45.940> have

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
farmers markets then the game you have

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.290 
farmers markets then the game you have
to<00:01:46.180> say<00:01:46.740> what's<00:01:47.740> in<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.310> soil<00:01:48.760> so<00:01:49.090> it's<00:01:49.210> not

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
to say what's in the soil so it's not

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
just what we call organic farming it's

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.210 
just what we call organic farming it's
for<00:01:52.540> these<00:01:52.750> in<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.170> soil<00:01:53.440> where<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.890> plants

to a lot of other functions in the body
the<00:02:31.750> next<00:02:31.989> thing<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.200> essential<00:02:32.800> fatty<00:02:33.010> acids

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
the next thing is essential fatty acids

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.180 
the next thing is essential fatty acids
which<00:02:34.090> should<00:02:34.300> be<00:02:34.540> provided<00:02:35.170> by<00:02:35.410> plant<00:02:35.860> foods

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
which should be provided by plant foods

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.880 
which should be provided by plant foods
again<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.940> also<00:02:37.150> by<00:02:37.600> our<00:02:37.989> animal<00:02:38.620> through

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
again and also by our animal through

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.430 
again and also by our animal through
that<00:02:39.130> we<00:02:39.250> can<00:02:39.459> chew<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.390> how<00:02:40.660> is<00:02:40.900> ready<00:02:41.170> the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
that we can chew so how is ready the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.770 
that we can chew so how is ready the
grass<00:02:41.769> these<00:02:42.160> days<00:02:42.459> in<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.820> Sun<00:02:43.120> shines<00:02:43.420> for

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
grass these days in the Sun shines for

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.660 
grass these days in the Sun shines for
their<00:02:43.959> not<00:02:44.140> having<00:02:44.380> their<00:02:45.010> essential<00:02:45.489> fatty

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
their not having their essential fatty

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.340 
their not having their essential fatty
acids<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.239> therefore<00:02:46.600> when<00:02:46.720> we're<00:02:46.900> eating<00:02:47.050> the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
acids so therefore when we're eating the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.740 
acids so therefore when we're eating the
cow<00:02:47.530> all<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:47.890> byproducts<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.640> cows<00:02:48.910> we're<00:02:49.600> not

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
cow all the byproducts of cows we're not

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.930 
cow all the byproducts of cows we're not
getting<00:02:50.050> our<00:02:50.170> essential<00:02:50.620> fatty<00:02:50.800> acids<00:02:51.250> not<00:02:51.820> on

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
getting our essential fatty acids not on

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.910 
getting our essential fatty acids not on
the<00:02:52.030> fish<00:02:52.239> is<00:02:52.450> farmed<00:02:52.989> these<00:02:53.230> days<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.830> when

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
the fish is farmed these days and when

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.380 
the fish is farmed these days and when
you<00:02:54.010> look<00:02:54.160> at<00:02:54.280> what<00:02:54.459> is<00:02:54.550> plan<00:02:54.820> to<00:02:55.060> fish<00:02:55.209> is

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
you look at what is plan to fish is

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.610 
you look at what is plan to fish is
eating<00:02:55.810> it's<00:02:56.140> not

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
eating it's not

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.369 
eating it's not
natural<00:02:57.010> diets<00:02:57.430> for<00:02:57.610> therefore<00:02:58.379> essential

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
natural diets for therefore essential

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.009 
natural diets for therefore essential
fatty<00:02:59.590> acids<00:03:00.040> are<00:03:00.190> lacking<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:01.480> then<00:03:01.750> we<00:03:01.870> look

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
fatty acids are lacking and then we look

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.809 
fatty acids are lacking and then we look
at<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.290> vegetable<00:03:02.860> sources<00:03:03.159> because<00:03:03.430> the

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
at the vegetable sources because the

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.820 
at the vegetable sources because the
nuts<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.360> seeds<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.049> avocados<00:03:05.739> and

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
nuts and the seeds and the avocados and

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.680 
nuts and the seeds and the avocados and
vegetables<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.580> things<00:03:06.610> like<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.030> we<00:03:07.540> have

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
vegetables and things like that we have

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.750 
vegetables and things like that we have
to<00:03:07.840> then<00:03:07.989> go<00:03:08.200> back<00:03:08.409> to<00:03:08.519> where<00:03:09.519> are<00:03:09.670> the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
to then go back to where are the

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.670 
to then go back to where are the
minerals<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.420> soil<00:03:10.629> that<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.140> help<00:03:11.379> to

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
minerals in the soil that can help to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.680 
minerals in the soil that can help to
produce<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.310> essential<00:03:12.760> fatty<00:03:12.970> acids<00:03:13.450> so

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
produce the essential fatty acids so

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.930 
produce the essential fatty acids so
it's<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.379> long<00:03:14.620> long<00:03:15.010> journey<00:03:15.040> down<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.640> food

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
it's the long long journey down the food

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.410 
it's the long long journey down the food
chain<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.360> see<00:03:16.890> what<00:03:17.890> is<00:03:18.069> happening<00:03:18.519> in<00:03:18.730> yeah

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
chain to see what is happening in yeah

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.600 
chain to see what is happening in yeah
are<00:03:19.840> you<00:03:20.079> really<00:03:20.319> getting<00:03:20.709> what<00:03:21.159> you<00:03:21.280> think

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
are you really getting what you think

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.089 
are you really getting what you think
you're<00:03:21.790> getting<00:03:22.000> from<00:03:22.599> refrigerating<00:03:23.470> the

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
you're getting from refrigerating the

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.039 
you're getting from refrigerating the
next<00:03:24.340> one<00:03:24.489> we<00:03:24.640> want<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.120> is<00:03:25.269> our<00:03:25.420> vitamins

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
next one we want to is our vitamins

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.589 
next one we want to is our vitamins
again<00:03:26.370> extracted<00:03:27.370> from<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.730> variety<00:03:28.209> of<00:03:28.239> food

that were meant to eat the vitamins are

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.720 
that were meant to eat the vitamins are
not<00:03:31.870> only<00:03:32.140> work<00:03:32.379> as<00:03:32.590> precursors<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.280> most<00:03:33.609> of

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
not only work as precursors to most of

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.150 
not only work as precursors to most of
you<00:03:33.910> minerals<00:03:34.390> they<00:03:34.840> all<00:03:35.019> work<00:03:35.230> in<00:03:35.410> synergy<00:03:35.650> so

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
you minerals they all work in synergy so

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.220 
you minerals they all work in synergy so
this<00:03:36.310> is<00:03:36.340> just<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.730> chance<00:03:37.000> how<00:03:37.450> all<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:37.810> your

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
this is just a chance how all of your

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.470 
this is just a chance how all of your
fat<00:03:38.620> soluble<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.310> water-soluble<00:03:39.819> vitamins

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
fat soluble and water-soluble vitamins

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.690 
fat soluble and water-soluble vitamins
interact<00:03:41.049> in<00:03:41.319> your<00:03:41.470> body<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:42.370> if<00:03:42.430> you're<00:03:42.549> not

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
interact in your body so if you're not

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.729 
interact in your body so if you're not
getting<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.030> balance<00:03:43.480> of<00:03:43.720> all<00:03:43.959> of<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.230> bargains

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
getting a balance of all of the bargains

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.949 
getting a balance of all of the bargains
that<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:45.010> need<00:03:45.250> then<00:03:45.970> it<00:03:46.060> will<00:03:46.239> affect<00:03:46.659> the

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
that you need then it will affect the

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.890 
that you need then it will affect the
other<00:03:47.019> bardhaman<00:03:47.620> so<00:03:47.859> a<00:03:48.099> good<00:03:48.549> example<00:03:48.900> of

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
other bardhaman so a good example of

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.589 
other bardhaman so a good example of
that<00:03:49.959> is<00:03:50.409> I'm<00:03:51.129> deficiency<00:03:51.909> which<00:03:52.299> is<00:03:52.450> always

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
that is I'm deficiency which is always

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.949 
that is I'm deficiency which is always
related<00:03:52.870> to<00:03:53.290> vitamin<00:03:53.890> b12<00:03:54.549> b12<00:03:55.540> has<00:03:55.930> a

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
related to vitamin b12 b12 has a

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.869 
related to vitamin b12 b12 has a
synergistic<00:03:56.590> relation<00:03:57.129> with<00:03:57.340> all<00:03:57.609> of<00:03:57.790> the

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
synergistic relation with all of the

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.059 
synergistic relation with all of the
other<00:03:57.909> environments<00:03:58.690> so<00:03:59.260> therefore<00:03:59.709> if

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
other environments so therefore if

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.289 
other environments so therefore if
you're<00:04:00.220> not<00:04:00.280> getting<00:04:00.579> all<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.760> vitamins<00:04:00.910> from

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
you're not getting all the vitamins from

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.349 
you're not getting all the vitamins from
the<00:04:01.510> diet<00:04:01.720> will<00:04:02.169> affect<00:04:02.500> your<00:04:02.739> minerals<00:04:03.359> the

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
the diet will affect your minerals the

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.360 
the diet will affect your minerals the
environments<00:04:04.840> also<00:04:05.109> act<00:04:05.290> as<00:04:05.530> antioxidants

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
environments also act as antioxidants

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.509 
environments also act as antioxidants
and<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.930> antioxidants<00:04:08.739> combat<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.340> free

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
and the antioxidants combat the free

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.490 
and the antioxidants combat the free
radicals<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.419> if<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.660> don't<00:04:10.840> have<00:04:11.079> all<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.290> the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
radicals so if you don't have all of the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.379 
radicals so if you don't have all of the
vitamins<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.489> lot<00:04:12.639> of<00:04:12.760> these<00:04:12.849> functions

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
vitamins and a lot of these functions

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.390 
vitamins and a lot of these functions
also<00:04:14.349> not<00:04:14.950> working<00:04:15.209> so<00:04:16.209> in<00:04:16.570> a<00:04:16.630> nutshell

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
also not working so in a nutshell

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.949 
also not working so in a nutshell
basically<00:04:18.400> saying<00:04:18.639> all<00:04:18.910> of<00:04:19.090> these<00:04:19.269> nutrients

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
basically saying all of these nutrients

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.920 
basically saying all of these nutrients
are<00:04:20.079> needed<00:04:20.470> for<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.769> healthy<00:04:21.609> diet<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:22.599> provide

the body the essential things it needs

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.850 
the body the essential things it needs
for<00:04:24.970> your<00:04:25.270> immune<00:04:25.660> function<00:04:26.289> for<00:04:26.650> your<00:04:26.740> body

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
for your immune function for your body
