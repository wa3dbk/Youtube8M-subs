 hello everyone is welcome on 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.740
 a test point fr now we're going 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.670
 see 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:17.760
 the Greek alphabet so let's start with 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:22.289
 alvin that's his and no it's a 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:26.250
 tiny and that's the alphabet 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.970
 in uppercase so alva we know 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.309
 all is alpha that's how it is 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.440
 so it's written like that that's it 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.620
 alpha and uppercase 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.420
 it's the 1 we know but it's 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:47.730
 say alfa beta it's like that with 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:51.059
 a shot and that goes out here and we 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.180
 capital is the b we know but 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.770
 it is pronounced btan of ankama 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.520
 that's it and we capitalize it's a 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.690
 something like that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:08.689
 and like that and with a small stroke 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:13.200
 on your way from here to del in the lowercase 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:16.470
 it's like that and the capital 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.030
 it's the detail we all know 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:26.759
 so epsilon epsilon is that 1.3 to 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:32.220
 the upside and uppercase it's the wish 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.990
 we know this is the epsilon 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.810
 we know but it is pronounced 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:46.700

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:48.710
 capitalized to capital letters written and 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.009
 we capitalize these aids we know 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.680
