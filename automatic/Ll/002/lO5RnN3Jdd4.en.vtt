00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
like electronic music they will be a bit

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.070 
like electronic music they will be a bit
less<00:02:24.980> good<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.130> quality<00:02:26.250> for<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.240> music

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
less good in quality for the music

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.260 
less good in quality for the music
itself<00:02:28.440> but<00:02:29.070> for<00:02:29.460> everything<00:02:29.730> else<00:02:29.970> they're

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
itself but for everything else they're

little gap here in the corner where

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.890 
little gap here in the corner where

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
second take this longer hey when you

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.320 
second take this longer hey when you
have<00:03:24.690> those<00:03:25.050> on<00:03:25.380> your<00:03:25.560> head<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.940> ear

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
have those on your head and the ear

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.570 
have those on your head and the ear
actually<00:03:27.959> goes<00:03:28.260> inside<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:29.130> can<00:03:29.310> feel<00:03:29.550> that

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
actually goes inside you can feel that

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.360 
actually goes inside you can feel that
gap<00:03:30.350> touching<00:03:31.350> on<00:03:31.470> your<00:03:31.650> ear<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.070> hurts

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
gap touching on your ear and it hurts

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.270 
gap touching on your ear and it hurts
out<00:03:32.610> after<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> bit<00:03:33.510> but<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.769> think<00:03:35.130> it's

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
out after a bit but I I think it's

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.199 
out after a bit but I I think it's
because<00:03:35.430> they<00:03:35.790> made<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.330> US<00:03:36.930> inner<00:03:38.060> circle<00:03:39.060> a

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
because they made the US inner circle a

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.060 
because they made the US inner circle a
bit<00:03:39.360> too<00:03:39.630> small<00:03:40.550> and<00:03:41.930> yeah<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.500> can<00:03:43.530> avoid

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
bit too small and yeah you can avoid

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.110 
bit too small and yeah you can avoid
that<00:03:44.580> by<00:03:45.200> putting<00:03:46.200> them<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.530> bit<00:03:46.830> over<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.670> it

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
that by putting them a bit over and it

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.490 
that by putting them a bit over and it
further<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:50.060> forward<00:03:51.060> so<00:03:51.930> they<00:03:52.110> don't<00:03:52.320> touch

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
further a forward so they don't touch

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.550 
further a forward so they don't touch
inside<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.540> that's<00:03:54.540> still<00:03:54.900> great<00:03:55.140> it<00:03:55.350> works

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
inside and that's still great it works

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.830 
inside and that's still great it works
good<00:03:55.769> but<00:03:56.600> you<00:03:57.600> know<00:03:57.720> very<00:03:58.320> my<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.769> thing
