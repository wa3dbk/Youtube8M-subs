00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
want to see if I can keep the length

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.130 
want to see if I can keep the length
because<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.090> like<00:01:33.300> it<00:01:33.330> right<00:01:33.600> where<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:33.960> at

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
because I like it right where it's at

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.430 
because I like it right where it's at
right<00:01:34.350> now<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.810> my<00:01:36.960> first<00:01:37.230> time

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
right now so this is my first time

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.540 
right now so this is my first time
looking<00:01:37.920> at<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.310> I've<00:01:38.610> shaken<00:01:38.940> it<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:40.550> it's

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
looking at this I've shaken it and it's

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.980 
looking at this I've shaken it and it's
really<00:01:41.970> pretty<00:01:42.210> thick<00:01:43.190> so<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:45.510> me<00:01:45.659> that's<00:01:45.810> a

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
really pretty thick so to me that's a

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.340 
really pretty thick so to me that's a
good<00:01:46.140> sign<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.640> going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.110> keep<00:01:49.110> my

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
good sign that it's going to keep my

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.480 
good sign that it's going to keep my
very<00:01:49.740> brittle<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.940> weak<00:01:51.270> nails<00:01:53.960> strong<00:01:55.490> they

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
very brittle and weak nails strong they

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:12.230 
very brittle and weak nails strong they
really<00:01:56.790> took<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.030> beating<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.630> those<00:01:58.729> acrylics

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:20.480 

so<00:02:13.050> here's<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.980> finish<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:19.020> was<00:02:19.350> two<00:02:19.650> coats<00:02:20.010> of

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
so here's the finish it was two coats of

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.570 
so here's the finish it was two coats of
jelly<00:02:21.180> Sh<00:02:23.030> they're<00:02:24.030> soaked<00:02:24.990> off<00:02:25.230> gel<00:02:26.070> polish

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
jelly Sh they're soaked off gel polish

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.150 
jelly Sh they're soaked off gel polish
in<00:02:27.200> seafoam<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.810> that's<00:02:30.990> on<00:02:31.260> top<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
in seafoam so and that's on top of the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.600 
in seafoam so and that's on top of the
vitae<00:02:32.970> gel<00:02:34.460> recovery<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:37.310> they<00:02:38.310> definitely

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
vitae gel recovery and they definitely

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.630 
vitae gel recovery and they definitely
feel<00:02:39.570> they<00:02:39.960> definitely<00:02:40.320> are<00:02:40.650> stronger<00:02:41.220> like<00:02:41.490> I

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
feel they definitely are stronger like I

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.360 
feel they definitely are stronger like I
can't<00:02:41.910> bend<00:02:42.210> them<00:02:43.280> not<00:02:44.280> as<00:02:45.590> strong<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.920> guess<00:02:47.130> as

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
can't bend them not as strong I guess as

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.090 
can't bend them not as strong I guess as
acrylics<00:02:48.060> but<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:49.110> know<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.380> whole<00:02:49.410> point<00:02:49.890> is

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
acrylics but you know the whole point is

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.680 
acrylics but you know the whole point is
is<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.550> wanted<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.090> get<00:02:51.270> out<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.600> the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
is that I wanted to get out of the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.130 
is that I wanted to get out of the
kerlix<00:02:52.140> have<00:02:52.920> thinner<00:02:53.520> more<00:02:54.480> natural-looking
