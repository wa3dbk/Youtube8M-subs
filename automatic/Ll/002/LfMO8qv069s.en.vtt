now<00:00:07.140> let<00:00:07.290> me<00:00:07.319> show<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:07.560> how<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.710> do

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
now let me show you how to do

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.900 
now let me show you how to do
dimensional<00:00:08.370> math

pretty much you put in dimensions the

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.970 
pretty much you put in dimensions the
way<00:00:22.480> you<00:00:22.540> say<00:00:22.779> them<00:00:22.810> put<00:00:23.380> in<00:00:23.470> the<00:00:23.529> number<00:00:23.800> and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
way you say them put in the number and

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.140 
way you say them put in the number and
then<00:00:24.279> label<00:00:24.490> it<00:00:24.700> 12<00:00:25.000> feet<00:00:25.859> 7<00:00:26.859> inches<00:00:27.039> and<00:00:27.640> any

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
can back digits out one at a time so

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.790 
can back digits out one at a time so
let's<00:00:40.330> go<00:00:40.449> back<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:40.900> say<00:00:41.019> seven<00:00:41.350> sixteenths

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
and volume is enter it directly if you

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.339 
and volume is enter it directly if you
already<00:02:10.450> know<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:10.720> number<00:02:10.959> you<00:02:11.080> don't<00:02:11.170> have

already know the number you don't have

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.619 
already know the number you don't have
to<00:02:11.410> multiply<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:11.860> let's<00:02:12.310> say<00:02:12.489> 100<00:02:13.120> square<00:02:13.390> feet

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
to multiply it let's say 100 square feet

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.780 
to multiply it let's say 100 square feet
you<00:02:13.840> would<00:02:13.930> hit<00:02:14.020> feet<00:02:14.410> feet<00:02:15.099> see<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.459> now<00:02:15.580> says

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
you would hit feet feet see it now says

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.400 
you would hit feet feet see it now says
square<00:02:16.060> feet<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:17.140> can<00:02:17.260> now<00:02:17.349> start

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
square feet you can now start

one<00:02:19.360> more<00:02:19.540> time<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.990> goes<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.260> cubic<00:02:20.560> feet<00:02:20.710> for

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
one more time it goes to cubic feet for

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.140 
one more time it goes to cubic feet for
cubic<00:02:21.250> volume<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.670> then<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.820> can<00:02:21.940> come

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
cubic volume and then you can come

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.940 
cubic volume and then you can come
that<00:02:22.450> two<00:02:22.599> yards<00:02:22.989> or<00:02:23.140> whatever<00:02:23.590> else<00:02:23.799> you<00:02:23.920> want
