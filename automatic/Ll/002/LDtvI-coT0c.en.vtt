into the starter 12 hours later I had a
fly<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> problem<00:00:59.850> because<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.329> was<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> warm

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
fly a problem because this was a warm

summer<00:01:01.410> day<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:02.489> need<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.670> feed<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:05.220> we

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
summer day we need to feed it and we

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.130 
summer day we need to feed it and we
need<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:06.619> master<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:09.090> dried<00:01:09.360> surface<00:01:09.840> into

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
need to master the dried surface into

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.219 
need to master the dried surface into
the<00:01:10.170> mixture<00:01:10.909> one<00:01:11.909> part<00:01:12.180> rye<00:01:12.390> flour<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.990> one

the mixture one part rye flour on one
part<00:01:13.530> white<00:01:13.920> flour

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.030 

and<00:01:18.510> water<00:01:19.510> equal<00:01:20.200> parts

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.900 

mix<00:01:24.040> it<00:01:24.190> well<00:01:24.730> I<00:01:29.220> should<00:01:30.220> have<00:01:30.400> this<00:01:30.520> run

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
mix it well I should have this run

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:37.830 
mix it well I should have this run
Ethan's<00:01:31.290> consistency<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:37.270> leave<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.479> for

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
Ethan's consistency so we leave that for

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:49.360 
Ethan's consistency so we leave that for
another<00:01:37.930> 12<00:01:38.440> hours

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.399 

naturally<00:01:50.370> you<00:01:50.700> start<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.330> bubble<00:01:51.540> by<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
naturally you start to bubble by now and

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.480 
naturally you start to bubble by now and
that's<00:01:52.560> very<00:01:52.860> quickly<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:55.560> chew<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.100> two<00:01:56.310> days

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that's very quickly to chew the two days

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.610 
that's very quickly to chew the two days
is<00:01:56.760> one<00:01:57.120> to<00:01:57.270> two<00:01:57.420> days<00:01:57.660> that's<00:01:57.870> very<00:01:58.110> fast<00:01:58.410> but

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
is one to two days that's very fast but

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.570 
is one to two days that's very fast but
I'll<00:01:58.770> feed<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.220> so<00:01:59.400> it<00:02:00.530> once<00:02:01.530> more<00:02:01.830> so<00:02:02.369> it'll

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
I'll feed it so it once more so it'll

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.850 
I'll feed it so it once more so it'll
grow<00:02:02.729> back

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
grow back

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.800 
grow back
this<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.610> out<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.090> made<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.300> hot<00:02:06.510> summer

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
this is this out of I made a hot summer

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.160 
this is this out of I made a hot summer
day

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
day

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.020 
day
so<00:02:07.320> that's<00:02:07.650> why<00:02:07.830> it's<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.160> fast<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.729> winter

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
so that's why it's so fast in the winter

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.010 
so that's why it's so fast in the winter
take<00:02:09.450> up<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.840> week<00:02:11.450> where<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.510> just<00:02:12.720> need<00:02:12.870> to

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
take up to a week where you just need to

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:21.440 
take up to a week where you just need to
do<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:13.320> process<00:02:14.090> every<00:02:15.090> 12<00:02:15.390> hours<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:20.450> 12

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
do this process every 12 hours so 12

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.250 
do this process every 12 hours so 12
hours<00:02:21.630> later<00:02:22.459> it's<00:02:23.459> very<00:02:23.880> nice<00:02:24.180> fluffy<00:02:24.989> and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
hours later it's very nice fluffy and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.860 
hours later it's very nice fluffy and
foamy<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:28.160> just<00:02:29.160> leave<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.730> for<00:02:30.030> another<00:02:30.540> 12

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
foamy I just leave it for another 12

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.070 
foamy I just leave it for another 12
hours<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:33.390> now<00:02:33.989> it's<00:02:34.200> done<00:02:35.209> that's<00:02:36.209> really<00:02:36.450> not

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
hours so now it's done that's really not

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.300 
hours so now it's done that's really not
much<00:02:37.260> more<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.709> do<00:02:37.860> with<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:42.980> just<00:02:43.980> have<00:02:44.190> to

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
much more to do with this just have to
