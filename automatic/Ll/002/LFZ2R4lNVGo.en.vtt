00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hi guys welcome to another video 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.210
 more of ingenio trastero today is thiago 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.360
 ribera or santiago river 30 anyone 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.740
 the 2 thiago rivers to the microphone and today 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.960
 is going to show you these two excellent 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.910
 mod that I have found the most 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.920
 first let's see a micro re 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.410
 review to tell you that it's real 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.760
 craft and power craft we are going to enter 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.310
 as light for this map that is 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.439
 nice has nothing and boys ready 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.580
 these two things that see here that it's time 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.859
 of people this is real craft we are going to 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.120
 power, as the name says 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.190
 real we are going to have a quantity 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.890
 Improved from different rails 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.239
 combinations 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.660
 and because we are going to use craft with power 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.949
 craft because this type of combination 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.530
 for those of us who like to finish and do 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.480
 giant size mines and take out 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.480
 resources quickly or automatically 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.309
 we will be able to do this with king craft and 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.920
 power cat power that spoke that makes us 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.180
 is that we are going to be able to use this power 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.159
 will be guiding a lot so I have the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.510
 server open and I have other things going 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.570
 to change the ingenuity here but it's going to 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.400
 buy computer yes gentlemen we are going to 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.920
 buy good computer I want them 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.220
 show when we launch something the 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.750
 this power craft automatically the 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.200
 conveyor belt is going to take it 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.750
 just like if we got it to have or 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.520
 power work 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.520
 just like if we had it to have 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.079
 with one of these three that can be done 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.270
 you can place conveyor belts 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.850
 on the sides we can also put a 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.479
 chest and take things out of the chest very 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.479
 similar to him 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.680
 will craft and industrial craft but 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.130
 this is more of construction this is this 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.929
 well in if this one assimilates more to what 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.570
 which is an industry itself or how 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.070
 work the big industries or 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.380
 Business 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.990
 As I tell you, the mold is great now 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.040
 says that this is the final chapter 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:03.030
 of the download we install we are going to 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.030
 start with the revisions 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.310
 but many that I saw I had to pass the 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.460
 video of some things and what he wants 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.740
 do 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.650
 weird that they do not call him doing something like 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.420
 I told them they can place chests and they can 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.640
 make the chest leave the tape 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.430
 conveyor things there are elevators 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.890
 wait I look for there are elevators these 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.230
 are the elevators descend and elevator 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.060
 and descend saab down we can do that 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.180
 the items go up or down then let's say 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.490
 our this is a train those who have 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.380
 seen how the tunnels build this 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.730
 build tunnels, it's just that 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.250
 let's place and proceed to build 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.350
 tunnels the size that we need it 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.070
