00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.920
 rare tumors at the center of attention of the fifteenth lion king of Italy 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.170
 on the dresser and group we talk about it with all the farmhouse that runs the Italian network 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.149
 of rare tumors 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.149
 all home feeds what the rare tumor network is 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:21.130
 the network of rare tumors and a clinical collaboration 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.529
 so it's a network of clinicians 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.319
 in reality of different situations an Italian color gt 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:28.759
 who collaborate 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.759
 on clinical cases of tumors 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.670
 how many are you how to tune tv 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.909
 are several dozen 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.049
 of Italian clinical centers that are kings 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.180
 who collaborate within the network 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.010
 are actually more than 100 right now there are obviously some 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.570
 who work more 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.930
 Network 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.510
 hey for each of these centers there is at least one clinician who acts as a referent 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.160
 for the network but often there are groups 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.670
 and multidisciplinary within each institution that face 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.340
 as such it is the rai 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.650
 here are the rare tumors you are dealing with, some examples 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.270
 basically rare tumors 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.310
 I'm 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.510
 hd 3tb there are pediatric tumors that are all rare 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.700
 there are hematological tumors, the part of which is here 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.400
 was 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.020
 and then there are the adult solid tumors 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.870
 timetables 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.130
 which are most of them are 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.910
 we do not take into account that altogether all the rare tumors 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.930
 according to how you define them but in any case they are at least 10 20 percent 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.310
 of new cancer cases so this means that 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.670
 rare tumors are not uncommon 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.880
 as a whole they are rare individually but therefore they are 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.070
 not just an ethical problem because of course the patient with cancer 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.409
 must not be discriminated against may even have a problem socially want 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.250
 say quantitatively important 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.560
 and that clinical point of view such problems are rare tumors 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.130
 but the problem of rare tumors essentially 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.739
 an expert fault write with 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:17.840
 because naturally the expertise 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.079
 on rare tumors and more difficult to find 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.980
 in the territory compared to the isa experts on frequent tumors the main one 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:31.269
 problem of the patient with rare tumor is where I have to go ie where 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.499
 I can find a center with experience in my cancer 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.879
 and with your boston network as a target, assistance is offered to 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:41.869
 sick people 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:46.099
 the goal is to share clinical cases and then to improve 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.639
 the quality of care through the sharing of expert screeners 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.949
 which is found in the territory but not necessarily not only 100 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.409
 so basically the goal is to improve the quality of care 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:05.030
 at the same time succeeding attracted by the patient near where he lives 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:10.510
 should improve the quality of care at the same time should 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.700
 reduce health migration that is a major problem especially for the 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.589
 rare disease 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:18.639
 here there is a frequent comparison between the various centers that in jargon is 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.799
 call second opinion because it 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.870
 yes but it is not a matter of episodic opinion 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.419
 is a second opinion that occurs within a collaboration 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.419
 continuous between two +100 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:36.029
 so this means that everyone in the network grows inside the 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:39.779
 network therefore there is a virtuous circuit of quality improvement 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.409
 which certainly is in the single second spinning mill 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.900
 its founding moment but we must imagine a series of second opinions 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.719
 they are many patients and therefore an overall cultural growth of the whole network 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:57.129
 here it is verbose I must say first of all to collaborate on a personal level but 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.139
 also requires 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.619
 I think a big one 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:04.359
 technological network of technological infrastructures as a site 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.429
 realized on this point of view 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:11.359
 today the technology of collaborative networks is a lot 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.189
 once the attachment was the first pioneering attempts were 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:20.369
 today they seem very far away today we all will have so it is not difficult 

00:04:20.369 --> 00:04:22.490
 technologically collaborate 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.199
 it is what we ask and in effect to health facilities simply 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.300
 internet access through a pc 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:35.460
 in reality we certainly have a software platform on a software level a little 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.729
 sophisticated 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.689
 also and above all to correspond to the 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:44.279
 ok to regulatory requirements for example for the protection of recipe data 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:48.439
 for that partition for about 15 years what are the main achievements 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:49.660
 pc searches 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.630
 that you have completed this period of time 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.599
 but I would say to you at least on some rare tumors in particular sarcomas 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.969
 we have made the sharing 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.580
 at this point of thousands of clinical cases 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.349
 in Italy over the years 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.809
 here is the triple tool prison your goals that projects you have in mind 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.110
 the idea the dream is that what has been a project so far 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:24.129
 come to become a permanent resource of the national health system 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:28.309
 this is why the network is the project of the network right now in you 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:31.550
 hands of the conference state regions 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.159
 is deciding there has already been a favorable opinion of the assessors is deciding 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:39.800
 if buying the net there is the network could become a tool 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.099
 directly 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:44.379
 ok let's say owned 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:45.639
 of the regions 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.860
 each region contributes to maintaining the financing of the network 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.380
 and therefore the network also becomes a potentially exposed project 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:59.039
 to the risk to close again but a permanent resource of the sanitary system as 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:05:59.919
 was a hospital
