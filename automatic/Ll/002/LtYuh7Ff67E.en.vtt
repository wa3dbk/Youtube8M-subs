00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.390
 hi all friends appvideoreview can't handle the pooh they are ovid 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.869
 today I want to show you what will be the novelties from the four signature egg. 2 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.869
 then I installed the beta 3 on my aifon 4 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.560
 and I can tell you that the battery consumption is say at level 4. 1 - 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.849
 quite good 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.649
 and for the rest there is on the phone the state is absolutely unalterable 4. 1 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.419
 let's see what the functions are 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.080
 let's start from eprint 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.790
 air print a white plains printing service 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.680
 and that it will be possible to use directly from our help and print 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.980
 images little word page 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.210
 by clicking on this print button we will be able to choose the printer that 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.050
 will have to be a compatible printer then a conceptual printer st 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.920
 integrated 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.360
 does not work with sharing as an estimate of costs x so how to see none 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.610
 printer found even though I shared one we give the left drug 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.360
 so you will have to buy a printer with 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.579
 Conci can explain it if you want 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.710
 use this function 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.090
 we can obviously choose the number of copies 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.090
 and once finished creamy print 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.720
 the laces see this item is also within the browser 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.170
 by clicking on this rustic house that used to be the most 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.600
 immediately after sticcon first because it prints 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.650
 since we are the broswer I want to show 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.660
 novelty of search in the pages because perugia typing a word I want 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.520
 look for tg1 in this case 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.770
 to slide it down like this 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.310
 we will find mocking corsair in this page finds tg1 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.590
 we understand each other 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.290
 and we see that all the words in this case will be highlighted in yellow 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.290
 fast with those words that we are looking for in us 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.310
 as of the lower pea status it will come 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.870
 in the modified extras it is possible to go ahead with results 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.920
 or 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.619
 click on end to return a normal navigation bar 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.389
 The time of the hypotheses we women settings 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.369
 let's start with sounds 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:16.309
 the first novelty is the possibility of deactivating the policy of history 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:17.729
 with the volume keys 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.069
 for example, now I have lost a fool 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.340
 and as you can see if I in the springboard and click on the volume keys 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:30.000
 will be modified to rubella as it happens to defoult normally in any anfo 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.659
 the firmware 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.109
 instead they deactivate the stations 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.749
 and exiting the year from the settings application 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.719
 if I try to amplify the volume as you see, the writing on will not appear 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.319
 average 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.389
 but not too much arguing with me within the applications that 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.709
 take advantage of phone sound 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.999
 this function came very useful especially for those who make problems 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.999
 and that maybe I'll kill you family 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:57.769
 only one do not vote 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.409
 introduction of new ringtones in text messages 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.089
 let me hear some 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:05.089
 photo 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:17.049
 Hello 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.049
 me 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.099
 I'm a little too long rsna reports a text message but anyway 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.479
 therefore they are not ugly 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.469
 it's up to you the choice as you see are also divided into new ones and it's who it is 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.389
 original 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.389
 and we can also choose no story 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.579
 in addition, the note option has been added 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.559
 within the settings we can then choose the note strength e 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.479
 obviously the singing of defolt 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.939
 I'll show you some free photos I set this good 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.549
 Let's check 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.549
 as you can see there is this particular door 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.239
 now let's try to change we put helvetica 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:07.149
 and how do you see different photo than before 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.759
 watch over even the last uses 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:14.059
 ediltutto 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:18.209
 this is the original font of the previous film ur401 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.650
 death Note 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.360
 ok another life 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.360
 entry of restrictions 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.080
 within the settings have been enriched 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.439
 has been inserted the possibility of satirical installation which I am from 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:36.900
 epilation e 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.099
 multiplayer and the possibility of adding friends also in the center 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:47.110
 about yesterday center I want to show you a little novelty introduced in 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.639
 appstore for example looking for a game 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.639
 compatible origin center in this case enigmo 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.610
 as you can see 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.969
 here this little teen center logo appears 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.529
 is that we will confirm this lumen center compatible application 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.480
 as you can also see the religion of the vowels changing slightly now 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.310
 different is blue 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.270
 instead in the red 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.270
 and another thing I wanted to show images 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.330
 is the possibility of 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
 make a video promoter 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.490
 on Youtube. 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.020
 first in hd but this is a function has already been added from 401 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.680
 you want to see this the possibility of setting up a video as an audience 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.599
 not listed or private 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.669
 this function was not present before the firmware 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.450
 well I think I showed you everything 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:55.100
 I repeat that this is a beta version so it is absolutely not heard 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.960
 from bank 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.349
 the official exit should be around 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:01.999
 in early November - November 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:07.330
