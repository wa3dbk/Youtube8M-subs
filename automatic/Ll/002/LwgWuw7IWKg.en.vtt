00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
going through these sort of caverns and

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.090 
going through these sort of caverns and
you've<00:01:00.359> got<00:01:00.539> these<00:01:00.690> insectoid<00:01:01.620> creatures

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you've got these insectoid creatures

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.910 
you've got these insectoid creatures
coming<00:01:02.370> at<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.879> got<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.120> shoot<00:01:03.300> them<00:01:03.510> down

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920
