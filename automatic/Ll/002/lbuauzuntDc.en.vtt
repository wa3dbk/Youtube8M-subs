uses them they all just use their
secondary<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.680> course<00:01:16.950> when<00:01:17.220> they're<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
secondary of course when they're like a

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.899 
secondary of course when they're like a
certain<00:01:18.299> distance<00:01:18.740> they're<00:01:19.740> gonna<00:01:19.890> use<00:01:20.250> their

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
certain distance they're gonna use their

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.600 
certain distance they're gonna use their

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
primary but for all god this is a bad

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.899 
primary but for all god this is a bad
idea<00:01:24.259> but<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.530> most<00:01:25.710> part<00:01:25.860> people<00:01:26.460> just

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
idea but for the most part people just

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.429 
idea but for the most part people just
kind<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.210> run<00:01:27.420> around<00:01:27.509> with<00:01:27.840> their<00:01:27.960> secondary

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
kind of run around with their secondary

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.740 
kind of run around with their secondary
and<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.799> course<00:01:29.009> there's<00:01:29.610> situations<00:01:29.820> where

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and of course there's situations where

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.910 
and of course there's situations where
secondaries<00:01:31.650> are<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.829> good<00:01:32.040> idea<00:01:33.710> but<00:01:34.710> look<00:01:34.829> at

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
secondaries are a good idea but look at

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.990 
secondaries are a good idea but look at
that<00:01:35.040> that's<00:01:35.159> exactly<00:01:35.579> what<00:01:35.759> I'm<00:01:35.850> talking

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that that's exactly what I'm talking

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.069 
that that's exactly what I'm talking
about<00:01:36.270> perfect<00:01:36.780> example<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.740> guy<00:01:38.600> it's<00:01:39.600> not

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
about perfect example this guy it's not

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.569 
about perfect example this guy it's not
always<00:01:40.439> good<00:01:41.899> to<00:01:42.899> use<00:01:43.110> your<00:01:43.530> primary<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.399> not

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
always good to use your primary it's not

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.039 
always good to use your primary it's not
always<00:01:44.729> good<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.030> use<00:01:45.149> your<00:01:45.270> secondary<00:01:45.810> but

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
always good to use your secondary but

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.350 
always good to use your secondary but
people<00:01:46.470> definitely<00:01:46.710> seem<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.369> rely<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:48.090> their

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
people definitely seem to rely on their

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.710 
people definitely seem to rely on their
secondary<00:01:48.960> way<00:01:49.860> more<00:01:50.399> than<00:01:50.729> they<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:50.939> their

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720

god-knows-where trying to kill me with
that<00:07:17.610> weapon<00:07:17.910> instead<00:07:18.180> of<00:07:18.390> switching<00:07:18.930> to<00:07:19.170> your

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.290

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:27.750 
to use their primary more and use their

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.440 
to use their primary more and use their
secondary<00:07:28.380> when<00:07:29.310> it<00:07:29.430> is<00:07:29.520> appropriate<00:07:29.790> to<00:07:30.150> do

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.450
