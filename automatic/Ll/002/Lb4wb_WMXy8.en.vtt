00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.850
 all the same 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.599
 Internet communication is a great power after 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.370
 conversations online with his countryman with 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:19.260
 Altai region Andrew the power of Kosiha 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:22.920
 Allison Solovyov Hi He showed 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.080
 video about how he pulls frames on 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.890
 wire frame 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.869
 using such a crank two pads with 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.610
 the holes between which 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.180
 the coil is installed this knob 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.610
 knob 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.200
 has so tetrahedral same as 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.590
 coil hole sold with 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.590
 breakdown 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.969
 you can rotate set know 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.970
 shook wheelbarrows helped 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.970
 because then they did 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.560
 in essence, the process is almost ready 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.010
 take a frame 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.230
 as limiters look for me to visit 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:24.930
 to food without walking we take the wire pulling 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.930
 here exactly as shown Andrew 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:39.940
 it's a kind of report that him and 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:42.220
 live and win but I didn't 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.910
 izgylyatsya two holes later I'll be there 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.290
 do while cooking which is the framework 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.390
 by the way, only the nozzle will have to be too 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.050
 make to drill hole they 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.050
 ancient aetsya 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.220
 the process has begun 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.500
 here's a frame turned out to be stretched 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.110
 the only thing here 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.780
 the wire cuts very well into 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.190
 the wood can be seen as it will continue 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.260
 I think that's okay anyway 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.269
 you can even one-time so probably 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.269
 it is very good and very comfortable
