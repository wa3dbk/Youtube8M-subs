00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:05.339
 I have nothing for the results like 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.649
 arrived in the sense that arrived 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.050
 through praise he always has a friend 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.240
 of the sultanate disappointing point of view 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.540
 the boys compartment in front of face between 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.880
 fielded everything they had 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.090
 recovered these concern critical 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.090
 of the newspaper 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.740
 the reader beyond the episodes that it is 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.210
 important however sliding though so 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.160
 frail mentally de corato in the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.169
 team that starts well what 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.210
 it seemed that instead the light for good 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:39.460
 part of the game 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.110
 yes even if I have to honestly tell you the 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.519
 parties have been more matches since 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.989
 we often play football after the 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.030
 manifest funding until it is 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.230
 all the question came but the city 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.290
 they are not there to play the game 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.350
 usual those game that so on zeman 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.210
 according to every holy day in which certain 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.290
 invented the time has changed by 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.940
 condition 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.830
 has become another party started in 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.990
 which one still counts the ball is not true 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.580
 that I 'm really both about what it is 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.280
 success that there have been among other things 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.720
 absolutely national for luck of 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.000
 how it went on up to 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.510
 I must not say it is the case maybe yes 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.510
 red team 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.520
 really 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.850
 ends weakened 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.850
 Yup 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.320
 let's face it 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.420
 for behavioral case 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.440
 then 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.730
 I do what the holidays to say yes 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:45.740
 second time launched and then at the end 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:48.370
 there is no network 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.310
 nothing that any error a mistake 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.290
 the team, however, is struggling for lire 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.210
 best wanted as you of the question 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.800
 this is almost the first theme I sincerely 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.810
 just to write me too and also 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.060
 because I talked to me that I saw 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.520
 he had faced me the match he saw 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.540
 how strongly a pool had celebrated 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.060
 the goal of lamela 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.550
 so this I took off with 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.560
 the field from here any idea but 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.610
 I would like a subsequent management 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.420
 January to this as a gesture 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.340
 volunteer 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.500
 nothing a clear gesture that put us 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.660
 in trouble but it certainly wasn't 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.760
 a gesture is then a specialist 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.989
 unintentionally believed for a moment in the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.930
 that maybe if not that it amalgamates 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.190
 due to the fact that he wanted to 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.560
 desperate to match this game 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.230
 forward he lost a ball he wanted to 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.290
 all new to be able to hit it and you are 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.750
 freed energetically from the maio 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.370
 shuffle we can say a thousand times but 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.870
 certainly the director of Rome is bad 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.110
 will apply the super ethical code ie 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.990
 Rome has a code that includes a minus 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.130
 good boy 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.390
 she is the difference between these episodes 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.850
 to know if he heard the president 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.850
 I heard what Pallotta said
