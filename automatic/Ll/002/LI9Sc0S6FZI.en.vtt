00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the eyelash curler and supposedly then

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.459 
the eyelash curler and supposedly then
you<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:43.140> curl<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:43.829> lashes<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.940> apply<00:00:45.469> your

you can curl your lashes and apply your

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.010 
you can curl your lashes and apply your
eyeliner<00:00:46.680> at<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.520> same<00:00:47.850> time<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.629> think

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
eyeliner at the same time I think

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.380 
eyeliner at the same time I think
there's<00:00:49.289> probably<00:00:49.590> about<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.890> 2%<00:00:50.730> chance<00:00:50.820> that

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
there's probably about a 2% chance that

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.389 
there's probably about a 2% chance that
this<00:00:51.510> will<00:00:51.719> actually<00:00:52.350> work<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.890> look<00:00:53.129> at<00:00:53.250> how

neat<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.750> most<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.199> time<00:00:55.410> my

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
neat that is most of the time my

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.069 
neat that is most of the time my
eyeliner<00:00:55.980> doesn't<00:00:56.370> turn<00:00:56.730> out<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:56.940> good<00:00:57.570> like
