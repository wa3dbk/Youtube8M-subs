managers<00:00:44.699> from<00:00:45.699> my<00:00:45.820> computer<00:00:46.149> I<00:00:46.210> use<00:00:46.390> the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
managers from my computer I use the

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:54.750 
managers from my computer I use the
32-bit<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:49.090> just<00:00:49.269> run<00:00:49.480> that<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:53.460> then<00:00:54.460> wait

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
32-bit so just run that and then wait

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.599 
32-bit so just run that and then wait
for<00:00:54.789> it<00:00:55.089> -<00:00:55.660> I<00:00:55.690> just<00:00:56.050> slowed<00:00:56.289> up<00:00:56.469> see<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.190> pop-up

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
for it - I just slowed up see the pop-up

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.880 
for it - I just slowed up see the pop-up
screen<00:00:57.879> so<00:00:58.420> on<00:00:58.780> this<00:00:58.929> screen<00:00:59.230> you'll<00:00:59.440> see<00:00:59.469> that

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
screen so on this screen you'll see that

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.400 
screen so on this screen you'll see that
uh<00:01:00.239> I'm<00:01:01.239> not<00:01:01.690> going<00:01:01.809> to<00:01:01.870> do<00:01:01.989> it<00:01:02.079> this<00:01:02.199> time

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
uh I'm not going to do it this time

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.590 
uh I'm not going to do it this time
because<00:01:02.559> of<00:01:03.100> course<00:01:03.579> I<00:01:03.879> already<00:01:04.239> have<00:01:04.360> it<00:01:04.510> on

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
because of course I already have it on

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.399 
because of course I already have it on
but<00:01:05.470> you<00:01:06.220> would<00:01:06.340> go<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.549> add<00:01:06.939> and<00:01:07.299> you<00:01:08.259> would

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
but you would go to add and you would

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.940 
but you would go to add and you would
add<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.590> file<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:10.630> isn't<00:01:10.990> an<00:01:11.049> ISO<00:01:11.439> format<00:01:11.710> so

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
add a file that isn't an ISO format so

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.289 
add a file that isn't an ISO format so
what<00:01:12.070> we're<00:01:12.280> doing<00:01:12.310> here<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:12.850> we're<00:01:13.030> putting

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
what we're doing here is we're putting

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.109 
what we're doing here is we're putting
it<00:01:13.509> into<00:01:13.689> ISO<00:01:14.170> format<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.610> you<00:01:15.670> would<00:01:16.090> just

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
it into ISO format so you would just

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.160 
it into ISO format so you would just
look<00:01:16.360> it<00:01:17.369> through<00:01:18.369> your<00:01:18.579> downloads<00:01:19.170> select

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
look it through your downloads select

look it through your downloads select
your<00:01:20.470> file<00:01:20.649> that<00:01:20.680> you've<00:01:21.070> downloaded<00:01:21.250> through

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
your file that you've downloaded through

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.830 
your file that you've downloaded through
a<00:01:21.820> torrent<00:01:22.329> or<00:01:22.720> whatnot<00:01:23.189> whatever<00:01:24.189> you<00:01:24.340> got<00:01:24.549> it

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
a torrent or whatnot whatever you got it

a torrent or whatnot whatever you got it
and<00:01:25.840> just<00:01:26.200> go<00:01:26.649> ahead<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:26.979> flip<00:01:27.250> that<00:01:27.360> if<00:01:28.360> you

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
and just go ahead and flip that if you

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.289 
and just go ahead and flip that if you
did<00:01:28.720> you<00:01:29.469> will<00:01:29.619> pop<00:01:30.490> up<00:01:30.520> right<00:01:30.790> around<00:01:30.969> here

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
did you will pop up right around here

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.539 
did you will pop up right around here
underneath<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.170> game<00:01:32.320> ID<00:01:32.530> they'll<00:01:32.979> select<00:01:33.250> it

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
underneath the game ID they'll select it

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.450 
underneath the game ID they'll select it
and<00:01:34.360> then<00:01:34.570> what<00:01:34.689> you'll<00:01:34.840> do<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.259> you'll<00:01:36.219> go

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
and then what you'll do is you'll go

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.940 
and then what you'll do is you'll go
into<00:01:38.729> transfer<00:01:40.229> click<00:01:41.229> transfer<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:41.860> you'll

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
into transfer click transfer and you'll

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.760 
into transfer click transfer and you'll
go<00:01:42.100> down<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.490> ISO<00:01:42.969> because<00:01:43.149> that's<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.780> that's

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
go down to ISO because that's the that's

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.679 
go down to ISO because that's the that's
what<00:01:44.920> we<00:01:45.039> want<00:01:45.280> in<00:01:45.369> them<00:01:45.490> we<00:01:45.670> want<00:01:45.909> it<00:01:46.000> in<00:01:46.180> as<00:01:46.390> an

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
what we want in them we want it in as an

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.969 
what we want in them we want it in as an
ISO<00:01:47.170> image<00:01:47.500> so<00:01:48.310> it'll<00:01:48.520> look<00:01:48.640> like<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:49.180> CD<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.860> go

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
ISO image so it'll look like a CD so go

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.789 
ISO image so it'll look like a CD so go
ahead<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.280> close<00:01:51.399> that<00:01:51.640> off<00:01:51.670> there<00:01:52.770> both<00:01:53.770> of

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
ahead and close that off there both of

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.279 
ahead and close that off there both of
the<00:01:54.100> windows<00:01:54.399> and<00:01:54.700> then<00:01:55.600> what<00:01:55.780> we'll<00:01:55.930> do<00:01:56.079> is

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
the windows and then what we'll do is

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.219 
the windows and then what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:56.409> open<00:01:56.560> up<00:01:57.030> WBFF<00:01:58.030> manager<00:01:58.509> with<00:01:59.200> the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
we'll open up WBFF manager with the

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:06.840 
we'll open up WBFF manager with the
pop-up<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.159> happen<00:02:02.340> no<00:02:03.340> manats<00:02:03.700> it<00:02:03.850> opens<00:02:04.180> up

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.890 

we'll<00:02:07.390> go<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.600> our<00:02:07.810> drives<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.560> don't<00:02:09.250> see<00:02:12.900> which

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
we'll go to our drives I don't see which

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.020 
we'll go to our drives I don't see which
drive<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.320> is<00:02:14.410> so<00:02:14.590> assuming<00:02:15.130> we<00:02:15.190> have<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.400> USB<00:02:15.760> in

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
drive it is so assuming we have a USB in

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.650 
drive it is so assuming we have a USB in
there<00:02:16.210> whatever<00:02:16.570> you<00:02:16.690> have

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
there whatever you have

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.120 
there whatever you have
you'll<00:02:19.660> minimize<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.260> go<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:20.860> your<00:02:20.980> computer

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
you'll minimize that go to your computer

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.840 
you'll minimize that go to your computer
check<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.820> what<00:02:22.060> drive<00:02:22.480> your<00:02:22.900> USB<00:02:23.380> is<00:02:23.530> in<00:02:23.850> Ori

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
check it what drive your USB is in Ori

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.070 
check it what drive your USB is in Ori
SD<00:02:25.300> card<00:02:25.600> actually<00:02:26.380> would<00:02:26.710> just<00:02:26.950> be<00:02:27.100> USB<00:02:28.080> know

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
SD card actually would just be USB know

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.940 
SD card actually would just be USB know
decided<00:02:29.560> for<00:02:29.860> example<00:02:30.250> mine<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:30.820> in<00:02:31.120> drive<00:02:31.360> J

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
decided for example mine is in drive J

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.240 
decided for example mine is in drive J
so<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:33.670> would<00:02:34.180> head<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:34.510> back<00:02:34.750> over<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.350> my<00:02:35.470> WBFF

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
so I would head on back over to my WBFF

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.160 
so I would head on back over to my WBFF
manager<00:02:36.790> 3.0<00:02:38.310> open<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.460> back<00:02:39.670> up<00:02:39.840> then<00:02:40.840> what

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.030 
manager 3.0 open that back up then what
what<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.320> would<00:02:41.620> do

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
what I would do

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.790
