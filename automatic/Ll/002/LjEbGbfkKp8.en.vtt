00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.919
 Hello guys 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.349
 the book of the time is casagrande and its 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.880
 demons written by the casagrande coup 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.759
 by giovani ribeiro 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.010
 I'm not much of a fan of biographies. 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.989
 I already said this in another video 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.250
 most of them are not funny I think 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.469
 regardless of the car being a whore 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.930
 athlete does not mean that his life was 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.700
 interesting some biographies that he 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.990
 for example michael jordan was the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.270
 greatest basketball player of all time. 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.000
 first time feline bag this 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.310
 It used to be a standard I liked a 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.650
 I made the last one out the one 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.960
 towel if I go from the first 20 that I 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.530
 I even made the gas-breaking book 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.360
 I leave the link for you finally home 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.100
 great and his demons is also a 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.009
 Except I liked it fucking hell 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.689
 because it focuses not only on the 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.729
 football great home warrior 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.579
 It was cool, he was a good player but he is not 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.220
 that the focus of the book is more on the 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:23.190
 large house person and the riots and 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.070
 demons he faces in some cases 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.870
 demons was not even quoted because he arrived 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.210
 to be so inspired by some time of 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.640
 that he saw demons even in the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.909
 his apartment and opens it with 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.010
 I already opened telling the main 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.280
 hallucinations that the big house suffered 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.450
 for drug abuse he is a drug addict 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.850
 strong and mixed cocaine and heroin 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.520
 tequila and marijuana then it is lucinalva 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.159
 he saw demons he listened to things he 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.380
 we had absurd billiards and with 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.600
 this then the football part is for the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.220
 clear book people learn in the career of 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.439
 how it started 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.780
 his transfers in all 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.460
 classic elements the brawls he 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.740
 had with the santana phone 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.929
 the fights with lion friendship 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.079
 very strong that he had with Socrates 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.319
 later and moved away after the chaos 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:18.000
 talk to the Brazilian team when he 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.489
 was playing in Flemish and cheering 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.709
 Corintian began to scream and I 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.530
 I'm not mistaken of the Corinthian casagrande in the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.849
 and he was thrilled not to 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.069
 got more to play for flamengo 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.439
 back to the corinthians are all 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.849
 football elements are in the book 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.879
 are well told in the well-written book 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.409
 a light thematic book in the very light 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.060
 but it is written in a light way 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.650
 two day reading 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.689
 if you have not been too lazy not 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.750
 It's all there, another quiet way. 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:47.639
 a heavy way is a jumpsuit where 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.379
 you stay learning everything he did 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.060
 in soccer is not that way always 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.159
 counted in an inexpensive way 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.540
 house moved to the 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.269
 but that thing left 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.400
 extremely educated and then you tell and you see 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.409
 by the personality of the casagrande as 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.239
 that soccer event is 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.579
 manifested in his life is much more 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.980
 interesting in this way but 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.530
 cool legal quotation mark is 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.079
 even his battle against drugs 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.829
 Casagrande stayed one year hospitalized the year 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.930
 It's a damn thing a year without almost 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.669
 receiving a visit a year was only one 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.349
 I dream to go back and include his family . 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:24.510
 interned against the will and was 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.780
 hospitalized three times then this 40 days 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.669
 interned leave I'm going to use it account 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.799
 also of the times he almost died neither 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.540
 Too much kick had had almost no 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.810
 cardiac arrest at home had a single 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.430
 son witnessed matiko hospital then 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.530
 all this element of his struggle against 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.109
 The drugs are very interesting in the book. 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.659
 is easy to identify with your struggles 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.909
 Personal him what else it takes you 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.250
 understand that regardless of whether you stop 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.650
 to use or not the psychological addiction to 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.290
 Will to use is always present 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.419
 say something he will never beat the 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.549
 drugs he uses an angel metaphor 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:02.400
 football and drawing with drugs 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.340
 or if you just do not use it, it's okay 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.019
 size of try to overcome because 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.819
 in front of this he will always lose 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.099
 I identified myself I achieved 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.659
 I found the book runs from football is 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.239
 very cool, he also talks about 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:18.150
 democracy and speaks when he 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.759
 joined to en the direct already on 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.199
 oppression by the military regime that 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.880
 the big house was always a guy 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.520
 transgressions or a guy I gave 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.349
 authorities you could authority as 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.900
 I am one more reason for you to read this 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.759
 book really liked the big house 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.380
 stopped playing ball when I was 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.000
 starting to enjoy more football then 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.969
 I got to follow other career 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.750
 but independent of the team that you 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:44.060
 cheer was a player was a 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.070
 mega super craque bigger without exchanges of 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.660
 all times a good player but like 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.310
 I said the career element 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.400
 his footballing is not the main 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.260
 book focus is everything here 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.930
 but the cool thing is the way 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.570
 he almost died 40 he died 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.370
 He still talks about his great friend. 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.860
 Socrates' partner dies the couple 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.230
 and there is also that thing 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.170
 alcoholism but socially accepted in it 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.260
 already used heavier drugs so anyway 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:15.440
 he resisted miracles, man is alive and it's 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.840
 cool you see the battle that was also 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.340
 wedding his speech talking speaking 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.060
 from everything to every aspect of life 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.860
 his 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.480
 but the coolest even this battle 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.700
 his personalities that he has overcome today 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.640
 we almost killed more than once no 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.980
 accident series where he can search 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.930
 People live is a guy that she 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.840
 staged an act today is a comment 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.080
 we are with tolerable commentators 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.820
 well-articulated football does not need 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.860
 like soccer to enjoy this book 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.170
 do not need to be an ex drug addict a drug addict 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.360
 to like this book you do not need 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.950
 be a Corinthian to like this book 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.690
 any of these three elements of a 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.160
 How are you going to make yourself identify yourself? 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.320
 more with book but are not 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.060
 indispensable to the goalkeeper a good 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.900
 reading a light reading a reading 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.910
 quiet 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.330
 I really liked it , I read it, I recommend it. 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.350
 strongly house great and his demons is 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.160
 that's personal 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.160
 a hug
