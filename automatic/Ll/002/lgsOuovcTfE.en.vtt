00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:04.709
 there is a good chance that the wheel of your car on the manufacture here at the 

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:05.660
 saint luc chapel 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.030
 every day between 30 and 35 thousand euros are produced with always more 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.030
 advanced length on the competition 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.269
 the lover of the eu 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.460
 which will probably allow us 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.919
 the freedom of the roads 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.880
 we do not have the prototypes in montreal responded the maternal striker 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:29.999
 lighter 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.010
 today more hesitant today 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.570
 with the tabasco 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.970
 the direction of the group keeps smiling 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.940
 but frau who became European leader of the wheel assigned 550 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.660
 millions of euros of turnover and low date not the mans 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.090
 allow to maintain a technological advance but this increases in a 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.860
 open market we have to be competitive 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.360
 road manufacturing is more dependent on automation than on 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.860
 skilled labor as you can see our production and at 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.800
 rationalize our know-how is a city and we see the danger of 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.940
 Asian production but we believe our competitiveness eric 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.620
 caravaca 125 the four European factories of the group lies the 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.240
 close to their customers 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.470
 in order to streamline production 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.650
 but well over 8 million euros have been invested for the moment 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.690
 chain status automate road productions for pole at 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.620
 back history and all group formats 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.280
 in the e year the same word format prefabricated at the highest level at 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.330
 within the metro group 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.130
 so we put in the same factory all the wheels and anti in order to 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.230
 limit the number of dimension changes and therefore consequently 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.990
 shelter more products on equipment production capacity 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.659
 of the site has increased by 20% in three years 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.429
 installed since 1958 the machined azf of dolphin phase be relocated one does not 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:45.810
 can not improvise fast 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.159
 it is necessary to invest millions tens of millions of euros for 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.430
 build factories 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.910
 so that actually a given moment when the machines are installed a 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.090
 place they tend in the time he stayed there and grow 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.630
 around this position 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.840
 and that's what makes today a factory in china 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.530
 something that is 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.680
 the metro site of the chapel-saint-luc 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.770
 extends over 25 hectares and employs 700 employees
