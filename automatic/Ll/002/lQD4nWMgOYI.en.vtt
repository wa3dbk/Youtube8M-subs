00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.280
 we have waited for a long time 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.560
 that this law of broadcasting be changed 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.870
 a law that would be well giving with successive errors of governments the 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.369
 conformation of multimedia 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:14.139
 that for me are one of the ways to attack what we call 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.480
 Press freedom 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.870
 when the opportunity arises for political reasons that are not 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.929
 I want to go in to reconsider because if we do not paralyze ourselves in that 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.550
 the law and businesswoman 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.429
 discuss it is necessary to present it later 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.269
 that all the legislators work in aiming some element that allows 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.320
 make it fairer at some point where it is not fair but I used to want to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.470
 I have read the law presents me very well 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.000
 and that it fully satisfies here it needs that we have all proclaimed 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.670
 since many years 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.590
 that a new broadcasting law enters without a library 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.380
 emphatically from the beginning state in favor of the law especially from 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.060
 read the fundamental articles I have concentrated on those that have most 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.230
 criticized by those who have shown the cti in accordance with the law and considered that 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.250
 there are no elements there 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.970
 except for the discussion as for 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.690
 for this we will not get the law I think this is a way 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.840
 simply 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.090
 to refuse to consider something that we are all waiting for a lot 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.560
 I need avidly professionally but also in everything that 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.560
 makes the ethical question and the best development of journalism 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.500
 the business that was established with respect to football is one 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.910
 perversity 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.890
 that has demoralized me after many years of preaching 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.490
 against something that has cheated the clubs that has been done with the consent 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.520
 incredibly of the own association of the Argentine soccer with the complicity 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.470
 oo weakness of all the leaders who enter only a short time enter 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.150
 and leave always change while the person who has everything under 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.180
 control that is the president of the is the one that finally 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.050
 act for what in certain multimedia groups etc etc perfectly 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.939
 we know percent what are 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.560
 cc remained for many years with football without tender for time 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.590
 undetermined considering that soccer is of general interest that is 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.819
 a public thing 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.069
 that makes the identity of the Argentines steal that keep it 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.799
 the name of codes 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.659
 practically mafioso 'that are those of offering protection for those who sign 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.809
 what the group agree with and the one that is percent water threat of attack 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:24.679
 so that those 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:29.579
 what that disobedient show this this behavior plus the immense 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.369
 amount of money that has been desired to be without measure reads a newspaper there 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:34.859
 percent 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.559
 this journalist who respected the business of 9 billion pesos about 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:39.650
 numbers or calculation 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.640
 but my calculation did not have the basis that surely 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.750
 has the times 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.299
 percent but in addition to this business 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.180
 what it generated as a business this revealed that the clubs never received 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.999
 nothing and by not receiving the clubs 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.989
 did not receive people is something we can not imagine very cipher 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.190
 practically why 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.950
 they became owners of channels in the rest of the country 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.850
 those bases we do not know how much they are worth 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.980
 compared to 2 pesos through having football rights 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.029
 it is a perversity 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:11.969
 has been something so infamous what happens in these years that starred in media 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.300
 who do journalism and that through journalism 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.640
 they defend those businesses I think is the most irritating and bo the biggest scam 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.580
 consented that the PSOE has been closely watched in my entire life as a journalist
