00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.680
 hello dear rider here are 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.150
 ds 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.940
 I am often asked 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:20.720
 Now take this treeless and star 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.640
 trek latte or that satie here ultra 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.590
 flex with battle tree 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.740
 the prices are not always 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.169
 but it is the decisive factor 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.300
 Feeling that the rider is riding on the horse 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.250
 I just want both times now 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.530
 explain something about their products 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.899
 technical side only that maybe 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.470
 to remain a small decision- making aid 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.079
 can 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.370
 with the star trek saddle at the star 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.280
 trek saddle is harmless the star trek 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.110
 is tree going and therefore natural 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.750
 completely flexible and adaptable 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.620
 sometimes just the tree big test her 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.990
 he looks completely bent but 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.270
 just not by that means get through 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:06.380
 its special construction are 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:09.079
 stability the second point that 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.750
 suddenly or the classes are natural 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.590
 two you can change individually 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.360
 you can get them here 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.159
 You can change them in this axis 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.880
 but also in this axis change and 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.530
 This may cause problems 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.409
 compensate that can occur 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.929
 a divergence between saddle well so 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.490
 between pre-position and saddle position then 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:34.039
 of course I have the possibility of 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.460
 stepless adjustment we have 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.630
 this people and the immediately can not 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.020
 change with one 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.200
 Allen key followed by screw then 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.939
 i can do the widening and and 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.859
 then I write the woman to it 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.200
 that means I have the possibility this 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:54.890
 saddle in all axes and levels too 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.470
 change and adapt to the horse 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.210
 Of course, the tree is full in his 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.460
 Construction also easier 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.710
 that means here we have wenders and 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.310
 stirrups and this whole in charge 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.250
 harnik around seven and a half kilo it 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.980
 of course that means little here 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.150
 the health problems continue 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.180
 do not have the heavy saddle 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.100
 can cancel or similar things 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.380
 Of course, the saddle can be wonderful 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.260
 with however the krux at the 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.209
 thing is i would tell you so that 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.209
 is about it is pronounced 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.540
 be at 80 85 kilo today's conclusion 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.730
 perhaps kilowatt still comply with 90 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.780
 but 110 kilo rider actually belongs 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.850
 not in the treeless set so here and here 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.260
 the quantum wester 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.820
 the big advantage would be here of course 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.100
 the adjustability and that is 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.930
 a very comfortable adjustability 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.970
 I show that one just has one 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.040
 special play man par excellence 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.940
 You can even ride horses on the horse 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.019
 lets do all 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.450
 then you start screwing the 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.880
 progressively close or me woman we the 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.030
 against direction 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.549
 I wanted to continue in a fit 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.030
 Of course that's just because here one thing 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:18.440
 very clever double succeeds 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:21.380
 Investments so if you have the one as 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.130
 The disadvantage is to say town Lecco 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.500
 here is at 85 90 kilo you can finish 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.640
 Of course, bring the advantage here 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.720
 this tree does not blow the satellite 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.670
 more operated 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.079
 he still has a flexibility here 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.400
 this area i can shut it down 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.070
 rotate 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.260
 but the tree will naturally fall 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.530
 not even a rider can come from here 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.270
 110 lbs 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.010
 Of course that is still a great one 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:54.650
 History is the substructure that is 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.670
 cushion stretcher pillow the pillows can 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.650
 from the appropriate button professionals 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.220
 changed to padded upholstered 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.209
 so that you can be quite fine here 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.470
 individually on site afterwards with the horse 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.489
 can adjust the upholstery 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.500
 that means I have the possibility 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.930
 first about the setting in the 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.609
 continued to make and adaptable that then 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:23.990
 I'm in the pillow here and do 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:26.300
 here an individual Kreuzberg yes that 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.419
 the better is the treeless variant 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.110
 the us afflecks variant it is difficult 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.230
 accept 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.330
 in the end, they can only 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.120
 decide if both try 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.400
 when they rode to a test 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.280
 if their horse gives him also has shown 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.030
 a piece of what they like 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.570
 Eventually, they will 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.210
 Relatively quickly notice the experience 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.760
 made that the one who cares for that 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.640
 Just after he decides that 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.729
 yes virtually makes it from his heart because he 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.760
 just simply feels that the right us 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.590
 So should not be said buy the 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.570
 mail order or look where are 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.419
 herkriegen but really bring someone 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.610
 the responsible and individual 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.900
 this race swept and then adapted 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.900
 we should just give it a try
