from the Microsoft Store online in terms

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.450 
from the Microsoft Store online in terms
of<00:00:37.200> style<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.890> definitely<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
of style this is definitely not the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.850 
of style this is definitely not the
slimmest<00:00:39.030> keyboard<00:00:39.510> an<00:00:39.690> entire<00:00:40.140> world<00:00:40.469> but

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
slimmest keyboard an entire world but

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.220 
slimmest keyboard an entire world but
not<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.129> thickest<00:00:41.489> either<00:00:41.899> size-wise<00:00:42.899> it

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
not the thickest either size-wise it

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.020 
not the thickest either size-wise it
does<00:00:43.530> simulate<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> bake<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.789> not<00:00:44.969> a

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
does simulate a bake so this is not a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.119 
does simulate a bake so this is not a
keyboard<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.809> want<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> look<00:00:46.200> into<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
keyboard you want to look into if if the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.380 
keyboard you want to look into if if the
small<00:00:47.399> working<00:00:47.820> area

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
small working area

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.779 
small working area
like<00:00:49.350> most<00:00:49.590> keyboard<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.100> there<00:00:50.309> there<00:00:50.670> are

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
like most keyboard out there there are

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.180 
like most keyboard out there there are
two<00:00:51.090> tabs<00:00:51.360> or<00:00:51.660> lakes<00:00:52.199> under<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> keyboard

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
two tabs or lakes under the keyboard

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.729 
two tabs or lakes under the keyboard
however<00:00:53.850> those<00:00:54.270> legs<00:00:54.570> are<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.870> little<00:00:55.079> bit<00:00:55.379> high

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
however those legs are a little bit high

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.920 
however those legs are a little bit high
for<00:00:55.770> me<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.430> prefer<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.910> type<00:00:57.300> without<00:00:57.570> them

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
for me so I prefer to type without them

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.470 
for me so I prefer to type without them
