00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
thought I would do just sort of a quick

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.420 
thought I would do just sort of a quick
little<00:00:04.140> tutorial<00:00:04.259> video<00:00:04.859> because<00:00:05.160> I've<00:00:05.250> seen

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
little tutorial video because I've seen

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.950 
little tutorial video because I've seen
a<00:00:05.490> lot<00:00:05.700> of<00:00:05.730> people<00:00:06.120> that<00:00:06.390> have<00:00:06.600> been<00:00:06.690> sending

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
a lot of people that have been sending

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.009 
a lot of people that have been sending
out<00:00:07.140> friend<00:00:07.350> requests<00:00:08.030> even<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.120> me<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.599> I'm

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
out friend requests even to me and I'm

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.209 
out friend requests even to me and I'm
not<00:00:10.050> getting<00:00:10.469> them<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.740> I'm<00:00:10.800> like<00:00:10.889> well<00:00:11.070> why

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
not getting them and I'm like well why

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.310 
not getting them and I'm like well why
am<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.460> not<00:00:11.580> getting<00:00:11.790> them<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.960> figured

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
am I not getting them and so I figured

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.620 
am I not getting them and so I figured
out<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.950> people<00:00:14.580> are<00:00:14.969> adding<00:00:15.269> friends

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
out that people are adding friends

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.910 
out that people are adding friends
through<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.839> provisionally<00:00:16.500> registered

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
through the provisionally registered

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
through the provisionally registered
system<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:18.060> was<00:00:18.270> what<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.630> was<00:00:18.810> doing

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
system and that was what I was doing

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.179 
system and that was what I was doing
yesterday<00:00:19.140> before<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.680> realized<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.070> that

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
yesterday before I realized that that

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.099 
yesterday before I realized that that
was<00:00:20.369> wrong<00:00:20.609> so<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.449> thought<00:00:21.779> I'd<00:00:21.900> go<00:00:22.080> through

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
was wrong so I thought I'd go through

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.689 
was wrong so I thought I'd go through
her<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.500> show<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.949> wrong<00:00:23.100> way<00:00:23.340> which<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
her and show you the wrong way which a

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.640 
her and show you the wrong way which a
lot<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.880> people<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.300> been<00:00:24.449> using<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.109> then

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
lot of people have been using and then

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.570 
lot of people have been using and then
of<00:00:25.769> course<00:00:25.800> they're<00:00:26.070> getting<00:00:26.130> confuse

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
of course they're getting confuse

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.740 
of course they're getting confuse
because<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> wrong<00:00:27.330> way<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:27.630> they

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
because it's the wrong way but they

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.769 
because it's the wrong way but they
don't<00:00:27.900> know<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.730> because<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.939> like<00:00:30.689> I

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
don't know that because this like I

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.209 
don't know that because this like I
don't<00:00:30.840> even<00:00:31.050> know<00:00:31.170> why<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.560> exists<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
don't even know why it exists in the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.220 
don't even know why it exists in the
first<00:00:32.399> place<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.239> bad<00:00:33.450> way<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:34.079> is

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
first place but so the bad way this is

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.590 
first place but so the bad way this is
how<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> lot<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.800> people<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.100> been<00:00:35.160> doing<00:00:35.309> it

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
how a lot of people have been doing it

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.729 
how a lot of people have been doing it
you'd<00:00:36.600> think<00:00:36.840> ok<00:00:37.050> well<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.380> want<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.620> add<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
you'd think ok well I want to add a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.250 
you'd think ok well I want to add a
friend<00:00:38.010> well<00:00:38.309> go<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.760> friends<00:00:39.030> list<00:00:39.059> right

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.069 

so<00:00:43.260> we'll<00:00:43.469> wait<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.980> load<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.570> you

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
so we'll wait for that to load and you

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.569 
so we'll wait for that to load and you
can<00:00:49.200> see<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.530> know<00:00:49.620> I've<00:00:49.739> got<00:00:49.920> I've<00:00:50.190> got<00:00:50.430> my

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
can see you know I've got I've got my

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.100 
can see you know I've got I've got my
friends<00:00:51.000> here<00:00:51.180> or<00:00:51.300> whatever<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.660> that's<00:00:51.719> fine

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
friends here or whatever and that's fine

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.840 
friends here or whatever and that's fine
so<00:00:52.770> you'd<00:00:52.920> think<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.430> would<00:00:53.550> hit<00:00:53.670> this

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
so you'd think that you would hit this

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.299 
so you'd think that you would hit this
register<00:00:54.360> friend<00:00:54.600> button<00:00:54.860> now<00:00:55.860> at<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.070> point

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
register friend button now at this point

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.400 
register friend button now at this point
it's<00:00:57.270> telling<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.719> use<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.989> gamepad<00:00:58.140> at

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
it's telling you to use the gamepad at

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.020 
it's telling you to use the gamepad at
this<00:00:58.559> point<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.219> your<00:00:59.670> gamepad

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
this point you can on your gamepad

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.549 
this point you can on your gamepad
you'll<00:01:00.210> you'll<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> text<00:01:01.079> window<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
you'll you'll see a text window on a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.599 
you'll you'll see a text window on a
keyboard<00:01:01.739> tour<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.280> enter<00:01:02.520> in

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
keyboard tour you can enter in

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.789 
keyboard tour you can enter in
somebody's<00:01:03.000> ID<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:05.570> for<00:01:06.570> example<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.650> one

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
somebody's ID so for example this is one

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.950 
somebody's ID so for example this is one
person<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.280> know<00:01:08.400> was<00:01:08.790> trying<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.510> add<00:01:09.659> me

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
person that I know was trying to add me

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.550 
person that I know was trying to add me
and<00:01:11.090> apparently<00:01:12.090> sent<00:01:12.510> me<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.840> request<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.439> it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and apparently sent me a request but it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.960 
and apparently sent me a request but it
didn't<00:01:13.770> ever<00:01:13.890> go<00:01:14.040> through<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:17.880> see

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
didn't ever go through so so you can see

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.450 
didn't ever go through so so you can see
there<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.509> says<00:01:19.259> I've<00:01:19.710> registered<00:01:20.189> them<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
there it says I've registered them as a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.950 
there it says I've registered them as a
friend<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.030> come<00:01:21.240> down<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> end<00:01:21.840> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
friend and you come down to the end of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.640 
friend and you come down to the end of
the<00:01:22.020> list<00:01:22.200> or<00:01:22.500> well<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.799> guess<00:01:23.990> I'll<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.049> that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the list or well I guess I'll see that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.200 
the list or well I guess I'll see that
doesn't<00:01:25.950> work<00:01:26.040> because<00:01:26.130> he<00:01:26.400> added<00:01:26.759> me<00:01:26.909> he<00:01:26.970> can

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
doesn't work because he added me he can

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.429 
doesn't work because he added me he can
okay<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.170> for<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.890> example<00:01:30.049> let's<00:01:31.049> try

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
okay but for this example let's try

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.690 
okay but for this example let's try
another<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:31.950> because<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.310> know<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.610> this

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
another one because I know that this

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.639 
another one because I know that this
will<00:01:32.880> work

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.289 

you<00:01:39.649> come<00:01:39.979> down<00:01:40.100> here<00:01:40.340> okay<00:01:40.579> here's<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:40.939> perfect

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
you come down here okay here's a perfect

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.959 
you come down here okay here's a perfect
example<00:01:41.500> now<00:01:42.500> I<00:01:42.530> just<00:01:42.619> added<00:01:43.100> like<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.399> random

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
example now I just added like the random

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.399 
example now I just added like the random
named<00:01:44.179> Reggie<00:01:44.570> because<00:01:44.840> somebody<00:01:45.109> out<00:01:45.229> there

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
named Reggie because somebody out there

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.919 
named Reggie because somebody out there
has<00:01:45.649> to<00:01:45.679> have<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.130> name<00:01:46.280> Reggie<00:01:46.610> right<00:01:46.969> so

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
has to have the name Reggie right so

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.899 
has to have the name Reggie right so
okay<00:01:48.310> provisionally<00:01:49.310> registered<00:01:49.700> friend

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
okay provisionally registered friend

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.669 
okay provisionally registered friend
that<00:01:50.149> would<00:01:50.299> mean<00:01:50.539> that<00:01:50.570> if<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:51.140> wanted<00:01:51.439> to<00:01:51.500> be

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
that would mean that if I wanted to be

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.020 
that would mean that if I wanted to be
friends<00:01:51.979> with<00:01:52.130> this<00:01:52.310> real<00:01:52.520> person<00:01:52.880> named

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
friends with this real person named

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.340 
friends with this real person named
Reggie<00:01:53.329> they<00:01:53.600> would<00:01:53.780> need<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:53.990> come<00:01:54.170> in<00:01:54.319> and

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
Reggie they would need to come in and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.499 
Reggie they would need to come in and
manually<00:01:54.950> add<00:01:55.219> me<00:01:55.490> through<00:01:55.850> this<00:01:56.000> system<00:01:56.390> as

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
manually add me through this system as

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.949 
manually add me through this system as
well<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:56.899> guess<00:01:57.280> it<00:01:58.280> works<00:01:58.689> but<00:01:59.689> it<00:01:59.840> is

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
well so I guess it works but it is

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.800 
well so I guess it works but it is
incredibly<00:02:00.619> non-intuitive<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:01.850> if<00:02:02.209> I<00:02:02.569> wanted

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
incredibly non-intuitive so if I wanted

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.090 
incredibly non-intuitive so if I wanted
to<00:02:02.869> be<00:02:03.049> friends<00:02:03.289> with<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:03.500> Reggie<00:02:03.679> person

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
to be friends with this Reggie person

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.770 
to be friends with this Reggie person
the<00:02:04.670> best<00:02:04.880> way<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.060> do<00:02:05.240> this<00:02:05.360> would<00:02:05.539> be<00:02:05.659> to

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
the best way to do this would be to

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.999 
the best way to do this would be to
actually<00:02:05.899> remove<00:02:06.319> them<00:02:06.500> from<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.770> friends

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
actually remove them from the friends

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.080 
actually remove them from the friends
list<00:02:07.189> and<00:02:07.280> add<00:02:07.459> them<00:02:08.560> elsewhere<00:02:09.560> entirely<00:02:10.090> so

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
list and add them elsewhere entirely so

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:19.800 
list and add them elsewhere entirely so
what<00:02:11.239> you<00:02:11.329> want<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.510> do<00:02:11.690> is<00:02:11.989> go<00:02:12.230> into<00:02:12.410> miiverse

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.600 

okay<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:20.870> once<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.680> come<00:02:21.829> into<00:02:22.010> Beaver<00:02:22.340> Singh

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
okay so once you come into Beaver Singh

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.920 
okay so once you come into Beaver Singh
at<00:02:22.730> Lowe's<00:02:24.579> you'll<00:02:25.579> want<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:25.849> hit<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.299> user<00:02:26.660> menu

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
at Lowe's you'll want to hit a user menu

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.780 
at Lowe's you'll want to hit a user menu
and<00:02:27.430> then<00:02:28.430> hit<00:02:28.579> Search<00:02:28.910> users<00:02:29.620> now

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
and then hit Search users now

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.100 
and then hit Search users now
unfortunately<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:32.180> tried<00:02:32.569> this<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:32.959> Reggie

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
unfortunately I tried this and Reggie

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.920 
unfortunately I tried this and Reggie
doesn't<00:02:33.500> exist<00:02:33.829> but<00:02:34.150> we<00:02:35.150> know<00:02:35.299> that<00:02:35.599> this

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
doesn't exist but we know that this

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.780 
doesn't exist but we know that this
person<00:02:36.290> does<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:43.040> searches<00:02:43.280> for<00:02:43.549> the<00:02:43.639> user

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
person does and it searches for the user

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.789 
person does and it searches for the user
and<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.030> presents<00:02:44.359> them<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.750> now<00:02:45.380> if<00:02:45.620> he

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
and it presents them to you now if he

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.710 
and it presents them to you now if he
wasn't<00:02:46.190> already<00:02:46.430> my<00:02:46.790> friend<00:02:47.150> then<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.569> would

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
wasn't already my friend then I would

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.000 
wasn't already my friend then I would
tap<00:02:47.930> on<00:02:48.079> this<00:02:48.230> view<00:02:48.440> profile<00:02:48.829> button<00:02:49.160> and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
tap on this view profile button and

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.930 
tap on this view profile button and
there<00:02:52.010> would<00:02:52.160> be<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.370> friend<00:02:52.970> request<00:02:53.829> box

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
there would be a friend request box

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.559 
there would be a friend request box
right<00:02:55.940> above<00:02:56.299> that<00:02:56.680> little<00:02:57.680> swirl<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:59.420> that

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
right above that little swirl so that

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.300 
right above that little swirl so that
would<00:02:59.720> say<00:02:59.930> you<00:02:59.989> know<00:03:00.290> friend<00:03:00.889> requests<00:03:01.190> or

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
would say you know friend requests or

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.229 
would say you know friend requests or
whatever<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:01.639> then<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:01.790> could<00:03:01.910> send<00:03:02.150> the

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
whatever and then you could send the

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.210 
whatever and then you could send the
request<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.690> way<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:03.079> would<00:03:03.530> pop<00:03:03.709> up<00:03:03.739> just

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
request that way it would pop up just

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.879 
request that way it would pop up just
like<00:03:04.400> if<00:03:04.639> you<00:03:04.819> were<00:03:04.850> on<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.120> 360<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:06.680> know<00:03:06.739> any

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
like if you were on a 360 you know any

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.080 
like if you were on a 360 you know any
anything<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:07.430> would<00:03:07.519> actually<00:03:07.819> be<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.060> know

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
anything that would actually be you know

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.140 
anything that would actually be you know
intuitive<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:09.079> don't<00:03:09.380> know<00:03:09.500> why<00:03:09.940> Nintendo<00:03:10.940> did

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
intuitive I don't know why Nintendo did

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.660 
intuitive I don't know why Nintendo did
that<00:03:11.329> I<00:03:11.599> don't<00:03:11.810> know<00:03:11.959> if<00:03:12.109> it's<00:03:12.230> for<00:03:12.670> parental

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
that I don't know if it's for parental

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.170 
that I don't know if it's for parental
controls<00:03:14.209> or<00:03:14.599> child<00:03:14.959> safety<00:03:15.410> or<00:03:15.680> what<00:03:16.099> but<00:03:17.090> if

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
controls or child safety or what but if

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.490 
controls or child safety or what but if
you're<00:03:17.299> having<00:03:17.450> trouble<00:03:17.870> where<00:03:18.049> you<00:03:18.200> know

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
you're having trouble where you know

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.750 
you're having trouble where you know
that<00:03:18.739> you've<00:03:18.829> been<00:03:18.889> sending<00:03:19.220> people<00:03:19.430> friend

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
that you've been sending people friend

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.920 
that you've been sending people friend
requests<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.359> they<00:03:20.420> haven't<00:03:20.630> been<00:03:20.840> getting

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
requests and they haven't been getting

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.360 
requests and they haven't been getting
them<00:03:21.200> or<00:03:21.349> they<00:03:21.440> haven't<00:03:21.680> been<00:03:21.739> accepting<00:03:22.220> them

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
them or they haven't been accepting them

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.949 
them or they haven't been accepting them
it's<00:03:22.849> probably<00:03:23.209> not<00:03:23.329> that<00:03:23.389> they're<00:03:23.660> ignoring

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
it's probably not that they're ignoring

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.390 
it's probably not that they're ignoring
you<00:03:24.169> it's<00:03:24.349> just<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.590> they<00:03:24.769> have<00:03:24.799> no<00:03:25.069> idea

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
you it's just that they have no idea

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.129 
you it's just that they have no idea
that<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.180> actually<00:03:26.359> did<00:03:26.720> because<00:03:27.019> they

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
that you actually did because they

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.680 
that you actually did because they
didn't<00:03:27.440> receive<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:27.829> request<00:03:28.130> and<00:03:28.489> so<00:03:29.150> if<00:03:29.450> you

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
didn't receive a request and so if you

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.870 
didn't receive a request and so if you
did<00:03:29.989> receive<00:03:30.349> one<00:03:30.680> through<00:03:31.160> this<00:03:31.310> new<00:03:31.519> method

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
did receive one through this new method

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.720 
did receive one through this new method
you<00:03:32.810> would<00:03:32.900> come<00:03:33.109> into<00:03:33.230> notifications<00:03:33.980> click

helps I know even from a personal
perspective<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.540> was<00:03:41.720> confused<00:03:42.139> about<00:03:42.200> this<00:03:42.440> at

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
perspective I was confused about this at

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.319 
perspective I was confused about this at
first<00:03:42.799> I<00:03:43.010> sent<00:03:43.250> out<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.370> slew<00:03:43.669> of<00:03:43.700> requests<00:03:44.150> and

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
first I sent out a slew of requests and

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.819 
first I sent out a slew of requests and
everybody<00:03:44.780> was<00:03:44.930> ignoring<00:03:45.230> me<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:45.590> I<00:03:45.650> thought

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
everybody was ignoring me and I thought

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.150 
everybody was ignoring me and I thought
either<00:03:46.579> people<00:03:47.030> secretly<00:03:47.389> hate<00:03:47.660> me<00:03:47.870> or<00:03:48.160> it's

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
either people secretly hate me or it's

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.039 
either people secretly hate me or it's
broken<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.699> so<00:03:50.419> it<00:03:50.540> took<00:03:50.690> me<00:03:50.810> a<00:03:50.840> while<00:03:50.989> to

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
broken and so it took me a while to

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:51.850 
broken and so it took me a while to
figure<00:03:51.290> out<00:03:51.500> that

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
figure out that

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.670 
figure out that
this<00:03:52.670> is<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.180> proper<00:03:53.630> way<00:03:53.660> to<00:03:53.840> do<00:03:54.020> it<00:03:54.170> so<00:03:54.290> I

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
this is the proper way to do it so I

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.920 
this is the proper way to do it so I
hope<00:03:55.190> that<00:03:55.370> helps<00:03:55.700> and<00:03:55.940> if<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.210> did<00:03:56.390> you<00:03:56.840> know
