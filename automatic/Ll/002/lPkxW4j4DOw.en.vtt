00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
the second half it was really important

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.550 
the second half it was really important
not<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:19.000> let<00:02:19.270> them<00:02:19.420> get<00:02:19.690> another<00:02:19.990> Golan<00:02:20.410> and

not to let them get another Golan and
get<00:02:20.770> back<00:02:20.950> in<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.190> game<00:02:21.340> wasn't<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.940> think

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
get back in the game wasn't it I think

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.070 
get back in the game wasn't it I think
though<00:02:22.660> if<00:02:22.930> it's<00:02:23.380> all<00:02:23.950> 90-minute<00:02:24.520> is

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
though if it's all 90-minute is

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.210 
though if it's all 90-minute is
important<00:02:26.080> because<00:02:26.200> if<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.650> are<00:02:26.740> in<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:26.950> food

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220
