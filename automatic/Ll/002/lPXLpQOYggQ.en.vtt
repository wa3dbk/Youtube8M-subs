00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
this is really cool because underneath

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.380

and she really needed more storage in
here<00:02:02.530> so<00:02:02.770> I<00:02:02.800> thought<00:02:03.360> pirate-themed<00:02:04.360> more

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
here so I thought pirate-themed more

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.279

storage<00:02:05.290> hatches<00:02:06.280> can<00:02:06.460> go<00:02:06.610> in<00:02:06.759> here<00:02:06.869> exactly<00:02:07.869> I

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
storage hatches can go in here exactly I

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.469 
storage hatches can go in here exactly I
think<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.369> was<00:02:09.459> incredible<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:10.179> really

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.540 
think it was incredible that you really
taught<00:02:10.720> us<00:02:10.929> all<00:02:11.230> what<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.070> true<00:02:12.280> meaning

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
taught us all what the true meaning

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.850 
taught us all what the true meaning
family<00:02:12.970> really<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.480> about<00:02:13.750> it's<00:02:14.380> not<00:02:14.800> about

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
family really is about it's not about

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.680 
family really is about it's not about
