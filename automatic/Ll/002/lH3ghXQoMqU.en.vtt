00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.569
 good day here is my first 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.639
 video again from berlin wonderful 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.019
 winter i was still in a week ago 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.759
 california now i am here again 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.920
 from a very customer 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.590
 special reason i work here and 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.000
 I would not be in front of a video camera 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.510
 If I do not have a product with me 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.910
 would have 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.350
 and today it's about the lg flex 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.070
 a bit in the tongue breaker if you 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.800
 lg flex tries to say why 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.180
 Here lies a banana life entirely 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.790
 easy as you end here 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.820
 pack as is 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.550
 LG bent smartphone so the first one 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.489
 Smartphone from LG with curved display 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.520
 and that was here today in Germany 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.050
 We've shown that to a few people 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.480
 We already have that on the ces 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.890
 looked at but we want us now 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.430
 Of course, look at the packaging 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.350
 and look like this thing here in his 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.399
 beautiful cover is embedded like her 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.530
 I have not opened it yet 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.840
 I only have it today, too 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.119
 far seen and me now times 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.220
 curious if it is on war yes there it is 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.659
 how to pack that from 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.490
 Here you can also see that I hope that you 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.259
 it also looks good on the camera 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.259
 you already know that this phone is 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.360
 really very bent here is the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.360
 banana for comparison maybe again 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.030
 So as well as the packaging is so 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.409
 that too is in here 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.689
 the deep was bent very much and it 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.500
 First of all it is noticeable that it is very big 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.750
 6 inch big display and if you want 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.000
 normal phone so not bent 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.990
 holding next to it is also noticeable how 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.829
 strong here 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.479
 this advertising lies in the device 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.159
 given but very briefly aside for it 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.329
 Yes, this is also about an unboxing 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.530
 That's why we want to know what else 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.790
 in this packaging is also here 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.110
 I think I have to say first 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.610
 quite nice that the manufacturers are over 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.200
 More thoughts about making your devices 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.250
 also to be packed accordingly 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.979
 Of course, that would just have to be one 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.509
 can pack normal boxee but there 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.649
 was also in favor of a curved box 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.800
 I think decidedly chic can 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.210
 then you also then one 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.980
 his impression then one more here 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.010
 quick guide to the device with it 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.380
 and also the obligatory micro 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.100
 usb on usb cable to be on the phone 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.780
 connect to the computer or that 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.190
 enclosed power supply one must it 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.410
 power supply because without electricity 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.960
 does not work then have the part 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:34.270
 We also have some in ear here 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.860
 headphones with extra plugs 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.760
 silicone probably plugs the 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.770
 biggest mess and l is equipped here 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.080
 it is also here it is 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.430
 also around the curved one if one this in the 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.710
 So detail looks are normal so 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.660
 I just got headphones right now 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.580
 thought to break them but are not 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.960
 broken they are just born around 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.610
 so the designer 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.810
 according to the design language of ltg flex 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.420
 My goodness 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.340
 a little more complicated was alright 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.270
 it was also in there is still 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:12.220
 a little g packed with it you get 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.800
 with security then the subject for the 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.810
 sim card also changed us all to one 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.340
 wonderful company you just 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.730
 here on youtube or on us 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.400
 the page follows and with this part 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.950
 you have to be somewhere here at any one 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.230
 connect to the sim card slot 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.390
 come over here with one 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.280
 small stuck in there you come here 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.580
 in the fold here is the hypo sim 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.420
 card purely maybe times like that 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.610
 hardware the device does not know yet 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.770
 3 10 megapixel camera behind then 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.860
 also 3500 milliampere battery here 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.290
 built into the 1 2 3 resp 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.630
 to be exact 2.26 ghz quad core 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.590
 processor it's two gigabytes of RAM 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.780
 built-in 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.500
 and yes here's a hdg oled display 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.239
 behind are a few others 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.710
 I'll give you some nice facts now 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.390
 but not everybody wants to read aloud 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.090
 Otherwise, how do you naturally find out? 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.700
 our products to this device lg 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.100
 always packs the devices in a lot 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.970
 a lot of plastic here a first cover 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.630
 then here is another one 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.040
 plastic foil on it in front is a 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.020
 plastic are thought of on the sides 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.330
 many small thin plastic films 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.040
 to now I do not do all from 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.580
 but in any case, everything is beautiful 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.410
 protected very important here too 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.250
 mention that we will of course in the 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.990
 future then a little bit more 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.210
 more detailed here is the 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.000
 so-called his wolverine year 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.550
 surface calls lg that nice 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.950
 it's about this cover this 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.950
 surface that virtually heals itself 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.430
 So you two ex man guy morin 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.390
 should scratch this cover a bit 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.070
 prevent 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.630
 of course only if now a portal to 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.300
 the material then it will be synonymous 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.610
 leave a safe mark here 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.470
 but this cover should actually be like that 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.210
 work that if minor scratches 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.680
 to smear smaller ones that 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.690
 the material of this surface the 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.400
 attached ensures that this 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.840
 scratches disappear over time 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.340
 we'll see that I have 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.450
 Now two weeks time we part the times 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.130
 to look at the practice in practice 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.130
 So it has to say it's pretty nice 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:19.770
 large I have now though at 13 here 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:23.080
 accustomed but we clearly see that is 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:26.920
 lg flex again a whole number 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.210
 larger works already relatively far but the 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.620
 I also noticed the north one has 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.640
 gets used to everything very fast and 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.900
 then you do not want to go back 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.970
 I'm curious how that 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.250
 get a little bit in the next time 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.910
 closer look a bit 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.830
 Try this coups display 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.970
 really brings something or whether it 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.170
 just a bauble is with the 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.290
 The manufacturers want to show that they are 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.290
 can 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.950
 otherwise there is actually for me 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.440
 is not there so much to say about that 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.360
 device that my first impression of the 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.950
 We'll see each other in the next few weeks 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.260
 of course and then write as well 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.280
 already firmly that was it now from me 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:05.050
 i say goodbye to this place 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:06.280
 and say goodbye to what he can do 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.660
 has forgotten you is to mention that 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.130
 this thing in the back here too 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.110
 turns the turning point of a basic 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.250
 is active except one since no end cards 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.800
 made that I am here now and I am 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.030
 because the colleagues of giga film are quite 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.820
 practically they were diligent 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.470
 work like you come to page comes 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.480
 directly to the here taps the right 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.070
 or left anyway and here 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.350
 you can find the top apps so the 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.240
 we playlist all our top 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:32.040
 Among other things, apps also come with the 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.040
 multi x and light who now the x 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.760
 there are just a few colleagues here 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.260
 I'm just waiting because you can 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.700
 also like to be loud because I have to 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.510
 cut it out or maybe 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.670
 I just leave it in, too 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.980
 These are the colleagues from the games 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.500
 area which look now briefly 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:57.800
 let and disappear directly 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.700
 I come back to the device there are the 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.110
 Colleagues still but that 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.860
 I am not irritated at all 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.860
 come back to the device
