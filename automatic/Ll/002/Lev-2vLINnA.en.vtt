00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.910
 Today I would like to introduce you to this Audi a 4 avant 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.419
 I will 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:15.579
 It is Audi a 4 avant here though 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:21.420
 It will be 1.8 turbo car of Kuatoron four-wheel drive of the 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:25.980
 It is immediately with this exterior and the state of the interior 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.530
 Though I want to comment like this while having you attack with the image well though 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.220
 Overall it looks very beautiful 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:37.780
 There is an impression that the car Anou 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:40.560
 I'm greed It's a paint crack that is common to European cars 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:46.940
 Because it is not any such things 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:52.040
 That package is also very beautiful. 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.770
 It is because there is no gully wound of Koide because there is really no line 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.380
 So much this is a place that he cares 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.010
 There is a place that is small 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:06.629
 Big 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.629
 There is no such thing as a dent or scratch 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.799
 I think that the state is not very high beautiful 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.770
 I'm de ho brake dust something 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.100
 I'd or a fine I is that Tteyuu of like a not take anymore caked 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.440
 It is around that too 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.890
 The amount of money from this car amount is very high 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.790
 that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.830
 It is when you from the amount to which this soup to imagine 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.540
 There is a gap between the amount of money that the customer imagines and the meaning of this condition. 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:51.210
 It seems like 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:51.210
 Even though I want you to see Well, a little not after it is your car 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.610
 The condition of the interior is also unknown I don't know if you look at it with a camera . 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.909
 Also 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.770
 Let 's look at that sheet 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:10.440
 There are really few things like stagnant, especially this kind of bucket 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:13.280
 There are quite a lot of cars that the side of this side is crushed 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.709
 About this car was said that so 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.690
 I thing is running so Kokiriko 130,000 kilometers It is after it is a place that no 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:26.900
 But that's it 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:29.050
 The feeling of use seems to be 130,000 kilos at that imagined feeling of use or not at that time 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.710
 I might be 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.400
 As for this car, that kind of thing 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.700
 so much 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.180
 I do not have the impression that it is a running car 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.069
 It feels like 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.710
 It is probably a non-smoking car as there is no tobacco smell or anything else 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:52.300
 I think not 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:56.760
 Using the most I'd know that I am something also look at the state of it is the rear of the seat 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:00.950
 The condition of the seat not to feel like 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.800
 I think it a little school that there is no exaggeration to say that 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.430
 It is a living space of rear 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.240
 Well ride 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.400
 Well at all this long distance drive 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.160
 It is good 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.810
 It is quite spacious 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.010
 A little bit 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.790
 2 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:30.840
 So you I am that 1234 I'm sorry to 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:34.290
 Since the film is pasted properly, this is also actually purchased and the film of that child later 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:40.079
 There are quite a few orders to put on 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:44.159
 If it's a sedan, it's a three-sided sedan, but I'm sorry I'm sorry 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:47.890
 After all, this 30,000 Toka 40,000 Toka Toka it neatly that went so I'm coming with 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:50.580
 As it is enforced from the beginning, such 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.600
 I wonder if there are any concerns 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.340
 after 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.520
 After all because it is this kind of wagon type with this avant 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:05.610
 It is very wide also something that the rear of You're space 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:11.400
 If you often ride a wagon or something like this with a variety of hobbies 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.590
 It is also possible that there are few cars that are dirty and smelly behind. 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.799
 Absent 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.340
 Really, not so say the point of that negative in regard to do is I ne this car 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.430
 is not it 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.990
 I think that you are using very high beautifully 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.040
 I think 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:33.980
 I think 12 goals to sleep on the floor 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:33.980
 It feels like the scope of use is broadened because there is power supply and so on. 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.689
 It is the Atochotto engine 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.689
 I hope to see you 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.330
 eh 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.710
 th 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.800
 Hmm 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.800
 Perhaps 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.729
 I am 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.729
 That's it 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.050
 I'd like to put a little now engine Te 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:10.839
 Hmm 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.860
 of 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.760
 Wow 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:29.980
 You can watch the engine blowup in a very good condition. 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:34.180
 The room is too late to enter that port but keep it very clean 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:37.050
 I think you can see the condition from this area already 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.050
 think 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.340
 Hey 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.750
 You can see if you look at photos and various materials, but this hid 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.050
 It may be a headlight 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:52.200
 Even though I or fairly junior high school also bought becomes attached later 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.550
 After Since it has this with from the beginning 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.639
 etc etc 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.160
 Since the Toka or with the navigation rice cake 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.030
 A little 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.810
 Let's light it up 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.810
 I am 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:15.740
 It is this blue light, of course for inspection 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.740
 Become a headlight 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:29.010
 While running 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.010
 I will try to check the operation
