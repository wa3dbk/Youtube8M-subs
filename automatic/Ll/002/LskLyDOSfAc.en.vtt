00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
this is a user journey exploring a user

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.769 
this is a user journey exploring a user
is<00:00:15.929> going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.590> move<00:00:16.980> from<00:00:17.490> their<00:00:18.029> account<00:00:18.510> page

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
is going to move from their account page

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.529 
is going to move from their account page
check<00:00:19.439> their<00:00:19.859> eligibility<00:00:20.550> check<00:00:21.060> their<00:00:21.240> land

check their eligibility check their land
and<00:00:21.840> make<00:00:22.590> an<00:00:22.710> application<00:00:22.830> first<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:24.300> wanted

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
and make an application first we wanted

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.599 
and make an application first we wanted
to<00:00:24.779> see<00:00:25.320> where<00:00:25.529> they<00:00:25.619> were<00:00:25.710> coming<00:00:25.740> from<00:00:26.039> and

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
to see where they were coming from and

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.250 
to see where they were coming from and
we<00:00:26.730> wanted<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.090> check<00:00:27.359> if<00:00:27.630> they<00:00:27.779> were<00:00:27.840> eligible

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
we wanted to check if they were eligible

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.330 
we wanted to check if they were eligible
to<00:00:28.619> move<00:00:28.920> on

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
to move on

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.950 
to move on
once<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.789> know<00:00:29.880> they're<00:00:30.119> eligible<00:00:30.630> then<00:00:30.810> we

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
once we know they're eligible then we

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.810 
once we know they're eligible then we
need<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.199> gather<00:00:31.349> more<00:00:31.500> information<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.730> we

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
need to gather more information so we

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.060 
need to gather more information so we
just<00:00:33.030> do<00:00:33.210> some<00:00:33.420> quick<00:00:33.719> sketches<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.620> work<00:00:34.890> out

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
just do some quick sketches to work out

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.069 
just do some quick sketches to work out
roughly<00:00:35.610> how<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.390> user<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.719> going<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.930> get

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
roughly how the user is going to get

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.069 
roughly how the user is going to get
from<00:00:37.350> A<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> B<00:00:38.780> once<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:39.960> established

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
from A to B once you have established

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.590 
from A to B once you have established
the<00:00:40.920> rough<00:00:41.100> flow<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:42.270> we<00:00:42.300> start

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
the rough flow and then we start

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.420 
the rough flow and then we start
exploring<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.350> more<00:00:43.500> detail<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.160> start

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
exploring that in more detail we start

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.299 
exploring that in more detail we start
looking<00:00:45.329> at<00:00:45.719> each<00:00:46.079> screen<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> journey

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
looking at each screen in the journey

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.209 
looking at each screen in the journey
and<00:00:47.670> each<00:00:47.789> step<00:00:48.090> then<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:48.960> try<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.500> refine

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and each step then we try and refine

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.639 
and each step then we try and refine
those<00:00:50.700> steps<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.930> journey<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.410> as

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
those steps so that the journey is as

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.069 
those steps so that the journey is as
simple<00:00:53.070> as<00:00:53.129> possible<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.390> user<00:00:54.570> with<00:00:54.960> no

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
simple as possible for the user with no

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.069 
simple as possible for the user with no
complications<00:00:55.969> this<00:00:56.969> will<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.780> first

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
complications this will be the first

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.580 
complications this will be the first
page<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.579> user<00:00:59.820> will<00:01:00.300> land<00:01:00.840> up<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.320> check

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
page that the user will land up to check

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.460 
page that the user will land up to check
their<00:01:01.800> eligibility<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:03.420> still<00:01:03.750> keep<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.439> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
their eligibility and we still keep it a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.350 
their eligibility and we still keep it a
little<00:01:04.530> fidelity<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.610> stage<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:05.909> we

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
little fidelity at this stage so we

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.840 
little fidelity at this stage so we
don't<00:01:06.540> overcomplicate<00:01:07.140> or<00:01:07.770> worry<00:01:08.250> about<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
don't overcomplicate or worry about the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.910 
don't overcomplicate or worry about the
content<00:01:09.270> too<00:01:09.450> much<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.930> stage<00:01:10.170> we're

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
content too much at this stage we're

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.429 
content too much at this stage we're
just<00:01:11.100> still<00:01:11.310> trying<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.700> work<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.750> flow<00:01:12.990> we

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
just still trying to work on the flow we

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.320 
just still trying to work on the flow we
have<00:01:13.590> determined<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.310> landing<00:01:15.060> page

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
have determined that this landing page

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.940 
have determined that this landing page
will<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.380> beach<00:01:16.590> farm<00:01:16.950> page<00:01:18.830> then<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
will be the beach farm page then the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.190 
will be the beach farm page then the
user<00:01:20.130> goes<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.030> countryside<00:01:21.390> stewardship

or eliminate them from the application

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.270 
or eliminate them from the application
process<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.259> once<00:01:40.470> they've<00:01:40.680> completed<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
process so once they've completed the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.460 
process so once they've completed the
six<00:01:41.490> questions<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:42.270> set<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.630> rules<00:01:42.840> were<00:01:43.020> run<00:01:43.259> in

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
six questions a set of rules were run in

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.289 
six questions a set of rules were run in
the<00:01:43.649> background<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.460> will<00:01:44.670> allow<00:01:45.149> us<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the background that will allow us to

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.300 
the background that will allow us to
determine<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:46.290> eligibility<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> user

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
determine the eligibility of the user

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.889 
determine the eligibility of the user
once<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.549> they're<00:01:50.790> eligible<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.750> we

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
once we know they're eligible then we

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.450 
once we know they're eligible then we
need<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.140> find<00:01:52.320> out<00:01:52.439> more<00:01:52.649> information<00:01:52.920> about

need to find out more information about
their<00:01:53.820> holding<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.390> they<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.750> define<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
their holding so they have to define the

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
and the features on each Pig so they can

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.840 
and the features on each Pig so they can
as<00:02:00.080> we<00:02:00.560> need<00:02:00.710> present<00:02:01.070> them<00:02:01.190> with<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.370> map<00:02:01.640> and
