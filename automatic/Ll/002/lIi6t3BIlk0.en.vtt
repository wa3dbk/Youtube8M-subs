that you can make a small batch at a

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.199 
that you can make a small batch at a
time<00:02:42.740> that's<00:02:43.740> generally<00:02:44.220> how<00:02:44.250> r<00:02:44.430> do<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:47.209> then

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
time that's generally how r do it then

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
they're like a 32 ounce size jar so that

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.690 
they're like a 32 ounce size jar so that
i<00:04:12.720> can<00:04:12.780> keep<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.200> mixture<00:04:13.770> inside<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.490> jar

i can keep the mixture inside the jar

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.340 
i can keep the mixture inside the jar
after<00:04:15.210> I've<00:04:15.390> whipped<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.310> also<00:04:17.310> on<00:04:18.350> you

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
after I've whipped it and also on you

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.350 
after I've whipped it and also on you
can<00:04:19.530> store<00:04:19.830> this<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.489> refrigerator<00:04:20.610> so

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
can store this in the refrigerator so

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.270 
can store this in the refrigerator so
that<00:04:21.390> it<00:04:21.630> can<00:04:21.780> last<00:04:21.989> longer<00:04:22.350> this<00:04:23.100> will

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
that it can last longer this will

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.410 
that it can last longer this will
probably<00:04:23.490> last<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:24.420> good<00:04:24.780> year<00:04:25.820> if<00:04:26.820> it's<00:04:27.120> kept

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
probably last a good year if it's kept

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.270 
probably last a good year if it's kept
in<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.930> refrigerator<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:30.350> it<00:04:31.350> with<00:04:31.650> not<00:04:32.010> in<00:04:32.190> the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
in a refrigerator and it with not in the

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.520 
in a refrigerator and it with not in the
refrigerator<00:04:32.850> under<00:04:33.270> temperatures<00:04:33.780> of<00:04:33.990> 72

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
refrigerator under temperatures of 72

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.290 
refrigerator under temperatures of 72
degrees<00:04:37.070> so<00:04:38.070> i'll<00:04:38.220> just<00:04:38.250> start<00:04:38.940> this<00:04:39.150> where

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
degrees so i'll just start this where

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.690 
degrees so i'll just start this where
far<00:04:42.300> with<00:04:42.570> it

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.210 

just<00:04:45.300> make<00:04:45.540> sure<00:04:45.570> that<00:04:45.900> everything<00:04:46.380> is<00:04:46.590> going

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
just make sure that everything is going

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:55.570 
just make sure that everything is going
to<00:04:47.370> be<00:04:47.430> compliant<00:04:48.000> to<00:04:48.420> mind<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:49.670> differently

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.540 

right<00:04:56.580> now<00:04:56.730> looks<00:04:57.030> kind<00:04:57.360> of<00:04:57.420> less<00:04:57.660> you<00:04:57.870> like<00:04:58.550> so

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
right now looks kind of less you like so

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.380 
right now looks kind of less you like so
what<00:04:59.790> I'll<00:04:59.910> do<00:05:00.320> now<00:05:01.320> is<00:05:01.350> all<00:05:01.800> with<00:05:02.040> it<00:05:02.220> so<00:05:03.180> I<00:05:03.210> can

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
what I'll do now is all with it so I can

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:11.370 
what I'll do now is all with it so I can
get<00:05:03.570> like<00:05:03.720> a<00:05:03.870> creamy<00:05:04.230> texture<00:05:04.710> to<00:05:04.980> it

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380
