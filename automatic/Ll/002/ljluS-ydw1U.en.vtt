00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.310
 take care of this tutorial let's see a little the theory that is the hair in 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.369
 these days we have seen now is how to apply dyes smokes on the tables more 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.070
 collected but we really know what is the hair eh &amp; e that is composed 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.820
 because we are blonde because they are brown because they do not come out the faces I come back 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.260
 this is going to this tutorial we are going to comment to know what that good endeavor the hair 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.050
 on its outside and I say on the outside more inside the pri as far as I know on 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.469
 the outside is a damage strands lifeless 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:49.990
 constituted essentially 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.190
 for the sum of proteins that most of them currently lived 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.559
 trace elements 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.609
 mahuad pigment and these good substances will receive in the lifeless stage 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.440
 because many times I've heard comments that 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.300
 for example that in fairs 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.660
 that silicones p initially good hair let's see 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.390
 Peru is dead neighborhood painted state and from within in the follicle 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.140
 hairy but what is all the morning the hair is dead in three not so 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.170
 Well, talk about it 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.770
 everything can let him not breathe because he does not breathe, it's worth sun 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.659
 has life if you say life gives us joys and the spokeswoman attached paths 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.500
 good bases 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.760
 It's a lifeless filament on the outside where I studied where you have to nourish 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.330
 I send you for the hair to grow strong discomfort the life 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.450
 the center in the hair follicle 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.880
 good hair growth the love that feels a centimeter to 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.020
 centimeter and a half per month exquisite street around 1 60 in cabins at 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.650
 day 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.450
 he is always more than striking the fall 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.039
 the black and long hair that is instead short and blond once more in a 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.890
 striking but 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.340
 when in a squat venezuela pulling 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.420
 well, there are calls for attention 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.860
 for a long black hair that cross that being the most is more scandalous than 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.760
 the normal little ball between 80 between the teeth we worry about is if it's daytime 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.520
 and without these they have to change their hair then it is also important to save 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.140
 know if the hair that has fallen is reappearing is very 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.500
 important that if you pass the grains through the scalp and b6 crespins antella 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.840
 escorts that you're tagged are you and the one that is coming out that affection that's been 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.919
 fallen 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:37.669
 what are you going to put money 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:42.779
 let's see a little bit also the phases the hair up to mind are three phases in 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:44.020
 the ana gem phase 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.540
 Cartagena in the final 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.570
 let's see a little that escaped to walk aracena 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:55.619
 in this phase are the streets in full performance in this phase hard network 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:59.669
 of stores and six years that is the time that will be valid per cent between 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:00.949
 two and six years 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:06.229
 in the hair fall is shorter in the frontal area than you have about two 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:10.179
 years this phase of growth and longer in the approval phase does 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.890
 shiver 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.819
 she sings the six years that this growth phase happens many times we have 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.090
 more of the cortitos here in the day to art that a year ago that's why it's 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.240
 because they are less time growing there is based on the strategy 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.710
 and Carlos did not reach - length in the back area was a flag 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.270
 do not miss Cartagena 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.869
 is closer and is at rest until a hand is 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:39.860
 phase in which hair rests 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.860
 and we're going to the patient dinner 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:49.439
 in this phase the eternal peace of others is when the hair is detached 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.569
 that the pony club knows and the hair street 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.329
 these are the three phases of he life of hair 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:01.110
 let's see now the exchange rates that we find in terms of form 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.620
 we have straight hair type dyn individualize peak that is stabilized 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.920
 We have established explained that it is the wavy stolen and in a short time that 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.920
 they are very curly 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:23.389
 hair treatments can be classified into four types the normal 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.229
 dry fatty ix normal hair is here in my house at a glance 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.020
 to serrano that these usually have too much married and is not dry from their 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.340
 bright hair for your normal hair 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.099
 It's worth the dry look is without you 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.839
 and I bankruptcy has said and on the scalp put same for a hundred with little 

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:44.900
 grease 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.330
 is a cigarette or the same thing teaches them a dry hair 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.650
 then we have the oily hair the appearance of oily hair as very 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.740
 bright grass all for pasture or 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.680
 stuck scalp and on the scalp the look then is that 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.839
 he like many shined with a lot of fat 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:06.639
 after we found them close to them mixed out that queréndaro 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.639
 aspect would be very bright for the scalp to jiménez and tips for 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.800
 13 glasses quoted brittle that would be the minister's hair 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.279
 mulet who is in charge 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:22.410
 that the troops are not blond brown is the one who says this 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.580
 Well, it looked like melanin 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.719
 melanin is the name that receives the pigment 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.499
 percent who know you to him in the eyes 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:34.499
 and here they 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.729
 with the main function of melanin 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.089
 is acting as a protective barrier against the sun's rays so when we go to 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:45.430
 the beach or the summer we get dark 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.009
 it's because the melanin that the French manufacturer hospitals 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.839
 that character that distrust that to protect it from the solar rays 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.229
 well there are many types of melamine melanin fabra that man 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.719
 they provide the dark pigments in the snowy chestnuts and faith though 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:05.800
 the league the most curious 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.310
 which is loaded with dickens provide light colors and so bad 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.719
 and so the redhead 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:16.050
 ee the mixture of these two types of melanin are the ones that this one tell you 

00:06:16.049 --> 00:06:20.180
 then the variety that there are people who respect the truth 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.499
 so we are darker to more claritas 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:26.799
 well here it happens with the courts because they do not have with the masks because 

00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:31.429
 knows the date those gray hairs good as this happens when the factory grows with 

00:06:31.429 --> 00:06:35.429
 melamine in then there are no melanocytes fields of color and that's why the hair is 

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:36.759
 turns white 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:37.979
 year 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:39.680
 the 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.060
 According to said that it is a young age when faces do not come out, bodies have nothing 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.760
 to see if the logical thing syria what with eta is already atrophying the 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:50.300
 Melanin stops producing 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:56.110
 but he will always be present and the young man with marbles does not pass anything this is 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.960
 this way it stops producing melanin and shouts come out the little straw 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:07.830
 basically they will be drinking what it is since it is the ringleader 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.740
 the types of changes there are two types of scalp colors 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.230
 the phase of life 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.330
 good team to which this tutorial because from now on we go towards a new 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.919
 capillary problems section and we'll talk 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:22.020
 I would like you to drop the grease jacket 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.349
 but what I did think was right that the first one video art explaining that 

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:30.159
 is that the hair is the way so we do not know them much better 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:34.460
 he then just say to this for having patience in that they were finally 

00:07:34.459 --> 00:07:37.759
 I have a hard time answering it because I do not feel like answering 

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:41.789
 but because I do not have barely time that caters with the summer holidays it 

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:43.300
 complicates a bit more 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.929
 but the Italians have answered our doubts to other comments 

00:07:46.929 --> 00:07:52.179
 the rest I promise not to have left I know that you are there stresses the control 

00:07:52.179 --> 00:07:54.969
 Count mentioned the Tibetans that is undue Saturday
