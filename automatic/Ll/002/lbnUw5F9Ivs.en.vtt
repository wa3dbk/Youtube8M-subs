I<00:00:36.020> wanted<00:00:36.980> to<00:00:37.100> talk<00:00:37.310> about<00:00:37.340> zero<00:00:37.910> point<00:00:38.300> energy

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
I wanted to talk about zero point energy

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.650 
I wanted to talk about zero point energy
I've<00:00:40.160> been<00:00:40.310> doing<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.640> lot<00:00:40.820> of<00:00:40.880> research<00:00:41.420> you

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
I've been doing a lot of research you

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.200 
I've been doing a lot of research you
know<00:00:41.810> when<00:00:42.080> you're<00:00:42.920> really<00:00:43.760> have<00:00:43.940> illnesses

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
know when you're really have illnesses

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.960 
know when you're really have illnesses
you<00:00:44.570> always<00:00:45.170> sudden<00:00:45.440> start<00:00:45.740> to<00:00:45.950> really<00:00:46.430> pay

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
you always sudden start to really pay

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.480 
you always sudden start to really pay
more<00:00:47.240> attention<00:00:47.720> to<00:00:47.750> your<00:00:48.020> health<00:00:48.290> and<00:00:48.530> try<00:00:49.430> to

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
more attention to your health and try to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.090 
more attention to your health and try to
get<00:00:49.730> information<00:00:49.910> that's<00:00:50.540> what<00:00:50.720> I<00:00:50.750> did<00:00:50.990> so<00:00:51.710> I

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
get information that's what I did so I

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.880 
get information that's what I did so I
wanted<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:52.520> share<00:00:52.820> with<00:00:52.880> you<00:00:53.890> something

that's<00:00:55.190> very<00:00:55.280> real<00:00:55.730> for<00:00:56.030> me<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.390> it<00:00:56.600> is<00:00:56.900> that

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
that's very real for me and it is that

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.760 
that's very real for me and it is that
zero<00:00:57.530> point<00:00:57.890> energy<00:00:58.070> I<00:00:59.050> walk<00:01:00.050> down<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.440> street

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
zero point energy I walk down the street

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.740 
zero point energy I walk down the street
I<00:01:00.950> could<00:01:01.220> feel<00:01:01.430> my<00:01:01.489> legs<00:01:01.880> feeling<00:01:02.360> a<00:01:02.540> little

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
I could feel my legs feeling a little

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.560 
I could feel my legs feeling a little
heavy<00:01:02.989> right<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:03.739> I'm<00:01:03.829> like<00:01:04.009> okay<00:01:04.210> all<00:01:05.210> i<00:01:05.239> have

heavy right and I'm like okay all i have
to<00:01:05.600> do<00:01:05.869> is<00:01:06.079> tap<00:01:06.350> into<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:06.800> zero<00:01:07.430> point<00:01:07.670> energy

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
to do is tap into that zero point energy

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.120 
to do is tap into that zero point energy
which<00:01:08.150> is<00:01:08.360> all<00:01:08.630> around<00:01:08.990> us<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:09.530> all<00:01:09.770> we<00:01:09.800> have

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
which is all around us and all we have

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.430 
which is all around us and all we have
to<00:01:10.280> do<00:01:10.460> is<00:01:10.700> just<00:01:10.970> know<00:01:11.210> how<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.479> tap<00:01:11.810> into<00:01:12.050> it

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
to do is just know how to tap into it

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.440 
to do is just know how to tap into it
and<00:01:13.270> that's<00:01:14.270> what<00:01:14.450> i<00:01:14.570> do<00:01:14.720> if<00:01:15.200> i<00:01:15.800> feel<00:01:15.830> myself

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
and that's what i do if i feel myself

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.219 
and that's what i do if i feel myself
feeling<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:18.170> know<00:01:18.320> more<00:01:18.760> unsteady<00:01:19.760> or<00:01:20.270> if<00:01:20.900> I'm

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
feeling you know more unsteady or if I'm

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.910 
feeling you know more unsteady or if I'm
just<00:01:22.240> feeling<00:01:23.240> heavy<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:23.990> only<00:01:24.260> have<00:01:24.470> msu

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
just feeling heavy and only have msu

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.070 
just feeling heavy and only have msu
legs<00:01:25.159> just<00:01:25.370> feel<00:01:25.580> like<00:01:25.729> like<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.299> ton<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.659> bricks

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
legs just feel like like a ton of bricks

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.510 
legs just feel like like a ton of bricks
don't<00:01:27.440> you<00:01:27.620> know<00:01:27.710> they<00:01:27.860> don't<00:01:27.979> feel<00:01:28.280> like

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
don't you know they don't feel like

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.070 
don't you know they don't feel like
flesh<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.120> blood<00:01:29.330> anymore<00:01:29.540> just<00:01:29.750> feels<00:01:30.020> like

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
flesh and blood anymore just feels like

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.789 
flesh and blood anymore just feels like
wood<00:01:30.530> or<00:01:30.560> something<00:01:31.090> so<00:01:32.090> I<00:01:32.630> just<00:01:33.260> tapped<00:01:33.560> into

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
wood or something so I just tapped into

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.700 
wood or something so I just tapped into
the<00:01:34.070> energy<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:34.909> I<00:01:35.540> can't<00:01:35.930> tell<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:36.440> exactly

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
the energy and I can't tell you exactly

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.230 
the energy and I can't tell you exactly
how<00:01:37.549> to<00:01:37.820> do<00:01:38.299> it<00:01:38.510> but<00:01:39.409> just<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.890> your

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
how to do it but just that your

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.000 
how to do it but just that your
intention<00:01:41.240> is<00:01:41.420> there<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:41.990> just<00:01:42.229> knowing<00:01:42.560> that

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
it is there for you it's not just in the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.030 
it is there for you it's not just in the
drugs<00:01:47.060> it's<00:01:47.330> not<00:01:47.510> in<00:01:47.750> anything<00:01:48.080> it's<00:01:48.530> just<00:01:48.619> all

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
drugs it's not in anything it's just all

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.320 
drugs it's not in anything it's just all
over<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:50.229> zero<00:01:51.229> point<00:01:51.760> another<00:01:52.760> important

over and zero point another important
point<00:01:53.510> one<00:01:53.720> in<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:53.960> but<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:54.380> know<00:01:55.150> zero<00:01:56.150> point

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
point one in it but you know zero point

what<00:02:03.049> are<00:02:03.229> they<00:02:03.350> talking<00:02:03.530> about<00:02:04.040> so<00:02:04.310> I<00:02:04.340> found

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
what are they talking about so I found

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.370 
what are they talking about so I found
something<00:02:04.939> yesterday<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:05.780> read<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.200> I

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
something yesterday and I read it and I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.660 
something yesterday and I read it and I
really<00:02:06.770> understood<00:02:07.159> it<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.430> was<00:02:07.490> like

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
really understood it and it was like

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.899 
really understood it and it was like
damn<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.539> was<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.500> happy<00:02:09.769> now<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:10.459> really

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
damn I was so happy now I really

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.649 
damn I was so happy now I really
understand<00:02:11.419> zero<00:02:11.749> point<00:02:12.139> zero<00:02:12.469> point<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.730> the

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
understand zero point zero point is the

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.449 
understand zero point zero point is the
opposite

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
opposite

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.809 
opposite
when<00:02:17.459> things<00:02:17.730> start<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> go<00:02:18.510> bad<00:02:18.769> when<00:02:19.819> when

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
when things start to go bad when when

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.990 
when things start to go bad when when
things<00:02:21.150> just<00:02:21.239> go<00:02:21.810> like<00:02:22.170> God<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:23.129> know<00:02:23.280> entropy

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
things just go like God you know entropy

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.479 
things just go like God you know entropy
it's<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.599> opposite<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.200> entropy<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:26.160> look<00:02:26.370> up

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
it's the opposite of entropy so look up

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.890 
it's the opposite of entropy so look up
entropy<00:02:27.030> entr<00:02:27.540> Oh<00:02:27.690> phy<00:02:28.970> it's<00:02:29.970> it's<00:02:30.330> going<00:02:30.660> the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
entropy entr Oh phy it's it's going the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.920 
entropy entr Oh phy it's it's going the
other<00:02:30.930> way<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:32.129> the<00:02:32.340> beginning<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.450> point

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
other way to the beginning to the point

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.619 
other way to the beginning to the point
in<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.349> beginning<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.640> works<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.420> not

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
in the beginning so it works it's not

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.190 
in the beginning so it works it's not
hocus<00:02:37.110> pocus<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:38.370> really<00:02:38.879> works<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:40.019> can

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
hocus pocus it really works and you can

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.380 
hocus pocus it really works and you can
find<00:02:40.560> books<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.129> it<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.519> believe<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.239> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
find books on it I believe that the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.080 
find books on it I believe that the
Reconnective<00:02:43.110> energy<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.799> just<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.790> just

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
Reconnective energy is just it just

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.380 
Reconnective energy is just it just
opens<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.930> up<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.430> being<00:02:47.430> able<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.940> tap<00:02:48.360> into

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
opens you up to being able to tap into

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.770 
opens you up to being able to tap into
that<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:49.410> helps<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.370> remember<00:02:51.060> on<00:02:51.720> a

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
that it helps you to remember on a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.630 
that it helps you to remember on a
cellular<00:02:52.410> level<00:02:52.769> how<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:55.400> just<00:02:56.400> like

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
cellular level how to just just like

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.350 
cellular level how to just just like

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
powers-that-be can take that away from

powers-that-be can take that away from

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
you like the m1 like I'm wearing this

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.880 
you like the m1 like I'm wearing this
zero<00:03:14.250> point<00:03:14.579> pendant<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.510> think<00:03:16.440> it's<00:03:16.620> pretty

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
zero point pendant I think it's pretty

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.610 
zero point pendant I think it's pretty
you<00:03:17.549> know<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.260> all<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.440> does<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:20.000> give<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.329> a

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
you know and all it does is give you a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.580 
you know and all it does is give you a
sense<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.889> how<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.489> was<00:03:23.670> your<00:03:24.030> body<00:03:24.299> how<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.410> was

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
sense of how it was your body how it was

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.809 
sense of how it was your body how it was
before<00:03:26.420> so<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.750> fourth<00:03:28.079> dimension<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.709> time

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
before so that fourth dimension of time

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.729 
before so that fourth dimension of time
kicks<00:03:29.819> in<00:03:30.030> with<00:03:30.299> zero<00:03:30.540> point<00:03:30.840> energy<00:03:30.989> all<00:03:31.500> it

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
kicks in with zero point energy all it

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.879 
kicks in with zero point energy all it
does<00:03:31.920> is<00:03:32.069> takes<00:03:32.370> fact<00:03:32.819> i'm<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:34.290> time<00:03:34.319> when

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
does is takes fact i'm so the time when

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.370 
does is takes fact i'm so the time when
your<00:03:35.040> cells<00:03:35.670> were<00:03:35.910> healthy<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.510> time<00:03:36.750> when

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
your cells were healthy the time when

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.890 
your cells were healthy the time when
you<00:03:37.590> were<00:03:37.709> happier<00:03:38.190> they<00:03:38.489> just<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.420> goes<00:03:39.599> back

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
you were happier they just it goes back

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.259 
you were happier they just it goes back
into<00:03:40.109> time<00:03:40.440> that's<00:03:40.709> as<00:03:40.920> simple<00:03:41.160> as<00:03:41.609> i<00:03:41.790> can<00:03:42.000> put

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
into time that's as simple as i can put

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.259 
into time that's as simple as i can put
it<00:03:42.650> zero-point<00:03:43.650> means<00:03:43.920> going<00:03:44.280> back<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
it zero-point means going back to the

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.059 
it zero-point means going back to the
beginning<00:03:45.480> going<00:03:46.470> back<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.950> beginning

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
beginning going back to the beginning

beginning going back to the beginning
when<00:03:47.519> things<00:03:47.549> were<00:03:48.090> just<00:03:48.389> pure<00:03:49.169> energy<00:03:49.500> pure

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
beginning for you you know before things

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.940 
beginning for you you know before things
went<00:03:56.910> crazy<00:03:57.889> so<00:03:58.889> i<00:03:59.690> have<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.829> know

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
went crazy so i have the the you know

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.870 
went crazy so i have the the you know
the<00:04:02.160> am<00:04:02.400> one<00:04:02.760> thing<00:04:03.169> it<00:04:04.169> comes<00:04:04.799> in<00:04:05.010> here<00:04:05.370> where

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
is it here i found my wand i actually

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.530 
is it here i found my wand i actually
got<00:04:09.660> two<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:10.079> these<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.620> got<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.160> yashi<00:04:11.609> and<00:04:12.120> I<00:04:12.329> got
