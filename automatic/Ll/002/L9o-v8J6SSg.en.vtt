00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.380 

so<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.890> idea<00:02:07.040> with<00:02:07.369> these<00:02:07.549> cocktails<00:02:07.970> is<00:02:08.209> to

so the idea with these cocktails is to

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.900 
so the idea with these cocktails is to
produce<00:02:08.599> something<00:02:08.989> that<00:02:09.590> enhances<00:02:10.340> the

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
produce something that enhances the
