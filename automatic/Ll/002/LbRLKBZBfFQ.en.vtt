it<00:00:39.510> firmly<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:40.020> place<00:00:40.050> we<00:00:40.950> do<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.250> by<00:00:41.460> moving

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
it firmly in place we do this by moving

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.250 
it firmly in place we do this by moving
our<00:00:41.850> needle<00:00:42.210> forwards<00:00:42.660> through<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> next

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
pearl on the string and then we run the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.760 
pearl on the string and then we run the
needle<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.570> between<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> two<00:00:46.289> strands<00:00:46.620> of
