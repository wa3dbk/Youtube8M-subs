00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.160 
or anything like that and if you're
wondering<00:02:18.680> why<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.069> used<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.640> label<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.720> put<00:02:20.750> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
wondering why I used a label to put the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.100 
wondering why I used a label to put the
boiling<00:02:21.860> water<00:02:22.069> into<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:22.910> cast<00:02:23.150> iron<00:02:23.450> is

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
boiling water into the cast iron is

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.530 
boiling water into the cast iron is
because<00:02:24.590> if<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:24.980> put<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.790> tea<00:02:26.000> kettle<00:02:26.209> water

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
because if you put the tea kettle water

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.930 
because if you put the tea kettle water
directly<00:02:27.410> into<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:28.040> cast<00:02:28.250> iron<00:02:28.549> you<00:02:28.760> have<00:02:28.910> a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
directly into the cast iron you have a

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.600 
directly into the cast iron you have a
chance<00:02:29.239> of<00:02:29.390> burning<00:02:29.599> your<00:02:29.870> hands<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.610> this

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
chance of burning your hands and this

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.729
