00:00:08.364 --> 00:00:11.012
There's a lot of talk
about flossing these days.

00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:13.322
With new products
and evidence showing

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:16.100
the importance of flossing
to the health of your mouth

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.194
as well as the
rest of your body.

00:00:18.194 --> 00:00:21.930
So which method of
flossing is most effective?

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.470
Over the years, I've seen a
lot of information and research

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.890
about the Waterpik® Water
Flosser and its effectiveness.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.850
And just the fact that there's
so many research studies

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.880
behind it, so many years of
experience in effectiveness,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.800
it makes me very confident in
recommending it for patients.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.830
In study after study, the
Waterpik® Water Flosser

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.710
has been proven to be the
most effective way to floss.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.290
The Waterpik® Water
Flosser removes up

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.690
to 99.9% of plaque biofilm
from treated areas.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.190
You apply the Waterpik® to
plaque on a surface of a tooth,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.690
and you look with a scanning
scope, and it's gone.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.190
It's simply gone.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.050
And that's unequivocal
and unarguable.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.520
The Water Flosser
was up to 50% more

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.400
effective at reversing
gingivitis and improving

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.300
gum health, compared
to string floss.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.160
And was up to three
times as effective

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.190
as flossing for plaque
removal in people with braces.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.450
We've been using the Waterpik®
in our practice for 25 years.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.275
And the research that
I've seen on Waterpik®

00:01:24.275 --> 00:01:26.640
certainly backs up
the clinical efficacy

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.100
that's been apparent
to us over the years.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.630
The results are clear.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.650
The water flosser is
unquestionably easier and more

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.600
effective than string floss.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.040
But what about Air Floss?

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.040
In a 28-day study, the
Waterpik® Water Flosser

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.600
was found to be up to 80%
more effective than Sonicare®

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.400
Air Floss at reducing
gingivitis, and up to 70%

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.415
more effective for
plaque reduction.

00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:54.740
When I saw, subsequently,
the results comparing

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.460
water flossing to air flossing,
I was not at all surprised.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.180
They simply bore
out the conclusions

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.420
that I have come
to in my own mouth.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.780
And best of all, water
flossing is easy.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.110
It takes just a minute a day,
and leaves your mouth feeling

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.380
clean and fresh.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.000
They'll have stacks and
stacks of free floss

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.460
that I've given them for years,
and they're not using it.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.510
But they will use
the water flosser.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.189
When patients ask me,
do I have to floss?

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:22.980
I'll tell them, no.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.370
I don't floss.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.910
And they look shocked, because
here's a hygienist telling

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.530
them, "I don't floss."

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.520
But at the same time, I
always chase that with a,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.830
"but I use a Waterpik.®"

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.462
The Waterpik® Water Flosser.

00:02:35.462 --> 00:02:39.040
The easy and more
effective way to floss.
