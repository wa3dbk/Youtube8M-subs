00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.940 

so<00:02:14.420> I'm<00:02:14.750> not<00:02:14.930> trying<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.260> torture<00:02:15.620> them<00:02:15.740> over

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
so I'm not trying to torture them over

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.350 
so I'm not trying to torture them over
here<00:02:16.190> I<00:02:16.220> just<00:02:16.430> had<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.700> move<00:02:16.850> them<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.240> could

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
here I just had to move them so I could

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.040 
here I just had to move them so I could
give<00:02:17.570> them<00:02:17.720> into<00:02:17.930> new<00:02:18.200> towel<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:20.810> think

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
give them into new towel and I think

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.630 
give them into new towel and I think
he's<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.440> only<00:02:21.500> one<00:02:21.860> whose<00:02:22.100> eyes<00:02:22.280> actually

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
he's the only one whose eyes actually

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.950 
he's the only one whose eyes actually
open<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:23.870> far<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.580> just<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.850> one<00:02:26.180> little<00:02:26.510> eye

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
open so far so just that one little eye

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:35.010 
open so far so just that one little eye
and<00:02:28.210> he<00:02:29.210> probably<00:02:29.780> can't<00:02:30.260> see<00:02:30.500> much<00:02:30.710> out<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.160> it

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.530 

just<00:02:36.020> probably<00:02:36.410> still<00:02:36.980> seeing<00:02:37.490> light<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:38.209> don't

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
just probably still seeing light I don't

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.530 
just probably still seeing light I don't
know<00:02:38.720> if<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:38.900> could<00:02:39.050> tell<00:02:39.440> but<00:02:40.330> his<00:02:41.330> little

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
know if you could tell but his little

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.390 
know if you could tell but his little
eye<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:41.750> blue<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:43.630> think<00:02:44.630> probably<00:02:45.530> means<00:02:46.130> that

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
eye is blue I think probably means that

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.220 
eye is blue I think probably means that
he<00:02:46.790> can't<00:02:47.060> really<00:02:47.300> see<00:02:47.690> yet<00:02:47.900> but<00:02:48.080> he's

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
he can't really see yet but he's

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.760 
he can't really see yet but he's
probably<00:02:48.520> detecting<00:02:49.570> like<00:02:50.570> lights<00:02:51.290> he<00:02:51.620> can

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
probably detecting like lights he can

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.140 
probably detecting like lights he can
see<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.160> something's<00:02:52.550> bright<00:02:52.820> or

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
see that something's bright or

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.710 
see that something's bright or
something's<00:02:53.510> dark<00:02:55.390> that's<00:02:56.390> probably<00:02:56.630> the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
something's dark that's probably the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.140 
something's dark that's probably the
extent<00:02:57.080> of<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.320> for<00:02:57.560> him<00:02:57.739> but<00:02:57.920> soon<00:02:58.640> he'll<00:02:59.120> be

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
extent of it for him but soon he'll be

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.720 
extent of it for him but soon he'll be
able<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.570> see<00:02:59.900> actual<00:03:00.610> shapes<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.970> colors<00:03:02.450> and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
able to see actual shapes and colors and

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.160 
able to see actual shapes and colors and
again<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.850> zooming<00:03:05.150> Katzie<00:03:05.540> colors<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:06.020> don't

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
course mom is outside and that's why I

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.590 
course mom is outside and that's why I
felt<00:03:57.980> comfortable<00:03:58.430> taking<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.910> opportunity

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
felt comfortable taking the opportunity

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.490 
felt comfortable taking the opportunity
to<00:03:59.720> switch<00:03:59.870> the<00:04:00.170> towels<00:04:01.959> but<00:04:02.959> hopefully<00:04:03.380> one

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
to switch the towels but hopefully one

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.930 
to switch the towels but hopefully one

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
all looking for something to eat I

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.580 
all looking for something to eat I
really<00:04:08.690> might<00:04:08.870> just<00:04:09.049> want<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.260> be<00:04:09.320> left<00:04:09.470> alone

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
really might just want to be left alone

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.170 
really might just want to be left alone
as<00:04:09.829> that<00:04:09.920> they<00:04:10.010> can<00:04:10.160> sleep<00:04:11.560> anyway<00:04:13.180> somebody's

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
as that they can sleep anyway somebody's

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.240 
as that they can sleep anyway somebody's
starting<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:14.570> open<00:04:14.630> up<00:04:14.900> an<00:04:15.079> eye<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.769> I<00:04:16.040> thought

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
starting to open up an eye and I thought
