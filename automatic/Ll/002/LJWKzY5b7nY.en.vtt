00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
your TV speakers you're missing out on

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.700 
your TV speakers you're missing out on
half<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.129> experience<00:00:38.530> basically<00:00:39.530> you're

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
half the experience basically you're

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.209 
half the experience basically you're
settling<00:00:40.159> for<00:00:40.219> this<00:00:41.620> when<00:00:42.620> you<00:00:42.739> could<00:00:43.069> be

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
settling for this when you could be

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:44.770 
settling for this when you could be
feeling<00:00:43.579> like<00:00:43.760> you're<00:00:43.969> in<00:00:43.999> the<00:00:44.149> middle<00:00:44.359> of<00:00:44.659> the

feeling like you're in the middle of the
action<00:00:44.989> like<00:00:45.649> this<00:00:49.719> so<00:00:50.719> why<00:00:51.199> wouldn't<00:00:51.619> you

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:51.709 
action like this so why wouldn't you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:53.219 
action like this so why wouldn't you
want<00:00:51.920> a<00:00:51.979> home<00:00:52.100> theater<00:00:52.429> experience

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
want a home theater experience

well<00:00:54.229> conventional<00:00:55.219> home<00:00:55.399> theater<00:00:55.699> systems

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
well conventional home theater systems

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.689 
well conventional home theater systems
can<00:00:56.299> be<00:00:56.420> difficult<00:00:56.869> to<00:00:56.989> set<00:00:57.170> up<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:57.559> use<00:00:57.739> you

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
can be difficult to set up and use you

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.219 
can be difficult to set up and use you
need<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:58.969> find<00:00:59.149> space<00:00:59.510> for<00:00:59.539> five<00:00:59.989> different

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
need to find space for five different

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.229 
need to find space for five different
speakers<00:01:00.829> and<00:01:01.729> then<00:01:01.879> there's<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.209> challenge

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
speakers and then there's the challenge

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.209 
speakers and then there's the challenge
of<00:01:02.779> running<00:01:02.929> wires<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.619> the<00:01:03.709> back<00:01:03.889> of<00:01:04.070> your

of running wires to the back of your

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:07.020 
of running wires to the back of your
room<00:01:04.539> what<00:01:05.539> if<00:01:05.659> there<00:01:05.780> was<00:01:05.930> an<00:01:06.049> easier<00:01:06.350> way

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
room what if there was an easier way

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.980

on TV in really full life like the tail
so<00:01:25.909> how<00:01:26.090> does<00:01:26.149> a<00:01:26.299> simple<00:01:26.719> system<00:01:26.899> like<00:01:27.109> this

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
so how does a simple system like this

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.349 
so how does a simple system like this
deliver<00:01:27.829> that<00:01:28.009> spacious<00:01:28.549> sound<00:01:28.759> experience

tells us where a sound is coming from

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.690 
tells us where a sound is coming from
then<00:02:09.019> we<00:02:09.080> can<00:02:09.379> use<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.560> knowledge<00:02:10.159> along

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
then we can use that knowledge along
