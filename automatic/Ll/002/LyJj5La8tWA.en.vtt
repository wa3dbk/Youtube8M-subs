00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
process by which money is created is so

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.560 
process by which money is created is so
simple<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.199> mind<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.649> repelled<00:00:41.480> what<00:00:42.480> he

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
simple that the mind is repelled what he

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.779 
simple that the mind is repelled what he
meant<00:00:42.809> was<00:00:42.989> even<00:00:43.530> after<00:00:44.100> hearing<00:00:44.339> how<00:00:44.550> money

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
meant was even after hearing how money

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.180 
meant was even after hearing how money
is<00:00:44.879> actually<00:00:45.480> created<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.499> still<00:00:46.800> won't<00:00:47.010> want

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
is actually created you still won't want

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.939 
is actually created you still won't want
to<00:00:47.249> believe<00:00:47.339> it<00:00:48.230> so<00:00:49.230> if<00:00:49.319> you<00:00:49.409> don't<00:00:49.530> get<00:00:49.739> this

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
to believe it so if you don't get this

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.770 
to believe it so if you don't get this
segment<00:00:50.309> on<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> first<00:00:50.699> pass<00:00:51.030> don't<00:00:51.539> worry

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
segment on the first pass don't worry

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.509 
segment on the first pass don't worry
because<00:00:52.109> money<00:00:52.350> creation<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:53.100> truly<00:00:53.489> a

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
because money creation is truly a

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.049 
because money creation is truly a
bizarre<00:00:53.850> thing<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.239> ponder<00:00:54.479> let<00:00:55.140> alone<00:00:55.350> accept

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
bizarre thing to ponder let alone accept

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.489 
bizarre thing to ponder let alone accept
but<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.089> not<00:00:57.420> because<00:00:57.749> it's<00:00:57.899> difficult<00:00:58.079> any

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
but it's not because it's difficult any

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.259 
but it's not because it's difficult any

normal ten-year-old child could
understand<00:01:00.749> it<00:01:00.889> first<00:01:01.889> let's<00:01:02.670> look<00:01:02.819> at<00:01:02.940> how

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
understand it first let's look at how

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.530 
understand it first let's look at how
money<00:01:03.269> is<00:01:03.359> created<00:01:03.479> by<00:01:03.960> banks<00:01:05.270> leaving<00:01:06.270> aside

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
proportion a fraction of the money they

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.160 
proportion a fraction of the money they

in theory banks are allowed to loan out
up<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.619> ninety<00:01:40.979> percent<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.460> what<00:01:41.700> people<00:01:42.119> have

up to ninety percent of what people have

up to ninety percent of what people have
on<00:01:42.450> deposit<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:43.109> them<00:01:43.289> although<00:01:44.000> as<00:01:45.000> we'll

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
on deposit with them although as we'll

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.870 
on deposit with them although as we'll
see<00:01:45.810> later<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.439> actual<00:01:47.039> proportion<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.700> much

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
see later the actual proportion is much

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.999 
see later the actual proportion is much
closer<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.359> a<00:01:48.390> hundred<00:01:48.689> percent<00:01:49.020> than<00:01:49.649> ninety

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
closer to a hundred percent than ninety

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.730 
closer to a hundred percent than ninety
percent<00:01:50.600> but<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:51.630> our<00:01:51.990> example<00:01:52.469> we'll<00:01:52.679> use

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
percent but for our example we'll use

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.370 
percent but for our example we'll use
ninety<00:01:53.159> percent

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
ninety percent

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.690 
ninety percent
regardless<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> actual<00:01:56.130> amounts<00:01:56.399> because

regardless of the actual amounts because

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.730 
regardless of the actual amounts because

single individual that wants to borrow
$900<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.140> bank<00:02:28.379> loans<00:02:28.709> them<00:02:29.300> $900<00:02:31.130> the

$900 and so the bank loans them $900 the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.979 
$900 and so the bank loans them $900 the

accountant<00:02:36.540> who<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.260> turn<00:02:37.440> deposits<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.160> in<00:02:38.340> a

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
accountant who in turn deposits it in a

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.880 
accountant who in turn deposits it in a
bank<00:02:38.730> now<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.750> could<00:02:39.930> be<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.170> same<00:02:40.349> bank<00:02:40.650> or<00:02:40.860> a

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
bank now it could be the same bank or a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.410 
bank now it could be the same bank or a
different<00:02:41.220> bank<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.940> doesn't<00:02:42.299> really

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
different bank but that doesn't really

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.199 
different bank but that doesn't really
change<00:02:42.810> how<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.080> story<00:02:43.470> gets<00:02:43.709> told<00:02:43.769> at<00:02:44.099> all<00:02:44.220> so

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
change how the story gets told at all so

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.729 
change how the story gets told at all so
let's<00:02:45.420> keep<00:02:45.569> it<00:02:45.750> simple<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.260> make<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.620> the

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
let's keep it simple and make it the

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.300 
let's keep it simple and make it the
very<00:02:46.769> same<00:02:47.400> bank<00:02:48.110> with<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.260> new<00:02:49.620> deposit<00:02:50.160> the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
very same bank with this new deposit the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.610 
very same bank with this new deposit the
bank<00:02:50.489> now<00:02:50.640> has<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.849> fresh<00:02:51.299> $900<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.290> work<00:02:52.410> with

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
bank now has a fresh $900 to work with

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.350 
bank now has a fresh $900 to work with
and<00:02:52.799> so<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.010> gets<00:02:53.190> busy<00:02:53.549> finding<00:02:53.790> somebody<00:02:54.180> who

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
and so it gets busy finding somebody who

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.949 
and so it gets busy finding somebody who
wants<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.720> borrow<00:02:54.930> 90%<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:55.829> that<00:02:56.220> amount<00:02:56.489> or

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
wants to borrow 90% of that amount or

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.130 
wants to borrow 90% of that amount or
810<00:02:57.959> dollars<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:59.150> so<00:03:00.150> another<00:03:00.599> loan<00:03:00.870> this

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
810 dollars and so another loan this

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.630 
810 dollars and so another loan this
time<00:03:01.349> for<00:03:01.530> eight<00:03:01.680> hundred<00:03:01.829> and<00:03:02.040> ten<00:03:02.310> dollars

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
time for eight hundred and ten dollars

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.360 
time for eight hundred and ten dollars
is<00:03:02.790> made<00:03:03.030> which<00:03:03.420> gets<00:03:03.660> spent<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.470> redeposited

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
is made which gets spent and redeposited

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.250 
is made which gets spent and redeposited
in<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.819> same<00:03:06.000> bank<00:03:06.239> meaning<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.810> brand

new<00:03:07.500> fresh<00:03:07.860> deposit<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.660> 810<00:03:09.660> dollars<00:03:09.959> is

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
new fresh deposit of 810 dollars is

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.130 
new fresh deposit of 810 dollars is
available<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.860> loan<00:03:11.040> against<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.959> bank

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
available to loan against so the bank

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.449 
available to loan against so the bank
loans<00:03:13.410> out<00:03:13.530> ninety<00:03:13.920> percent<00:03:14.099> of<00:03:14.310> eight

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
and twenty nine dollars and so it goes

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.420 
and twenty nine dollars and so it goes
until<00:03:18.959> we<00:03:19.200> finally<00:03:19.650> discover<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.280> the

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.630 
back without interest we can undo the
entire<00:05:37.080> string<00:05:37.470> of<00:05:37.590> transactions<00:05:38.310> but<00:05:38.490> when

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
entire string of transactions but when

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.060 
entire string of transactions but when
we<00:05:38.760> factor<00:05:39.030> in<00:05:39.330> interest<00:05:39.900> there<00:05:40.680> suddenly

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
we factor in interest there suddenly

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.560 
we factor in interest there suddenly
isn't<00:05:41.430> enough<00:05:41.640> money<00:05:41.820> to<00:05:42.030> pay<00:05:42.180> back<00:05:42.360> all<00:05:42.510> the

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
isn't enough money to pay back all the

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.370 
isn't enough money to pay back all the
loans<00:05:43.730> clearly<00:05:44.730> that<00:05:45.120> is<00:05:45.330> a<00:05:45.360> big<00:05:45.690> hole<00:05:46.050> in<00:05:46.080> this

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
loans clearly that is a big hole in this

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.870 
loans clearly that is a big hole in this
story<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:46.860> so<00:05:47.040> we'll<00:05:47.220> need<00:05:47.340> to<00:05:47.490> find<00:05:47.670> out

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
story and so we'll need to find out

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.880 
story and so we'll need to find out
where<00:05:48.060> that<00:05:48.090> money<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:49.200> money<00:05:49.440> to<00:05:49.620> pay<00:05:49.740> off

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
where that money the money to pay off

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.910 
where that money the money to pay off
the<00:05:49.920> interest<00:05:50.430> comes<00:05:50.910> from<00:05:51.210> in<00:05:51.560> doing<00:05:52.560> so<00:05:52.740> will

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
the interest comes from in doing so will

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.590 
the interest comes from in doing so will
also<00:05:53.190> clear<00:05:53.400> up<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.640> mystery<00:05:53.940> of<00:05:54.120> where<00:05:54.360> the

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
also clear up the mystery of where the

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.400 
also clear up the mystery of where the
original<00:05:55.170> $1000<00:05:55.950> came<00:05:56.160> from<00:05:56.510> so<00:05:57.510> what<00:05:58.170> was<00:05:58.290> the

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
original $1000 came from so what was the

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.200 
original $1000 came from so what was the
purpose<00:05:58.650> of<00:05:58.890> all<00:05:59.010> this<00:05:59.160> why<00:05:59.640> did<00:05:59.850> we<00:05:59.970> spend

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
purpose of all this why did we spend

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.640 
purpose of all this why did we spend
these<00:06:00.420> past<00:06:00.660> few<00:06:00.870> minutes<00:06:00.990> studying<00:06:01.350> the

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
these past few minutes studying the

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.430 
these past few minutes studying the
mechanism<00:06:02.250> of<00:06:02.370> money<00:06:02.580> creation<00:06:03.090> because<00:06:04.080> in

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
mechanism of money creation because in

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.650 
mechanism of money creation because in
order<00:06:04.950> to<00:06:05.070> appreciate<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.820> implications<00:06:06.540> of

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
order to appreciate the implications of

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.960 
order to appreciate the implications of
our<00:06:06.750> massive<00:06:07.140> levels<00:06:07.680> of<00:06:07.770> debt<00:06:07.980> you<00:06:08.640> have<00:06:08.670> to

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
our massive levels of debt you have to

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.060 
our massive levels of debt you have to
understand<00:06:09.420> how<00:06:09.810> that<00:06:10.050> debt<00:06:10.290> came<00:06:10.530> into<00:06:10.680> being

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
understand how that debt came into being

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.270 
understand how that debt came into being
that's<00:06:11.490> one<00:06:11.760> reason<00:06:11.940> and<00:06:12.590> the<00:06:13.590> more<00:06:13.770> important

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
that's one reason and the more important

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.800 
that's one reason and the more important
reason<00:06:14.310> is<00:06:14.760> related<00:06:15.210> to<00:06:15.240> all<00:06:15.450> those

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
reason is related to all those

reason is related to all those
