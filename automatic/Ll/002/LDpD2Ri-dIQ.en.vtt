00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.829 
the g8 teens out and overall they're not
so<00:00:13.679> bad<00:00:13.710> i<00:00:14.160> feel<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.389> lot<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.690> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
so bad i feel that a lot of the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.010 
so bad i feel that a lot of the
secondaries<00:00:16.770> are<00:00:16.800> underused<00:00:17.430> because<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
secondaries are underused because the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.620 
secondaries are underused because the
fmg9<00:00:19.350> she's<00:00:19.949> really<00:00:20.550> overpowered<00:00:21.359> all<00:00:21.480> of

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
fmg9 she's really overpowered all of

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.320 
fmg9 she's really overpowered all of
them<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.960> really<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.699> not<00:00:23.850> really<00:00:23.910> true

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
them and really it's not really true

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.630 
them and really it's not really true
because<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.199> last<00:00:25.439> update<00:00:25.859> don't<00:00:26.340> get<00:00:26.550> me

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
because in this last update don't get me

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.300 
because in this last update don't get me
wrong<00:00:26.820> fmg<00:00:27.570> use<00:00:27.720> are<00:00:27.900> still<00:00:28.170> very<00:00:28.650> overpowered

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
wrong fmg use are still very overpowered

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.609 
wrong fmg use are still very overpowered
but<00:00:29.939> i<00:00:29.970> think<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.630> lot<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.900> secondaries<00:00:31.590> are

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
but i think a lot of secondaries are

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.979 
but i think a lot of secondaries are
kind<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.980> overlooked<00:00:32.430> ever<00:00:33.239> since<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.660> j

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
kind of overlooked ever since the j

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.860 
kind of overlooked ever since the j
teens<00:00:34.350> got<00:00:34.860> their<00:00:35.070> spread<00:00:35.670> widened<00:00:36.120> i<00:00:36.329> feel

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
teens got their spread widened i feel

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.080 
teens got their spread widened i feel
they've<00:00:37.050> lost<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.469> lot<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.680> power<00:00:37.920> there's<00:00:38.610> if

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
they've lost a lot of power there's if

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.610 
they've lost a lot of power there's if
up<00:00:39.360> close<00:00:39.629> they're<00:00:39.870> still<00:00:40.110> going<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.410> any

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
up close they're still going to be any

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.220 
up close they're still going to be any
gun<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.160> if<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.030> I've<00:00:42.510> noticed<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.050> lot<00:00:43.079> of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
gun but if it's I've noticed a lot of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.010 
gun but if it's I've noticed a lot of
the<00:00:43.469> other<00:00:43.800> hand<00:00:44.520> guns<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.000> these<00:00:45.180> these

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the other hand guns like these these

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.930 
the other hand guns like these these
have<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> lot<00:00:46.590> smaller<00:00:46.860> hip<00:00:47.190> rates<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.730> can

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
have a lot smaller hip rates so you can

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.790 
have a lot smaller hip rates so you can
be<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> lot<00:00:48.239> more<00:00:48.270> accurate<00:00:48.840> with<00:00:49.050> them<00:00:49.230> that's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
be a lot more accurate with them that's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.500 
be a lot more accurate with them that's
why<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.010> was<00:00:50.250> able<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.520> get<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.090> game<00:00:51.270> play

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
why I was able to get this game play

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.590 
why I was able to get this game play
here<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.800> game<00:00:53.010> play<00:00:53.219> i'm<00:00:53.489> using<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
here and in this game play i'm using the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.500 
here and in this game play i'm using the
assault<00:00:55.170> package<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:56.129> predator<00:00:57.120> missle

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
assault package with predator missle

reaper and a c-130 and my primary weapon

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.170 
reaper and a c-130 and my primary weapon
that<00:01:02.010> doesn't<00:01:02.250> really<00:01:02.340> matter<00:01:02.579> i<00:01:02.879> think<00:01:03.090> was

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
that doesn't really matter i think was

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.870 
that doesn't really matter i think was
the<00:01:03.210> PM<00:01:04.019> 6<00:01:04.680> or<00:01:04.920> whatever<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.400> called<00:01:05.460> it's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the PM 6 or whatever it's called it's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.679 
the PM 6 or whatever it's called it's
not<00:01:05.939> very<00:01:06.180> good<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:07.189> I<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.729> kind<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.119> wanted

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
not very good and I just kind of wanted

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.480 
not very good and I just kind of wanted
to<00:01:09.930> make<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.409> video<00:01:10.590> because<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.310> haven't

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
to make this video because I haven't

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.670 
to make this video because I haven't
made<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.790> video<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.510> long<00:01:12.630> time<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.110> I'm

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
made this video in a long time and I'm

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.230 
made this video in a long time and I'm
kind<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.010> thinking<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.549> couple<00:01:14.850> things<00:01:15.000> for

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
kind of thinking of a couple things for

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.890 
kind of thinking of a couple things for
the<00:01:15.330> future<00:01:15.500> my<00:01:16.500> first<00:01:16.740> idea<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
the future my first idea is like a

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.170 
the future my first idea is like a
series<00:01:18.900> because<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.920> always<00:01:20.670> feel<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:20.970> i'm

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
series because I always feel like i'm

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240 
series because I always feel like i'm
just<00:01:21.330> uploading<00:01:21.540> random<00:01:22.049> gameplays<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.619> I

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
just uploading random gameplays and I

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.280 
just uploading random gameplays and I
just<00:01:23.790> feel<00:01:23.970> if<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.240> had<00:01:24.330> something<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:25.080> I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
just feel if I had something to do I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.920 
just feel if I had something to do I
might<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.920> able<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.189> get<00:01:26.460> more<00:01:26.580> videos<00:01:26.790> out<00:01:27.210> my

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
might be able to get more videos out my

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.530 
might be able to get more videos out my
idea<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> gun<00:01:29.729> series<00:01:30.270> where

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
idea is to have like a gun series where

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.380 
idea is to have like a gun series where
I<00:01:30.810> go<00:01:31.320> through<00:01:31.560> all<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> guns<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.579> trying<00:01:33.299> get

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
I go through all the guns and trying get

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.850 
I go through all the guns and trying get
a<00:01:33.420> pretty<00:01:33.869> good<00:01:34.020> game<00:01:34.170> play<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.500> them<00:01:34.680> I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
a pretty good game play with them I

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.410 
a pretty good game play with them I
probably<00:01:35.430> couldnt<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.640> an<00:01:35.790> amazing<00:01:36.000> score

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
probably couldnt get an amazing score

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.630 
probably couldnt get an amazing score
with<00:01:36.570> all<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.869> them<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:36.990> I'd<00:01:37.890> probably<00:01:38.310> set

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
with all of them but I'd probably set

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.260 
with all of them but I'd probably set
like<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.930> certain<00:01:39.930> goal<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.470> each<00:01:40.890> gun<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.670> try

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
like a certain goal for each gun and try

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.389 
like a certain goal for each gun and try
and<00:01:42.329> get<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.780> then<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.619> give<00:01:43.829> you

I<00:01:48.299> would<00:01:48.570> suggest<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.110> use<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.680> perks<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
I would suggest you use like perks and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.690 
I would suggest you use like perks and
stuff<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.820> kill<00:01:51.450> streak<00:01:51.720> loadouts<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:53.040> that's

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
stuff and kill streak loadouts so that's

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.149 
stuff and kill streak loadouts so that's
one<00:01:53.939> idea<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.479> then<00:01:54.869> also<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.619> kind<00:01:56.070> of

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
one idea and then also this is kind of

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.580 
one idea and then also this is kind of
just<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.030> next<00:01:57.240> video<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.689> got<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> pretty

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
just for the next video I got a pretty

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.560 
just for the next video I got a pretty
fast<00:01:58.920> mode<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.369> was<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.610> two<00:01:59.969> minutes<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.420> 10

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
fast mode it was like two minutes and 10

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.109 
fast mode it was like two minutes and 10
seconds<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.290> I'm<00:02:01.890> kind<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.610> deciding

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
seconds and I'm kind of just deciding

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.490 
seconds and I'm kind of just deciding
whether<00:02:03.299> or<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:03.540> i<00:02:03.630> should<00:02:03.750> upload<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.290> full

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
whether or not i should upload the full

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.139 
whether or not i should upload the full
gameplay<00:02:04.770> because<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.759> was<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> Kill<00:02:06.119> Confirmed

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
gameplay because it was a Kill Confirmed

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.919 
gameplay because it was a Kill Confirmed
where<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.869> go<00:02:07.049> 50<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.619> three<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.950> normal<00:02:08.190> one

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
where I go 50 and three in a normal one

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.990 
where I go 50 and three in a normal one
and<00:02:09.049> considering<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.069> only<00:02:10.310> need<00:02:10.459> sixty<00:02:10.819> five

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
and considering the only need sixty five

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.050 
and considering the only need sixty five
things<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.510> get<00:02:12.500> like<00:02:12.829> a<00:02:12.859> win<00:02:13.189> I<00:02:13.489> thought<00:02:13.969> it

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
things to get like a win I thought it

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.520 
things to get like a win I thought it
was<00:02:14.120> pretty<00:02:14.329> good<00:02:14.480> gameplay<00:02:14.900> but<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.409> was

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
was pretty good gameplay but it was

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.770 
was pretty good gameplay but it was
eight<00:02:15.739> minutes<00:02:16.010> long<00:02:16.219> and<00:02:16.519> I<00:02:16.969> just<00:02:17.000> think<00:02:17.599> that

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
eight minutes long and I just think that

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.199 
eight minutes long and I just think that

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
where I am right now this is probably

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.369 
where I am right now this is probably
one<00:04:03.349> of<00:04:03.379> the<00:04:03.590> most<00:04:03.859> wide<00:04:04.579> open<00:04:04.909> areas<00:04:05.239> so<00:04:06.019> if

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
one of the most wide open areas so if

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.170 
one of the most wide open areas so if

you can just like stick in the close
range<00:04:08.449> areas<00:04:08.840> you'll<00:04:09.109> win<00:04:09.319> a<00:04:09.590> good<00:04:10.370> amount<00:04:10.579> of

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:10.699 
range areas you'll win a good amount of

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.420 
range areas you'll win a good amount of
your<00:04:10.939> gun<00:04:11.419> fights<00:04:11.659> and<00:04:12.019> I<00:04:12.829> was<00:04:12.949> using<00:04:13.129> this<00:04:13.340> gun

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430

in a couple other games and I was like
being<00:04:16.489> shot<00:04:16.849> guns<00:04:17.090> because<00:04:17.269> these<00:04:17.630> just<00:04:17.900> pump

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
being shot guns because these just pump

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.500 
being shot guns because these just pump
outlet<00:04:18.529> really<00:04:19.010> fast

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
outlet really fast

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.370 
outlet really fast
so<00:04:20.200> that's<00:04:20.830> kind<00:04:21.130> of<00:04:21.190> my<00:04:21.310> tips<00:04:21.550> for<00:04:21.820> this<00:04:21.940> gun

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
so that's kind of my tips for this gun

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.260 
so that's kind of my tips for this gun
really<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.500> like<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.490> middle<00:04:24.790> Kirk<00:04:25.000> doesn't

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
really the like the middle Kirk doesn't

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.080 
really the like the middle Kirk doesn't
really<00:04:25.420> matter<00:04:25.600> i<00:04:25.780> think<00:04:26.200> i'm<00:04:26.290> using<00:04:26.940> what<00:04:27.940> am

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
really matter i think i'm using what am

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.340 
really matter i think i'm using what am
I<00:04:28.180> using<00:04:28.330> you<00:04:28.540> don't<00:04:28.690> want<00:04:28.870> quick<00:04:29.080> draw

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
I using you don't want quick draw

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.020 
I using you don't want quick draw
because<00:04:29.560> you're<00:04:29.950> not<00:04:30.040> going<00:04:30.250> to<00:04:30.310> zoom<00:04:30.490> in<00:04:30.700> I'm

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
because you're not going to zoom in I'm

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.820 
because you're not going to zoom in I'm
pretty<00:04:31.270> I'm<00:04:31.450> using<00:04:31.660> hard<00:04:31.990> line<00:04:32.200> because<00:04:32.620> of

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
pretty I'm using hard line because of

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.540 
pretty I'm using hard line because of
the<00:04:32.920> assault<00:04:33.640> I<00:04:33.850> like<00:04:34.150> hard<00:04:34.510> line<00:04:34.750> I<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:35.980> guess

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
the assault I like hard line I I guess

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.400 
the assault I like hard line I I guess
assassin<00:04:37.090> is<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.420> best<00:04:37.600> middle<00:04:37.870> part<00:04:38.110> perk

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
assassin is the best middle part perk

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.080 
assassin is the best middle part perk
but<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:39.010> don't<00:04:39.340> really<00:04:39.430> like<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.820> use<00:04:39.850> this

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
but I don't really like to use this

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.720 
but I don't really like to use this
hacen<00:04:40.540> so<00:04:40.870> I<00:04:41.200> tend<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:41.950> stick<00:04:42.160> with<00:04:42.310> hardline

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
hacen so I tend to stick with hardline

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.940 
hacen so I tend to stick with hardline
because<00:04:43.120> it<00:04:43.720> gets<00:04:43.900> your<00:04:44.110> all<00:04:44.560> you<00:04:44.800> need
