00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
are also going to need coconut oil or

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.610 
are also going to need coconut oil or
olive<00:00:50.250> oil<00:00:50.579> whichever<00:00:51.059> type<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.539> boiler<00:00:51.899> but

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
olive oil whichever type of boiler but

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.840 
olive oil whichever type of boiler but
something<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> grease<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> pans<00:00:53.460> down<00:00:53.699> so

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
something to grease the pans down so

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.450 
something to grease the pans down so
they<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:54.059> stick<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.350> use<00:00:55.590> 1/3<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.250> cup

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
they don't stick and I use 1/3 of a cup

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.220 
they don't stick and I use 1/3 of a cup
because<00:00:56.910> that's<00:00:57.149> pretty<00:00:57.570> much<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.079> right

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
because that's pretty much the right

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.219 
because that's pretty much the right
amount<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.859> get<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.550> roomful

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.319 

so<00:01:04.769> good<00:01:04.979> number<00:01:05.219> of<00:01:05.250> eggs<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.759> use<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.149> about

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
so good number of eggs to use is about

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:09.620 
so good number of eggs to use is about
seven<00:01:06.810> seven<00:01:07.649> will<00:01:07.740> give<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.009> a<00:01:08.460> full<00:01:09.119> pan<00:01:09.390> as

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
seven seven will give you a full pan as

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.550 
seven seven will give you a full pan as
long<00:01:09.780> as<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.200> enough<00:01:10.409> ingredients

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
long as you have enough ingredients

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.590 
long as you have enough ingredients
otherwise<00:01:11.399> you<00:01:11.670> kind<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.969> probably<00:01:12.329> have<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
otherwise you kind of probably have to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.660 
otherwise you kind of probably have to
use<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:13.049> eight<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.259> nine<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
use like eight or nine and if you have a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.600 
use like eight or nine and if you have a
lot<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:14.969> ingredients<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.990> six<00:01:16.289> is<00:01:16.439> good<00:01:16.619> so

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
lot of ingredients then six is good so

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.359 
lot of ingredients then six is good so
what<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.820> want<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.149> do<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.979> want<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> mix

fine<00:02:05.330> because<00:02:05.930> I<00:02:06.170> like<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.440> get<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.590> little<00:02:06.920> bit

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
fine because I like to get a little bit

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.010 
fine because I like to get a little bit
of<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.940> ingredients<00:02:08.540> in<00:02:08.750> each<00:02:08.960> one<00:02:10.780> well<00:02:11.780> it

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020

looks<00:02:12.200> like<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.470> could've<00:02:12.860> used<00:02:13.040> few<00:02:14.030> more

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210
