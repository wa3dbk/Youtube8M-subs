motivational interviewing and I'm going
to<00:01:07.680> take<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.130> learning<00:01:08.729> angle<00:01:09.240> because<00:01:09.510> I'm

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
to take a learning angle because I'm

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.590 
to take a learning angle because I'm
allergic<00:01:09.930> thirst<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:11.460> behaviors<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.420> that's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
allergic thirst on behaviors so that's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.480

the<00:01:12.689> angle<00:01:12.900> i'm<00:01:13.229> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> take<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> so

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the angle i'm going to take on it so

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.100 
the angle i'm going to take on it so
it's<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.790> little<00:01:14.970> bit<00:01:15.090> different<00:01:15.780> than<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
it's a little bit different than the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.340 
it's a little bit different than the
book<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:17.610> much<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> talk<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.780> going<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.229> be

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
book and much of the talk is going to be

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.260 
book and much of the talk is going to be
just<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.680> run-up<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> two<00:01:20.700> techniques<00:01:20.939> so

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
just a run-up to the two techniques so

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.969 
just a run-up to the two techniques so
it's<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.750> kind<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.170> half<00:01:22.770> an

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
it's going to be kind of like half an

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.130 
it's going to be kind of like half an
hour<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.280> background<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.299> then<00:01:24.630> about<00:01:24.840> half

hour of background and then about half

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.789 
hour of background and then about half
an<00:01:25.290> hour<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.590> practice<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:27.140> that<00:01:28.140> means<00:01:28.619> you're
