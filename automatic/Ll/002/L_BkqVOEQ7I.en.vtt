00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.530
 hello together with the rott com / de 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.030
 Weekly review of 10 02 10 16 back 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.670
 we start the topics with water 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.400
 friendly and although it was again 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.080
 few winners of the bonus codes and these 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.780
 Action went on all platforms where 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.500
 word comes from the active and indeed 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.270
 facebook on the forum at youtube and 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.500
 of course on the main page that is 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.260
 Many thanks to all participants 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.390
 I hope you are looking forward over the few 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.340
 a thousand gold which then poured out there 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.590
 and of course that will be the case 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.110
 what in the future to come back the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.220
 means subscribed and maybe easy 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.250
 the facebook page then you are there 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.200
 always on the ball 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.200
 the developer diary on the tenth 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.450
 second there was said by emily that 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.730
 there is one game for all wargaming 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.980
 united launcher will give that is 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.600
 that every every game say so 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.489
 world of tanks current world of 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.170
 warplanes future workshops about 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.759
 a single lounge will be started 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.630
 Of course, it's nice and easy 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:12.119
 comfort features are available at the moment 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.009
 discounts when planning one 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.450
 discount in the planning, that is 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.709
 everyone who is already in the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.940
 has thought over the past but one 

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.920
 to represent small with a 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.929
 Of course there are always a few buddies there 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.890
 200,000 gold costs it was just one 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:24.869
 hard number 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.110
 that is now significantly reduced with 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.750
 patch 8.11 and that on 500 gold the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.280
 That's why he thought of that 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.810
 should strike now because 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.599
 It has never been so cheap and will 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.369
 probably not be anymore 

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:40.709
 the developer diary on the eleventh second 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.450
 because it was said that in the milk 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.979
 system will be improved in 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.569
 quotation marks is currently being developed 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.310
 It is possible that the credibility 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.170
 is considered by every player 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.270
 that of course a nice number because 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.280
 now there is definitely one 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.470
 and other complaints system of us 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.300
 band and that uses a lot and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.610
 also partly unfounded simple 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.950
 due to any dropouts 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.360
 or any aggression and if 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.580
 Of course, so little thought 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.840
 used the proven system, so to speak 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.239
 will that just say okay that 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.349
 player is flawless and if the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.840
 complains then maybe it has 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.830
 more weight than someone else thinks 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.349
 i have a good approach 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.060
 I'm curious if that is really the case 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.590
 or if it is so in the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.819
 development gets stuck 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.470
 let's go 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.780
 There is a matchmaking table for 08 11 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.250
 then again they can 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.790
 of course here in peace 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.760
 with the premium tank of course where the 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.040
 be mixed and of course the big one 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.440
 the big change with patch 08 11 and 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.820
 Although the fall of the twelfth begs 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.100
 here but here as I said maximum 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:47.170
 beg eleven then a good news here 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.319
 for all konsoleros among you and indeed 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.590
 the world of tanks is xbox 360 edition 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.060
 come out that I think I have 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.950
 to play gamescom yourself 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.180
 I really liked it 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.030
 say and it can only get better 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.440
 and have been for a whole two times 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.150
 relaxed to slaughter on the couch 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.530
 it is a beautiful thing and straight 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.090
 after that it is free 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.840
 or free for all the 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.160
 So xbox 360 gold members are from 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.650
 He wishes you much fun 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.510
 skin in because as I said play has 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.670
 beautiful effects sometimes even more beautiful 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.930
 as the pc unfortunately developer day at 12 2 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.730
 because you can see what direction 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.350
 is something thought of at wargaming and 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.420
 Although apparently was on the super test 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.519
 an option outlook which bunker 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.230
 Customers on bunker cannons on cards 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.340
 suddenly became active and also over 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.590
 shot for a tank 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.940
 Of course that's a nice thing, too 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.840
 that a bit of this war 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.940
 atmosphere maybe again 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.040
 transported if that, of course, but in the 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.200
 game is so playable and if that is not 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.299
 maybe then be too difficult 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.650
 could not do as I said it is known 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.299
 is also just tried if that really 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.250
 another thought is now 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.900
 is gone on or whether that already 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.329
 happens again you can not, unfortunately, 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.130
 say but you see wargaming is thinking 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.660
 at the game a bit further and 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.230
 really thinks about the topic bvg 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.320
 also to be included somewhere 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.630
 Developer diary of 13 wargaming 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.730
 school problems complaints with the field 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.190
 of view should a mini patch 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.570
 solve this problem with 0 90 it will 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.060
 then be possible that yourself too 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.620
 because there were really many 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.329
 Complain with the easy with the 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.880
 field of view right now not so rightly 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.710
 comes with since 08 11 but there's synonymous 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.570
 already mods the whole 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.850
 then work with them 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.830
 again on the patch in front of the patch 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.420
 the version before the patch brings that way 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.370
 it right and 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.510
 That's why I think it can 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.420
 one or the other maybe up again 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.730
 to come to the stand he wanted apropos 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.490
 mod pack meets quite good resp 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.160
 I have created a mod pack for the 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.410
 version 8 11 08 11 is up and running again 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.490
 very good now with little ones 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.260
 I had difficulty getting started 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.800
 but now she is running 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.230
 flawless 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.430
 who wants to see it all and in action 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.920
 It also can be seen here 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.570
 watch a little video and 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.730
 if you like it thinkable 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.800
 just simply the rest mods folder 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.630
 so to speak, replace it with this and 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.050
 So the whole thing is really going on a lot 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.870
 you have to do that to me 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.030
 then the eu became a server 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.080
 amsterdam relocated that he has the one 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.510
 or others noticed there was 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.940
 incredible ping problems and leaks up 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.560
 eu 1 and this was then just from 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.390
 his data center in munich 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.050
 so to speak deactivated and became after 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.670
 Because of this, eu u1 stands 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.380
 and u2 now in amsterdam 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.380
 This is quite a bit 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.890
 identical situation with both servers 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.390
 given 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.340
 for some, it is good for some 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.960
 bad I can unfortunately the second 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.340
 group because I somehow from the 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.710
 Connection in Munich 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.300
 have been beneficial if this 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.580
 situation now remains permanent or whether 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.080
 it's just a short-term solution 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.620
 you can not say but as I said 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.660
 Currently the stand is as it is 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.850
 developer diary on 14.2 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.100
 There are always times after patch is 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.140
 the question to the rear may soder after 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.000
 hidden changes that are not 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.470
 have been communicated and of course 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.480
 was once again the theme tan system 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.670
 in the foreground whether something has been changed 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.160
 would have been rumored at least again 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.530
 and it was officially confirmed or 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.180
 said to have been with patch 1 08 11 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.580
 No changes made to the system 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:20.470
 So you can tell her there 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:23.500
 be reassured so the armor 445 is located 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:26.200
 from the super test that is with 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.180
 0 90 then changed and seen here 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.190
 in the picture really nice then 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.560
 you get these these pages crash 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.960
 Armor then will look like this 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.760
 so it is definitely one 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.750
 exciting and interesting story 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.060
 what comes with 000 and one of us 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.070
 second thing 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:48.470
 There were pictures from the super test 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:56.790
 again with three tanks that 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:07:03.270
 95 e6 you can see here quite well then 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:05.220
 as soon as the 23 of three yes probably not 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.139
 So it should be sold like it 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.430
 this tank then we will get that 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.110
 pretty likely not clear 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.190
 word armor so you become another 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.870
 option on how to serve up this coming 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:20.100
 In any case, it will be a 47 so 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:24.750
 a lot is already fixed and the animal 3 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:26.790
 big tractor krupp the german too 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.900
 interesting again so you can do that 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.300
 now look at it from now on 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.760
 That's why I hope so 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.240
 this tank will come soon and guess 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.830
 with 000, it should be here so far 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.180
 that was the word that came with the word 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.610
 happy weeks thank you for 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.710
 watch and will be happy as always 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:46.970
 if he stays on the ball in the future 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.970
 thank you and on
