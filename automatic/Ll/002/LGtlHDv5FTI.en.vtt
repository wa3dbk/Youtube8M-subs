00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:14.929
 a sacred mountain and the superstitions of the Sherpas 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.980
 they had never transmitted so much chills in a video game 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.390
 cursed mountain is the new bet for the terror of quiksilver and that arrives in 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.310
 exclusive to nintendo wii the central axis of the story revolves around 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.950
 a relic a brother lost a mountaineer in his search and many 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.060
 legends 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.900
 not over it's difficult mons is looking for answers on the 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.129
 disappearance of his brother when he was looking for a thousand-year-old relic 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.929
 on a sacred mountain in the himalayas known as auto chomón 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:54.210
 year the answer will get it as we move forward in the adventure and in 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.309
 some time we will ask ourselves if his brother really is alive 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.250
 when eric hacienda anticipated produce in the villages of people who 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.350
 they lived there 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.220
 you will realize that he is not alone and that the legend about ghosts are more than 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.110
 certain 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.700
 and that is just knowing the beginning of the story gives chills 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.689
 since those who died in that region are held in limbo 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.100
 imagine what a mountain can appear and in the streets of the villages 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.710
 although the experience of a solid storyline and is narrated to 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.659
 Throughout the sena without movement at times Tibetan monks will appear 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:35.900
 of nothing 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.220
 offering tracks little pigs in the same way other characters 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.850
 The funny thing is that at the beginning the character offers a sensation of little 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.570
 charisma 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.219
 as well as a shallow story 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.539
 Throughout the adventure we will also find sheets of different books 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.280
 that only a kind of diary of our brother or prophecies that between 

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:59.770
 other themes 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.869
 these are very important to get fully into the game 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.729
 our enemies were ghosts 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.520
 that by the way there is little variety and most are very slow 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:17.619
 At first its influx will be rather scarce to eliminate them we have 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.819
 of several weapons the main one will be the pioneer 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.349
 It is a peak for climbers, we will also have other lesser known 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.619
 as the katrina a knife with a road map to and in the form of a hook 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.130
 the quillá 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.620
 if it is a dagger in the pay and the corb lo an eight-pointed wheel 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:41.529
 some of these utensils can be improved to make it stronger 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.740
 and we are safer but those actions but the most important thing is the 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:48.849
 third Eye 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.650
 a very important element in the Tibetan culture that will allow them 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.279
 visualize symbols that closes doors or defeat enemies 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:03.040
 we will have the weapons stored in the backpack with objects and books 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.880
 binnacle 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.880
 that we can consult at any time 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.650
 although there are few enemies on the screen 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.850
 the atmosphere that has been created in course in mountain on these small 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.180
 defects 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.740
 difficult to see has managed to exploit the question of whether to flee without time 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.720
 load behind the doors 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.800
 with very elaborated textures and in scenarios full of details and 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.910
 interactive that together with the meteorological environment band 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.270
 sound and sounds this equipment makes the title worthy of testing though as 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.560
 always some ex isure is of low resolution and there are some 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.179
 realizations 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:46.139
 we must also highlight the perfect dubbing in Spanish and the use 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.559
 of weymouth speaker as retransmitter and other sounds 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:53.090
 at the time of eliminating all 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.960
 the enemies 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.070
 we can do it with attacks from the body against the body 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.689
 by spiritual attacks throwing a kind of light with the third little 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:07.060
 or with the ritual of compassion that is when the marine energy of the ghost 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:09.789
 it goes down and a symbol appears 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.789
 the one that has to start it 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.030
 sometimes we will have to make movements with the nunchuk iu and command 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.400
 to completely eliminate the enemies or defend 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.930
 The important thing is that they are varied and appear on the screen when 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.129
 perform the 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:32.119
 the ten movements will be reached although sometimes there are difficulties to 

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:35.580
 the time to make the shipments controls also notes the movements 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:40.990
 we can also perceive when we played that the character is moderate 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.860
 and that some resident ibor to labor technique escaped is included 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.509
 cursed mountain is a survival horror game dupré safe fresh air to this 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:55.619
 genre this title has a very well-crafted story with a good 

00:04:55.619 --> 00:05:00.580
 setting graphics very well managed by the developers and a 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.459
 dubbing very correct otherwise control failures cause that in 

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:09.370
 Sometimes the game is tedious anyway 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.400
 after the last part of the Perón project will not reach Europe it is 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.139
 a good opportunity to spend fear wii 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.940
 so if you dare help ericka find her brother
