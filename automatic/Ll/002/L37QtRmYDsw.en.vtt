so<00:01:45.490> again<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.850> advantage<00:01:46.270> of<00:01:46.390> this<00:01:46.540> would<00:01:47.320> be

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
so again the advantage of this would be

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.480 
so again the advantage of this would be
not<00:01:47.710> having<00:01:48.009> to<00:01:48.340> rely<00:01:48.610> on<00:01:48.790> a<00:01:49.479> Wi-Fi<00:01:50.409> connection

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
not having to rely on a Wi-Fi connection

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.910 
not having to rely on a Wi-Fi connection
