00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.810 

I<00:00:05.029> think<00:00:05.750> in<00:00:05.930> today's<00:00:07.780> climate<00:00:08.780> with<00:00:09.289> the<00:00:09.820> sort

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
I think in today's climate with the sort

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.160 
I think in today's climate with the sort
of<00:00:10.849> perhaps<00:00:11.330> the<00:00:11.450> more<00:00:11.570> unhealthy<00:00:11.930> options

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
of perhaps the more unhealthy options

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.900 
of perhaps the more unhealthy options
the<00:00:12.680> foods<00:00:12.920> that<00:00:13.039> are<00:00:13.219> high<00:00:13.400> in<00:00:13.430> fat<00:00:13.879> and

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
the foods that are high in fat and

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.109 
the foods that are high in fat and
solids<00:00:14.449> the<00:00:14.539> fast<00:00:14.750> foods<00:00:15.049> and<00:00:15.880> becoming<00:00:16.880> so

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
solids the fast foods and becoming so

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.450 
solids the fast foods and becoming so
attractive<00:00:17.689> one<00:00:18.619> of<00:00:18.740> the<00:00:18.800> things<00:00:19.039> that<00:00:19.220> food

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
attractive one of the things that food

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.579 
attractive one of the things that food
dooms<00:00:19.760> project<00:00:20.330> did<00:00:20.539> was<00:00:20.840> he'd<00:00:20.990> actually<00:00:21.140> made

dooms project did was he'd actually made

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:23.679 
dooms project did was he'd actually made
fruit<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:22.369> vegetables<00:00:22.880> certainly<00:00:23.300> become

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
fruit and vegetables certainly become

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.329 
fruit and vegetables certainly become
attracted<00:00:24.380> to<00:00:24.409> children<00:00:24.679> through<00:00:25.220> the

attracted to children through the
characters<00:00:25.849> in<00:00:26.089> the<00:00:26.179> program<00:00:26.689> and<00:00:27.369> encouraged

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
characters in the program and encouraged

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.890 
characters in the program and encouraged
them<00:00:28.519> to<00:00:28.579> try<00:00:28.909> the<00:00:28.970> fingers<00:00:29.449> and<00:00:29.659> then<00:00:29.749> they

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
them to try the fingers and then they

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.450 
them to try the fingers and then they
realized<00:00:30.289> they<00:00:30.409> did<00:00:30.589> actually<00:00:30.739> like<00:00:31.039> it<00:00:31.310> did

what we needed to do I thought the food

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.979 
what we needed to do I thought the food
is<00:00:53.070> coordinated<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.879> worked<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.330> really

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
is coordinated that I worked with really

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.229 
is coordinated that I worked with really
help<00:00:55.170> support<00:00:55.410> me<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.890> process<00:00:56.160> get<00:00:57.120> me

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
help support me in this process get me

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.670 
help support me in this process get me
all<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.390> information<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.989> indeed<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
all the information on indeed and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.470 
all the information on indeed and
actually<00:00:59.280> made<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.580> whole<00:00:59.760> process<00:01:00.090> really

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
actually made the whole process really

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.380 
actually made the whole process really
rather<00:01:00.809> easy<00:01:01.080> and<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:02.340> all<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:03.150> still

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
rather easy and so all I have still

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.260 
rather easy and so all I have still
reading<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.780> oversee<00:01:04.260> things<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> first

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
reading was oversee things in the first

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.030 
reading was oversee things in the first
couple<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.300> weeks<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.020> then<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.619> really<00:01:07.890> just

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
couple of weeks and then it really just

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.550 
couple of weeks and then it really just
takes<00:01:08.220> off<00:01:08.720> on<00:01:09.720> each<00:01:09.869> side<00:01:10.050> or<00:01:10.080> anything

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.730 

I<00:01:15.649> definitely<00:01:16.369> feel<00:01:16.909> that<00:01:17.479> lunch<00:01:18.290> is<00:01:18.439> a<00:01:18.500> lot

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
I definitely feel that lunch is a lot

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.910 
I definitely feel that lunch is a lot
healthier<00:01:19.600> payments<00:01:20.600> as<00:01:20.720> well<00:01:20.899> I<00:01:21.170> seem<00:01:21.890> to

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
healthier payments as well I seem to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.499 
healthier payments as well I seem to
have<00:01:22.070> been<00:01:22.220> educated<00:01:22.820> by<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:22.970> whole<00:01:23.210> coal

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
have been educated by the whole coal

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.179 
have been educated by the whole coal
program<00:01:23.750> rather<00:01:24.289> than<00:01:24.560> just<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:24.950> children

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
program rather than just the children

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.760 
program rather than just the children
and<00:01:25.640> that's<00:01:26.180> obviously<00:01:26.509> a<00:01:26.600> key<00:01:26.869> thing<00:01:27.320> for<00:01:27.710> us

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
and that's obviously a key thing for us

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.200 
and that's obviously a key thing for us
certainly<00:01:28.369> at<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.670> beginning<00:01:29.000> of<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.119> year

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
certainly at the beginning of the year

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.810 
certainly at the beginning of the year
before<00:01:29.360> we<00:01:29.600> started<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:31.189> the<00:01:31.520> amount<00:01:31.729> of

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
before we started the the amount of

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.279 
before we started the the amount of
fruit<00:01:32.030> very<00:01:32.210> nice<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:32.689> was<00:01:32.780> really<00:01:33.020> really

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
fruit very nice and was really really

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.139 
fruit very nice and was really really
quite<00:01:33.799> low<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:35.240> there<00:01:36.140> was<00:01:36.259> a<00:01:36.289> little<00:01:36.560> bit<00:01:36.770> of

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
quite low and there was a little bit of

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.399 
quite low and there was a little bit of
there<00:01:38.149> was<00:01:38.240> a<00:01:38.270> little<00:01:38.450> bit<00:01:38.630> of<00:01:38.689> worries<00:01:38.990> from

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
there was a little bit of worries from

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.749 
there was a little bit of worries from
the<00:01:39.560> children<00:01:39.860> before<00:01:39.979> we<00:01:40.159> before<00:01:40.460> we<00:01:40.549> start

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
the children before we before we start

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:41.859 
the children before we before we start
the<00:01:40.850> program<00:01:40.909> but<00:01:41.270> they<00:01:41.360> actually<00:01:41.479> got<00:01:41.689> really

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
the program but they actually got really

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.810 
the program but they actually got really
into<00:01:42.229> it<00:01:42.259> once<00:01:42.679> we<00:01:42.770> started<00:01:43.070> playing<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.340> DVD

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
into it once we started playing the DVD

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.010 
into it once we started playing the DVD
and<00:01:44.030> there<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:44.360> everything<00:01:44.659> like<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:44.810> they

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
and there and everything like that they

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.380 
and there and everything like that they
loved<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.350> songs<00:01:45.590> they<00:01:46.009> repeated<00:01:46.460> them<00:01:46.670> and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
loved the songs they repeated them and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.580 
loved the songs they repeated them and
they<00:01:47.450> certainly<00:01:47.630> even<00:01:47.899> remember<00:01:48.319> them<00:01:48.440> now

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
they certainly even remember them now

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.080 
they certainly even remember them now
and<00:01:48.740> they<00:01:48.830> still<00:01:48.890> sing<00:01:49.220> them<00:01:49.369> when<00:01:49.850> it's<00:01:49.970> been

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
and they still sing them when it's been

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.370 
and they still sing them when it's been
months<00:01:50.299> since<00:01:50.539> we<00:01:50.720> could<00:01:50.869> play<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.229> actual

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
months since we could play the actual

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.810 
months since we could play the actual
DVD<00:01:52.100> itself

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.270
