they're going to do things but just kind
of<00:02:51.570> wanted<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.870> illustrate<00:02:51.989> this<00:02:52.470> because<00:02:52.770> I

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
of wanted to illustrate this because I

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.830

think this is a really cool way to take

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.320 
think this is a really cool way to take
private<00:02:55.800> label<00:02:56.070> rights<00:02:56.100> content<00:02:56.940> that's

that's<00:02:57.780> already<00:02:58.080> good<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.590> delivers<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.980> good

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
that's already good and delivers a good

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.710 
that's already good and delivers a good
message<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.820> kind<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.090> punch<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.360> up<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.570> little

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720
