we're<00:00:12.210> going<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.420> take<00:00:12.600> a<00:00:12.630> fairly<00:00:12.960> long<00:00:13.290> length

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
we're going to take a fairly long length

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.540 
we're going to take a fairly long length
of<00:00:13.890> thread<00:00:15.110> cut<00:00:16.110> it<00:00:16.790> and<00:00:17.790> take<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.840> cut<00:00:19.080> end

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
of thread cut it and take the cut end

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.340 
of thread cut it and take the cut end
and<00:00:20.550> bring<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.970> right<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.869> first<00:00:22.110> warp<00:00:22.670> on

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
and bring it right to the first warp on

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.970 
and bring it right to the first warp on
the<00:00:25.350> leftmost<00:00:25.770> side<00:00:27.439> and<00:00:28.439> we're<00:00:28.590> going<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.740> tie

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the leftmost side and we're going to tie

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.819 
the leftmost side and we're going to tie
this<00:00:29.040> on<00:00:29.689> just<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.869> simple<00:00:31.590> little<00:00:32.360> knot<00:00:33.829> back

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
this on just a simple little knot back

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.360 
this on just a simple little knot back
the<00:00:35.040> other<00:00:35.160> way<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:36.650> it's<00:00:37.650> very<00:00:37.890> important

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
the other way and it's very important

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.479 
the other way and it's very important
that<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.760> leave<00:00:38.970> a<00:00:39.000> tail<00:00:39.390> long<00:00:40.350> enough<00:00:40.739> here

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
that you leave a tail long enough here

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.940 
that you leave a tail long enough here
in<00:00:41.970> order<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.840> thread<00:00:43.140> your<00:00:43.170> needle<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.770> we're

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
in order to thread your needle so we're

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.560 
in order to thread your needle so we're
going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> hide<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.610> at<00:00:44.880> the<00:00:45.030> end<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.420> our

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
going to hide this at the end of our

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.740 
going to hide this at the end of our
weaving<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:49.280> want<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.400> let<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.580> know<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.540> what

weaving and that's what we're going to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.530 
weaving and that's what we're going to
do<00:01:07.799> right<00:01:07.979> now<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:09.000> want<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.270> let<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.509> know

that this is with your packaging so if

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.670 
that this is with your packaging so if
your<00:01:11.640> style<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.119> learning<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.780> looking<00:01:13.590> at

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
your style of learning is looking at

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.739 
your style of learning is looking at
illustrations<00:01:14.400> these<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.270> there<00:01:15.749> for<00:01:16.049> you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the patterns that you'll use will

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.929 
the patterns that you'll use will
normally<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.469> look<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.039> this<00:01:23.579> they'll

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
normally be look like this they'll

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.419 
normally be look like this they'll
either<00:01:24.179> be<00:01:24.329> a<00:01:24.509> cross<00:01:25.079> stitch<00:01:25.380> needlepoint<00:01:26.249> or

on<00:01:28.799> graph<00:01:29.189> paper<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.270> fun<00:01:30.479> with

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
on graph paper and you can have fun with

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.239 
on graph paper and you can have fun with
your<00:01:30.749> colored<00:01:31.049> pencils<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.619> create<00:01:32.130> your

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:32.249 
your colored pencils and create your

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:33.950 
your colored pencils and create your
design<00:01:32.700> which<00:01:33.119> will<00:01:33.270> show<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.509> where<00:01:33.810> your

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
design which will show you where your

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.620 
design which will show you where your
beads<00:01:34.200> are<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.679> go<00:01:34.859> they'll<00:01:35.850> also<00:01:36.090> look

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
beads are going to go they'll also look

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.899 
beads are going to go they'll also look
like<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:37.229> when<00:01:37.649> you're<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:38.039> working<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:38.789> a

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
like this when you're in working with a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.940 
like this when you're in working with a
book<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.509> you'll<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.139> your<00:01:40.289> graph<00:01:40.560> here

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
book and you'll have your graph here

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.090 
book and you'll have your graph here
where<00:01:41.219> your<00:01:41.399> beads<00:01:41.609> should<00:01:41.880> go<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.829> lot<00:01:43.950> of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
where your beads should go and a lot of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.730 
where your beads should go and a lot of
times<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.909> my<00:01:45.090> own<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.719> it's<00:01:46.319> on<00:01:46.499> graph

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
times I just do my own and it's on graph

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.980 
times I just do my own and it's on graph
paper<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.399> pretty<00:01:47.729> rough<00:01:48.060> looking<00:01:48.389> but<00:01:48.689> I

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
paper it's pretty rough looking but I

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.319 
paper it's pretty rough looking but I
know<00:01:49.170> what<00:01:49.530> I'm<00:01:49.619> doing<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.130> today<00:01:51.119> we're

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
know what I'm doing and today we're

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.999 
know what I'm doing and today we're
going<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.509> use<00:01:51.719> this<00:01:52.049> particular<00:01:52.350> little

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
going to use this particular little

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.239 
going to use this particular little
graph<00:01:53.249> and<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.729> has<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> repeat<00:01:54.709> so<00:01:55.709> with<00:01:56.069> that

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
graph and it has a repeat so with that

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:03.590 
graph and it has a repeat so with that
we're<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.759> begin<00:01:56.939> our<00:01:57.560> weaving<00:02:02.389> with<00:02:03.389> my

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
we're going to begin our weaving with my

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.800 
we're going to begin our weaving with my
graph<00:02:03.869> handy<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.649> my<00:02:05.249> beads<00:02:05.549> laid<00:02:06.240> out<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.600> my

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.649 
underneath the warp we're going to pick
our<00:02:18.030> beads<00:02:18.240> up<00:02:18.450> according<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.110> our<00:02:19.140> design<00:02:19.650> and

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
our beads up according to our design and

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.110 
our beads up according to our design and
it's<00:02:21.659> I<00:02:21.900> don't<00:02:22.470> talk<00:02:23.010> while<00:02:23.280> I'm<00:02:23.459> picking<00:02:23.849> up

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
it's I don't talk while I'm picking up

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.580 
it's I don't talk while I'm picking up
might<00:02:24.330> be

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
might be

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.500 
might be
because<00:02:24.980> I'm<00:02:25.160> also<00:02:25.340> counting<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.239> it's<00:02:26.390> going

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
because I'm also counting so it's going

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.210 
because I'm also counting so it's going
to<00:02:26.569> be<00:02:26.690> quiet<00:02:26.959> for<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.260> few<00:02:27.319> minutes<00:02:27.769> but<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:29.239> will

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
to be quiet for a few minutes but I will

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.869 
to be quiet for a few minutes but I will
get<00:02:31.220> these<00:02:31.430> all<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:32.120> whole<00:02:32.420> row<00:02:32.660> on<00:02:32.959> my<00:02:33.019> needle

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
get these all the whole row on my needle

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.160 
get these all the whole row on my needle
so<00:02:34.879> I'm<00:02:35.030> going<00:02:35.269> to<00:02:35.360> have<00:02:35.510> seven<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:36.080> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
so I'm going to have seven of the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.030 
so I'm going to have seven of the
lavender<00:02:36.650> one<00:02:37.099> two<00:02:37.519> three<00:02:38.480> four<00:02:38.810> five<00:02:39.470> six

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
lavender one two three four five six

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.490 
lavender one two three four five six
seven<00:02:40.510> two<00:02:41.510> of<00:02:42.500> this<00:02:43.310> very<00:02:43.580> pretty<00:02:44.500> metallic

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
seven two of this very pretty metallic

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.039 
seven two of this very pretty metallic
and<00:02:46.750> I'm<00:02:47.750> going<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.049> have<00:02:48.319> three<00:02:48.769> of<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.310> green

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.600 

and<00:02:54.049> that's<00:02:54.170> my<00:02:54.470> whole<00:02:54.709> first<00:02:54.980> row<00:02:55.160> of<00:02:55.310> my

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
and that's my whole first row of my

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:03.640 
and that's my whole first row of my
pattern<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.470> draw<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.530> beads<00:02:58.459> down<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:02.650> line

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
pattern I draw the beads down and line

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.620 
pattern I draw the beads down and line
them<00:03:03.860> up<00:03:04.010> now<00:03:04.250> your<00:03:04.459> first<00:03:04.730> row<00:03:05.030> is<00:03:05.209> always<00:03:05.599> a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
them up now your first row is always a

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.490 
them up now your first row is always a
little<00:03:05.980> dicey<00:03:07.510> because<00:03:08.510> what<00:03:08.959> you're<00:03:09.140> trying

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
little dicey because what you're trying

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.369 
little dicey because what you're trying
to<00:03:09.560> do<00:03:09.799> at<00:03:10.099> this<00:03:10.280> point<00:03:10.579> is<00:03:10.910> make<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:12.079> beads

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
to do at this point is make the beads

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:19.390 
to do at this point is make the beads
each<00:03:12.920> bead<00:03:13.340> go<00:03:13.640> between<00:03:14.120> each<00:03:15.019> warp<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.980> I'm

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
each bead go between each warp and I'm

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.220 
each bead go between each warp and I'm
feeling<00:03:19.819> like<00:03:19.849> the<00:03:20.150> tensions<00:03:20.629> a<00:03:20.780> little<00:03:21.019> loose

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
feeling like the tensions a little loose

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.350 
feeling like the tensions a little loose
so<00:03:21.470> what<00:03:21.709> I'm<00:03:21.829> going<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.099> do<00:03:22.310> is<00:03:22.549> release<00:03:22.790> this

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
so what I'm going to do is release this

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.650 
so what I'm going to do is release this
knob<00:03:23.750> over<00:03:24.019> here<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.879> tighten<00:03:25.879> up<00:03:25.940> my<00:03:26.120> tension

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
knob over here and tighten up my tension

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.770 
knob over here and tighten up my tension
and<00:03:26.950> release<00:03:27.950> this<00:03:28.250> knob<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:28.880> tighten<00:03:29.510> my

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
and release this knob and tighten my

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.500 
and release this knob and tighten my
tension<00:03:30.200> this<00:03:30.380> direction<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.970> don't<00:03:32.209> want<00:03:32.420> it

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
tension this direction you don't want it

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.090 
tension this direction you don't want it
so<00:03:32.569> tight<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:33.260> feels<00:03:33.590> like<00:03:33.769> it's<00:03:33.950> going

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
so tight that it feels like it's going

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.069 
so tight that it feels like it's going
to<00:03:34.160> break<00:03:34.790> but<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.239> want<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.510> tight<00:03:35.750> enough<00:03:36.019> so

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
to break but you want it tight enough so

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.920 
to break but you want it tight enough so
that<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.530> doesn't<00:03:36.709> Bend<00:03:37.190> or<00:03:37.700> dip<00:03:38.389> on<00:03:38.600> you<00:03:38.720> while

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
that it doesn't Bend or dip on you while

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.349 
that it doesn't Bend or dip on you while
you're<00:03:39.079> putting<00:03:39.260> your<00:03:39.500> beads<00:03:39.709> in<00:03:41.319> much<00:03:42.319> nicer

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
you're putting your beads in much nicer

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.300 
you're putting your beads in much nicer
push<00:03:44.359> your<00:03:44.630> beads<00:03:44.930> all<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.319> way<00:03:45.829> up<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.190> the

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
push your beads all the way up to the

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.539 
push your beads all the way up to the
very<00:03:46.340> top<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.420> see<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:47.959> couple<00:03:48.410> that<00:03:48.560> are<00:03:48.709> down

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
very top I see a couple that are down

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.400 
very top I see a couple that are down
sometimes<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.389> need<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.630> be<00:03:50.750> encouraged

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
sometimes I need to be encouraged

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.009 
sometimes I need to be encouraged
they're<00:03:51.709> a<00:03:51.739> little<00:03:51.889> shy<00:03:52.660> bring<00:03:53.660> them<00:03:53.810> up<00:03:53.989> to

they're a little shy bring them up to

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.920 
they're a little shy bring them up to

below<00:04:10.750> this<00:04:11.750> part<00:04:12.169> really<00:04:12.530> surprised<00:04:13.010> me<00:04:13.190> I'm

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
below this part really surprised me I'm

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.550 
below this part really surprised me I'm
a<00:04:13.519> weaver<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.120> I<00:04:14.239> had<00:04:14.569> the<00:04:14.690> idea<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:15.290> I'd<00:04:15.410> be

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
a weaver and I had the idea that I'd be

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.740 
a weaver and I had the idea that I'd be
going<00:04:15.829> in<00:04:16.039> and<00:04:16.250> out<00:04:16.310> of<00:04:16.370> each<00:04:16.729> of<00:04:16.910> these<00:04:17.030> but

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
going in and out of each of these but

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.050 
going in and out of each of these but
it's<00:04:17.900> it's<00:04:18.169> row<00:04:18.709> by<00:04:18.950> row<00:04:19.220> so<00:04:19.519> let's<00:04:19.729> do<00:04:19.910> the

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
it's it's row by row so let's do the

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.920 
it's it's row by row so let's do the
second<00:04:20.450> row<00:04:21.490> again<00:04:22.490> following<00:04:23.000> my<00:04:23.180> chart<00:04:23.570> I'm

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
second row again following my chart I'm

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.120 
second row again following my chart I'm
going<00:04:24.500> to<00:04:24.650> be<00:04:25.300> picking<00:04:26.300> up<00:04:26.599> beads<00:04:27.560> for<00:04:28.099> the

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
going to be picking up beads for the

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.700 
going to be picking up beads for the
second<00:04:28.580> row<00:04:28.760> this<00:04:29.690> time<00:04:30.020> I'm<00:04:30.200> going<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.470> have

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
second row this time I'm going to have

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.160 
second row this time I'm going to have
six<00:04:32.200> lavender

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:48.900 

two<00:04:38.170> metallics<00:04:38.920> and<00:04:40.680> four<00:04:41.680> green

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.730 

there<00:04:49.510> we<00:04:49.630> go<00:04:50.080> Row<00:04:50.530> 2<00:04:50.800> is<00:04:50.830> ready<00:04:52.140> same<00:04:53.140> process

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
there we go Row 2 is ready same process

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.500 
there we go Row 2 is ready same process
now<00:04:53.950> this<00:04:54.160> gets<00:04:54.400> a<00:04:54.580> little<00:04:54.730> bit<00:04:55.030> easier

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
now this gets a little bit easier

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.280 
now this gets a little bit easier
because<00:04:55.920> these<00:04:56.920> beads<00:04:57.370> are<00:04:57.550> holding<00:04:58.000> those

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
because these beads are holding those

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:05.970 
because these beads are holding those
warps<00:04:59.430> separate<00:05:03.750> now<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:05.350> need<00:05:05.530> to<00:05:05.650> make<00:05:05.800> it

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
warps separate now you need to make it

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.800 
warps separate now you need to make it
comfortable<00:05:06.280> for<00:05:06.550> yourself<00:05:07.180> if<00:05:07.420> you<00:05:07.570> work

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
comfortable for yourself if you work

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.570 
comfortable for yourself if you work
really<00:05:08.050> close<00:05:08.590> to<00:05:08.770> here<00:05:08.980> it's<00:05:09.100> hard<00:05:09.310> to<00:05:09.400> get

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
really close to here it's hard to get

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.030 
really close to here it's hard to get
your<00:05:09.730> finger<00:05:10.030> under<00:05:10.330> so<00:05:10.570> I'm<00:05:10.810> up<00:05:11.410> about<00:05:11.860> an

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
your finger under so I'm up about an

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.390 
your finger under so I'm up about an
inch<00:05:12.250> from<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.670> edge<00:05:12.790> of<00:05:13.240> my<00:05:14.460> groove<00:05:15.460> set<00:05:15.790> here

inch from the edge of my groove set here

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.180 
inch from the edge of my groove set here
from<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:18.520> warping<00:05:18.850> beam<00:05:19.290> there<00:05:20.290> we<00:05:20.410> go<00:05:20.590> back

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
from the warping beam there we go back

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.430 
from the warping beam there we go back
into<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.580> Dino<00:05:21.940> you're<00:05:22.600> going<00:05:22.750> to<00:05:22.810> ask<00:05:22.960> me<00:05:23.200> why

into the Dino you're going to ask me why

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.230 
into the Dino you're going to ask me why

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
would she put the back end of her needle

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.200 
would she put the back end of her needle
through<00:05:25.420> there<00:05:25.660> the<00:05:26.410> reason<00:05:26.860> is<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.820> front

through there the reason is the front

through there the reason is the front
end<00:05:28.480> is<00:05:28.660> very<00:05:28.960> sharp<00:05:29.350> and<00:05:29.790> I<00:05:30.790> don't<00:05:31.090> want<00:05:31.270> to

there<00:05:45.490> you<00:05:45.610> go<00:05:45.790> you<00:05:46.510> will<00:05:46.660> continue<00:05:47.200> waving

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
there you go you will continue waving

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.830 
there you go you will continue waving
until<00:05:47.860> you<00:05:47.980> complete<00:05:48.400> your<00:05:48.430> pattern<00:05:51.690> well<00:05:52.690> as

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.170 
you can see my pattern is growing and I

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.270 
you can see my pattern is growing and I
have<00:05:57.070> very<00:05:57.790> little<00:05:58.180> thread<00:05:59.050> left<00:05:59.470> and<00:05:59.860> I<00:06:00.040> have

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.080 

be<00:06:16.690> done<00:06:16.930> so<00:06:17.860> if<00:06:18.040> you<00:06:18.130> know<00:06:18.280> a<00:06:18.310> surgeon's<00:06:18.880> knot

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
be done so if you know a surgeon's knot

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.390 
be done so if you know a surgeon's knot
that's<00:06:19.480> what<00:06:19.690> we're<00:06:19.840> going<00:06:20.050> to<00:06:20.169> do<00:06:20.400> we're

that's what we're going to do we're

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.930 
that's what we're going to do we're
going<00:06:21.430> to<00:06:21.669> cross<00:06:22.230> the<00:06:23.230> old<00:06:23.500> with<00:06:24.100> the<00:06:24.280> new<00:06:24.310> and

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:33.260 

I<00:06:27.940> take<00:06:28.210> one<00:06:29.190> two<00:06:30.190> turns<00:06:30.640> on<00:06:31.419> the<00:06:32.080> bottom<00:06:32.470> and

I'm going to take my right one and make
one

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250

two turns or loops on the top and I'm

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.850 
two turns or loops on the top and I'm
going<00:06:47.510> to<00:06:47.570> pull<00:06:47.840> all<00:06:48.050> four<00:06:48.680> at<00:06:48.950> the<00:06:49.100> same<00:06:49.310> time

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
going to pull all four at the same time

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.980 
going to pull all four at the same time
there's<00:06:51.860> our<00:06:52.190> surgeon's<00:06:52.669> knot<00:06:52.880> this<00:06:53.600> is<00:06:53.750> nice

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
there's our surgeon's knot this is nice

that up last rows done the same as the
first<00:07:21.650> row<00:07:22.900> we're<00:07:23.900> going<00:07:23.930> to<00:07:24.140> tie<00:07:24.350> off<00:07:24.590> this

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830 
first row we're going to tie off this

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.860 
first row we're going to tie off this
time<00:07:25.190> and<00:07:25.490> this<00:07:25.610> is<00:07:25.760> what<00:07:25.970> I<00:07:26.000> want<00:07:26.330> you<00:07:26.480> to<00:07:26.510> see

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:29.660 
so my back back into my needle is going

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:35.659 
so my back back into my needle is going
through<00:07:31.960> the<00:07:32.960> row

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:35.669 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:39.499 

and<00:07:35.939> this<00:07:36.300> time<00:07:36.749> I<00:07:37.759> am<00:07:38.759> going<00:07:39.030> to<00:07:39.270> take<00:07:39.479> my

00:07:39.499 --> 00:07:39.509 
and this time I am going to take my

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:43.159 
and this time I am going to take my
needle<00:07:39.749> around<00:07:40.319> that<00:07:40.979> leftmost<00:07:41.400> last<00:07:42.389> warp

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:43.169 
needle around that leftmost last warp

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:45.730 
needle around that leftmost last warp
and<00:07:43.469> I'm<00:07:43.860> just<00:07:44.099> going<00:07:44.310> to<00:07:44.430> loop<00:07:44.819> it<00:07:44.999> through

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:45.740 
and I'm just going to loop it through

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.290 
and I'm just going to loop it through
make<00:07:46.740> just<00:07:46.979> a<00:07:47.069> little<00:07:47.099> bit<00:07:47.490> of<00:07:47.610> a<00:07:47.699> knot<00:07:47.939> that

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300 
make just a little bit of a knot that

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.230 
make just a little bit of a knot that
way<00:07:48.479> this<00:07:49.020> is<00:07:49.080> not<00:07:49.379> going<00:07:49.590> to<00:07:49.650> slide<00:07:49.889> out<00:07:50.240> all

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 
way this is not going to slide out all

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.289 
way this is not going to slide out all
right<00:07:51.479> we're<00:07:52.020> done
