00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.889
 New and interesting about the world of sneakers 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.990
 all links you can find in the description to 

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:12.840
 this video 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.079
 2 thousand more back in 2000 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.880
 first year both played in these sneakers 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.729
 also he was spotted in this coloring on 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.090
 all-star match and in this model he became 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.279
 for the first time champion yang go and that's 13 years old 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.770
 later happened again reprint of it 

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:32.819
 masterpiece which is many from the game point 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.950
 The view is considered excellent but when you consider 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:38.609
 this unusual design that was taken from 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.000
 car audi tt camp admirers already 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:45.990
 divided into two parts who like 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.840
 appearance and who looks the other way 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.010
 people on the map as well as in it sneakers 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.470
 still continue to attract me 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.810
 I definitely consider these adidas successful 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.540
 first about design and materials 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.940
 you see they go and these sneakers 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.160
 smooth shapes proper like 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.429
 car from which these sneakers 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.110
 invented this audi tt 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:15.870
 can say one whole up 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:18.630
 present but the outside 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.070
 from a separate piece here as you see 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.650
 also here are the internal boundaries and contour 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:30.410
 the nose area is also separate and these 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:33.180
 elements on the side and all of this is put together 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.220
 many associate them with composites from 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.090
 nike but there we have 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.900
 polyurethane 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.060
 cast solid and here it is just such 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.440
 our material is well on top or glued 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.750
 on top of these sneakers 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:51.019
 Ie not such here he as husband to say 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:54.590
 rubber this material is softer pliable 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.570
 if you mean the same composites 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.880
 let me say that this is something on 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.120
 This material is like in a raincoat 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.340
 but he is still not suitable 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.280
 the word i think is 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.060
 Plenochka synthetic stronger better 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.950
 by herself 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.019
 Well, now you can consider it 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:18.630
 Closer still here seen two 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.970
 powerful plastic elements in the field 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:26.299
 nose and as you see 2 heel areas 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.610
 it is clear that they are here to fix 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.260
 Well, so that this backdrop is not to lose not 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.930
 rubbed a lot on top of the material 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.680
 present inside this model and you 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.959
 see in fact everything is promin 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.760
 there is a conclusion that these 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.440
 sneakers do not limit our freedom 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.720
 movements chocks first see them and here 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.560
 yellow well and then begin 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.200
 black 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.569
 and they are threaded into the loops of which 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.640
 8 pieces on each side and more 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.709
 additionally 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.650
 Well, these elements here too 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:05.630
 present now tell you about 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.630
 them more on purposely flat sneakers 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.930
 for starters i will say that from the inside 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:16.470
 the sides here use leather 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:19.530
 they are these soft elements you see which ones 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.280
 they are inflated from padding material then 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.950
 There is if tighten with the Turks dense 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.720
 thanks to this skin 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.260
 Well, also write to the material these elements 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.800
 very tightly fix our leg 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.840
 these pads can be said even outside 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.910
 they press here these areas right now 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.710
 I show you how it looks like 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:46.740
 agree some book like I said 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.870
 already the material of the demolition is overrun there goes 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:54.300
 the tongue above here is already used mesh 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.940
 new sneakers are still well out 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.580
 but as you can see the air is circulating 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.930
 bad enough to see that hole 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:06.240
 here and as such is not present you 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.680
 already as I repeated many times very 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.070
 a lot of packing material and 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.070
 and in the tongue and generally inside this model and 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:23.220
 here now we show what insole 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:25.320
 pasted into this reprint now 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.010
 the soles were originally used 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.039
 technology 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.550
 and de brien is like so she was called but 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.440
 I do not see the designation in this model 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.810
 in the early 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.660
 on earlier versions this designation was and 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.940
 maybe in this version after all 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.420
 replaced the material but still it is not 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.300
 I donâ€™t know for sure what kind of exit 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.040
 here we have a thick sole 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.440
 she of course definitely from foam 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.710
 material well and this by itself for 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:58.400
 depreciation is still present here 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.550
 technology torshin that's shining it 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.550
 the word is we have a plate in the middle of itself 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.590
 by itself it is a twisting of sneakers and for 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.980
 better response to all movements 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:14.230
 player that is for responsiveness down 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:17.270
 outsole black solid herringbone with 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:20.900
 mark you see non marking that is 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:25.280
 there will be no tracks and stripes on the floor 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:27.590
 Well left this rubber as you can see in 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.560
 the profile is very very thin all this 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:38.230
 can say for feeling card now 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:39.740
 logos on the soles you see on the backdrop 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.470
 adidas too 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:46.610
 and nasal and on the tongue the same thing above 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:50.930
 There well and traditional three strips on 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:54.380
 on both sides of myself add that 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:59.570
 if you don't pay attention to adidas 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:01.580
 it is this pair that will make you 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.940
 likely to treat it better 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.919
 three lanes to him brand as they say 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.320
 we live only once and why 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:11.840
 still not try it in what played 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.570
 Coby still in the two thousandth and even more so if 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.820
 These sneakers turned out to cheer on this 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.250
