00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.279
 our top tips board now if you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.649
 is opposing fishing for the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.150
 first time you have not yet 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.059
 opportunity to learn the work 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.250
 correct artificial shrimp if you already 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.260
 is a viewer of the program with 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.119
 sure I've seen in another program 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.560
 but we have to worry about the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.060
 people are also acting for the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.789
 first time then shrimp work 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.420
 Quite simply you always have to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:31.289
 try to feel a background with the shrimp 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.960
 then the artificial shrimp it you 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.620
 uses with this hook that has a 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.480
 call that we call gibi head 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.710
 A plunge this plunge has several 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.129
 different sizes depending on the force 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.690
 of water you modify the weight of lead 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.420
 weight gig head 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.309
 The slower the water you are, the more 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.649
 put a jeep raid lighter than she 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.420
 will reach the bottom moment that the water 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.489
 start running a lot you need 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.670
 today put on a heavier network for the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.670
 your shrimp get to the bottom because the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.409
 camores largest biggest snook 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.659
 they are deep down then you 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:18.810
 throws the next mangrove leaves 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:21.869
 touch the background touched the background i get up 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.270
 stock Shrimp 31 depends on how 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.630
 Are you going to work, I like to work? 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.950
 with two rings and I hope he plays the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:36.000
 background again the collection touches us 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.909
 waiting to touch the bottom of the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.369
 stock up and hope to touch the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.740
 background it is important that when you 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.369
 raise the shrimp you always leave the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.860
 stick pointed up so that its 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.170
 line will get stretched and will be more 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.840
 you have the sensitivity of the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.399
 shrimp touched the bottom fling 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.399
 here again the rb6 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.870
 I hope to touch the bottom always prove the 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.350
 pointing upwards 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.680
 I gathered up the shrimp waiting to touch 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.130
 in the background always stick the plastic 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.130
 line 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.680
 I gathered up the shrimp 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.890
 I waited and touched the bottom with the ditch. 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.700
 pointed up and so you can 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.700
 have more sensitivity 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.440
 then this is the correct job of the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.430
 artificial shrimp for you to work on 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.849
 artificial shrimp 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.280
 It is important that you have a good stick 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.959
 a good reel to work with 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.269
 I'm working with the stick here. 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.140
 ask people to show that we love the che 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:55.060
 This song is not working. 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.790
 6.3 feet is 12 to 20 pounds to the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.719
 they are several made for the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:06.939
 reality of the Brazilian fish component 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:09.280
 Japanese are more built in the 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:14.169
 developed the jazz in which it was the person 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.269
 who chose the dowel dowels 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.669
 the site mammoth that is a 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.980
 less lighter than the others 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.790
 make the job more comfortable. 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.219
 Light 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.889
 so when dean was thought of 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:29.799
 components that stick it fetched in 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:32.530
 Japan but looked for the components 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:37.329
 for both Brazilian fish and tucunare 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:40.209

 which is practiced with music and 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.510
 was developed thinking about gibi rules 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.120
 even heavier guedes that we have 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.669
 that use in brazil that our waters 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.799
 tend to have a little current 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:55.569
 bigger because that was our top picture
