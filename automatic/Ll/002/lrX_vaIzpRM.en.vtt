to be a lot of point you're dripping

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.949 
to be a lot of point you're dripping

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
down when you remove this cap so I'll be

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.030 
down when you remove this cap so I'll be
right<00:03:53.200> back<00:03:54.570> okay<00:03:55.570> so<00:03:55.630> that's<00:03:56.410> what<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.800> looks

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
right back okay so that's what it looks

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.630 
right back okay so that's what it looks
like<00:03:57.220> after<00:03:57.519> you<00:03:57.730> remove<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.239> oil<00:03:58.269> cap<00:03:59.640> you

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
like after you remove the oil cap you

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.259 
like after you remove the oil cap you
can<00:04:00.670> see<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.060> oil<00:04:01.090> is<00:04:01.330> still<00:04:01.540> dripping<00:04:01.900> down

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
can see the oil is still dripping down

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.630 
can see the oil is still dripping down
so<00:04:04.269> when<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:04.900> open<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:06.900> always<00:04:07.900> kind<00:04:08.470> of

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
so when I open that always kind of

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.770 
so when I open that always kind of
pouring<00:04:09.640> out<00:04:09.880> like<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:11.130> like<00:04:12.130> raining<00:04:15.720> so<00:04:16.720> you

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
pouring out like a like raining so you

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.879 
pouring out like a like raining so you
need<00:04:17.260> an<00:04:17.380> oil<00:04:17.500> pan<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.600> got<00:04:19.870> an<00:04:19.930> oil<00:04:20.049> pan<00:04:20.410> here

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
to collect all that oil and should wear

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:35.460 
to collect all that oil and should wear
gloves<00:04:28.300> because<00:04:29.460> my<00:04:30.460> hands<00:04:30.910> is<00:04:31.060> full<00:04:31.810> oil<00:04:34.470> but

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
gloves because my hands is full oil but

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.370 
gloves because my hands is full oil but
luckily<00:04:35.770> I<00:04:35.950> woke<00:04:36.370> love<00:04:36.760> so<00:04:37.450> right<00:04:39.630> so<00:04:40.630> this<00:04:41.320> is

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
luckily I woke love so right so this is

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.640 
luckily I woke love so right so this is
what<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:41.740> looks<00:04:41.979> like<00:04:42.220> when<00:04:42.880> you<00:04:43.030> remove<00:04:43.650> the

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
what it looks like when you remove the

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.310 
what it looks like when you remove the
oil<00:04:44.830> pan<00:04:45.160> and<00:04:47.729> you<00:04:48.729> suppose<00:04:49.270> you<00:04:49.539> replace<00:04:49.990> the

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
oil pan and you suppose you replace the

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.860 
oil pan and you suppose you replace the
oil<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.430> o-ring<00:04:52.440> this<00:04:53.440> o-ring<00:04:53.650> here<00:04:54.550> and

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
oil the the o-ring this o-ring here and

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.690 
oil the the o-ring this o-ring here and
the<00:04:55.870> smaller<00:04:56.200> ring<00:04:56.710> is<00:04:56.890> inside<00:04:57.550> here

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
the smaller ring is inside here

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.930 
the smaller ring is inside here
underneath<00:05:01.590> here<00:05:02.590> so<00:05:03.340> you<00:05:03.400> have<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.640> remove

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
underneath here so you have to remove

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.360 
underneath here so you have to remove
this<00:05:04.150> cap<00:05:04.479> and<00:05:06.900> replace<00:05:07.900> that<00:05:08.710> smaller<00:05:09.070> Oh

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
this cap and replace that smaller Oh

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.779 
this cap and replace that smaller Oh
ring<00:05:09.690> but<00:05:10.690> tell<00:05:11.620> you<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.860> truth<00:05:12.130> I<00:05:13.140> never<00:05:14.789> and

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
ring but tell you the truth I never and

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.570 
ring but tell you the truth I never and
I<00:05:16.419> have<00:05:16.840> never<00:05:17.140> replaced<00:05:17.680> that<00:05:17.979> it's<00:05:18.400> not

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
I have never replaced that it's not

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.390 
I have never replaced that it's not
leaking<00:05:18.760> oil<00:05:19.169> so<00:05:20.169> I<00:05:20.620> didn't<00:05:21.100> bother<00:05:21.750> plus<00:05:23.400> the

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
leaking oil so I didn't bother plus the

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.269 
leaking oil so I didn't bother plus the
reason<00:05:24.700> why<00:05:24.850> I<00:05:24.880> can<00:05:25.240> use<00:05:25.600> a<00:05:25.979> 3/8<00:05:26.979> wrench

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:28.279 
reason why I can use a 3/8 wrench

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:36.069 
reason why I can use a 3/8 wrench
to<00:05:28.879> open<00:05:29.059> this<00:05:29.449> out<00:05:29.749> here<00:05:33.759> is<00:05:34.759> because<00:05:35.089> this

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:36.079 
to open this out here is because this

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:40.269 
to open this out here is because this
cap<00:05:37.039> the<00:05:37.429> smaller<00:05:37.789> gap<00:05:38.179> here<00:05:38.479> is<00:05:39.439> tight<00:05:39.919> enough

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
cap the smaller gap here is tight enough

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:45.669 
cap the smaller gap here is tight enough
for<00:05:40.579> me<00:05:40.699> to<00:05:41.569> turn<00:05:41.839> the<00:05:42.319> whole<00:05:42.589> thing<00:05:44.229> so<00:05:45.229> that

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:45.679 
for me to turn the whole thing so that

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:49.659 
for me to turn the whole thing so that
makes<00:05:45.979> life<00:05:46.399> easier<00:05:46.939> for<00:05:47.149> me<00:05:48.219> until<00:05:49.219> then<00:05:49.459> is

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
makes life easier for me until then is

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.499 
makes life easier for me until then is
leaking<00:05:50.089> in<00:05:50.329> there<00:05:50.979> think<00:05:51.979> about<00:05:52.509> replacing

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:53.509 
leaking in there think about replacing

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.289 
leaking in there think about replacing
this<00:05:53.899> small<00:05:54.169> oring<00:05:54.739> but<00:05:55.039> all<00:05:55.999> right<00:05:56.089> now
