00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.630
 Tailoring absolutely the design 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:37.140

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.070
 our controlling module as I said 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.890

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.620

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.980

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:57.700

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:57.700

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.690

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.370

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:34.040
 So control module sits here then 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.290
 right next to the battery we have plus 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.060

 The whole thing we have with Velcro tape above 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.250
 attached to the fuse cover so 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.769
 that we have to get a backup here 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.720

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.180
