pressure pushing sort of she had won

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.480 
pressure pushing sort of she had won
races<00:01:45.960> easier<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.680> past<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.340> just

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
races easier in the past but it was just

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.950 
races easier in the past but it was just
wonderful<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:48.060> how<00:01:48.210> much<00:01:48.360> courage<00:01:48.659> he<00:01:48.780> had

when the chips were down on on saturday
with<00:01:53.399> me<00:01:54.180> probably<00:01:54.479> let<00:01:54.630> them<00:01:54.720> back<00:01:54.869> into<00:01:55.020> the

she just she loves galloping that
straight<00:03:26.609> line<00:03:26.639> and<00:03:26.970> she<00:03:27.120> probably<00:03:27.299> travels<00:03:27.690> a

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
straight line and she probably travels a

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.890 
straight line and she probably travels a
bit<00:03:29.370> keener<00:03:29.639> in<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.120> straight<00:03:30.359> line<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.780> she

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
bit keener in a straight line and she

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.199 
bit keener in a straight line and she
didn't<00:03:31.169> do<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:31.470> on<00:03:31.530> sad<00:03:31.859> day<00:03:32.099> and<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:33.090> was

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
didn't do that on sad day and that was

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.120 
didn't do that on sad day and that was
probably<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.510> flagship<00:03:33.959> when<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.560> probably<00:03:34.829> oh

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
probably the flagship when I probably oh

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.680 
probably the flagship when I probably oh
that<00:03:35.400> was<00:03:35.489> probably<00:03:35.609> a<00:03:35.819> flag<00:03:36.060> there<00:03:36.450> initially

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
that was probably a flag there initially

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.339 
that was probably a flag there initially
when<00:03:37.109> I<00:03:37.139> was<00:03:37.889> in<00:03:38.130> my<00:03:38.250> first<00:03:39.169> analysis<00:03:40.169> of<00:03:40.290> the

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
when I was in my first analysis of the

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.839 
when I was in my first analysis of the
race<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.709> she<00:03:40.859> wasn't<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.280> usual<00:03:41.609> self

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
race that she wasn't that a usual self

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.220
