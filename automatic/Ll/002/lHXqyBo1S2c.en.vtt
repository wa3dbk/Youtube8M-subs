Darth<00:03:06.310> Vader<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.780> think<00:03:08.140> c-3po<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.400> I

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
Darth Vader and I think c-3po and I

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.190 
Darth Vader and I think c-3po and I
think<00:03:10.360> Han<00:03:10.600> Solo<00:03:10.900> back<00:03:11.800> in<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.310> 80s<00:03:12.910> when<00:03:13.210> Star

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
think Han Solo back in the 80s when Star

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.470 
think Han Solo back in the 80s when Star
Wars<00:03:14.230> first<00:03:14.920> came<00:03:15.160> out<00:03:15.280> they<00:03:15.880> did<00:03:16.120> some<00:03:16.360> of

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
Wars first came out they did some of

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.320 
Wars first came out they did some of
these<00:03:16.600> I<00:03:17.050> think<00:03:17.500> they<00:03:17.740> were<00:03:17.800> 12-inch<00:03:18.550> so<00:03:19.000> they

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
these I think they were 12-inch so they

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.940 
these I think they were 12-inch so they
would<00:03:19.840> have<00:03:19.930> been<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.050> little<00:03:20.560> bit<00:03:20.650> shorter

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
would have been a little bit shorter

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.670 
would have been a little bit shorter
