 she is 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.319
 in football 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:13.319
 she is 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:18.839
 probably all wishes of the earth 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.889
 the smallest amount falls out 

00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:22.339
 precipitation in the world 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.439
 here lies the desert of atacama 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.999
 lifeless mountains for which earlier times in 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.559
 a century a few drops fall from the sky 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:33.280
 life-giving moisture we manage the richest 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.920
 Pacific Ocean 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.500
 all animals that could survive in these 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.860
 harsh lands 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.490
 enjoy sea gifts 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.550
 yes and man many centuries ago 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.130
 burned severe coast mined 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.200
 feed yourself from the ocean 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.600
 Chilean jackets to strip on the very 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.780
 north of the country near the equator 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.970
 although the coast and discounts are tropics 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.870
 lives relatively little here 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.790
 species of underwater inhabitants 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.210
 cold water is expressed 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.880
 but a great fodder base 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.760
 would allow dwelling here 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.229
 sea ​​creatures 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.229
 reach a huge number 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.030
 november spring time in the southern hemisphere 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.980
 man take care of procreation 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.979
 large male stone crab 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.380
 for several days will be worn on 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.680
 hands your platform love you 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.120
 until you see who will be soon 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.470
 father 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.770
 a squad of ten many crayfish which 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.130
 include crab character and shrimp 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.920
 read at the highest and highest 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.240
 level among the whole class so figuratively 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.450
 in the Chilean Biryukov lives only about 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.190
 ten kinds of crabs 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.590
 but their populations reached huge 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.590
 sizes 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.710
 the shape and color of the shell depends on the location 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.930
 crab meat 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.980
 for some reason this collapse left 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.680
 your favorite doctor kelp 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.570
 and now trying to hide from the red 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.800
 seaweed 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.580
 on sight of cranes isn't it very 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.469
 OK 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.109
 but he can see a moving object with 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:13.329
 one and a half meters 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.409
 each eye bed consists of several 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:16.320
 thousand 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.229
 small visitors to Moscow 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:20.299
 able to see only a small part 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.609
 items 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.169
 it's called mosaic viewers 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.679
 so over a thousand people searching for food 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.480
 mccartney asylum himself 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.510
 enjoy and in terms of how much 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.459
 sense of smell and special chemical 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.849
 the senses 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:37.919
 interesting 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:39.859
 not only class but true appearance on 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.489
 where it is located 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.459
 the stalk is responsible for several days 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.030
 first viewed and 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.090
 mobility dependent review clearly healing 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.779
 crab 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.449
 in article eyes are located 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:53.269
 subjects 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.409
 70 Greece 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.669
 the hormones that were produced there 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.320
 responsible for metabolism 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.269
 it looks like open spaces 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.589
 as well as in the application 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:05.589
 evening engine shaped bodies 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.299
 in order to grow houses 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.259
 you have to constantly throw off your cop 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:12.460
 adult crabs 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.100
 the clinic usually occurs 1 or two times 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.639
 year 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.880
 but the grind reached 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.880
 dwarf can change two months 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:22.569
 ahead necid under the old armor 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.649
 a new cover is formed 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:27.429
 not yet fortified with calcium salts 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:29.589
 clinic is the most dangerous time life and 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:30.949
 crustaceans 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.279
 not protected Kraft is trying to find 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.089
 safe haven and now waiting for now 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:38.759
 his armor will not be strong again 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.179
 during molt kravets eats so 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.479
 as with the outer shell line and 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.529
 jaws of nezada and even the stomach of crustaceans 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:50.169
 molting krapane only grows but also 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.979
 can recover lost in battles 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:53.399
 limbs 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.469
 when the liver is ten but the main thing 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.789
 Stepan Tsapyuk begin to arrive in advance 

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:59.819
 stored calcium salts armor 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.039
 repeated 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.699
 after a while the crab again goes out 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.699
 shelter seeking food 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.900
 favorite treat not only people but all 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.339
 marine life 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:16.159
 despite his culinary 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:17.999
 the shrimp's fascination still 

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:19.829
 adapted shalit motifs in 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.090
 conditions cruel 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.349
 forever hungry 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.389
 but does not have such other shells and 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.999
 powerful extra pounds 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.319
 the shrimp reclaimed their place on the sea 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:30.319
 bottom 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:32.819
 in this they were helped by great mobility and 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.960
 unusual muftiat 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.080
 their bodies can be like 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.470
 so have a huge amount of funds and 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.169
 colors 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.169
 habitat dependent 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.520
 another trick which shrimp 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.889
 mastered in the struggle 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.039
 this is fertility 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.339
 less than a year after birth 

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:55.770
 young female start to put off 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.699
 eggs 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.029
 and in huge quantities 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:00.899
 Glinka shrimp happens very 

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:03.509
 it quickly hardens in its shell 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.199
 several hours 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.520
 compared to crab 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.900
 senses go away branches more developed 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.699
 she constantly has to be 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:11.650
 on the alert 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.210
 the sense of touch her sense of smell 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.009
 higher order than the other ten 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.229
 masters 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.440
 on long constantly 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.070
 similar amount is concentrated 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.009
 sensitive cells 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:23.900
 but shrimp rely not only 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.479
 on his son 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.330
 on all limbs and all over the body 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.479
 scattered on the prison 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.699
 complement the sense organ 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.189
 if a cell for some reason loses 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.770
 eye 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.789
 one after shedding instead of organ of sight 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.240
 she will have a little man by 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.199
 its functions 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.650
 reminiscent of the front antons 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.360
 you were shrimp food 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.830
 unassuming 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.590
 Slovtsova fifty many 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.320
 will algae be small animals and 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.969
 remains of dead marine organisms 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.029
 that is, everything that can be found on the sea 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.889
 bottom 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.979
 nothing is lost at the bottom 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.139
 sweepers will always be there 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.400
 this time the first crawl fight 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.169
 mistakes 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.449
 Andrei Milkin permutations and 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.409
 odorous attracted mollusks 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.919
 decomposing organically
