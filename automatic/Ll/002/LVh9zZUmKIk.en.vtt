00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:04.679 
just going to save quickly so penis hold
on<00:01:56.090> for<00:01:56.329> two<00:01:56.479> seconds

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.100 

okay<00:02:05.729> now<00:02:06.729> I'm<00:02:07.030> going<00:02:07.329> to<00:02:07.450> show<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.689> how<00:02:08.050> to

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.570 

there<00:02:19.490> is

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.310 

so<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.940> dark<00:02:26.180> moves<00:02:26.480> should<00:02:26.810> be<00:02:26.990> super

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
so the dark moves should be super

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.000 
so the dark moves should be super
effective<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:29.080> just<00:02:30.080> bringing<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.590> pokemon

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
effective so just bringing a pokemon

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.660 
effective so just bringing a pokemon
with<00:02:31.220> them<00:02:31.430> just<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.830> make<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.400> can<00:02:34.640> a

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
with them just to make it so it can a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.690 
with them just to make it so it can a
lower<00:02:35.420> self<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.960> lot<00:02:36.200> but<00:02:36.770> not<00:02:36.980> quite<00:02:37.310> kill<00:02:37.520> it

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
lower self a lot but not quite kill it

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.620 
lower self a lot but not quite kill it
this<00:02:37.850> should<00:02:38.000> be<00:02:38.060> around<00:02:38.420> level<00:02:38.810> 50<00:02:39.410> ish<00:02:40.630> so

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
this should be around level 50 ish so

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.080 
this should be around level 50 ish so
hopefully<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:42.770> won't<00:02:42.950> fill<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.910> they'll

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
hopefully this won't fill it and they'll

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.920 
hopefully this won't fill it and they'll
get<00:02:44.210> itself<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.780> free<00:02:44.930> low<00:02:45.170> oh<00:02:46.540> yeah<00:02:47.540> that's

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
get itself to free low oh yeah that's

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.920 
get itself to free low oh yeah that's
pretty<00:02:48.110> good<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:49.330> so<00:02:50.330> I'm<00:02:50.390> just<00:02:50.420> going<00:02:50.570> to<00:02:50.690> try

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
pretty good and so I'm just going to try

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.850 
pretty good and so I'm just going to try
throwing<00:02:51.290> dust<00:02:52.220> balls<00:02:52.580> out<00:02:52.760> of<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:53.860> because

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
throwing dust balls out of it because

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.080

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
ball quickly just to see what will

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
folks ball you never know I guess

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.130 
folks ball you never know I guess
just<00:04:00.840> try<00:04:01.079> a<00:04:01.110> variety<00:04:01.379> yeah<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.900> dust<00:04:03.900> balls

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
just try a variety yeah I dust balls

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.440 
just try a variety yeah I dust balls
probably<00:04:04.530> will<00:04:04.680> work<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.069> best<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:05.970> just<00:04:06.299> keep

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
probably will work the best so just keep

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:14.449 
probably will work the best so just keep
trying<00:04:06.690> with<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:06.930> dust<00:04:07.200> bowl

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:24.540 

okay

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.749 

yes<00:04:25.210> I<00:04:25.569> suggest<00:04:26.080> don't<00:04:26.470> use<00:04:27.099> the<00:04:27.310> master<00:04:27.490> ball

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
yes I suggest don't use the master ball

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.600 
yes I suggest don't use the master ball
in<00:04:27.940> any<00:04:28.090> of<00:04:28.270> these<00:04:28.449> ones<00:04:29.009> use<00:04:30.009> it<00:04:30.160> on<00:04:30.280> something

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
in any of these ones use it on something

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.670 
in any of these ones use it on something
that's<00:04:30.940> really<00:04:31.030> hard<00:04:31.479> maybe<00:04:32.020> like<00:04:32.259> Cresselia

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
that's really hard maybe like Cresselia

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.899 
that's really hard maybe like Cresselia
or<00:04:32.919> something<00:04:33.220> like<00:04:33.310> I<00:04:33.370> thought<00:04:33.610> since

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
or something like I thought since

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:38.180 
or something like I thought since
they're<00:04:34.270> very<00:04:34.659> hard<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.259> catch<00:04:35.470> or<00:04:36.419> mess<00:04:37.419> prett

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
they're very hard to catch or mess prett

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.070 
they're very hard to catch or mess prett
metric<00:04:39.190> maybe<00:04:39.490> cause<00:04:40.060> he's<00:04:40.300> pretty<00:04:40.629> hard<00:04:40.960> to

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
metric maybe cause he's pretty hard to

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.610 
metric maybe cause he's pretty hard to
catch<00:04:41.229> but<00:04:41.530> I've<00:04:41.800> done<00:04:42.159> it<00:04:42.220> before<00:04:42.759> so<00:04:43.620> you

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
catch but I've done it before so you

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.850 
catch but I've done it before so you
probably<00:04:44.860> could<00:04:45.220> catch<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:45.699> I<00:04:45.819> wouldn't<00:04:46.270> um

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
probably could catch it I wouldn't um

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.230 
probably could catch it I wouldn't um
you're<00:04:47.860> very<00:04:48.099> impatient<00:04:48.460> I<00:04:48.729> guess<00:04:48.909> you<00:04:49.090> could

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
you're very impatient I guess you could

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.969 
you're very impatient I guess you could
use<00:04:49.270> it<00:04:49.539> but<00:04:49.720> if<00:04:50.229> you're<00:04:50.409> somebody<00:04:50.680> that's

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
use it but if you're somebody that's

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.909 
use it but if you're somebody that's
pretty<00:04:51.220> patient<00:04:51.699> on<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:53.050> I<00:04:53.080> suggest<00:04:53.770> not

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
pretty patient on you I suggest not

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.740
