one<00:01:45.390> thing<00:01:45.570> about<00:01:45.979> everyday<00:01:46.979> minerals<00:01:47.460> is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
one thing about everyday minerals is

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.190 
one thing about everyday minerals is
that<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.750> very<00:01:48.900> careful

about the choosing of the color I

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.070 
about the choosing of the color I

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
noticed that when I choose the color on

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.580 
noticed that when I choose the color on
the<00:01:55.260> website<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:55.920> not<00:01:56.390> what<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:58.020> actually

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
the website it's not what you actually

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.350 
the website it's not what you actually
get<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.250> real<00:01:59.490> life<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.060> understand<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.080> the

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
get in real life I understand that the

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.910 
get in real life I understand that the
calibrations<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.630> all<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.200> monitors<00:02:04.500> would

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
calibrations of all the monitors would

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.010 
calibrations of all the monitors would
be<00:02:05.070> different<00:02:05.580> but<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.970> don't<00:02:06.270> believe<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.869> it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
be different but I don't believe that it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.859 
be different but I don't believe that it
has<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.440> can<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.550> different<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.569> looks

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
one of all the tree foundations that I

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.680 
one of all the tree foundations that I

like this now the thing about using
mineral<00:03:53.340> makeup<00:03:53.850> is<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.240> you<00:03:54.510> need<00:03:54.750> to

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
mineral makeup is that you need to

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.870 
mineral makeup is that you need to
buffer<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.470> on<00:03:55.650> your<00:03:55.980> skin<00:03:56.130> just<00:03:58.760> pretend<00:03:59.760> that

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
buffer it on your skin just pretend that

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.900 
buffer it on your skin just pretend that
this<00:04:00.870> is<00:04:01.110> your<00:04:01.530> this<00:04:03.020> is<00:04:04.020> a<00:04:04.050> floor<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.910> you

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
this is your this is a floor and you

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.890 
this is your this is a floor and you
need<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:07.310> scrub<00:04:08.310> your<00:04:08.370> floor's<00:04:08.820> so<00:04:08.970> buffing<00:04:09.780> is

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
need to scrub your floor's so buffing is

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.270 
need to scrub your floor's so buffing is
like<00:04:10.080> this<00:04:10.290> but<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.680> don't<00:04:10.860> have<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:11.040> like

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
like this but you don't have to like

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.380 
like this but you don't have to like
really<00:04:12.180> make<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.720> really<00:04:13.260> really<00:04:13.290> hard<00:04:13.739> but<00:04:14.100> I

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
really make it really really hard but I

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.640 
really make it really really hard but I
think<00:04:15.390> you<00:04:15.450> get<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.660> meaning<00:04:16.109> of<00:04:16.290> how<00:04:16.590> to

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
think you get the meaning of how to

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.820 
think you get the meaning of how to
buffer<00:04:17.100> on<00:04:17.459> your<00:04:17.669> face<00:04:19.790> people<00:04:20.790> say<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.299> you

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
buffer on your face people say that you

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.110 
buffer on your face people say that you
want<00:04:22.830> technique<00:04:23.220> that<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.460> can<00:04:23.640> use<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:24.090> to

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
want technique that you can use is to

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.530 
want technique that you can use is to
just<00:04:24.860> go<00:04:25.860> from<00:04:26.040> top<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.370> bottom<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:27.210> don't

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
just go from top to bottom I don't

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.290 
just go from top to bottom I don't
really<00:04:27.690> have<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:28.050> technique<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.770> i<00:04:29.160> will<00:04:30.030> use

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
really have a technique that i will use

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:37.370 
really have a technique that i will use
for<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:31.040> but

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.710 

I<00:04:37.440> guess<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.250> just<00:04:38.400> smoosh<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.150> all<00:04:39.330> over<00:04:39.600> my

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720
