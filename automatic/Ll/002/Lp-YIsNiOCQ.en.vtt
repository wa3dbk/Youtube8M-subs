00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
though they dumped her in the water

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.899 
though they dumped her in the water
you<00:01:04.470> know<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.619> don't<00:01:04.949> think<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.339> did<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.549> very<00:01:05.610> good

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
you know I don't think I did a very good

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.570 
you know I don't think I did a very good
job<00:01:05.970> here<00:01:06.420> at<00:01:06.630> depicting<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.530> size<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
job here at depicting the size of the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.160 
job here at depicting the size of the
Anna<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.850> waters<00:01:09.180> than<00:01:09.390> these<00:01:09.540> pages<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.110> think

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
Anna and waters than these pages I think

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.800 
Anna and waters than these pages I think
it<00:01:10.560> might<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:10.890> largely<00:01:11.700> because<00:01:12.119> there's<00:01:12.510> very

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
it might be largely because there's very

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.530 
it might be largely because there's very
little<00:01:12.930> point<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.409> reference<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:14.100> scale<00:01:15.060> in

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
little point of reference for scale in

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.969 
little point of reference for scale in
the<00:01:15.630> distance<00:01:15.960> all<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.350> see<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.890> these

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the distance all you see is just these

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.340 
the distance all you see is just these
very<00:01:17.310> sheer<00:01:17.670> vertical<00:01:17.970> stone<00:01:18.570> walls<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.320> you

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
very sheer vertical stone walls so you

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.870 
very sheer vertical stone walls so you
can't<00:01:19.590> actually<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> river<00:01:20.790> is

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
can't actually see that the river is

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.240 
can't actually see that the river is
very<00:01:21.210> wide<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.500> only<00:01:22.619> put<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.070> down

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
very wide but I can only put that down

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.280 
very wide but I can only put that down
to<00:01:23.490> my<00:01:23.790> inexperience<00:01:24.210> drawing<00:01:24.810> these<00:01:24.930> sort<00:01:25.200> of

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
to my inexperience drawing these sort of

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.710 
to my inexperience drawing these sort of
backgrounds<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.610> think<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.509> few

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
backgrounds and I think with just a few

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.569 
backgrounds and I think with just a few
perspective<00:01:28.650> changes<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.310> might<00:01:29.460> have

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
perspective changes that might have

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.219 
perspective changes that might have
ended<00:01:29.820> up<00:01:29.850> better<00:01:30.030> either<00:01:30.689> way<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.840> was

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
ended up better either way I was

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.280 
ended up better either way I was
starting<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.770> break<00:01:32.579> out<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.659> formula<00:01:34.020> of

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
starting to break out of the formula of

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.780 
starting to break out of the formula of
drawing<00:01:34.590> Annie<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.159> was<00:01:35.280> starting<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.579> feel

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
drawing Annie and I was starting to feel

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.569 
drawing Annie and I was starting to feel
more<00:01:36.180> comfortable<00:01:36.930> not<00:01:37.439> sticking<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
more comfortable not sticking with the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.789 
more comfortable not sticking with the
original<00:01:39.090> character<00:01:39.930> design<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.500> I've<00:01:40.619> made

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
original character design that I've made

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.440 
original character design that I've made
before<00:01:40.979> start<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> comic<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.180> since

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
before start in the comic and since

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.510 
before start in the comic and since
she's<00:01:42.630> shown<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.170> kind<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.860> neat<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.280> tidy

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
she's shown to be kind of neat and tidy

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.819 
she's shown to be kind of neat and tidy
it's<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:45.750> fun<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.140> draw<00:01:46.350> her<00:01:46.500> looking<00:01:46.770> a

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
it's it was fun to draw her looking a

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.399 
it's it was fun to draw her looking a
bit<00:01:46.979> disheveled<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.549> Oh<00:01:48.180> looky<00:01:48.810> here<00:01:49.110> it's

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
bit disheveled and Oh looky here it's

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.190 
bit disheveled and Oh looky here it's
this<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.399> where<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.579> start<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.000> draw<00:01:51.329> her<00:01:51.869> hair

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
this is where I start to draw her hair

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.530 
this is where I start to draw her hair
flipping<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:53.130> at<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> ends<00:01:53.640> almost<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.509> a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
flipping up at the ends almost like a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.160 
flipping up at the ends almost like a
flame<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.549> yep<00:01:56.880> shadow<00:01:57.119> comes<00:01:57.390> back<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
flame and so yep shadow comes back and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.550 
flame and so yep shadow comes back and
he<00:01:58.350> did<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.399> way<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.700> imagined<00:02:00.149> shadow

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
he did the way that I imagined shadow

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.630 
he did the way that I imagined shadow
speaking<00:02:01.560> at<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.950> point<00:02:02.189> before<00:02:02.369> he

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
speaking at this point before he

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.609 
speaking at this point before he
actually<00:02:02.909> finds<00:02:03.149> his<00:02:03.329> voice<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:04.439> almost

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
actually finds his voice is it's almost

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.969 
actually finds his voice is it's almost
like<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.860> beeps<00:02:05.790> or<00:02:06.259> chirps<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.799> would<00:02:07.890> be

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
like a beeps or chirps that would be

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.990 
like a beeps or chirps that would be
made<00:02:08.160> from<00:02:08.429> very<00:02:09.020> high-pitched<00:02:10.020> vibrations

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
made from very high-pitched vibrations

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.610 
made from very high-pitched vibrations
in<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.180> case<00:02:12.390> since<00:02:12.690> he's<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.110> stone

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
in this case since he's on a stone

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.080 
in this case since he's on a stone
surface<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.220> would<00:02:14.280> probably<00:02:14.580> sound<00:02:14.909> like

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
surface it would probably sound like

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.690 
surface it would probably sound like
whatever<00:02:15.659> sound<00:02:16.019> rocks<00:02:17.010> would<00:02:17.220> make<00:02:17.370> if<00:02:17.549> they

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
whatever sound rocks would make if they

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.369 
whatever sound rocks would make if they
were<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.970> vibrate<00:02:18.390> against<00:02:18.720> each<00:02:18.810> other<00:02:19.019> at<00:02:19.319> a

high pitch as cat finds out later the

one main jerk and her tag-along jerk
here<00:02:33.569> but<00:02:34.140> they<00:02:34.260> explained<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.829> shadow

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
here but they explained that shadow

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.339 
here but they explained that shadow
wasn't<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.030> shadow<00:02:36.390> man<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.720> was<00:02:36.840> up<00:02:36.989> at<00:02:37.319> the

down at the bottom of the other ravine

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.039 
down at the bottom of the other ravine
because<00:02:44.760> they're<00:02:45.180> undergoing<00:02:45.540> some<00:02:45.810> sort<00:02:45.989> of

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
because they're undergoing some sort of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
test and to complete that test they want

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.809 
test and to complete that test they want
Annie<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.930> kill<00:02:49.260> them<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:50.069> wanted<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.430> start

Annie to kill them and I wanted to start

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.699 
Annie to kill them and I wanted to start
showing<00:02:51.060> how<00:02:51.780> strange<00:02:52.109> their<00:02:52.410> fairy

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
showing how strange their fairy

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.699 
showing how strange their fairy
creatures<00:02:52.920> were<00:02:53.310> by<00:02:54.060> them<00:02:54.989> finding<00:02:55.560> it

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
creatures were by them finding it

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.800 
creatures were by them finding it
unconscionable<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:57.209> any<00:02:57.390> would<00:02:57.599> suggest

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
unconscionable that any would suggest

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.479 
unconscionable that any would suggest
that<00:02:58.079> they<00:02:58.200> cheat<00:02:58.470> on<00:02:58.500> their<00:02:58.769> test<00:02:58.980> even

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
that they cheat on their test even

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.789 
that they cheat on their test even
though<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.180> test<00:03:00.390> itself<00:03:00.750> required<00:03:01.230> them<00:03:01.530> to

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
though the test itself required them to

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.559 
though the test itself required them to
end<00:03:02.040> their<00:03:02.220> lives<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.819> order<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.239> show<00:03:03.390> that

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
end their lives in order to show that

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.149 
end their lives in order to show that
the<00:03:03.690> priorities<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.440> creatures<00:03:04.890> like<00:03:05.010> these

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
the priorities of creatures like these

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.860 
the priorities of creatures like these
and<00:03:05.489> maybe<00:03:05.609> creatures<00:03:06.030> from<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.359> forest<00:03:06.690> are

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
and maybe creatures from the forest are

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.649 
and maybe creatures from the forest are
very<00:03:07.470> different<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:08.069> human<00:03:08.849> priorities<00:03:09.420> and

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
very different to human priorities and

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.440 
very different to human priorities and
on<00:03:10.079> this<00:03:10.170> page<00:03:10.409> we<00:03:10.859> see<00:03:11.549> some<00:03:11.790> Big<00:03:11.970> L<00:03:12.209> guy
