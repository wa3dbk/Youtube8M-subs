00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.230 
my step tricep and also a good form for
standing<00:00:21.240> would<00:00:21.539> be<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.730> make<00:00:23.730> sure<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.119> your

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
standing would be to make sure that your

first of all sleet is in a nice stable
position<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.269> would<00:00:30.420> say<00:00:30.599> shoulder<00:00:30.990> width

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
position I would say shoulder width

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
upright in doing that that stops you

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.410 
upright in doing that that stops you
from<00:00:46.010> pushing<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.160> shoulders<00:00:47.760> forward<00:00:48.030> and

from pushing your shoulders forward and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.959 
from pushing your shoulders forward and
engaging<00:00:48.719> your<00:00:49.170> deltoids<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:50.100> which<00:00:50.730> case

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
engaging your deltoids in which case

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.569 
engaging your deltoids in which case
you'll<00:00:51.449> take<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> isolation<00:00:52.500> move<00:00:52.680> away<00:00:53.010> from

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
you'll take the isolation move away from

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.540 
you'll take the isolation move away from
the<00:00:53.730> visor<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.809> variations<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.890> holding<00:00:56.520> the

the visor the variations in holding the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.799 
the visor the variations in holding the
bars<00:00:56.850> would<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:59.489> closer<00:00:59.789> grip<00:01:00.239> we'll<00:01:00.660> be

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
bars would be the closer grip we'll be

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.299 
bars would be the closer grip we'll be
working<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:02.149> their<00:01:03.149> full<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.199> lengthening<00:01:04.920> of

the of the curl and working on the long
head<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.380> bicep<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.909> long<00:01:12.060> heads<00:01:12.299> more

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
head of the bicep the long heads more

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.840 
head of the bicep the long heads more
concentrated<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.650> overall<00:01:14.040> fitness<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
concentrated on overall fitness of the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.359 
concentrated on overall fitness of the
arm<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:16.229> those<00:01:16.350> who<00:01:16.530> want<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.710> get<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.979> thicker

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
arm for those who want to get a thicker

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.770 
arm for those who want to get a thicker
arm<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.900> then<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.259> want<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.880> basically<00:01:20.930> just

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
arm and then you want to basically just

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.840 
arm and then you want to basically just
have<00:01:22.900> a<00:01:22.930> more<00:01:23.380> narrower<00:01:23.860> grip<00:01:24.159> so<00:01:24.610> I'll<00:01:24.700> be

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
have a more narrower grip so I'll be

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.700 
have a more narrower grip so I'll be
showing<00:01:25.060> how<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:25.869> come<00:01:26.170> all<00:01:26.320> that<00:01:26.350> and

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
showing how you come all that and

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.580 
showing how you come all that and
obviously<00:01:27.010> body<00:01:27.460> positioning<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:29.290> wider

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
obviously body positioning and the wider

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.560 
obviously body positioning and the wider
the<00:01:29.830> grip<00:01:30.070> should<00:01:30.340> be<00:01:30.520> concentrating<00:01:31.299> more<00:01:31.450> in

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
the grip should be concentrating more in

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.350 
the grip should be concentrating more in
the<00:01:31.860> shorter<00:01:32.860> heads<00:01:33.070> which<00:01:33.790> gives<00:01:34.180> our

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
the shorter heads which gives our

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.749 
the shorter heads which gives our
overall<00:01:34.750> pay<00:01:34.990> peak<00:01:35.380> on<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.890> bicep<00:01:41.430> good<00:01:42.430> form

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
overall pay peak on the bicep good form

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.609 
overall pay peak on the bicep good form
for<00:01:43.030> skull<00:01:43.300> crusher<00:01:43.570> would<00:01:43.840> be<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.259> make<00:01:44.409> sure

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
for skull crusher would be to make sure

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.219 
for skull crusher would be to make sure
that<00:01:44.830> your<00:01:45.100> your<00:01:45.909> elbow<00:01:46.270> is<00:01:46.479> faced<00:01:46.750> in<00:01:46.960> front

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
that your your elbow is faced in front

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.039 
that your your elbow is faced in front
first<00:01:47.560> of<00:01:47.770> all<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.970> make<00:01:49.149> sure<00:01:49.330> also<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:49.750> your

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
first of all to make sure also that your

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.580 
first of all to make sure also that your
your<00:01:50.380> wrists<00:01:50.860> aren't<00:01:51.369> too<00:01:51.640> too<00:01:52.540> floppy<00:01:52.780> or

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
your wrists aren't too too floppy or

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.560 
your wrists aren't too too floppy or
you're<00:01:53.740> holding<00:01:54.040> it<00:01:54.159> nice<00:01:54.369> and<00:01:54.399> firm<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
you're holding it nice and firm the

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.060 
you're holding it nice and firm the
reason<00:01:58.990> why<00:01:59.110> it's<00:01:59.259> called<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.530> skull<00:01:59.860> crusher

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
reason why it's called the skull crusher

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.560 
reason why it's called the skull crusher
is<00:02:00.369> if<00:02:00.520> you<00:02:00.610> get<00:02:00.759> it<00:02:00.909> wrong<00:02:01.030> then<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.360> pretty

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
is if you get it wrong then you pretty

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.710 
is if you get it wrong then you pretty
much<00:02:01.750> lose<00:02:02.080> in<00:02:02.770> your<00:02:02.890> head<00:02:03.039> so<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:04.420> don't<00:02:04.600> want

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
much lose in your head so you don't want

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.490 
much lose in your head so you don't want
to<00:02:04.780> go<00:02:04.869> too<00:02:04.929> heavy<00:02:05.289> on<00:02:05.560> that<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:06.569> it<00:02:07.569> is<00:02:08.350> how

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
to go too heavy on that and it is how

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.020 
to go too heavy on that and it is how
you<00:02:08.530> form<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.190> exercise<00:02:09.610> as<00:02:09.819> well

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
you form the exercise as well

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.580 
you form the exercise as well
you<00:02:10.269> know<00:02:10.390> you<00:02:10.450> need<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.690> perform<00:02:11.319> it<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
you know you need to perform it the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.440 
you know you need to perform it the
correct<00:02:11.860> way<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.250> order<00:02:12.459> to<00:02:12.580> make<00:02:12.730> sure<00:02:12.760> you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
correct way in order to make sure you

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.930 
correct way in order to make sure you
hit<00:02:13.600> in<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.840> right<00:02:14.019> part<00:02:14.319> if<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.519> elbows<00:02:15.910> are

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
hit in the right part if the elbows are

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.120 
hit in the right part if the elbows are
not<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.900> right<00:02:17.050> place<00:02:17.380> then<00:02:17.709> you'll<00:02:17.920> end

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
not in the right place then you'll end

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.920 
not in the right place then you'll end
up<00:02:18.280> hitting<00:02:18.459> your<00:02:18.700> shoulders<00:02:19.209> or<00:02:19.510> your<00:02:19.600> chest

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
up hitting your shoulders or your chest

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.330 
up hitting your shoulders or your chest
so<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.340> think<00:02:21.550> form<00:02:22.180> on<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.690> really

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
so I think form on that is really

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.280 
so I think form on that is really
important

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.550 

wrist<00:02:28.290> curls<00:02:28.530> covers<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.720> flat<00:02:30.720> part<00:02:30.990> forearm

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
wrist curls covers the flat part forearm

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.620
