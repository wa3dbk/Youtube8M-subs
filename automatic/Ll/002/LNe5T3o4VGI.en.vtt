00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.190 
down since i don't live in the same city
as<00:00:37.700> my<00:00:37.730> sister<00:00:38.090> I<00:00:38.270> was<00:00:38.540> a<00:00:38.570> little<00:00:38.899> out<00:00:39.020> of<00:00:39.079> my

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
as my sister I was a little out of my

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.800 
as my sister I was a little out of my
element<00:00:39.350> at<00:00:39.980> this<00:00:40.190> thrift<00:00:40.460> store<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.420> I<00:00:41.450> got

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
element at this thrift store so I got

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.890 
element at this thrift store so I got
off<00:00:41.930> to<00:00:42.110> a<00:00:42.140> really<00:00:42.410> a<00:00:42.740> slow<00:00:43.400> start<00:00:43.880> but<00:00:44.540> it<00:00:44.690> all

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
off to a really a slow start but it all

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.230 
off to a really a slow start but it all
worked<00:00:45.140> out<00:00:45.320> in<00:00:45.380> the<00:00:45.650> end<00:00:48.610> so<00:00:49.610> we<00:00:49.730> started<00:00:50.090> out

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
worked out in the end so we started out

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.420 
worked out in the end so we started out
drifting<00:00:50.510> together<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.530> then<00:00:51.650> I<00:00:51.680> realized<00:00:52.190> we

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
drifting together and then I realized we

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.700 
drifting together and then I realized we
should<00:00:52.580> probably<00:00:52.880> split<00:00:53.420> up<00:00:53.720> so<00:00:53.990> we<00:00:54.290> can<00:00:54.530> get

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
should probably split up so we can get

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.710 
should probably split up so we can get
everything<00:00:54.980> that<00:00:55.340> we<00:00:55.640> wanted<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:55.970> get<00:00:56.240> which

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
everything that we wanted to get which

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.569 
everything that we wanted to get which
brings<00:00:56.990> me<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.230> my<00:00:57.440> first<00:00:57.620> tip<00:00:57.950> if<00:00:58.130> you're<00:00:58.340> with

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
brings me to my first tip if you're with

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.700 
brings me to my first tip if you're with
a<00:00:58.610> partner<00:00:59.150> split<00:00:59.840> up<00:00:59.990> for<00:01:00.170> better<00:01:00.440> coverage

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
a partner split up for better coverage

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:16.180 
a partner split up for better coverage
of<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.190> store

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.550

the<00:01:22.500> beginning<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.160> I<00:01:23.880> struggled<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.510> little

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
the beginning and I struggled a little

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.640 
the beginning and I struggled a little
bit<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.260> my<00:01:26.040> car<00:01:26.340> was<00:01:26.520> empty<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.570> empty<00:01:28.050> for

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
bit and my car was empty just empty for

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:37.190 
bit and my car was empty just empty for
a<00:01:28.680> while<00:01:34.369> once<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.490> got<00:01:35.640> my<00:01:35.820> groove<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.780> was

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
a while once I got my groove going I was

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.920

able to find some interesting pieces and
the<00:01:40.200> hard<00:01:40.440> part<00:01:40.740> became<00:01:41.130> picking<00:01:41.910> what<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the hard part became picking what I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.580 
the hard part became picking what I
really<00:01:42.420> wanted<00:01:42.720> because<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.170> had<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> five

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.090 
which we just get it this was these were
399<00:04:09.220> and<00:04:10.090> they<00:04:10.480> were<00:04:10.540> half<00:04:10.780> off<00:04:11.080> and<00:04:11.470> these<00:04:12.040> are

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
399 and they were half off and these are

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.780 
399 and they were half off and these are
so<00:04:13.320> they're<00:04:14.320> kind<00:04:14.560> of<00:04:14.620> like<00:04:14.770> four<00:04:15.100> quarter<00:04:15.580> on

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790
