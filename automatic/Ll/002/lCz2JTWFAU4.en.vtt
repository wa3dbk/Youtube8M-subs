00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:19.659 
stack it's actually this nanos real easy

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.800 
stack it's actually this nanos real easy
to<00:00:19.779> set<00:00:20.140> up<00:00:20.169> and<00:00:20.560> as<00:00:21.399> you<00:00:21.550> can<00:00:21.669> see<00:00:21.699> here<00:00:22.089> I<00:00:22.119> like

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
to set up and as you can see here I like

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.859 
to set up and as you can see here I like
to<00:00:22.989> also<00:00:23.199> use<00:00:23.589> the<00:00:24.460> dt<00:00:24.939> to<00:00:25.239> get<00:00:25.449> a<00:00:25.479> fast

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
to also use the dt to get a fast

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.509 
to also use the dt to get a fast
pressure<00:00:26.199> and<00:00:26.470> heat<00:00:26.710> to<00:00:26.979> the<00:00:27.130> quarterback

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
pressure and heat to the quarterback

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.479 
pressure and heat to the quarterback
because<00:00:28.059> the<00:00:28.149> dt<00:00:28.539> is<00:00:29.019> actually<00:00:29.619> the<00:00:29.859> fastest

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
because the dt is actually the fastest

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.190 
because the dt is actually the fastest
way<00:00:30.519> you<00:00:30.699> could<00:00:30.970> get<00:00:31.119> to<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.419> quarterback<00:00:31.659> if

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
way you could get to the quarterback if

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.650 
way you could get to the quarterback if
you<00:00:32.500> know<00:00:32.679> how<00:00:32.890> to<00:00:32.920> blitz<00:00:33.309> them<00:00:33.519> the<00:00:34.420> right<00:00:34.629> way

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
again I don't like the receivers I start

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.429 
again I don't like the receivers I start
experimenting<00:01:15.430> with<00:01:15.759> Oregon<00:01:16.210> today<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:17.350> I
