that<00:00:45.300> i<00:00:45.329> would<00:00:45.539> think<00:00:45.660> but<00:00:45.840> even<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.200> they<00:00:46.350> did

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
that i would think but even if they did

you<00:00:47.129> know<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.520> would<00:00:47.670> make<00:00:47.850> him<00:00:47.969> even

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
you know that would make him even

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.940 
you know that would make him even
stronger<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:48.960> that's<00:00:49.140> that's<00:00:49.469> he<00:00:49.680> would<00:00:49.829> be

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
stronger but that's that's he would be

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.850 
stronger but that's that's he would be
strong<00:00:50.160> enough<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.399> win<00:00:50.579> anyway<00:00:51.469> yes<00:00:52.469> i'ma
