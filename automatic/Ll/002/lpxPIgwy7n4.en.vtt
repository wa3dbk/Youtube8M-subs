00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.589
 I do not know why something strange was heard 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.650
 but I think it's from my phone 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:19.380
 let's go into a world and let's see if 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.050
 they fixed some some details that 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.810
 they had out there 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.990
 to see what is generated by the world that we are 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.990
 in 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.500
 in what is this third person 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.210
 we change the view and also something that 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.550
 they added for example since when you kill 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.920
 to a golem that now does not wear 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.809
 and we're going to kill him I know it's not pretty 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.220
 but we have to do everything be it for the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.640
 review 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:49.470

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.830
 iron to see we make here a golem I do not know 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.420
 why suddenly it gets stuck a lot I do not know 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.420
 What happened to my phone right now? 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.729
 truth is something strange but good 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.030
 let's do this quick fast if it's 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:09.320
 that this works I do not know if in the chs ya 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:13.540
 for the version or why but let's see 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.460
 we go down if he lets me go down there is 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.520
 ok let's kill him with all the put the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.510
 world to see to see goals and everything is supposed 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.110
 that would give us the ok is iron 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.390
 because I do not know if I did it because 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.500
 I had when practically all night 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:36.430
 my phone but yes there it is and berlingo 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.230
 titos that is not equal to having blocks of 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.280
 iron but good let's see what they are 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.170

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.880

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.080
 description here only correct one 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.240
 error and they did not add more things 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.240
 they respond that now it goes to 60 fps instead 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.750
 of 20 responds that less is not right now 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.300

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.920

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.320
 squid released in the extinct 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.290
 it seems that they let us go and both leave 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.460
 drop the tears and gunpowder fields of 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.530
 level can now be replaced by 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.930
 blocks can be used fight while 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.430

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.760

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.959
 fixed in what is the anvil well 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.720
