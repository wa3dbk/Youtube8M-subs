just<00:01:38.490> exactly<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.540> Bushmaster<00:01:40.549> because

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
just exactly like a Bushmaster because

just exactly like a Bushmaster because
that's<00:01:41.759> exactly<00:01:41.909> what<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.930> a

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
but overall it's not too bad for $15.99

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.830 
but overall it's not too bad for $15.99
this<00:01:49.830> is<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.070> only<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:51.090> they

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
shipped us one and it's pretty good but

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.210
