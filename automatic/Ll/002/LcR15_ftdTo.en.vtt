Ellen's that I picked up I've actually

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.089 
Ellen's that I picked up I've actually
had<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:09.870> for<00:00:10.110> about<00:00:10.200> three<00:00:10.559> years<00:00:10.710> ago<00:00:10.860> and

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
had it for about three years ago and

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.850 
had it for about three years ago and
it's<00:00:11.429> more<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.820> toy<00:00:12.110> than<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.230> has<00:00:13.380> been<00:00:13.590> for

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
it's more of a toy than it has been for

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.450 
it's more of a toy than it has been for
anything<00:00:14.719> but<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.750> have<00:00:16.020> come<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.859> realize<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
anything but I have come to realize the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.320 
anything but I have come to realize the
survival<00:00:18.150> aspect<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.939> what<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.090> thing

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
survival aspect of it what this thing

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.050 
survival aspect of it what this thing
does<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.930> about<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.199> square<00:00:23.039> meter<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.939> if

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
does this is about a square meter and if

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.810 
does this is about a square meter and if
you<00:00:24.150> have<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> square<00:00:24.600> meter<00:00:24.960> that's<00:00:25.260> about<00:00:25.820> one

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
you have a square meter that's about one

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.330 
you have a square meter that's about one
kilowatt<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.689> energy<00:00:28.099> 1,000<00:00:29.099> watts<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:31.340> it

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
kilowatt of energy 1,000 watts and it

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.920 
kilowatt of energy 1,000 watts and it
will<00:00:32.520> set<00:00:32.700> things<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.059> fire<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.540> start

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
will set things on fire you can start

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.400 
will set things on fire you can start
fires<00:00:35.239> but<00:00:36.239> as<00:00:36.600> far<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:37.700> prepping<00:00:39.170> what<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.200> was

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
fires but as far as prepping what I was

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.600 
fires but as far as prepping what I was
thinking<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.800> could<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.520> you

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
thinking you could do with it is you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.270 
thinking you could do with it is you
could<00:00:41.760> probably<00:00:41.910> purify<00:00:42.480> some<00:00:42.750> water<00:00:43.280> and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
could probably purify some water and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.060 
could probably purify some water and
what<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.730> made<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.930> home<00:00:46.170> purifier

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
what I have made here is a home purifier

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.740 
what I have made here is a home purifier
and<00:00:47.989> I<00:00:49.250> haven't<00:00:50.250> I'm<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.600> for

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
and I haven't I'm this is just for

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.569 
and I haven't I'm this is just for
demonstration<00:00:51.930> purposes<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.219> was<00:00:53.370> going<00:00:53.520> to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
demonstration purposes if I was going to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.970 
demonstration purposes if I was going to
make<00:00:53.699> one<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.910> would<00:00:54.120> use<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> plastic<00:00:54.539> bucket

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
make one I would use a plastic bucket

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.860 
make one I would use a plastic bucket
but<00:00:55.980> I've<00:00:56.489> got<00:00:56.670> some<00:00:56.850> rocks<00:00:57.090> virtually

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
but I've got some rocks virtually

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.049 
but I've got some rocks virtually

what<00:01:32.759> that's<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.240> do

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
what that's going to do

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.230 
what that's going to do
is<00:01:35.039> you've<00:01:36.039> heard<00:01:36.310> that<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.640> can<00:01:36.819> take<00:01:36.999> water

ten hours well the homestead prepper is

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.389 
ten hours well the homestead prepper is
impatient<00:01:42.729> I<00:01:43.030> can't<00:01:43.240> wait<00:01:43.390> that<00:01:43.420> long

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
that energy and it's going to kill all

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.580 
that energy and it's going to kill all

little<00:02:01.990> bit<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:05.530> can<00:02:05.679> also<00:02:05.799> cook<00:02:06.250> with

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
little bit and you can also cook with

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:12.180 
little bit and you can also cook with
this<00:02:07.030> thing<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:10.420> will<00:02:10.959> from<00:02:11.890> what<00:02:12.040> I've

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
this thing and it will from what I've

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.300 
this thing and it will from what I've
been<00:02:12.220> told<00:02:12.879> is<00:02:13.329> it<00:02:13.540> will<00:02:13.750> melt<00:02:14.019> a<00:02:14.170> penny<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.709> to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
been told is it will melt a penny and to

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.759 
been told is it will melt a penny and to
melt<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:15.610> penny<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.900> thing<00:02:17.170> puts<00:02:17.379> off<00:02:17.530> about

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
melt a penny this thing puts off about

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.990 
melt a penny this thing puts off about
2,000<00:02:18.400> degrees<00:02:18.670> which<00:02:18.970> copper<00:02:19.390> melts<00:02:19.690> at<00:02:21.000> 1983

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
2,000 degrees which copper melts at 1983

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.050 
2,000 degrees which copper melts at 1983
degrees<00:02:22.269> I<00:02:22.420> believe<00:02:22.829> so<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.400> has<00:02:24.579> a<00:02:24.610> lot<00:02:24.910> of

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
degrees I believe so it has a lot of

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.430 
degrees I believe so it has a lot of
uses<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.900> can<00:02:26.319> also<00:02:27.629> cook<00:02:28.629> with<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.079> let's
