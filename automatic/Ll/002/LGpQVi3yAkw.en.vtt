and there was a freeze frame and it

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.820 
and there was a freeze frame and it
stood<00:00:30.179> there<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.449> like<00:00:30.510> 5<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.960> 10<00:00:31.140> seconds<00:00:31.619> and

at the prices everything turns out the

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.150 
at the prices everything turns out the
most<00:04:23.810> beneficial<00:04:24.350> thing<00:04:24.530> is<00:04:24.650> actually<00:04:24.950> to<00:04:25.040> go

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
most beneficial thing is actually to go

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.920 
most beneficial thing is actually to go

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
for the highest rating thing

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.749 
for the highest rating thing
which<00:04:26.990> from<00:04:27.199> my<00:04:27.229> service<00:04:27.620> provider<00:04:27.800> would<00:04:28.580> be

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
which from my service provider would be

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.040 
which from my service provider would be
20<00:04:29.180> up<00:04:29.389> in<00:04:29.660> a<00:04:29.840> hundred<00:04:30.229> fifty<00:04:30.889> down<00:04:31.190> so<00:04:32.030> I<00:04:32.479> plan

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
20 up in a hundred fifty down so I plan

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.900 
20 up in a hundred fifty down so I plan
on<00:04:33.259> going<00:04:33.889> with<00:04:34.100> that<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.400> it's<00:04:34.520> actually<00:04:34.610> not

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
on going with that and it's actually not

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.430 
on going with that and it's actually not
that<00:04:34.970> much<00:04:35.150> more<00:04:35.479> of<00:04:35.570> an<00:04:35.660> investment<00:04:35.780> honestly

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
that much more of an investment honestly

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.719 
that much more of an investment honestly
so<00:04:36.650> I'm<00:04:36.860> surprised<00:04:37.100> we<00:04:37.130> never<00:04:37.280> did<00:04:37.550> it<00:04:37.639> before

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
so I'm surprised we never did it before

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.120 
so I'm surprised we never did it before
but<00:04:38.539> the<00:04:39.169> reason<00:04:39.320> I'm<00:04:39.470> telling<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:39.740> this<00:04:39.800> is

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
but the reason I'm telling you this is

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.430 
but the reason I'm telling you this is
the<00:04:40.910> quality<00:04:41.270> is<00:04:41.690> going<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:41.900> be<00:04:42.020> so<00:04:42.410> much

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
the quality is going to be so much

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.939 
the quality is going to be so much
better<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.610> have<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:44.419> much<00:04:44.479> less<00:04:45.050> lag<00:04:45.500> and

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
better and have so much less lag and

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.719 
better and have so much less lag and
delay<00:04:46.460> then<00:04:47.270> my<00:04:47.930> older<00:04:48.289> streams<00:04:48.650> so<00:04:49.340> that's

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
delay then my older streams so that's

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.040 
delay then my older streams so that's
the<00:04:49.820> only<00:04:50.000> reason<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.270> feel<00:04:50.479> I<00:04:50.509> should<00:04:50.660> even

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
the only reason I feel I should even

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.170 
the only reason I feel I should even
inform<00:04:51.380> you<00:04:51.470> guys<00:04:51.560> about<00:04:51.740> this<00:04:51.979> so<00:04:52.220> quality

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180
