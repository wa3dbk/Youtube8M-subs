00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.100 

now<00:01:57.550> we're<00:01:57.729> in<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.240> digital<00:01:58.570> speedometer

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
now we're in the digital speedometer

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.800 
now we're in the digital speedometer
mode<00:01:59.290> so<00:02:00.040> if<00:02:00.190> I<00:02:00.250> hit<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.700> right<00:02:01.330> arrow

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
mode so if I hit the right arrow

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.219 
mode so if I hit the right arrow
it<00:02:02.500> ain't<00:02:02.800> change<00:02:03.070> it<00:02:03.220> over<00:02:03.400> to<00:02:03.520> an<00:02:03.610> analog<00:02:07.229> so

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
it ain't change it over to an analog so

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.840 
it ain't change it over to an analog so
now<00:02:08.380> what<00:02:08.530> we'll<00:02:08.679> do<00:02:08.830> is<00:02:09.009> we'll<00:02:09.160> go<00:02:09.220> through

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
now what we'll do is we'll go through

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.920 
now what we'll do is we'll go through
all<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.479> our<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:12.400> you'll<00:02:12.550> see<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:13.000> center

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
all of our so you'll see the center

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.870 
all of our so you'll see the center
portion<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.530> change<00:02:14.800> from<00:02:15.010> looking<00:02:15.670> like<00:02:15.760> an

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
portion of a change from looking like an

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.520 
portion of a change from looking like an
analog<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.420> then<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.780> now<00:02:16.900> has<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> display

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
analog and then and now has a display

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.340 
analog and then and now has a display
screen<00:02:18.270> whenever<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.450> have<00:02:19.660> your<00:02:19.690> radio<00:02:20.080> on

that<00:04:14.400> in<00:04:14.610> detail<00:04:15.030> here<00:04:15.570> so<00:04:16.290> we're<00:04:16.410> gonna<00:04:16.500> enter

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
that in detail here so we're gonna enter

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.280 
that in detail here so we're gonna enter
in<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.860> set<00:04:17.070> up<00:04:18.830> so<00:04:19.830> let's<00:04:19.980> start<00:04:20.220> off<00:04:20.370> with

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
in a set up so let's start off with

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.990 
in a set up so let's start off with
upper<00:04:22.290> left<00:04:22.530> so<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:23.190> upper<00:04:23.400> left<00:04:23.610> hand<00:04:23.700> is

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
upper left so the upper left hand is

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.800 
upper left so the upper left hand is
right<00:04:24.210> now<00:04:24.360> it's<00:04:24.540> it's<00:04:24.750> miles<00:04:25.080> per<00:04:25.230> gallon<00:04:26.810> so

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
right now it's it's miles per gallon so

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.780 
right now it's it's miles per gallon so
we<00:04:28.110> can<00:04:28.260> actually<00:04:28.410> change<00:04:28.740> this<00:04:29.040> this<00:04:29.190> is<00:04:29.340> true

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
we can actually change this this is true

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.650 
we can actually change this this is true
for<00:04:30.060> all<00:04:30.270> four<00:04:30.680> quadrants<00:04:32.240> so<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.330> can<00:04:33.450> change

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
for all four quadrants so you can change

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.510 
for all four quadrants so you can change
instant

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520

all<00:05:05.240> have<00:05:05.450> the<00:05:05.600> same<00:05:05.810> functions<00:05:06.680> where<00:05:07.130> you

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
all have the same functions where you

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.300 
all have the same functions where you

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
can switch them around you can also

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.960 
can switch them around you can also
restore<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.850> factory<00:05:11.030> default<00:05:12.910> now<00:05:13.910> the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
restore the factory default now the

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.400 
restore the factory default now the
speedometer<00:05:14.540> there's<00:05:14.990> a<00:05:15.110> couple<00:05:15.290> different

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
speedometer there's a couple different

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.440 
speedometer there's a couple different
views<00:05:15.890> we<00:05:16.130> have<00:05:16.280> two<00:05:16.490> analog<00:05:16.850> versions<00:05:17.300> and

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
views we have two analog versions and

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.770 
views we have two analog versions and
two<00:05:17.540> digital<00:05:17.930> versions<00:05:19.450> right<00:05:20.450> now<00:05:20.600> we're<00:05:20.750> on

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
two digital versions right now we're on

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.030 
two digital versions right now we're on
analog<00:05:21.230> to<00:05:22.990> sowhat<00:05:23.990> analog<00:05:24.350> one<00:05:24.590> does<00:05:24.800> that

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
analog to sowhat analog one does that

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.610 
analog to sowhat analog one does that
gives<00:05:25.190> you<00:05:25.340> some<00:05:26.140> borders<00:05:27.140> to<00:05:27.380> kind<00:05:27.560> of

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
gives you some borders to kind of

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.240 
gives you some borders to kind of
complete<00:05:27.950> the<00:05:29.680> circular<00:05:30.680> design<00:05:30.800> of<00:05:31.130> the

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
complete the circular design of the

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.900 
complete the circular design of the
gauges<00:05:31.460> it<00:05:32.180> keeps<00:05:32.570> that<00:05:32.810> analog<00:05:33.500> look<00:05:33.830> then<00:05:34.820> we

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
gauges it keeps that analog look then we

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:46.070 
gauges it keeps that analog look then we
have<00:05:35.030> a<00:05:35.060> digital<00:05:39.790> save<00:05:40.790> it

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.719 

so<00:05:46.590> that's<00:05:46.710> what<00:05:46.860> the<00:05:46.949> digital<00:05:47.129> looks<00:05:47.550> like

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
so that's what the digital looks like

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.999 
so that's what the digital looks like
the<00:05:48.539> other<00:05:48.690> digital<00:05:49.169> just<00:05:49.440> takes<00:05:49.620> away<00:05:49.830> those

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
the other digital just takes away those

00:05:50.009 --> 00:06:03.140 
the other digital just takes away those
circles<00:05:51.710> right<00:05:52.710> here<00:05:53.039> and

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.200 

we'll<00:06:03.600> save<00:06:03.810> it<00:06:03.840> to<00:06:04.020> analog<00:06:04.350> one<00:06:06.260> gear<00:06:07.260> display

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
we'll save it to analog one gear display

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:14.170 
we'll save it to analog one gear display
you<00:06:09.210> can<00:06:09.240> either<00:06:09.510> have<00:06:09.690> it<00:06:09.720> say<00:06:10.020> P<00:06:10.770> or<00:06:11.669> R<00:06:12.380> energy

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
you can either have it say P or R energy

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:21.170 
you can either have it say P or R energy
which<00:06:15.180> is<00:06:15.300> what<00:06:15.450> we're<00:06:15.570> set<00:06:15.750> at<00:06:15.870> right<00:06:15.990> now

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.870 

it<00:06:21.960> is<00:06:22.080> important<00:06:22.500> to<00:06:22.530> note<00:06:22.770> that<00:06:23.009> system

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
it is important to note that system

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.580 
it is important to note that system

so<00:06:57.540> here<00:06:57.750> display<00:06:58.050> right<00:06:58.260> now<00:06:58.380> is<00:06:58.500> P<00:06:59.540> now<00:07:00.540> we

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 
so here display right now is P now we

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.480 
so here display right now is P now we
can<00:07:00.840> change<00:07:01.080> it<00:07:01.290> to<00:07:01.350> where<00:07:01.560> it<00:07:01.680> says<00:07:01.830> word<00:07:02.160> and

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
can change it to where it says word and

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:29.629 
can change it to where it says word and
they'll<00:07:02.610> just<00:07:02.790> turn<00:07:02.970> it<00:07:03.120> into<00:07:03.270> Park
