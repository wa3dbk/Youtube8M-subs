and<00:02:16.150> small<00:02:16.840> history<00:02:17.320> if<00:02:17.470> you<00:02:17.590> want<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.800> know

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
and small history if you want to know

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.740 
and small history if you want to know
more<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.160> mean<00:02:18.430> definitely<00:02:18.610> google<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.540> because

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
more I mean definitely google it because

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.240 
more I mean definitely google it because
it's<00:02:19.870> kind<00:02:20.020> of<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.290> really<00:02:20.650> wild<00:02:20.890> and

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
it's kind of a really wild and

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.240 
it's kind of a really wild and
interesting<00:02:21.880> history<00:02:22.950> what<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:23.980> most

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
interesting history what is most

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.580 
interesting history what is most
interesting<00:02:24.460> about<00:02:24.850> cacao<00:02:25.180> is<00:02:25.600> despite<00:02:26.440> all

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
interesting about cacao is despite all

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.220 
interesting about cacao is despite all
its<00:02:26.710> controversy<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.090> plant<00:02:28.720> with<00:02:29.050> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
its controversy it is the plant with the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.910 
its controversy it is the plant with the
highest<00:02:29.650> amount<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:31.080> antioxidant<00:02:32.080> profile<00:02:32.590> in

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
highest amount of antioxidant profile in

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.150 
highest amount of antioxidant profile in
all<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.060> lands<00:02:34.480> now<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.080> heard<00:02:35.710> recently

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
all of the lands now I heard recently

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.220 
all of the lands now I heard recently
somebody<00:02:36.820> may<00:02:37.240> have<00:02:37.450> found<00:02:37.600> like<00:02:37.840> one<00:02:38.110> or<00:02:38.200> two

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
somebody may have found like one or two

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.800 
somebody may have found like one or two
things<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:39.010> may<00:02:39.310> or<00:02:39.550> may<00:02:39.580> not<00:02:39.730> be<00:02:39.940> slightly

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
things that may or may not be slightly

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.110 
things that may or may not be slightly
higher<00:02:41.140> in<00:02:41.320> antioxidants<00:02:42.070> but<00:02:42.550> there's<00:02:42.760> no

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
higher in antioxidants but there's no

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.540 
higher in antioxidants but there's no
definite<00:02:43.660> yet<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.200> at<00:02:44.440> this<00:02:44.470> point<00:02:44.980> cacao<00:02:45.370> is

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
definite yet so at this point cacao is

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.380 
definite yet so at this point cacao is
considered<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.120> highest<00:02:47.940> now<00:02:48.940> some<00:02:49.210> of<00:02:49.300> the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
considered the highest now some of the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.110 
considered the highest now some of the
things<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.810> can<00:02:49.960> do<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.530> its<00:02:51.400> traditionally

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
things it can do is its traditionally

even things like breast milk production
and<00:03:07.120> even<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.750> little<00:03:07.900> bit<00:03:08.020> of<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.770> know<00:03:08.800> things

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
and even a little bit of you know things

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.620 
and even a little bit of you know things
like<00:03:09.250> heart<00:03:09.460> disease<00:03:09.550> or<00:03:09.970> anything<00:03:10.060> requiring

like heart disease or anything requiring

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.080 
like heart disease or anything requiring
magnesium<00:03:11.410> because<00:03:11.800> there<00:03:12.100> is<00:03:12.250> an<00:03:12.400> enormous

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
magnesium because there is an enormous

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.480 
magnesium because there is an enormous
amount<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.480> magnesium<00:03:14.110> in<00:03:14.260> cacao<00:03:14.680> which<00:03:15.370> is

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
amount of magnesium in cacao which is

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.030 
amount of magnesium in cacao which is
why<00:03:15.610> women<00:03:16.510> during<00:03:17.230> monthly<00:03:17.620> cycles

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
why women during monthly cycles

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.790 
why women during monthly cycles
traditionally<00:03:18.640> crave<00:03:18.940> chocolate<00:03:19.800> most

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
traditionally crave chocolate most

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.560 
traditionally crave chocolate most
likely<00:03:21.070> because<00:03:21.220> of<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:22.120> amount<00:03:22.390> of

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
likely because of the the amount of

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.540 
likely because of the the amount of
magnesium<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.470> there<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.739> calcium<00:03:24.220> in<00:03:24.400> there

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
magnesium and there is calcium in there

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.830 
magnesium and there is calcium in there
too<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:26.250> let<00:03:27.250> me<00:03:27.370> give<00:03:27.550> you<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.730> rundown<00:03:28.209> of<00:03:28.720> some

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
too so let me give you a rundown of some

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.590 
too so let me give you a rundown of some
of<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.290> chemical<00:03:29.830> components<00:03:30.580> of<00:03:30.730> cacao<00:03:31.360> and

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
of the chemical components of cacao and

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.900 
of the chemical components of cacao and
I<00:03:31.780> don't<00:03:31.930> mean<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:32.890> know<00:03:33.010> chemicals<00:03:33.700> that

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
I don't mean you know chemicals that

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.340 
I don't mean you know chemicals that
they<00:03:34.030> add<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.630> when<00:03:34.780> you're<00:03:34.900> making<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:35.290> a

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
they add to it when you're making like a

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.660 
they add to it when you're making like a
Hershey's<00:03:35.620> chocolate<00:03:35.800> bar<00:03:36.280> these<00:03:36.520> are

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
Hershey's chocolate bar these are

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.610 
Hershey's chocolate bar these are
naturally<00:03:37.209> occurring<00:03:37.630> chemical<00:03:38.050> compounds

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
naturally occurring chemical compounds

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.080 
naturally occurring chemical compounds
the<00:03:39.250> first<00:03:39.580> one<00:03:39.850> is<00:03:40.410> anandam<00:03:41.410> I'd<00:03:41.560> this<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:42.760> a

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
the first one is anandam I'd this is a

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.560 
the first one is anandam I'd this is a
euphoric<00:03:43.959> substance<00:03:44.650> very<00:03:44.830> similar<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.670> THC

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
euphoric substance very similar to THC

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.370 
euphoric substance very similar to THC
in<00:03:47.350> marijuana<00:03:47.950> it<00:03:48.459> is<00:03:48.670> not<00:03:48.910> THC<00:03:49.630> it<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:50.050> similar

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
in marijuana it is not THC it is similar

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.040 
in marijuana it is not THC it is similar
to<00:03:50.830> it<00:03:51.010> which<00:03:51.730> is<00:03:51.910> why<00:03:52.030> people<00:03:52.090> sometimes<00:03:52.780> eat

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
to it which is why people sometimes eat

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.259 
to it which is why people sometimes eat
any<00:03:53.320> sort<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:53.739> like<00:03:53.920> chocolate<00:03:54.459> or<00:03:54.519> cacao<00:03:54.910> and

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
any sort of like chocolate or cacao and

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.740 
any sort of like chocolate or cacao and
they<00:03:55.750> get<00:03:56.019> kind<00:03:56.320> of<00:03:56.410> like<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.920> know<00:03:57.040> like

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
they get kind of like you know like

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.479 
they get kind of like you know like
romantic<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:59.050> euphoric<00:03:59.440> and<00:03:59.800> you<00:04:00.370> know

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
romantic and euphoric and you know

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.949 
romantic and euphoric and you know
they're<00:04:00.670> just<00:04:00.880> kind<00:04:01.060> of<00:04:01.120> in<00:04:01.300> a<00:04:01.330> state<00:04:01.630> of<00:04:01.750> bliss

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
they're just kind of in a state of bliss

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.920 
they're just kind of in a state of bliss
so<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:03.519> is<00:04:03.730> kind<00:04:03.880> of<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.090> chemical<00:04:04.510> answer

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
so that is kind of the chemical answer

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.770 
so that is kind of the chemical answer
to<00:04:05.200> what<00:04:05.410> you're<00:04:05.620> feeling<00:04:06.450> another<00:04:07.450> thing

to what you're feeling another thing

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.699 
to what you're feeling another thing
that<00:04:08.380> is<00:04:08.410> in<00:04:08.709> there<00:04:08.950> is<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.989> amino<00:04:10.989> acid<00:04:11.440> called

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
that is in there is a amino acid called

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.330 
that is in there is a amino acid called
arginine<00:04:12.570> and<00:04:13.570> this<00:04:14.050> is<00:04:14.350> kind<00:04:14.769> of<00:04:14.830> also<00:04:15.310> a

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
arginine and this is kind of also a

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.640 
arginine and this is kind of also a
natural<00:04:15.820> aphrodisiac<00:04:16.140> amongst<00:04:17.140> many<00:04:17.410> other
