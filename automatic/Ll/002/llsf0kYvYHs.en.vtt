how<00:06:14.530> much<00:06:14.680> it<00:06:14.860> costs<00:06:15.690> but<00:06:16.690> I<00:06:16.960> think<00:06:17.169> it<00:06:17.260> was

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
how much it costs but I think it was

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.820 
how much it costs but I think it was
around<00:06:17.789> $4<00:06:18.789> $5<00:06:19.539> give<00:06:19.810> or<00:06:19.930> take<00:06:20.050> if<00:06:20.349> it<00:06:20.530> is<00:06:20.650> that

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
around $4 $5 give or take if it is that

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.110 
around $4 $5 give or take if it is that
price<00:06:21.099> it's<00:06:21.340> kind<00:06:21.639> of<00:06:21.669> worth<00:06:21.849> it<00:06:22.000> because

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
price it's kind of worth it because

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.700 
price it's kind of worth it because
again<00:06:22.300> I<00:06:22.510> use<00:06:22.630> my<00:06:22.660> pebble<00:06:22.930> so<00:06:23.110> much<00:06:23.349> every

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710
