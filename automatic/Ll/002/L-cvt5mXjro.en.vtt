00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello ladies and gentlemen with you again 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.750
 fox bregman and the next video on the channel 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.349
 will be dedicated 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.290
 global keyboard rework nowhere 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.770
 where you will not see this look not look 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.289
 that is, I will start doing such a project 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.180
 I will show you a specific step by step 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.840
 I will explain it will be the so-called first 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.429
 a series 1 part actually well and from what we 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.769
 let's start with the tasks of Altai searching in 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.530
 internet keyboard which would be 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.380
 wireless would be backlit here 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.890
 all that I managed to find this 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.700
 keyboard is our keyboard 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.370
 It turns out microsoft 8 thousandth model 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.620
 Comes with a mouse in a set on batteries 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.390
 illuminated all very surely probably 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.270
 comfortable keyboard as they write here and 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.969
 say judging by the recall so she is all 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.730
 beautiful mouse say not very 4 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.329
 batteries included 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:07.080
 but but the price of this kit 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.270
 from 9 to 12 thousand rubles and practically 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.130
 you will not find anywhere else to respectively 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.490
 make something like you can go 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.619
 cheaper way to do it yourself 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.840
 hence the conclusion 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.570
 to make the keyboard wireless 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 glowing need to start to find 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:30.000
 backlight that is what was used 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.540
 The keyboard was taken as the base 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.909
 say a photos 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:41.150
 it turns out so taste and d800e 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:45.000
 Turk is so beautiful 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:49.110
 pretty won it is transparent like you 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.790
 You can see here what it is for 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.890
 explain showing will not shoot 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.020
 stupid vidic where top light bulbs 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.719
 diode ki put and all that because 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.780
 This full labudi absolute and the 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.840
 there is so doing in the collective farm I will 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.220
 do it with transparent buttons 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.300
 why disassembled and rotten 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.080
 Well, that is , we will now have a base 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.590
 considered such a keyboard too the photos 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.690
 we have 9 200 aw model 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.810
 it looks like we have a mouse like this 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:27.510
 bundled wireless receiver 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:29.480
 batteries like this 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.520
 wireless keyboard 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.480
 everything would of course be very simple that is 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.550
 swap keys yes let's say and 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.070
 they would all be transparent 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.290
 rests everything in it so as not descended 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.690
 backlight brightened just as it is 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.820
 it should be exactly the buttons 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.980
 Russian i.e. letters Russian and 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.910
 English all characters respectively 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.030
 for this the following will be produced 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.000
 action not from the wireless keyboard 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.200
 full keyboard 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.690
 part and it will be replaced by here this here but 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.040
 here it is with backlighting that is on 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.580
 transparent accordingly 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.140
 Of course he took it apart 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.580
 These keys are taken from such 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.150
 pretty transparent with the engraver 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.820
 all this work will be done 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.510
 accordingly, in fact, it will turn out 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.720
 something like this will overlap with us 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.930
 I will try very hard to do here 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:38.190
 neatly around here will be 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:43.099
 the switch turns out and as if here 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:47.040
 so in general so 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:50.370
 let's see what happens with us 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.040
 distance measurements were made all 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.480
 accordingly, the distance between 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.230
 buttons all match 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:02.250
 so what will I do in the course I will 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:05.329
 upload video all thanks to all with 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.329
 you was fox bregman
