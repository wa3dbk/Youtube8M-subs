00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.199 
shorter they're simply a bit softer on
the<00:03:29.020> ends<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:31.170> we'll<00:03:32.170> soon<00:03:32.500> be<00:03:32.890> able<00:03:33.459> to<00:03:33.760> swoop

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
the ends and we'll soon be able to swoop

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.509 
the ends and we'll soon be able to swoop
very<00:03:34.660> gracefully<00:03:35.290> over<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.860> side<00:03:36.069> and

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
very gracefully over to the side and

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.100 
very gracefully over to the side and
grow<00:03:37.150> out<00:03:37.390> into<00:03:38.019> layers<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:39.510> if<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.630> just<00:03:40.840> do

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
grow out into layers and if you just do

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.229 
grow out into layers and if you just do
this<00:03:41.290> every<00:03:41.650> six<00:03:41.860> weeks<00:03:42.010> or<00:03:42.370> so<00:03:42.580> as<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:42.849> bangs

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
this every six weeks or so as the bangs

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.089 
this every six weeks or so as the bangs
are<00:03:43.480> growing<00:03:43.840> just<00:03:44.080> kind<00:03:44.349> of<00:03:44.410> move<00:03:44.769> through

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
are growing just kind of move through

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.740 
are growing just kind of move through
the<00:03:45.190> banks<00:03:45.430> of<00:03:45.550> sections<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.209> remove<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.599> bit

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
the banks of sections and remove a bit

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.600 
the banks of sections and remove a bit
of<00:03:46.840> weight<00:03:46.989> from<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.349> ends<00:03:47.739> they'll<00:03:48.250> grow<00:03:48.430> out

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
of weight from the ends they'll grow out

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.120 
of weight from the ends they'll grow out
really<00:03:48.850> nicely
