00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
inserted in the galactosidase gene then

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.850 
inserted in the galactosidase gene then
that<00:02:42.120> gene<00:02:42.480> becomes<00:02:42.740> insertional<00:02:43.740> ii

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
that gene becomes insertional ii

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.000 
that gene becomes insertional ii
inactive<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.910> if<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.540> gene<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.080> inactive<00:02:46.740> it

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
inactive and if that gene is inactive it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.570 
inactive and if that gene is inactive it
will<00:02:47.430> not<00:02:47.700> convert<00:02:48.500> galactose<00:02:49.500> into<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.040> blue

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
will not convert galactose into a blue

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.060 
will not convert galactose into a blue
colored<00:02:51.000> compound<00:02:51.570> so<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.320> this<00:02:52.470> case<00:02:52.740> the

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
formation of the vascular cambium right

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.020 
formation of the vascular cambium right
so<00:05:36.750> it<00:05:36.900> means<00:05:37.200> the<00:05:37.530> interface<00:05:37.890> ocular<00:05:38.460> came<00:05:38.700> BM

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
so it means the interface ocular came BM

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.630 
so it means the interface ocular came BM
it<00:05:39.150> is<00:05:39.270> formed<00:05:39.720> from<00:05:39.990> the<00:05:40.230> pen<00:05:40.590> kanata<00:05:41.160> cells

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
it is formed from the pen kanata cells

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.240 
it is formed from the pen kanata cells
which<00:05:42.000> are<00:05:42.120> associated<00:05:42.450> with<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.320> medullary

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
which are associated with the medullary

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.150 
which are associated with the medullary
race<00:05:44.580> means<00:05:45.450> for<00:05:45.810> this<00:05:46.170> question<00:05:46.890> right

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
race means for this question right

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.190 
race means for this question right
option<00:05:48.000> is<00:05:48.180> fool<00:05:50.120> so<00:05:51.120> now<00:05:51.240> let's<00:05:51.510> proceed<00:05:51.810> to

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
option is fool so now let's proceed to

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.760 
option is fool so now let's proceed to
the<00:05:52.290> question<00:05:52.710> number<00:05:52.890> 121
