this<00:00:32.500> yet<00:00:32.770> so<00:00:32.800> I'm<00:00:33.309> going<00:00:33.520> to<00:00:33.579> do<00:00:33.670> the<00:00:33.790> unboxing

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
this yet so I'm going to do the unboxing

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.540 
this yet so I'm going to do the unboxing
and<00:00:34.510> then<00:00:34.690> do<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:35.079> build<00:00:35.290> probably<00:00:36.160> be<00:00:36.280> spread

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
and then do the build probably be spread

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.860 
and then do the build probably be spread
over<00:00:36.670> one<00:00:36.969> or<00:00:37.000> two<00:00:37.270> probably<00:00:38.050> be<00:00:38.170> over<00:00:38.379> two

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
over one or two probably be over two

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.869 
over one or two probably be over two

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
videos here for the for the building and

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.130 
videos here for the for the building and
then<00:00:43.000> we'll<00:00:43.180> do<00:00:43.300> a<00:00:43.329> flight<00:00:43.510> review<00:00:43.960> on<00:00:44.109> it

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
then we'll do a flight review on it

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.479 
then we'll do a flight review on it
hopefully<00:00:44.409> if<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.800> weather<00:00:45.010> holds<00:00:45.100> out

shall we see what we got inside the
first<00:01:03.729> thing<00:01:03.909> I<00:01:04.030> notice<00:01:04.269> when<00:01:04.420> I<00:01:04.510> open<00:01:04.780> this<00:01:04.900> up

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
first thing I notice when I open this up

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.140 
first thing I notice when I open this up
is<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.860> transmitter<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:09.490> they<00:01:09.640> changed

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
is the transmitter that they changed

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.730 
is the transmitter that they changed
airfield<00:01:10.840> was<00:01:10.960> changed<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.470> style

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
airfield was changed to the style

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.110 
airfield was changed to the style
transmitter<00:01:12.340> this<00:01:12.460> looked<00:01:12.729> more<00:01:12.880> like<00:01:12.940> a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
transmitter this looked more like a

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.470 
transmitter this looked more like a
dynamic<00:01:13.420> transmitter<00:01:14.350> now<00:01:14.560> then<00:01:15.480> they're

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
dynamic transmitter now then they're

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.960 
dynamic transmitter now then they're
older<00:01:17.350> style<00:01:17.650> transmitter<00:01:18.610> that<00:01:18.700> says<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
older style transmitter that says the

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.170 
older style transmitter that says the
2.4<00:01:22.510> gigahertz<00:01:22.980> antenna<00:01:23.980> that<00:01:24.520> now<00:01:24.820> can<00:01:25.060> be

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
2.4 gigahertz antenna that now can be

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.030 
2.4 gigahertz antenna that now can be
moved<00:01:25.420> instead<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.230> the<00:01:26.320> little<00:01:26.560> short<00:01:26.770> stubby

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
moved instead of the little short stubby

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.070 
moved instead of the little short stubby
one<00:01:27.370> that<00:01:27.520> they<00:01:27.640> used<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:27.940> have<00:01:28.000> yeah<00:01:28.600> I'll<00:01:28.720> get

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
one that they used to have yeah I'll get

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.450 
one that they used to have yeah I'll get
this<00:01:29.230> up<00:01:29.410> a<00:01:29.470> little<00:01:29.590> bit<00:01:29.800> closer<00:01:30.040> so<00:01:30.280> you<00:01:30.340> can

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
this up a little bit closer so you can

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.480 
this up a little bit closer so you can
see<00:01:30.550> it

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
see it

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.240 
see it
so<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.940> still<00:01:34.270> has<00:01:34.300> all<00:01:34.750> your<00:01:34.960> reverse<00:01:35.470> aniline

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
so it still has all your reverse aniline

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.500 
so it still has all your reverse aniline
elevator<00:01:37.800> throttle<00:01:38.800> and<00:01:39.220> rudder<00:01:39.820> reverse<00:01:40.300> on

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
elevator throttle and rudder reverse on

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.270 
elevator throttle and rudder reverse on
it<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:40.810> it's<00:01:40.930> got<00:01:41.050> a<00:01:41.080> mode<00:01:41.230> 1<00:01:41.470> mode<00:01:41.500> 2<00:01:41.740> switch

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
it and it's got a mode 1 mode 2 switch

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.170 
it and it's got a mode 1 mode 2 switch
which<00:01:42.490> is<00:01:42.520> kind<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:42.910> nice<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.890> anyway<00:01:45.550> so<00:01:45.610> it

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
which is kind of nice so anyway so it

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.540 
which is kind of nice so anyway so it
looks<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.420> little<00:01:46.540> bit<00:01:46.720> beefier<00:01:47.220> feels<00:01:48.220> like<00:01:48.460> it

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
looks a little bit beefier feels like it

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.520 
looks a little bit beefier feels like it
might<00:01:48.580> be<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:48.850> little<00:01:49.090> bit<00:01:49.210> beefier<00:01:49.480> too<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.080> I

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
might be a little bit beefier too so I

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.590 
might be a little bit beefier too so I
actually<00:01:51.130> have<00:01:51.550> had<00:01:51.730> no<00:01:51.940> problems<00:01:52.360> whatsoever

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
actually have had no problems whatsoever

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.780 
actually have had no problems whatsoever
with<00:01:53.230> the<00:01:53.470> transmitters<00:01:54.070> that<00:01:54.100> came<00:01:54.370> with<00:01:54.610> any

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
with the transmitters that came with any

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.050 
with the transmitters that came with any
of<00:01:54.940> these<00:01:55.030> airfield<00:01:55.540> airplanes<00:01:55.990> so<00:01:56.530> oh<00:01:57.010> hey<00:01:57.790> I

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.840 
of these airfield airplanes so oh hey I
just<00:01:58.150> noticed<00:01:58.540> that<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.950> is<00:02:00.220> interesting

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.450 
just noticed that that is interesting
looks<00:02:01.480> like<00:02:01.660> it<00:02:01.870> has<00:02:02.080> digital<00:02:02.410> trim<00:02:02.890> on<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.130> or

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
looks like it has digital trim on it or

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.090 
looks like it has digital trim on it or
there's<00:02:03.670> an<00:02:03.760> analog<00:02:04.150> trim<00:02:04.510> so<00:02:04.830> can't<00:02:05.830> wait<00:02:05.980> to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
there's an analog trim so can't wait to

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.590 
there's an analog trim so can't wait to
get<00:02:06.190> this<00:02:06.310> hooked<00:02:06.550> up<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:06.850> actually<00:02:06.970> try<00:02:07.360> that

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
get this hooked up and actually try that

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.309 
get this hooked up and actually try that
out

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.319 

and<00:02:12.739> stuff<00:02:12.980> take<00:02:13.579> a<00:02:13.610> quick<00:02:13.909> look<00:02:14.090> at<00:02:14.239> the

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
and stuff take a quick look at the

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:23.259 
and stuff take a quick look at the
instructions<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.920> looks<00:02:22.099> like<00:02:22.310> typical

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
instructions it looks like typical

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.520 
instructions it looks like typical
airfield<00:02:23.689> instructions<00:02:24.489> just<00:02:25.489> very<00:02:26.530> just

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
airfield instructions just very just

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.089 
airfield instructions just very just
some<00:02:27.769> some<00:02:28.219> pictures<00:02:28.609> and<00:02:29.409> very<00:02:30.409> small<00:02:30.680> blurbs

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
some some pictures and very small blurbs

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.110 
some some pictures and very small blurbs
of<00:02:31.430> what<00:02:31.609> to<00:02:31.730> do

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
of what to do

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.929 
of what to do
listing<00:02:32.780> of<00:02:32.870> all<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.170> parts<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:34.609> doesn't

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
listing of all the parts so it doesn't

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.099 
listing of all the parts so it doesn't
look<00:02:35.090> like<00:02:35.269> it's<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.480> hard<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.870> put<00:02:35.930> together

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
look like it's that hard to put together

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.580 
look like it's that hard to put together
but<00:02:36.980> we'll<00:02:37.700> go<00:02:38.120> through<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.510> step<00:02:38.780> by<00:02:38.840> step<00:02:38.989> I

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
but we'll go through that step by step I

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.319 
but we'll go through that step by step I
might<00:02:40.129> make<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.519> little<00:02:40.639> bit<00:02:40.849> easier<00:02:41.150> for

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
might make it a little bit easier for

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.490 
might make it a little bit easier for
somebody<00:02:41.510> else<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.900> buys<00:02:42.109> it<00:02:43.959> so<00:02:44.959> here<00:02:45.230> we<00:02:45.349> have

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
somebody else to buys it so here we have

00:02:45.500 --> 00:03:01.479 
somebody else to buys it so here we have
a<00:02:54.430> nice<00:02:55.430> three-blade<00:02:56.030> propeller<00:03:00.489> feels

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
a nice three-blade propeller feels

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.960 
a nice three-blade propeller feels
fairly<00:03:01.849> this<00:03:02.569> is<00:03:02.689> eleven<00:03:03.290> by<00:03:03.560> nine<00:03:03.970> three

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
fairly this is eleven by nine three

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.979 
fairly this is eleven by nine three
blade<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:06.519> spinner<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.879> then<00:03:08.540> it's<00:03:08.659> a<00:03:08.720> full

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
blade and spinner and then it's a full

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.789 
blade and spinner and then it's a full
personal<00:03:09.980> fashion<00:03:10.250> they<00:03:10.609> throw<00:03:10.939> in<00:03:11.090> the

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
personal fashion they throw in the

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.110 
personal fashion they throw in the
screwdriver<00:03:12.799> forty<00:03:13.220> which<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.489> very<00:03:13.700> nice

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
screwdriver forty which is very nice

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.869 
screwdriver forty which is very nice
also<00:03:14.419> I<00:03:14.450> see<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.870> nail<00:03:15.530> enlarge<00:03:15.889> here<00:03:16.159> so

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.180 

let's<00:03:19.879> go<00:03:20.030> ahead<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.329> take<00:03:20.540> out<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:21.159> fuselage

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
let's go ahead and take out the fuselage

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:30.599 
let's go ahead and take out the fuselage
there's<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.299> wheels

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.860 

that's<00:03:31.609> one<00:03:31.760> thing<00:03:31.909> I<00:03:32.030> do<00:03:32.090> like<00:03:32.449> about<00:03:32.510> the

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
that's one thing I do like about the

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.719 
that's one thing I do like about the
earthy<00:03:33.169> old<00:03:33.290> stuff<00:03:33.590> was<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.919> packing<00:03:34.310> they<00:03:34.579> do

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:34.729 
earthy old stuff was the packing they do

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.960 
earthy old stuff was the packing they do
good<00:03:34.940> job<00:03:35.150> of<00:03:35.269> packing<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.720> stuff<00:03:36.019> so<00:03:36.970> it's

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
good job of packing the stuff so it's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.879 
good job of packing the stuff so it's
really<00:03:38.479> hard<00:03:42.370> okay<00:03:43.659> so<00:03:44.659> there<00:03:44.930> this<00:03:45.739> is

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
really hard okay so there this is

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:46.680 
really hard okay so there this is
fuselage

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
fuselage

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.789 
fuselage
like<00:03:47.690> I<00:03:47.810> said<00:03:47.989> this<00:03:48.079> is<00:03:48.229> the<00:03:48.349> upgraded<00:03:48.680> version

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
like I said this is the upgraded version

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.520 
like I said this is the upgraded version
so<00:03:49.280> this<00:03:49.430> has<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:49.760> clear<00:03:50.000> canopy<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:50.750> windows

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
so this has the clear canopy and windows

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.800 
so this has the clear canopy and windows
and<00:03:51.859> it<00:03:52.310> even<00:03:52.549> has<00:03:52.699> a<00:03:52.729> pilot<00:03:53.209> on<00:03:53.359> the<00:03:53.479> inside<00:03:53.780> I

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
and it even has a pilot on the inside I

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.409 
and it even has a pilot on the inside I
don't<00:03:53.959> know<00:03:54.079> if<00:03:54.169> you<00:03:54.229> can<00:03:54.379> see<00:03:54.560> him<00:03:54.739> in<00:03:54.889> there

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
don't know if you can see him in there

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.670 
don't know if you can see him in there
so<00:03:56.419> this<00:03:56.540> is<00:03:56.599> quite<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.989> bit<00:03:57.169> different<00:03:57.199> than

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
so this is quite a bit different than

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.530 
so this is quite a bit different than
the<00:03:57.769> first<00:03:57.919> version<00:03:58.099> that<00:03:58.549> I<00:03:58.579> had<00:03:58.909> the<00:03:59.329> first

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
the first version that I had the first

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.240 
the first version that I had the first
version<00:03:59.900> the<00:03:59.930> cowl<00:04:00.199> was<00:04:00.530> actually<00:04:00.919> made<00:04:01.099> out

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
version the cowl was actually made out

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.189 
version the cowl was actually made out
of<00:04:01.280> plastic<00:04:01.879> and<00:04:02.239> this<00:04:02.780> time<00:04:02.959> is<00:04:03.079> actually

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:03.199 
of plastic and this time is actually

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.699 
of plastic and this time is actually
made<00:04:03.650> out<00:04:03.799> of<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:03.979> EP<00:04:04.280> on<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.549> phone<00:04:05.709> looks

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
made out of the EP on the phone looks

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.140 
made out of the EP on the phone looks
like<00:04:06.919> pretty<00:04:07.129> nice<00:04:07.340> motor<00:04:07.639> there<00:04:07.879> it<00:04:08.000> looks

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
like pretty nice motor there it looks

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.499 
like pretty nice motor there it looks
like<00:04:08.329> it's<00:04:08.479> the<00:04:08.629> same<00:04:08.840> size<00:04:09.229> see<00:04:09.829> it's<00:04:10.509> since

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:11.509 
like it's the same size see it's since

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:17.770 
like it's the same size see it's since
it's<00:04:11.629> a<00:04:11.720> 900<00:04:12.229> kilvo<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:15.379> markings<00:04:16.209> I<00:04:17.209> don't

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
it's a 900 kilvo the markings I don't

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.819 
it's a 900 kilvo the markings I don't
know<00:04:17.870> how<00:04:17.989> many<00:04:18.079> of<00:04:18.259> you<00:04:18.320> know<00:04:18.500> this<00:04:18.680> or<00:04:18.799> not

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
know how many of you know this or not

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.810 
know how many of you know this or not
but<00:04:20.139> the<00:04:21.139> markings<00:04:21.469> on<00:04:21.859> American<00:04:22.550> planes

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
but the markings on American planes

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.120 
but the markings on American planes
always<00:04:23.210> start<00:04:23.450> with

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
always start with

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.940 
always start with
November<00:04:24.670> I'm<00:04:25.540> not<00:04:25.750> sure<00:04:25.930> what<00:04:26.140> G<00:04:26.320> is<00:04:26.350> but<00:04:26.830> it's

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
November I'm not sure what G is but it's

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.160 
November I'm not sure what G is but it's
obviously<00:04:27.520> not<00:04:27.790> in<00:04:27.940> American<00:04:28.330> marking<00:04:28.720> what<00:04:29.140> I

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
obviously not in American marking what I

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.320 
obviously not in American marking what I
might<00:04:29.380> do<00:04:29.590> is<00:04:29.650> I<00:04:29.800> might<00:04:29.860> swap<00:04:30.730> these<00:04:30.940> stickers

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
might do is I might swap these stickers

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.690 
might do is I might swap these stickers
out<00:04:31.660> for<00:04:32.050> something<00:04:32.410> different<00:04:33.100> when<00:04:33.430> I<00:04:33.460> get<00:04:33.670> a

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
out for something different when I get a

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.890 
out for something different when I get a
chance<00:04:33.970> you<00:04:34.150> know<00:04:34.270> go<00:04:34.420> down<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.780> local

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
chance you know go down to the local

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.470 
chance you know go down to the local
hobby<00:04:35.200> shop<00:04:35.350> or<00:04:35.770> order<00:04:36.040> some<00:04:36.190> online<00:04:36.370> or<00:04:37.150> I

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
hobby shop or order some online or I

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.660 
hobby shop or order some online or I
might<00:04:37.870> even<00:04:38.020> print<00:04:38.380> them<00:04:38.560> off<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.980> have<00:04:39.250> access

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
might even print them off I have access

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.550 
might even print them off I have access
to<00:04:39.880> a<00:04:39.910> printer<00:04:40.510> that<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:40.870> could<00:04:41.080> probably<00:04:41.260> print

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
to a printer that I could probably print

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.160 
to a printer that I could probably print
some<00:04:41.710> more<00:04:41.860> fine<00:04:42.070> so<00:04:42.670> I'll<00:04:43.540> probably<00:04:43.690> do<00:04:43.990> that

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
some more fine so I'll probably do that

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.770 
some more fine so I'll probably do that
just<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.620> make<00:04:44.740> it<00:04:44.800> look<00:04:45.160> more<00:04:46.090> American<00:04:46.360> not

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
just to make it look more American not

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.560 
just to make it look more American not
anything<00:04:47.050> against<00:04:47.970> anybody<00:04:48.970> else<00:04:49.180> from<00:04:49.450> any

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
anything against anybody else from any

00:04:49.570 --> 00:05:10.910 
anything against anybody else from any
other<00:04:49.750> company<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.410> country<00:04:50.770> excuse<00:04:51.100> me<00:04:51.250> but

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.070 

so<00:05:11.920> this<00:05:12.130> version<00:05:12.340> does<00:05:12.850> not<00:05:13.090> have<00:05:14.910> flat

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
so this version does not have flat

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.540 
so this version does not have flat
that's<00:05:17.080> quite<00:05:17.260> a<00:05:17.320> pay<00:05:17.560> I<00:05:17.710> never<00:05:18.100> needed<00:05:18.340> the

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
that's quite a pay I never needed the

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.630 
that's quite a pay I never needed the
flaps<00:05:18.820> on<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:19.090> other<00:05:19.300> version<00:05:19.750> neither<00:05:19.990> so

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
flaps on the other version neither so

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.580 
flaps on the other version neither so
it's<00:05:21.640> not<00:05:21.760> a<00:05:21.820> big<00:05:22.030> deal<00:05:22.210> it<00:05:22.630> does<00:05:22.870> have<00:05:23.230> it<00:05:23.350> set

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
it's not a big deal it does have it set

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.960 
it's not a big deal it does have it set
up<00:05:23.620> for<00:05:23.770> flaps<00:05:24.190> looks<00:05:24.520> like<00:05:24.730> they're<00:05:24.880> already

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
up for flaps looks like they're already

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.730 
up for flaps looks like they're already
pre<00:05:25.270> hinged<00:05:25.660> probably<00:05:26.020> just<00:05:26.170> have<00:05:26.320> to<00:05:26.440> cut<00:05:26.620> it

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
pre hinged probably just have to cut it

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.460 
pre hinged probably just have to cut it
rate<00:05:26.920> right<00:05:27.880> here<00:05:27.910> and<00:05:28.540> then<00:05:29.530> put<00:05:31.050> on<00:05:32.050> a<00:05:32.080> servo

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
rate right here and then put on a servo

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.590 
rate right here and then put on a servo
win<00:05:32.680> I<00:05:32.890> like<00:05:33.220> how<00:05:33.340> they<00:05:33.520> got<00:05:33.550> that<00:05:33.820> covered<00:05:34.390> up

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
win I like how they got that covered up

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.660 
win I like how they got that covered up
with<00:05:34.720> tape<00:05:34.930> so<00:05:35.290> the<00:05:35.500> hides<00:05:35.830> all<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.310> wires<00:05:36.490> and

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
with tape so the hides all the wires and

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.850 
with tape so the hides all the wires and
stuff<00:05:37.000> there's<00:05:37.240> a<00:05:37.300> servo<00:05:37.720> for<00:05:37.960> for<00:05:38.770> the

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
stuff there's a servo for for the

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.180 
stuff there's a servo for for the
aileron<00:05:40.350> it<00:05:41.350> looks<00:05:41.500> like<00:05:41.680> there<00:05:41.830> is<00:05:41.920> a<00:05:41.950> little

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
aileron it looks like there is a little

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.710 
aileron it looks like there is a little
bit<00:05:42.430> of<00:05:42.520> shipping<00:05:42.790> advantage<00:05:43.210> there<00:05:43.450> it<00:05:43.540> looks

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
bit of shipping advantage there it looks

00:05:43.720 --> 00:06:03.540 
bit of shipping advantage there it looks
like<00:05:43.870> the<00:05:43.990> way<00:05:44.140> it<00:05:44.230> was<00:05:44.350> packed<00:06:02.100> the<00:06:03.100> vertical

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
like the way it was packed the vertical

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.880 
like the way it was packed the vertical
stabilizer<00:06:03.790> I<00:06:04.270> should<00:06:04.540> say<00:06:06.150> and<00:06:07.710> that's<00:06:08.710> all

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
stabilizer I should say and that's all

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.990 
stabilizer I should say and that's all
painted<00:06:09.280> by<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:09.550> looks

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000

that's<00:06:10.750> not<00:06:10.930> detailed<00:06:11.410> this<00:06:11.680> is<00:06:11.830> almost<00:06:12.100> right

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
that's not detailed this is almost right

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.220 
that's not detailed this is almost right

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.820 

Hwang's<00:06:27.130> far<00:06:27.570> this<00:06:28.570> looks<00:06:28.900> like<00:06:29.110> it's<00:06:29.290> either

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
Hwang's far this looks like it's either

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.570 
Hwang's far this looks like it's either
a<00:06:29.950> really<00:06:30.160> heavy-duty<00:06:30.490> plastic<00:06:30.820> or<00:06:32.580> maybe

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
a really heavy-duty plastic or maybe

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:47.340 
a really heavy-duty plastic or maybe
carbon<00:06:33.940> fiber<00:06:42.600> there's<00:06:43.600> the<00:06:43.780> other<00:06:43.900> wing<00:06:46.350> one

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
carbon fiber there's the other wing one

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.020 
carbon fiber there's the other wing one
thing<00:06:47.530> I<00:06:47.650> did<00:06:47.800> want<00:06:47.830> to<00:06:48.010> point<00:06:48.160> out<00:06:48.340> on<00:06:48.550> this

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030 
thing I did want to point out on this

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.480 
thing I did want to point out on this
plane<00:06:49.270> that<00:06:49.960> I<00:06:50.050> really<00:06:50.320> like<00:06:50.500> is<00:06:51.160> the<00:06:51.460> fact

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
plane that I really like is the fact

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.240 
plane that I really like is the fact
that<00:06:51.790> you<00:06:52.000> have<00:06:52.180> landing<00:06:53.110> lights<00:06:53.290> anyway<00:06:53.710> also

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
that you have landing lights anyway also

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.100 
that you have landing lights anyway also
wingtip<00:06:54.820> lights<00:06:55.090> know<00:06:55.600> if<00:06:55.660> there's<00:06:55.900> tail

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110 
wingtip lights know if there's tail

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.720 
wingtip lights know if there's tail
light<00:06:56.320> yes<00:06:56.830> there<00:06:57.100> is<00:06:58.980> right<00:06:59.980> there<00:07:00.010> and

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:00.730 
light yes there is right there and

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.210 
light yes there is right there and
there's<00:07:01.450> the<00:07:01.600> wire<00:07:01.780> for<00:07:02.050> it<00:07:02.200> oh<00:07:02.260> very<00:07:02.680> nice<00:07:02.950> I

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220 
there's the wire for it oh very nice I

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.170 
there's the wire for it oh very nice I
can't<00:07:03.400> wait<00:07:03.520> to<00:07:03.640> get<00:07:03.730> through<00:07:03.910> this<00:07:03.970> together

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180 
can't wait to get through this together

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.600 
can't wait to get through this together
and<00:07:04.540> see<00:07:04.630> what<00:07:04.750> it<00:07:04.870> looks<00:07:05.050> like<00:07:05.610> really

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
and see what it looks like really

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.250 
and see what it looks like really
looking<00:07:06.880> forward<00:07:07.180> to<00:07:07.270> this<00:07:07.360> plane<00:07:07.660> and<00:07:08.140> then

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260 
looking forward to this plane and then

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.610 
looking forward to this plane and then
of<00:07:08.380> course<00:07:08.410> we've<00:07:08.740> got<00:07:08.800> the<00:07:10.230> 2200<00:07:11.230> milliamp

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:11.620 
of course we've got the 2200 milliamp

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.960 
of course we've got the 2200 milliamp
battery<00:07:11.920> pack<00:07:12.760> this<00:07:12.970> is<00:07:13.150> a<00:07:13.680> 25<00:07:14.680> C<00:07:15.100> eleven

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:23.170 
maybe the one thing that I am going to

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.570 
maybe the one thing that I am going to
do<00:07:23.290> before<00:07:23.590> flying<00:07:23.860> this<00:07:24.040> is<00:07:24.100> I'm<00:07:24.370> going<00:07:24.520> to

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:24.580 
do before flying this is I'm going to
