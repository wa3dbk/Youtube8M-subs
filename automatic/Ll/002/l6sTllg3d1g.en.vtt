00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.840 
it stays as many years to come I think
it<00:01:58.590> wasn't<00:01:58.859> for<00:01:58.979> probably<00:01:59.219> support<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.789> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
it wasn't for probably support and the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.999 
it wasn't for probably support and the
group<00:02:00.060> has<00:02:00.209> been<00:02:00.240> organized<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.439> don't

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
group has been organized here I don't

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.410 
group has been organized here I don't
think<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.280> was<00:02:02.429> that<00:02:02.609> would've<00:02:03.030> happened<00:02:03.359> as

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
think this was that would've happened as

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.139 
think this was that would've happened as
quickly<00:02:03.659> as<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.990> has<00:02:04.189> in<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.219> guys<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.789> a<00:02:05.819> lot

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
quickly as it has in the guys like a lot

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.520 
quickly as it has in the guys like a lot
it<00:02:06.359> would<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.539> been<00:02:06.630> mothballed<00:02:06.840> just

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
it would have been mothballed just

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.440 
it would have been mothballed just
gathering<00:02:07.890> dust<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.549> think<00:02:08.940> what<00:02:09.090> they've<00:02:09.239> done

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
gathering dust I think what they've done

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.900 
gathering dust I think what they've done
is<00:02:09.869> absolutely<00:02:10.470> fantastic<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:11.250> anything

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
is absolutely fantastic and anything

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.240 
is absolutely fantastic and anything
that<00:02:11.940> we<00:02:12.180> can<00:02:12.450> do<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:13.739> help<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.099> new

keeping a child brewery going it's

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.830 
keeping a child brewery going it's
