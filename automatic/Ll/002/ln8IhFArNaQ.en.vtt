00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.849

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.629
 more than 2 million families chose to take the reins of the 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.170
 education of children in every way 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.960
 because they disagree with the official curriculum of other schools on 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.770
 in fear of the bad influence they may have on the environment. 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.000
 school and some still to bet that studying at home 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.850
 the performance of the children will be much better

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.400
 education of children 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.900
 during several hours of the day, the teacher takes turns in classes that 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.310
