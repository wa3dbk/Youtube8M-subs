00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.760
 in there so I have the weekend 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.720

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.849

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.220
 I think in private all too 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:58.180
 maybe a bit out there on the road 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.560
 and there will be lots of information to take away 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.860
 I think and I would say then 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.890
 Let's start with direct x 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:34.260
 square number two 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:34.260
 [Music] 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:41.219
 Of course , my pictures are still all 

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:43.789
 therefore my cell phone is broken where 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.789
 come in my calendar 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:58.520
 ok, luckily i have my cellphone 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:05:00.419
 synchronizes perfect square number one 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.659
 where do you stay I was already the whole 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.659
 Time 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.100
 [Applause] 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.650
 sda 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.930
 no my cellphone has broken 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.990
 and now I have my pictures everything 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.480
 lugging is still difficult 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.660
 I 've got it much easier yes 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.950
 like with a cloud, for example 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.690
 you can put your pictures and has 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.810
 she always has to go with it and I and her 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.700
 such a backpack with drag me around 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.200
 for example i have my cloud the 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.570
 take part and therefore always mine 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.100
 pictures and why not that 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.100
 previously no idea 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.450
 that was our top 5 you can us 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.320
 times in the comments write yours 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.610
 favorite apps 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.890
 I hope you enjoy the video 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.330
 If so, we are pleased 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.000
 of course, about a thumb after us 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.450
 above and over your abo and then until 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.090
 next time 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:08.340
 and you should still have a cell phone that 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:11.400
 Do not do it there if you can 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.720
 sausage script on a tray 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.210
 my mobile phone on a laptop 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.680
 I have them more cloud some of them 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.910
 I always have it, that means I have to 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.740
 Do not take it with you now 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.270
 the cloud simply saves it everywhere 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.650
 and syncs automatically 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.650
 I do not pay anything
