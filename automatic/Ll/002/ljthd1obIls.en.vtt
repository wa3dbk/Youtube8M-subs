 I will try to show them quickly 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.150
 all one by one to make a review 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.630
 tour of our products so forging 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.830
 Glinka multilayer central plate 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.630
 made of steel 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.410
 hvg lined from damask this will be on 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.980
 all knives 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.350
 That's the kind of forging here I want you 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.270
 show stabilized tree i will begin 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.270
 first boxster also nickel silver 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.590
 the tree is stabilized 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.670
 stabilized cup using 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.989
 green dye 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.640
 and modern stabilization technologies 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.699
 tree as a result it does not crack 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.229
 good clean not absorbed anything you 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.750
 but just see how much 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.820
 modern technology is turning a piece 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.500
 wood here in this effect and my 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.780
 the material is so seemingly it almost 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.180
 synthetic when let u macr 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.450
 snails are not cards but in fact it 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.450
 tree see our whole 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.770
 small metal knife small 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.770
 size the wedge here here about 110 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:36.400
 millimeters 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:39.650
 also multilayered forging lining and 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.180
 stabilized wood here too 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.180
 Here with the use of green dye 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.840
 3 knives 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.360
 also multilayer forging is very popular 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.140
 now multilayer forging becomes 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.800
 more melchior oh here and again 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.880
 this stabilized wood 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.460
 what using different 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:15.000
 dyes it is soaked in different ways 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:19.080
 and it turns out that it looks like this 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.080
 see our whole 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.830
 all-metal knife again 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.269
 here the handle is also stabilized 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:33.239
 wood using brown here 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.140
 dye it like some business now 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.140
 difficult to determine 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.340
 despite the fact that the handle is such as 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.470
 would be a small and comfortable to hold him 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.420
 the fingers do not fall on the blade like this 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.770
 cute little more comfortable cinema I 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.830
 I love small knives 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:07.400
 they can do anything in 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.400
 difference from big ones for example so 5 knife 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.780
 copper bolster 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.650
 I again and here is a stabilized tree 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.530
 colors of stabilized wood all 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.530
 different because different 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.980
 dye here is stabilization technology y 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.140
 all the same and the colors are different here 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.090
 here's a pen made a little by 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.750
 especially here it is thinning and for 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.570
 little finger 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.140
 very good here the little finger lies in 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.770
 what is the little finger 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.040
 as a rule, always a smaller volume 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.300
 the grip is extra then the finger is shorter and here 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.290
 so here is a recess 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.380
 in order to 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.380
 little finger was comfortable to cover the sleeve 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:01.020
 the next knife is also multilayer forging 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.939
 copper bolster 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.750
 handle done too 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.090
 stabilized wood here are all knives 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.209
 with stabilized wood not 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.639
 dye he's some kind of here 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.360
 brown or bare burgundy 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.530
 brown 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.530
 you will not understand what color 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.620
 such 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.620
 knife 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.700
 The next knife is also multi-layered. 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:50.440
 crust means bolster copper and wood 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:54.240
 here's a green tone like that here is green 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:57.010
 light up applied green dye 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.110
 stabilization stabilized wood 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:05.880
 like me hilt in this video 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.880
 here but applied the green dye and 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.720
 the last knife in this video which 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:24.390
 we look also mean court 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.390
 multilayer forging bolster tinsel 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.390
 cast 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:36.250
 hilt and stabilized wood 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:44.629
 here it is such a bright color 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:47.620
 such beige let's say light look 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:47.620
 knife in general 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:01.009
 here's a well made as it uporchik 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:05.870
 Yes, he also allows you to securely fix 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:10.610
 knife in hand and well take it out or something 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:17.389
