00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello dear friends today I 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 would like to talk to you about recently 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.860
 released update android to version 5 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.780
 1 for the 2013 nexus 7 tablet so 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.170
 let's start and start directly with 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.539
 the change this assembly brought 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.160
 changes as claimed by the developers 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.750
 About 14 thousand points on how are you 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.760
 understand us they will not be visible 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.849
 most of them will only be visible 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.039
 some so let's start the first thing 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.990
 I personally rushed my eyes this is what 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.270
 the speed of work has become faster 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.250
 faster to work in the interface faster 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.190
 open applications and the interface itself 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.930
 naturally became smoother 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.680
 Also, the changes affected the curtain 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.170
 Notifications now show how 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.030
 also there is a tuned wolf I changed 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.820
 that is, you can configure Wi-Fi right 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.699
 from the curtain without going into the basic settings 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.309
 devices the same situation with bluetooth 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.020
 that is, you can customize it immediately from 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.500
 the curtains without going into the basic settings 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.019
 it is very useful and changes also by 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.110
 The animation of some modes has not changed. 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.439
 that is, let's say the flight mode has changed 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.799
 animation and that's such a cool animation 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.450
 Auto screen rotation in principle according to 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.780
 the curtains are all changes made 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.360
 and icon changes in the settings now 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.900
 I'll show you what the icons have changed 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.600
 Not everything has changed the icon sounds 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.820
 notice a little bit different 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.360
 changed application icon in 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.159
 applications also notice that 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.079
 changed the icons android relatives 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.000
 applications now they look like this 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.649
 have not seen a little bit differently before 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.659
 but I was even more like it also 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:55.770
 exchanged with shared regulator 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:58.740
 loudness that's how it looks like it has become 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.180
 more comfortable more interesting too 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.210
 you can bring to the pluses well now I can 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.619
 basically say your personal 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.840
 impressions on dales on this assembly 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.730
 I personally she mission 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.090
 on pleased in such a plan I was expecting 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.220
 much more from this build in 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.870
 first as we were promised a gain 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.670
 performance I never saw 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.230
 I can show it on the example of antutu 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.050
 promised to increase performance 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.010
 in antutu but I'm after the update 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.379
 tested this program and he issued 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.360
 even smaller result a little bit than that 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.000
 there is no increase in antutu 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.489
 and performance gains in games i 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.690
 also did not notice that there are those games that 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.730
 they braked and brake so 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.910
 there is no performance gain 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.640
 here and it's certainly very sad too 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.260
 did not correct the situation with operational 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.440
 memory and now it will turn out more 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.500
 I will try to show you that is 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.360
 RAM as he is not normal 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.760
 I used it and I use it 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.829
 I now have a free 582 megabytes 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.269
 memory that is driving system almost 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:12.150
 gigabyte 851 megabytes of track that is with 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:17.340
 RAM did not understand it 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:20.400
 You can also add to the minuses also people 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.910
 I was told recently that it has become smaller 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.250
 keep battery power well guys i'm with you 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.950
 I do not agree because I tested 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.530
 it and the batteries it keeps just the same 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.540
 as on the previous version android 502 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.130
 that is, you just think it seems 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:42.209
 because you expected to see probably 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:45.120
 what will be the increase in battery life but 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.709
 it did not happen to you it seems that she 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.349
 became even smaller but now if I show 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.980
 that is, I have such indicators 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.079
 have turned out 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:01.220
 it at 50 percent brightness at in 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:05.130
 wai-fae use web surfing games 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.090
 viewing yu tuba and so on that is and 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:12.269
 so that's how we work 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.510
 the screen that is 4:11 the same result 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.950
 I was on the android top for 2 that is 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.390
 no changes 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.700
 in the battery I did not see and so on 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.900
 I can tell what conclusions on this 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.500
 assembly well of course there are pluses and 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.600
 minuses 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.730
 by the way about when i saw it though 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.790
 little i forgot to mark it this then 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.220
 that when the device is blocking 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.110
 first fade out the picture lights up 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.570
 black tap and then only the screen goes dead 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.940
 I don't know if I have one, but I 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.920
 it would notice it is not very pleasant and not 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.990
 always the usual 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.240
 Shuts down normally in sleep mode 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.970
 leaves and sometimes it happens 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.360
 but I can tell you the conclusions 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.780
 in the next thing guys we should wait 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.850
 android 5 1 1 in which in theory should 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:08.400
 fix all the shortcomings with the operational 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:11.220
 memory and speed bugs 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.800
 work is not exactly the speed of work 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.130
 the performance boost is also this 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.870
 everyone needs to fix everything everybody thanks for 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.920
 viewing if you liked this video 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.990
 put your thumb up 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.300
 subscribe to the channel I will 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.130
 very glad 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.320
