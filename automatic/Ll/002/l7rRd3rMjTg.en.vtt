00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.549
 hello I quote with Marc who gave a 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.070
 very playful workshop today 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.470
 how to recycle tetra pak and make 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.760
 with stools what you can we 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.890
 explain a little bit about how you're 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.300
 came this idea 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.740
 it came in 2011 after the event that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.810
 was created by robbie's men 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.150
 bonds and younger ones who was called 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.970
 happy visitors free on was all a 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.060
 group worked on recycling the 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.100
 waste management and the question was 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.540
 how to recycle tetra pak so he 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.380
 there were several experiences of fact 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:50.160
 marie-claire other people and and 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.580
 then I was at guy haorau armed I 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.350
 played with two breaks of tetra pak and 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:01:00.210
 miracle of bricks 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.879
 the child one and it becomes a brick 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.739
 full of air finally you who did the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.850
 workshop you understand but the radio 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.950
 it's hard to show 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.240
 so ok so two full bricks 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.920
 of air that makes it a hedge so then 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.270
 how do you make a stool what you 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.380
 can summarize a little bit for people 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.350
 precisely who did not follow the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.100
 workshop come to the workshop the next 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.800
 workshop no but so how about a 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.040
 stool that is 50 cm high 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:32.480
 needs 64 bricks to make a 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.950
 Stable stool but the real the real one 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.270
 idea is really to use the air 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.100
 to trap the air in one inside 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.020
 two bricks of tetra pak and make 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.320
 than a brick and after we ascendants 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.630
 panels that stick nature and so 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.120
 the stability and soundness of the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.310
 stool where she was locked up in 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.700
 inside so far they do not feel 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.700
 still broke the figure so we're going to 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.260
 gave a dozen everywhere 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.760
 orrville for people to try and 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.440
 realize how it works and 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.280
 for now I have not had a return 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.320
 negative you yourself ride yourself on 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.210
 in addition to the bricks so glue the 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.930
 paper too to surround the bricks 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.750
 and decorate yes so really we 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.760
 is in a spirit of 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.480
 I say it in English but it's Reduce 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.350
 louis where I want it laughs so reduce 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.720
 to try to reduce costs in the bank 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.470
 in asking other vineyards 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.840
 come wear the tetra pak for all 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.840
 distribution near the solar it is 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.150
 the before recovering them strike another 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.060
 project it makes a weight with tetra 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.800
 pak months we finally furniture is made 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.080
 and we hope to develop well by doing 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.480
 interior walls things like that 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.550
 finally we have to experiment what and so 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.510
 you try to share all those ideas 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.330
 you are doing a video 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.730
 Youtube 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.910
 that's what we would like to do 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.730
 show how to make panels for 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.030
 after playing with making furniture or 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.770
 something else so going to the big 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.989
 public and you even plan to send 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.650
 to tetra pak a video so what is this 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.480
 project is serious or mom of course 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.909
 this is serious because 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.569
 because tetra pak in the end 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:27.150
 it's still them who produce 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.660
 this matter finally 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.730
 the bricks and 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.140
 they may be interested to see that 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.190
 in southern india there is a 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.930
 community who who found the way to 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.269
 do something other than a container for 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.099
 for fruit juices actually it's the 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.239
 real problem that's what there is 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:51.970
 in the tetra pak it's all 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.290
 these industrial liquids that we absorb 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.350
 but which are not necessarily very good 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.470
 for us that in May 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.850
 and so sent would not stop what 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.660
 asking them to help us on the 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.980
 recycling and 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.230
 maybe they're going to go do it 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.030
 so we will try this morning you have 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.190
 received a visit also from someone who 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.480
 is considering recycling in his hotel 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.220
 in his guest house something like 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.910
 that no 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.549
 ditch songs that came this morning there 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.170
 use tetra pak in another way 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.450
 so it's interesting because there is 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.770
 no experiments that are out 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.360
 city and so all that that there are ideas 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.430
 who will continue others who are going 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.010
 stop at last we are really in the 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.490
 laboratory so we are happy to 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.470
 to participate in that would have changed 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.960
 interested he has plenty of ideas he wants 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.270
 develop it so we'll have to go 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.230
 discuss what we can do and what 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.760
 could you give me two three 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.170
 examples also in recycling 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.630
 what is being done so you it is 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.650
 the tetra pak tetra man is there 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.100
 other people who use 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.100
 other
