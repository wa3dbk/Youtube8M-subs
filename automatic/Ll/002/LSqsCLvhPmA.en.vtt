00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.640 

the<00:00:00.420> other<00:00:00.599> day<00:00:00.810> me<00:00:01.079> and<00:00:01.199> my<00:00:01.290> friend<00:00:01.560> were

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
the other day me and my friend were

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.169 
the other day me and my friend were
talking<00:00:01.709> about<00:00:02.159> James<00:00:02.460> Bond<00:00:02.790> and<00:00:03.060> then

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
talking about James Bond and then

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.510 
talking about James Bond and then
somehow<00:00:03.510> we<00:00:04.130> spiraled<00:00:05.130> into<00:00:05.310> this

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
somehow we spiraled into this

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.519 
somehow we spiraled into this
conversation<00:00:05.970> about<00:00:06.509> how<00:00:06.839> much<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.259> world

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
conversation about how much the world

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.580 
conversation about how much the world
sucks<00:00:08.389> at<00:00:09.389> first<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:10.050> thought<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:10.410> was

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
sucks at first I thought this was

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.629 
sucks at first I thought this was
because<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.920> statistical<00:00:11.490> probability

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
because of the statistical probability

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.310 
because of the statistical probability
of<00:00:12.150> me<00:00:12.269> being<00:00:12.450> James<00:00:12.660> Bond<00:00:12.900> when<00:00:13.019> I'm<00:00:13.110> older

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
of me being James Bond when I'm older

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.770 
of me being James Bond when I'm older
but<00:00:13.710> then<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.309> realized<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.269> because<00:00:15.630> of

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
but then I realized that it's because of

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.140 
but then I realized that it's because of
school<00:00:16.139> my<00:00:16.619> life<00:00:16.859> at<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.100> moment<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.609> teachers
