is you lose fat you're stimulating

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.910 
is you lose fat you're stimulating
overloading<00:01:35.900> your<00:01:35.990> muscle<00:01:36.320> by<00:01:36.410> training<00:01:36.710> like

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
overloading your muscle by training like

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.260
