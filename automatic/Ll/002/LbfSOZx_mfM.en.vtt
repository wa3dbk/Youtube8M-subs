00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hi guys, first of all sorry for the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.849
 lighting environment that are not too 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.880
 good but it 's because I'm going to record is e 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.370
 painting my hair blue and had no 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.510
 any program is not doing well 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:22.020
 so I chose my hair 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.789
 only she was pink continued pink 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.210
 as you can see pink is not 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.820
 I'm completely using shampoo 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.189
 waste for a week and a moment 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.079
 magician with my hair that way then 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.180
 I'll go over where I made a 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.379
 a test of mexico and that already left because 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.660
 she came and the blue caught on top of the rose 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.570
 so I 'll try to stay a little 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.329
 closer but I really this 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.649
 hair color I'll wear turquoise and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.250
 pretend to cover by applying on my hair 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.649
 and also our table shitake clix 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.420
 the colors are all different can see 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.670
 that my list of a crown applies to 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.670
 another and my hair on the other ends 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.250
 then you are able to stay totally 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.320
 ax the various things but in the beginning 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.590
 every change of ink and finishes 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.470
 thus rendering the pigmentation never so 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.930
 as well as the time as you wash and 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.060
 retouching may be that the color becomes a 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.680
 a little better than that 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.960
 That's it, let's see how it goes. 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.939
 it as much as I have to use 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 ink purer than expected in the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.970
 cream 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.210
 I'm still going to put a lot of cream 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.990
 because it is easier to apply and I do not 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.119
 I want you, she gets very dark, I 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.670
 I want a little but of course will not have 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:47.130
 a lot of difference today I will not tell you 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.380
 How much am I putting because how is mine? 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.890
 hair and the appliques 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.750
 so it's not too much paint and I'm very creamy 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.950
 I'll do more or less with my eye if I miss it. 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.530
 I can, I can 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.250
 I'm just doing a little bit now. 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:09.440
 You always because you already had cream for 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:12.000
 I can apply ink 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.150
 You can put the amount of credit 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.150
 also 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.170
 Good. I've been adding ink until 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.000
 I needed a little 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.300
 my hair to make sure I was not going 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.170
 stay a little cushion and see more 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.630
 or less ismm pigmentation that I want 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.310
 I'll try to keep that same color and 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.310
 when you see camera thing 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.770
 You do not even have to wear a suit 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.530
 and if possible use a grape because 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.630
 this ink stains a lot so you go 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.990
 getting your fingers colorful tones and can 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.260
 download everything then photo everything you do not 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.440
 wants ink because it can sneeze 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.140
 and it is very difficult to take away nor six lanes 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.140
 of clothing then really as a precaution is 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.000
 always good to put on an old suit 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.000
 Good to start applying ink 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.580
 some parts I already see that it will stay 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.580
 spotted even maybe it's a little bit today 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.500
 little studied with pink than the blue ink 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:50.379
 Do not worry, I do not know if you 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:52.180
 can see right here in the middle and I know 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.280
 that a lot of people are still going to talk but you 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.400
 have to do it unless you have 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.640
 everybody color you tried to be us people 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.180
 Seriously my hair had three hearts. 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.890
 I was afraid to try anything else. 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.400
 I was not able to choose in more 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.400
 than they 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:54.559
 Half the love was already missing. 

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:54.559
 a lot here and the appliques are not 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:01.889
 finally half the finished service is already 

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:03.719
 a small problem in having 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.519
 I usually leave the activity for about 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.479
 40 minutes 

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:10.129
 so I think it's going to take a while 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.839
 just right to be able to apply and paint and 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:15.569
 then already in my hair 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:17.849
 I finished everything so I've already ink 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:20.609
 the shelters and I think now gave 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:23.279
 time of romeu hair the time that I 

00:05:20.609 --> 00:05:26.729
 I was last had to apply 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:29.879
 so I 'll wash the 'dry' on it and 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.129
 show you what the result is 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:34.739
 I really liked that tone of blue that 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:39.029
 stayed as expected 

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:42.179
 lightly ax the colors of my hair 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:44.159
 and appliques were not small things and 

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:45.589
 some tones were still pulled by 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:48.569
 rose 

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:51.839
 but as I said before that for sure 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:55.889
 Going back alone with the time I went 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:58.559
 retouching I really liked it 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.629
 I hope you liked it too. 

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:03.479
 as I had said before I used 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:05.729
 agreement that at last 2010 schools 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.159
 I recommend it quite satisfied she did not 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:11.579
 leaves the hair so well at least pink does not 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:13.259
 It would be so easy and who 

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:16.139
 Good story, did you like the story? 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:18.269
 video of my new hair color 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.059
 how did you guys sign up for the 

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:22.709
 canal liked and accompany the 

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:26.809
 social networks that I had down here 

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:26.809
 her with a kiss until the next video
