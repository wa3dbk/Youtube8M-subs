I

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.070 

the<00:00:14.820> electric<00:00:15.820> hooked<00:00:16.300> up<00:00:16.510> we<00:00:16.630> got<00:00:16.780> the<00:00:16.870> lights

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
the electric hooked up we got the lights

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.050 
the electric hooked up we got the lights
hooked<00:00:17.320> up<00:00:17.500> in<00:00:17.680> the<00:00:17.740> batteries<00:00:18.130> now<00:00:18.700> it's<00:00:18.880> time

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
hooked up in the batteries now it's time

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.380 
hooked up in the batteries now it's time
to<00:00:19.300> permanently<00:00:19.840> mount<00:00:20.080> the<00:00:20.230> motor<00:00:21.300> what<00:00:22.300> we

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
to permanently mount the motor what we

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.000 
to permanently mount the motor what we
do<00:00:22.510> is<00:00:22.690> we<00:00:22.810> centered<00:00:23.140> a<00:00:23.200> boat<00:00:23.410> or<00:00:23.680> centered<00:00:23.980> a

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
do is we centered a boat or centered a

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.350 
do is we centered a boat or centered a
motor<00:00:24.220> in<00:00:24.369> the<00:00:24.430> back<00:00:24.460> of<00:00:24.700> the<00:00:24.760> boat<00:00:24.880> obviously

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
motor in the back of the boat obviously

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.210 
motor in the back of the boat obviously
but<00:00:25.540> we<00:00:25.660> drilled<00:00:25.960> the<00:00:26.080> holes<00:00:26.290> set<00:00:26.950> the<00:00:27.040> motor

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
but we drilled the holes set the motor

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.800 
but we drilled the holes set the motor
all<00:00:27.400> the<00:00:27.460> way<00:00:27.580> down<00:00:27.760> and<00:00:27.970> drilled<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:28.330> hole<00:00:28.510> at

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
all the way down and drilled the hole at

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.760 
all the way down and drilled the hole at
the<00:00:29.140> very<00:00:29.439> top<00:00:29.680> but<00:00:30.070> what<00:00:30.730> we<00:00:30.850> need<00:00:31.060> to<00:00:31.180> do<00:00:31.770> is

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
the very top but what we need to do is

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.380 
the very top but what we need to do is
we<00:00:32.950> got<00:00:33.070> to<00:00:33.190> get<00:00:33.250> this<00:00:33.430> cavitation<00:00:34.150> plate

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
we got to get this cavitation plate

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.729 
we got to get this cavitation plate
about<00:00:34.629> even<00:00:34.930> with<00:00:35.050> the<00:00:35.080> bottom<00:00:35.260> of<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.559> boat

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
about even with the bottom of the boat

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.080 
about even with the bottom of the boat
so<00:00:35.950> we're<00:00:36.100> going<00:00:36.220> to<00:00:36.280> go<00:00:36.400> ahead<00:00:36.430> and<00:00:36.760> lift<00:00:36.910> the

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
so we're going to go ahead and lift the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.150 
so we're going to go ahead and lift the
motor<00:00:37.239> now<00:00:37.989> if<00:00:38.080> i<00:00:38.260> can<00:00:38.320> get<00:00:38.500> Mike<00:00:38.739> out<00:00:38.920> of<00:00:39.100> the

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
motor now if i can get Mike out of the

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.890 
motor now if i can get Mike out of the
refrigerator<00:00:39.309> for<00:00:40.000> a<00:00:40.090> couple<00:00:40.360> minutes<00:00:40.480> he<00:00:40.720> can

refrigerator for a couple minutes he can

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.600 
refrigerator for a couple minutes he can
give<00:00:41.020> me<00:00:41.140> a<00:00:41.170> hand<00:00:41.379> raising<00:00:41.680> this<00:00:41.890> motor<00:00:42.160> up<00:00:42.400> and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
give me a hand raising this motor up and

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.330 
give me a hand raising this motor up and
not<00:00:42.820> will<00:00:43.780> pile<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.199> silicone<00:00:44.680> in<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.100> and

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
not will pile the silicone in the and

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.090 
not will pile the silicone in the and
the<00:00:45.879> bottom<00:00:46.270> hole<00:00:46.449> here<00:00:46.690> and<00:00:46.840> we'll<00:00:46.989> set<00:00:47.980> the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
the bottom hole here and we'll set the

00:00:48.100 --> 00:01:04.329 
the bottom hole here and we'll set the
motor

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.710 

we<00:01:05.339> gave<00:01:05.519> ourselves<00:01:05.640> about<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.150> half<00:01:06.360> inch<00:01:06.540> of

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
we gave ourselves about a half inch of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.200 
we gave ourselves about a half inch of
clay<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.710> whole<00:01:07.950> bottom<00:01:08.670> bolt<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.060> that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
clay I'm the whole bottom bolt so that

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.359 
clay I'm the whole bottom bolt so that
is<00:01:09.420> going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.810> slide<00:01:10.170> up<00:01:10.409> when<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.799> hoist<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.250> up

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
is going to slide up when we hoist it up

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:23.750 
is going to slide up when we hoist it up
we're<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> go<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> third<00:01:12.869> hole

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:34.240 

you<00:01:24.240> want<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.480> check<00:01:24.660> them

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.980 

that's<00:01:34.580> all<00:01:34.850> right<00:01:34.880> where<00:01:35.300> we<00:01:35.420> want<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:35.720> third

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
that's all right where we want a third

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.040 
that's all right where we want a third
hole<00:01:36.230> we<00:01:36.530> can<00:01:36.680> go<00:01:36.800> up<00:01:36.920> another<00:01:37.660> half<00:01:38.660> inch<00:01:38.900> or

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
hole we can go up another half inch or

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.570 
hole we can go up another half inch or
so<00:01:39.230> if<00:01:39.290> we<00:01:39.410> go<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.680> fourth<00:01:39.860> oh<00:01:40.100> but<00:01:40.280> I<00:01:40.340> think

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
so if we go to the fourth oh but I think

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.840 
so if we go to the fourth oh but I think
that'll<00:01:40.790> be<00:01:40.820> about<00:01:40.970> right<00:01:41.240> here<00:01:41.450> here<00:01:42.850> little

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
that'll be about right here here little

00:01:43.850 --> 00:02:08.749 
that'll be about right here here little
silicon

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.470
