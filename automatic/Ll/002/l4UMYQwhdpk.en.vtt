00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.950
 Hi there, Game Pilot 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.340
 This show is angry games and at the microphone again 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.860
 I 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.560
 call me as always shock and as 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.949
 I usually review mobile games 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.230
 devices went but here with a single frame 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.500
 you can understand what game is today 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.949
 speech 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.920
 yes yes this is the sensational andy masterpiece 2010 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.170
 years limbo I understand that only the most 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.679
 lazy reviewer has not yet done a review on 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.170
 limbo 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.899
 and until recently I was this 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.270
 the most lazy reviewer but now limbo 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.000
 came out and apples so my holy 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.129
 duty to talk a little about him of course 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.620
 like most viewers I am limbo 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.660
 long ago passed and passed more than once and 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.059
 not even two by the way passed on 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.309
 comp of course but now that arsenal on 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.039
 how can you play limbo expanded 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.960
 what is not a reason to rebuild well, since I 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.879
 still need to say something then let's 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.579
 pretend you nothing about this game 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.640
 I did not hear you play it for the first time 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.350
 the plot as such it is not here if not 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.659
 bump in the search for deep meaning 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.000
 most likely the authors had in mind 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.400
 purgatory that the Olympus itself that was 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.920
 first described by dante in his divine 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.140
 comedy that is the place where the soul gets 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.689
 those who had no place not in heaven not in 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.909
 hell such a hopelessness is that 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.210
 the end of the game is its beginning quite 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.549
 confirms this version okay plot 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.579
 this is not what this game can hook and 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.009
 yet it catches you think of a kapets like 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.070
 much so what 's the point well of course 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.259
 style and atmosphere of both in 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.600
 limbo in excess everything is done in 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.880
 black and white beautifully traced 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.979
 both foreground and backdrop with 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.110
 that many items and characters are so and 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.570
 remain for the player with black silhouettes 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.880
 and our imagination is where 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.040
 turn around you can imagine a bunch 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.009
 kids and you can and the junction and arrows 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.200
 the corpses of whom already as much like it all 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.270
 dark atmosphere of loneliness and 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.800
 hopelessness which is saturated with ours 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.140
 purgatory is maintained awesome 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.900
 suitable for all this sound action 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.750
 making a good sound in the game is a little 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.480
 whether not 50 percent of its atmosphere and here 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.180
 the sound of your fifty dollars worked for a lesson 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.370
 surely any atmosphere would roll 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.700
 in complete shit if the gameplay were 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.920
 clumsy uninteresting and tedious but here and 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.110
 this is no gameplay in big 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.040
 degree tied to solving rebuses and 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.500
 puzzles 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.930
 very often tied to physics or 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.850
 reaction speed solution set 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.100
 tasks are often non-trivial 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.290
 so you have to die often 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.660
 and and very diverse and colorful 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.240
 ways because of their non-standard 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.840
 problems are often solved there by sampling 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.090
 and mistakes 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.490
 and in our case the method of deaths and 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.010
 Resurrections regarding the port 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.260
 manageable done here as well 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.420
 ok like everything else when i 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.030
 I started the game I had a fear that 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.310
 realizes it anyhow it will spoil 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.040
 all fun but not all intuitive 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.450
 understandable and get used to it easier than 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.370
 could imagine 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.260
 and can be as before completely 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.840
 focus on what's happening and 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.660
 plunge into the world of limbu summarize 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.850
 pluses this is absolutely the same game on 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.430
 which fapaet so many people now 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.520
 third consecutive year and and and the transition to a new 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.510
 platform just as it did not spoil the cons 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.180
 well this is absolutely the same game nothing 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.940
 No new locations have been added and 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.180
 puzzles and it costs as much as 5 bucks 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.520
 Well 4 dollars 99 cents to be exact 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.750
 but let's not be greedy because it w 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.910
 his mother limbo 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.430
