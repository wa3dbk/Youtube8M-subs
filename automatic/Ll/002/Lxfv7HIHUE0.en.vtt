00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
we're getting it's going to be really

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.770

nice<00:02:18.530> um<00:02:18.920> but<00:02:19.430> there's<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.790> bad<00:02:20.300> thing<00:02:20.600> too<00:02:20.750> that

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.930 
I guess some people might be mad about
it<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:22.970> i<00:02:23.000> might<00:02:23.240> not<00:02:23.420> really<00:02:23.600> care<00:02:24.160> but<00:02:25.160> just

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
it so i might not really care but just

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.300
