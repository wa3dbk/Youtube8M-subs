bat I like to talk a bit about the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.340 
bat I like to talk a bit about the
design<00:00:14.070> it's<00:00:14.280> about<00:00:14.370> as<00:00:14.730> long<00:00:15.089> as<00:00:15.150> an<00:00:15.660> iPhone<00:00:16.049> 5

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
design it's about as long as an iPhone 5

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.290 
design it's about as long as an iPhone 5
and<00:00:16.650> that's<00:00:17.490> about<00:00:17.640> as<00:00:17.820> thick<00:00:18.000> as<00:00:18.150> any

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
and that's about as thick as any

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.880 
and that's about as thick as any
portable<00:00:18.720> hard<00:00:18.840> drive<00:00:18.930> you'll<00:00:19.260> see<00:00:19.439> nowadays

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
portable hard drive you'll see nowadays

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.040 
portable hard drive you'll see nowadays
in<00:00:20.039> fact<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.730> whole<00:00:20.880> fit<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.300> finish<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.600> kind

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
in fact the whole fit and finish is kind

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.560 
in fact the whole fit and finish is kind
of<00:00:22.580> reminiscent<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.699> most<00:00:23.970> portable<00:00:24.300> hard

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
of reminiscent of most portable hard

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.390 
of reminiscent of most portable hard
drives<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.170> pretty<00:00:25.320> easy<00:00:25.560> if<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.369> just

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
drives so it's pretty easy if you just

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.279 
drives so it's pretty easy if you just
want<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> throw<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.060> your<00:00:27.180> bag<00:00:27.359> will<00:00:28.050> take

up too much space nice little thing to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.690 
up too much space nice little thing to
carry<00:00:30.539> with<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.380> front<00:00:31.590> has<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> very<00:00:32.520> nice

carry with you the front has a very nice
brushed<00:00:33.600> aluminum<00:00:33.989> finished<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.500> it's

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
brushed aluminum finished and it's

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.650 
brushed aluminum finished and it's
coated<00:00:35.010> elsewhere<00:00:35.670> with<00:00:35.850> sort<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.420> soft

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
coated elsewhere with sort of a soft

coated elsewhere with sort of a soft
touch<00:00:36.950> finished<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.820> build

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
touch finished I really like the build

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.150 
touch finished I really like the build
quality<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.420> only<00:00:39.570> thing<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.829> does<00:00:40.980> pick

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
quality the only thing is it does pick

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.290 
quality the only thing is it does pick
up<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.309> little<00:00:41.399> bit<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.670> fingerprints<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
up a little bit of fingerprints on the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.160 
up a little bit of fingerprints on the
back<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.719> not<00:00:42.809> really<00:00:42.989> an<00:00:43.050> issue

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
back but it's not really an issue

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.500 
back but it's not really an issue
because<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.879> charge<00:00:45.090> your<00:00:45.239> devices

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
because it's here to charge your devices

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.790 
because it's here to charge your devices
you<00:00:45.809> don't<00:00:45.960> really<00:00:46.050> care<00:00:46.140> about<00:00:46.350> fingerprints

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
you don't really care about fingerprints

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.100 
you don't really care about fingerprints
so<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> side<00:00:47.820> there<00:00:48.239> are<00:00:48.390> some<00:00:48.629> cables

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
so on the side there are some cables

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.709 
so on the side there are some cables
one's<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.010> USB<00:00:50.489> cable<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.850> recharging<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
one's a USB cable for recharging the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.229 
one's a USB cable for recharging the
device<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:53.160> other<00:00:53.309> one's<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.579> micro<00:00:53.879> USB

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
device and the other one's a micro USB

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.590 
device and the other one's a micro USB
for<00:00:54.270> charging<00:00:54.750> your<00:00:55.680> other<00:00:56.219> devices<00:00:56.610> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
for charging your other devices you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.630 
for charging your other devices you
don't<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:57.870> need<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.170> use<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> phone<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:59.489> this

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
don't really need to use a phone in this

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.220 
don't really need to use a phone in this
case<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:01:00.000> powering<00:01:00.210> an<00:01:00.329> Arduino<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:00.989> maybe<00:01:01.140> a

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
case I'm powering an Arduino or maybe a

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.680 
case I'm powering an Arduino or maybe a
mobile<00:01:01.530> speaker<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:03.210> course<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:03.600> you

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
mobile speaker but of course if you

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.329 
mobile speaker but of course if you
don't<00:01:03.809> need<00:01:03.989> micro<00:01:04.409> USB<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.830> could<00:01:04.979> also<00:01:05.100> plug

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
don't need micro USB you could also plug

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.969 
don't need micro USB you could also plug
in<00:01:05.489> your<00:01:05.610> regular<00:01:05.790> USB<00:01:06.360> devices<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:07.530> charge<00:01:07.770> it

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
in your regular USB devices to charge it

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.350 
in your regular USB devices to charge it
as<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.250> mentioned<00:01:08.549> before<00:01:08.790> there's<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.030> cable<00:01:09.299> on

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
as I mentioned before there's a cable on

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.899 
as I mentioned before there's a cable on
the<00:01:09.479> side<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:10.680> all<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.100> line<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.850> is

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the side it's all in line and this is

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.270 
the side it's all in line and this is
one<00:01:12.210> thing<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.810> useful<00:01:13.680> because<00:01:14.070> you

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
one thing that is useful because you

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.429 
one thing that is useful because you
don't<00:01:15.240> need<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.479> carry<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.780> bunch<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.080> cables

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
don't need to carry a bunch of cables

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.170 
don't need to carry a bunch of cables
but<00:01:16.920> at<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> same<00:01:17.340> time<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> wish<00:01:17.939> there<00:01:18.119> would

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
but at the same time I wish there would

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.030 
but at the same time I wish there would
be<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> port<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.560> side<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.920> could

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
be like a port on the side so I could

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.890 
be like a port on the side so I could
just<00:01:20.159> plug<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:20.700> my<00:01:20.850> own<00:01:20.970> cables<00:01:21.360> as

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
just plug it in with my own cables as

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.359 
just plug it in with my own cables as
you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> cables<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> little<00:01:23.130> short

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
you can see the cables a little short

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.310 
you can see the cables a little short
when<00:01:23.520> I'm<00:01:23.610> trying<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.850> plug<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
when I'm trying to plug it in and and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.899 
when I'm trying to plug it in and and
charge<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> with<00:01:25.799> my<00:01:25.950> PC<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> want<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
charge it with my PC and if you want to

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.340 
charge it with my PC and if you want to
charge<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.240> off<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> wall<00:01:27.630> wart<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.259> to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
charge it off a wall wart you have to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.719 
charge it off a wall wart you have to
have<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> device<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> ground<00:01:29.310> because<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
have the device on the ground because it

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.429 
have the device on the ground because it
won't<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.000> able<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.210> hang<00:01:30.479> off<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.810> wall<00:01:31.020> so

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
won't be able to hang off the wall so

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.140 
won't be able to hang off the wall so
while<00:01:32.100> you're<00:01:32.250> using<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.640> device<00:01:32.909> or

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
while you're using the device or

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.640 
while you're using the device or
charging<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> there's<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.990> couple<00:01:34.170> indicator

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
charging it there's a couple indicator

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.609 
charging it there's a couple indicator
LEDs<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.250> top<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.960> they'll<00:01:36.960> blink<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.439> show

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
LEDs on top and they'll blink to show

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.520 
LEDs on top and they'll blink to show
you<00:01:37.700> it's<00:01:38.700> charge<00:01:39.030> status<00:01:39.240> or<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.960> stay<00:01:40.350> on

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
you it's charge status or just stay on

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.130 
you it's charge status or just stay on
when<00:01:41.460> you're<00:01:41.909> discharging<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.570> there's<00:01:42.990> only

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
when you're discharging it there's only

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.050 
when you're discharging it there's only
four<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.310> little<00:01:44.430> difficult<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.880> tell

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
four so it's a little difficult to tell

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.639 
four so it's a little difficult to tell
how<00:01:45.210> much<00:01:45.329> capacity<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.020> still<00:01:46.110> available<00:01:46.380> for

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
how much capacity is still available for

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.240 
how much capacity is still available for
use<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.939> mean<00:01:48.329> most<00:01:48.509> other<00:01:48.840> USB<00:01:49.290> charging

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
use but I mean most other USB charging

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.429 
use but I mean most other USB charging
systems<00:01:50.579> use<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.659> not<00:01:51.869> really<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> huge

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
systems use this so not really a huge

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.929 
systems use this so not really a huge
issue<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:53.100> wish<00:01:53.220> more<00:01:53.369> companies<00:01:53.759> would

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
issue just wish more companies would

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.179 
issue just wish more companies would
start<00:01:54.119> putting<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.540> small<00:01:55.259> LCDs<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.009> show

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
start putting in small LCDs to show

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.459 
start putting in small LCDs to show
maybe<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.549> percentage<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.719> xterm<00:01:57.990> also<00:01:58.259> comes

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
maybe a percentage the xterm also comes

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.200 
maybe a percentage the xterm also comes
with<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> couple<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.189> adapters<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.909> use<00:02:00.030> with

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
with a couple of adapters to use with

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.109 
with a couple of adapters to use with
your<00:02:00.360> devices<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.020> they<00:02:01.829> connect<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.430> DC

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
your devices and they connect to this DC

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.660 
your devices and they connect to this DC
to<00:02:03.329> USB<00:02:03.630> adapter<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.890> also<00:02:05.070> comes<00:02:05.340> with<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
to USB adapter that also comes with the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.850 
to USB adapter that also comes with the
X<00:02:05.790> arm<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.540> use<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.500> instead

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
X arm so you can just use that instead

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.710 
X arm so you can just use that instead
of<00:02:07.920> carrying<00:02:08.250> around<00:02:08.340> long<00:02:08.729> USB<00:02:09.060> cables<00:02:09.569> on

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
of carrying around long USB cables on

of carrying around long USB cables on
the<00:02:09.780> road<00:02:10.430> unfortunately<00:02:11.430> there<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.670> no

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
the road unfortunately there is no

yet<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:14.070> if<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.460> do<00:02:14.580> want<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.790> charge<00:02:15.000> an

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
yet so if you do want to charge an

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.940 
yet so if you do want to charge an
iPhone<00:02:15.180> 5<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.780> do<00:02:15.900> need<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.170> carry<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.470> cable

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
iPhone 5 you do need to carry that cable

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.980 
iPhone 5 you do need to carry that cable
so<00:02:17.640> I've<00:02:17.760> been<00:02:17.910> using<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.300> X<00:02:18.450> storm<00:02:18.720> for<00:02:18.930> a

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
so I've been using the X storm for a

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.290 
so I've been using the X storm for a
couple<00:02:19.260> weeks<00:02:19.440> now<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.100> purposely<00:02:20.940> not

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
couple weeks now and purposely not

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.270 
couple weeks now and purposely not
charging<00:02:21.780> my<00:02:21.930> phone<00:02:21.960> so<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.650> do<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.070> and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
charging my phone so I can do that and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.670 
charging my phone so I can do that and
it's<00:02:24.120> pretty<00:02:24.300> much<00:02:24.390> held<00:02:24.720> up<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.020> their<00:02:25.200> claims

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
it's pretty much held up to their claims

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.100 
it's pretty much held up to their claims
that<00:02:25.920> as<00:02:26.070> charged<00:02:26.460> my<00:02:26.610> phone<00:02:26.900> around<00:02:27.900> five

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
that as charged my phone around five

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.100 
that as charged my phone around five
times<00:02:28.410> every<00:02:28.680> single<00:02:28.950> time<00:02:29.660> in<00:02:30.660> terms<00:02:30.930> of

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
times every single time in terms of

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.900 
times every single time in terms of
charging<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.620> X<00:02:31.800> term<00:02:31.980> takes<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.310> couple<00:02:32.610> hours

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
charging the X term takes a couple hours

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.420 
charging the X term takes a couple hours
so<00:02:33.180> if<00:02:34.140> you're<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.710> road<00:02:34.890> with<00:02:35.130> it

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
so if you're on the road with it

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.250 
so if you're on the road with it
I'd<00:02:35.580> recommend<00:02:35.940> maybe<00:02:36.300> just<00:02:36.600> charging<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.140> at

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
I'd recommend maybe just charging it at

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.170 
I'd recommend maybe just charging it at
night<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:38.190> if<00:02:38.430> you're<00:02:38.550> not<00:02:38.670> gonna<00:02:38.760> use<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.150> for

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
night and if you're not gonna use it for

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.480 
night and if you're not gonna use it for
a<00:02:39.360> few<00:02:39.390> months<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.980> course

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
a few months of course

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.460 
a few months of course

normal battery maintenance practices

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.400 
normal battery maintenance practices
just<00:02:44.160> check<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:45.480> kept<00:02:45.720> its<00:02:45.870> charge<00:02:46.110> and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
just check that it kept its charge and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.200 
just check that it kept its charge and
be<00:02:46.860> sure<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.070> recharge<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.730> every<00:02:47.820> now<00:02:48.060> and

be sure to recharge it every now and

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.030 
be sure to recharge it every now and
again<00:02:48.240> so<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.780> you're<00:02:49.650> keeping<00:02:49.800> those

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
again so that you're keeping those

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.130 
again so that you're keeping those
batteries<00:02:50.490> intact<00:02:50.850> now<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.480> know<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.810> question

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
batteries intact now I know the question

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.750 
batteries intact now I know the question
is<00:02:52.170> probably<00:02:52.320> going<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.650> arise<00:02:52.890> can<00:02:53.520> this

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
is probably going to arise can this

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.290 
is probably going to arise can this

it for a few more hours until you get to
a<00:03:10.980> power<00:03:11.190> source<00:03:11.460> but<00:03:12.450> again<00:03:12.990> this<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.350> really

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
a power source but again this is really

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.220 
a power source but again this is really
designed<00:03:13.770> for<00:03:14.280> use<00:03:14.670> with<00:03:14.850> mobile<00:03:15.150> phones<00:03:15.360> or

designed for use with mobile phones or

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.830 
designed for use with mobile phones or
smaller<00:03:16.890> devices<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.730> aren't<00:03:17.880> big

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
power-hungry tablets so overall I mean I

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.650 
power-hungry tablets so overall I mean I
really<00:03:22.290> really<00:03:22.650> enjoyed<00:03:23.550> using<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.180> x-term

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
really really enjoyed using the x-term

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.800 
really really enjoyed using the x-term
there's<00:03:25.110> very<00:03:25.680> minimal<00:03:26.570> complaints<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.630> have

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
there's very minimal complaints I have

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.050 
there's very minimal complaints I have
again<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.860> only<00:03:29.040> thing<00:03:29.160> I'd<00:03:29.340> love<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:29.760> see<00:03:29.910> is

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
again the only thing I'd love to see is

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.640 
again the only thing I'd love to see is
maybe<00:03:30.270> a<00:03:30.360> port<00:03:30.660> on<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.900> side<00:03:31.050> so<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.320> can<00:03:31.500> just

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
maybe a port on the side so I can just

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.180 
maybe a port on the side so I can just
plug<00:03:31.860> in<00:03:32.010> my<00:03:32.130> own<00:03:32.250> cables<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.730> charge<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.150> but

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
plug in my own cables to charge it but

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.680 
plug in my own cables to charge it but
besides<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.520> it's<00:03:35.730> really<00:03:36.060> well<00:03:36.239> it's<00:03:36.450> it's

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
besides that it's really well it's it's

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.780 
besides that it's really well it's it's
some<00:03:36.870> of<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.050> best<00:03:37.080> build<00:03:37.500> quality<00:03:37.739> I've<00:03:38.430> seen

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
some of the best build quality I've seen

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.220 
some of the best build quality I've seen
in<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:39.000> while<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.209> mean<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.570> front<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.989> just

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
in a while I mean the front is just

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.660 
in a while I mean the front is just
great<00:03:40.500> with<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.950> brushed<00:03:41.220> aluminum<00:03:41.340> finish

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
great with the brushed aluminum finish

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.190 
great with the brushed aluminum finish
and<00:03:42.320> I<00:03:43.320> really<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.190> soft<00:03:44.489> touch<00:03:44.760> plastic<00:03:45.239> but

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
and I really like soft touch plastic but

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.110 
and I really like soft touch plastic but
overall<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.650> mean<00:03:46.950> this<00:03:47.130> is<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.340> great<00:03:47.580> device<00:03:47.880> if

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
overall I mean this is a great device if

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.020 
overall I mean this is a great device if
you<00:03:48.239> need<00:03:48.650> mobile<00:03:49.650> battery<00:03:50.100> backup<00:03:50.489> unit<00:03:50.520> I

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
you need mobile battery backup unit I

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.390 
you need mobile battery backup unit I
think<00:03:51.720> this<00:03:51.900> is<00:03:52.080> probably<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.160> way<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.280> go

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
think this is probably the way to go

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.840 
think this is probably the way to go
