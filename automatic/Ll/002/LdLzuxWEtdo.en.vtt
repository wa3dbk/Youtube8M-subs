00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
amateur but in those early years you

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.469 
amateur but in those early years you
were<00:01:59.950> winning<00:02:00.549> pretty<00:02:00.909> much<00:02:01.030> every<00:02:01.270> site

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
were winning pretty much every site

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.030 
were winning pretty much every site
earlier<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.049> you<00:02:02.110> were<00:02:02.200> good<00:02:02.380> at<00:02:02.409> her<00:02:02.590> no

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
earlier and you were good at her no

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.350 
earlier and you were good at her no
doubt<00:02:03.189> about<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.460> when<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:03.909> got<00:02:04.060> back<00:02:04.150> into

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
doubt about it when I got back into

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.539 
doubt about it when I got back into
boxing<00:02:04.840> because<00:02:05.020> my<00:02:05.380> mother<00:02:05.890> she<00:02:06.220> got<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.369> pub

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
in Newark so I had probably the best

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.080 
in Newark so I had probably the best
part<00:02:08.619> of<00:02:08.649> four<00:02:08.920> years<00:02:09.189> our<00:02:09.399> boxing<00:02:09.819> from<00:02:10.000> the

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
way away from the Padma knows it's

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.920 
way away from the Padma knows it's
playing<00:02:26.370> pool<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.940> playing<00:02:27.390> on<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.569> gambling

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
playing pool and playing on the gambling

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.690 
playing pool and playing on the gambling
machine<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.830> know<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:29.010> was<00:02:29.159> at<00:02:29.280> school<00:02:29.400> as

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
machine and you know I was at school as

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.729 
machine and you know I was at school as
well<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.420> sort<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.959> lost<00:02:31.110> interest<00:02:31.379> of

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
well so I sort of lost interest of

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.710 
well so I sort of lost interest of
boxing<00:02:32.129> but<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.340> think<00:02:32.610> things<00:02:33.269> happen<00:02:33.420> for<00:02:33.569> a

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
boxing but I think things happen for a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.229 
boxing but I think things happen for a
reason<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.230> not<00:02:35.159> being<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.579> boxing<00:02:35.970> at<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
reason and not being in boxing at the

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.199 
reason and not being in boxing at the
time<00:02:36.629> when<00:02:36.900> between<00:02:37.379> 15<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.129> 19<00:02:38.549> I<00:02:38.849> was<00:02:39.120> trying
