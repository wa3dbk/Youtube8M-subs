togepi model that's I believe has been
accepted<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.690> here's<00:02:31.320> a<00:02:31.530> quick<00:02:31.860> look<00:02:32.280> at<00:02:32.459> that

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
accepted so here's a quick look at that

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.520 
accepted so here's a quick look at that
and<00:02:33.830> yeah<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.670> I'm<00:02:36.120> just<00:02:36.510> gonna<00:02:36.690> keep<00:02:37.020> covered
