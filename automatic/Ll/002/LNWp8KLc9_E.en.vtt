00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.090

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.530
 we had to move to the bedroom 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.920
 to the ring to open it is the 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.660
 pack on top of the bed that you do not do 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.510
 many comments on the sheets of 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.190
 daisies that you may see but 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.829
 that's how hard I'm going to open this 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.480
 package that has arrived from amazon what 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.129
 you know watching 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.230
 the box is big, that's why I have to 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.530
 move to the bedroom because good the 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.269
 table had it is a little small and good 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.409
 and the bed is bigger with which 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:09.470
 let's try to open it so let's 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.960
 open it to discover the content of 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.700
 this package this new boxing 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.100
 mysterious 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.100
 We use the putter here 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.430
 Be careful when you open a box with 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.930
 a cutter you do not get too much is not going to 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:36.840
 be that you can what you just asked 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.700
 Well luckily it's protected here 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.090
 with enough paper 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.360
 let's remove this here this by 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.360
 there 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.060
 very well protected the truth comes very 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.930
 well protected we will turn it around 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.990
 because it comes backwards 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.830
 Well, I do not know if it looks good but it's 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.990
 a backpack 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.740
 that comes here and here comes the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.740
 bill 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.910
 let's remove the box 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.420
 we left it out there 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.950
 we keep the cutter 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.950
 and as you can see, it's a backpack 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.870
 from the layer layer manufacturer 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.410
 that will be worth to keep our 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.760
 photographic material the camera is made 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.760
 of photos accessories accessories like flash 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.030
 Torch 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.670
 memory cards and apart we will 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.769
 be worth to take our beloved 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.819
 laptop our beloved macbook but 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.799
 let's remove the plastic bag that 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.239
 I think I'll keep it for when 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.260
 use the suitcase so it does not get full 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.990
 of dust 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:07.850
 here we have it 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.850
 Today is only a boxing and I will make you a 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:18.069
 a detailed video or a review about 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:22.530
 this backpack tasting 3 n 135 pl as you can 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.530
 see is a pretty big backpack 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.830
 so this when we fill it I think that 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.890
 it's going to weigh a lot, I do not know if maybe 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:35.560
 yes it weighs a couple of kilos 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:38.410
 It comes with pockets over here 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.470
 As you can see it goes up a bit is colored 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.790
 yellow inside the entire interior is 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.900
 yellow to distinguish well 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.900
 what you are going to keep 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.770
 a few hooks this is like a kind 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.900
 catalog of all backpacks and 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.680
 especially of the characteristics of 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.740
 this backpack 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.200
 this is where we would keep the camera a 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.090
 little a bit a bit strange maybe 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.110
 because water stored on one side 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.480
 here 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.410
 and as you see brings some more surprise 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.410
 let's get it out 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:23.950
 if we can get this card 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.980
 here comes something else 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.470
 It is a bag that is hooked where 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.650
 we have the cutter we need to pull 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.990
 cutter as I told you the tripod 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.380
 tell me the tripod the camera would go right 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.090
 here to ice would go the goal the access 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.849
 wet on the side if you already know it is 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.699
 A Little bit weird 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:48.169
 I hope you will understand in another video 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.169
 which is quite useful 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:56.630
 here we have the scooter hook this 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:59.420
 that I have taken before 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:04.689
 this is a bag that you can carry 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:07.299
 here hung and is a protector 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:10.209
 for what is the backpack for 

00:05:07.299 --> 00:05:12.429
 protect it from the water of the sun is worth 

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:15.870
 It rains then you put this case that 

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:20.270
 would completely wrap the backpack 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.270
 and this that comes in this little bag 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.100
 it's another little bag 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.460
 little girl 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:32.910
 with a tape that comes in here that 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.830
 would be worth to place the tripod if 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.530
 we carry a tripod we can leave 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:42.210
 here in this little bag and this little bag and 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:44.070
 day more or less fit here subject 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.410
 over here as you see good let's put it 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.910

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.080
 you see 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.960
 that would see the here and here could 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.950
 arrange the tripod then we have more 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.950
 side pockets 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.110
 with lots of other pocket stuff here 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.740
 large lateral 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.620
 with different compartments and here in 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.750
 the back 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.990
 notice that the system of zippers 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.990
 bring 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.870
 I am very good quality of oil 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.930
 here in the back we're going to 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.800
 save what is 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:30.069
 our laptop for example 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.229
 my 15 inch pro macbook is worth the 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:35.440
 portable that can be saved is up 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:39.460
