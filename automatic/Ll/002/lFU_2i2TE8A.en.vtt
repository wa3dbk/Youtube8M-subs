00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
going to review the lunatic seismic for

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.050 
going to review the lunatic seismic for
the<00:00:04.080> iphone<00:00:04.440> 5<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:04.740> 5s<00:00:05.100> now<00:00:05.460> many<00:00:05.700> of<00:00:05.790> you<00:00:05.940> have

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
the iphone 5 and 5s now many of you have

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.120 
the iphone 5 and 5s now many of you have
asked<00:00:06.569> me<00:00:06.629> what<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:06.990> your<00:00:07.020> favorite<00:00:07.170> case<00:00:07.890> and

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
asked me what is your favorite case and

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.860 
asked me what is your favorite case and
this<00:00:08.400> seismic<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:09.000> actually<00:00:09.360> one<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.510> them<00:00:09.719> in

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
this seismic is actually one of them in

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:19.070 
this seismic is actually one of them in
terms<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.500> being<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.920> slim<00:00:11.250> case<00:00:11.429> anyways<00:00:18.080> this

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
terms of being a slim case anyways this

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.800 
terms of being a slim case anyways this
is<00:00:19.320> my<00:00:19.470> go-to<00:00:19.710> case<00:00:20.100> if<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.760> have<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.180> go<00:00:21.359> suit<00:00:21.689> up

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
is my go-to case if I have to go suit up

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.170 
is my go-to case if I have to go suit up
as<00:00:22.710> its<00:00:23.070> slim<00:00:23.279> enough<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:23.609> provides<00:00:23.910> quite<00:00:24.119> a

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
as its slim enough but provides quite a

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.849 
as its slim enough but provides quite a
bit<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.510> protection<00:00:24.660> or<00:00:25.140> if<00:00:25.560> I'm<00:00:25.680> in-between

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
bit of protection or if I'm in-between

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.429 
bit of protection or if I'm in-between
reviewing<00:00:26.640> iphone<00:00:27.029> cases<00:00:27.480> which<00:00:27.810> I'm<00:00:28.199> usually

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
reviewing iphone cases which I'm usually

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.080 
reviewing iphone cases which I'm usually
not<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.340> we're<00:00:29.490> gonna<00:00:29.609> run<00:00:29.820> through<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
not so we're gonna run through the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.580 
not so we're gonna run through the
review<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.510> after<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.019> am<00:00:31.199> gonna<00:00:31.349> tell

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
review and after that I am gonna tell

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.350 
review and after that I am gonna tell
you<00:00:31.710> how<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.640> case<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.210> one

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
you how you can get this case the one

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.900 
you how you can get this case the one
that<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.570> haven't<00:00:33.930> used<00:00:34.200> for<00:00:34.739> free<00:00:34.950> for<00:00:35.670> slim

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
that I haven't used for free for slim

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.549 
that I haven't used for free for slim
cases<00:00:36.360> our<00:00:36.540> scoring<00:00:36.960> system<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> little

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
cases our scoring system is a little

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.530 
cases our scoring system is a little
different<00:00:37.950> instead<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.250> nine<00:00:38.430> criteria<00:00:38.910> we're

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
different instead of nine criteria we're

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.450 
different instead of nine criteria we're
eight<00:00:39.690> against<00:00:40.079> five<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.770> design<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
eight against five so design and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.299 
eight against five so design and
functionality<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.090> rated<00:00:42.360> twice<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:42.840> much<00:00:43.050> as

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
functionality is rated twice as much as

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.310 
functionality is rated twice as much as
protection<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:45.239> gave<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.570> case<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> score

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
protection we gave this case a score

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.229 
protection we gave this case a score
four<00:00:46.590> point<00:00:46.860> nine<00:00:47.039> days<00:00:47.340> out<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.670> five<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.059> is

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
four point nine days out of five this is

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.990 
four point nine days out of five this is
pretty<00:00:48.660> much<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.140> perfect<00:00:49.469> slim<00:00:50.070> iPhone<00:00:50.640> case

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
pretty much the perfect slim iPhone case

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.720 
pretty much the perfect slim iPhone case
in<00:00:51.239> my<00:00:51.510> opinion<00:00:51.989> anyways<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:53.160> provides<00:00:53.460> great

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
in my opinion anyways it provides great

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.850 
in my opinion anyways it provides great
protection<00:00:54.149> allows<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.020> install<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.469> third

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
protection allows you to install a third

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.439 
protection allows you to install a third
party<00:00:56.190> screen<00:00:56.430> protector<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> case

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
party screen protector on to the case

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.150 
party screen protector on to the case
the<00:00:57.809> mute<00:00:57.960> ringer<00:00:58.230> switch<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> very<00:00:58.949> very

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the mute ringer switch is a very very

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.220 
the mute ringer switch is a very very
neat<00:00:59.460> thing<00:00:59.820> now<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.480> terms<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.930> fault<00:01:01.170> that

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
neat thing now in terms of a fault that

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.930 
neat thing now in terms of a fault that
now<00:01:01.379> I'd<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.770> try<00:01:01.890> very<00:01:01.949> very<00:01:02.309> hard<00:01:02.579> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
now I'd have to try very very hard to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.549 
now I'd have to try very very hard to
find<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.239> fault<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:04.199> might<00:01:04.409> be<00:01:04.530> very

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
find a fault is that it might be very

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.679 
find a fault is that it might be very
difficult<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.970> first<00:01:06.240> timers<00:01:06.540> to

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
difficult for the first timers to

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.560 
difficult for the first timers to
install<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> case<00:01:07.950> now<00:01:08.220> my<00:01:08.760> case<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.299> pretty

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
install the case now my case is pretty

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.469 
install the case now my case is pretty
worn<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.250> take<00:01:11.520> my<00:01:11.549> iPhones<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.420> out

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
worn in as I take my iPhones in and out

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.570 
worn in as I take my iPhones in and out
of<00:01:12.570> my<00:01:12.630> cases<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> lot<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.860> don't<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.430> use

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
of my cases a lot so I don't have to use

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.039 
of my cases a lot so I don't have to use
a<00:01:14.610> lot<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.850> my<00:01:14.970> finger<00:01:15.240> muscles<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:15.869> you're

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
a lot of my finger muscles but if you're

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.870 
a lot of my finger muscles but if you're
gonna<00:01:16.290> use<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.710> brand<00:01:17.040> new<00:01:17.280> case<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.759> might

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
gonna use this brand new case you might

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.399 
gonna use this brand new case you might
have<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.509> know<00:01:18.630> maybe<00:01:18.900> work<00:01:19.110> out<00:01:19.259> your

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
have to you know maybe work out your

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.780 
have to you know maybe work out your
finger<00:01:19.619> muscles<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.950> bit<00:01:19.979> I'm<00:01:20.189> joking<00:01:20.700> it's

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
finger muscles a bit I'm joking it's

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.609 
finger muscles a bit I'm joking it's
maybe<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.810> push<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> little<00:01:22.409> harder

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
maybe you have to push a little harder

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.469 
maybe you have to push a little harder
the<00:01:23.340> only<00:01:23.610> other<00:01:23.759> thing<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.150> could<00:01:24.360> think

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the only other thing that I could think

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.670 
the only other thing that I could think
of<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.780> might<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:25.049> difficult<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.560> this

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
of that might be difficult with this

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.830 
of that might be difficult with this
case<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.040> accessing<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> buttons<00:01:27.180> some

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
case is accessing the buttons some

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.440 
case is accessing the buttons some
people<00:01:28.140> might<00:01:28.320> find<00:01:28.560> too<00:01:29.220> hard<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.090> through

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
people might find too hard to through

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.960 
people might find too hard to through
the<00:01:30.689> impact<00:01:31.320> truss<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.159> don't<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the impact truss but I don't have that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.429 
the impact truss but I don't have that
problem<00:01:33.150> those<00:01:33.420> are<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.630> only<00:01:33.780> two<00:01:34.049> things<00:01:34.229> I

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
problem those are the only two things I

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.440 
problem those are the only two things I
can<00:01:34.619> think<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.100> could<00:01:35.430> even<00:01:36.060> say<00:01:36.270> bad

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
can think of that I could even say bad

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.569 
can think of that I could even say bad
about<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.900> case<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.920> terms<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.369> weight<00:01:38.460> in

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
about this case in terms of weight in

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.100 
about this case in terms of weight in
both<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> case<00:01:39.060> we'll<00:01:39.270> add<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> quarter<00:01:39.930> eighth

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
both the case we'll add a quarter eighth

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.080 
both the case we'll add a quarter eighth
of<00:01:40.290> an<00:01:40.409> inch<00:01:40.500> thickness<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.280> your<00:01:41.310> iPhone<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
of an inch thickness to your iPhone and

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.609 
of an inch thickness to your iPhone and
there's<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.390> quarter<00:01:42.689> inch<00:01:42.869> bumpers<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.409> kind

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
there's a quarter inch bumpers it kind

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.200 
there's a quarter inch bumpers it kind
of<00:01:43.680> goes<00:01:43.799> around<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.220> entire<00:01:44.250> iPhone<00:01:45.000> so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
of goes around the entire iPhone so

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.499 
of goes around the entire iPhone so
that's<00:01:45.689> about<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.110> bulky<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.850> case<00:01:48.090> gets

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that's about as bulky as the case gets

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.480 
that's about as bulky as the case gets
like<00:01:49.170> all<00:01:49.320> other<00:01:49.500> lunatik<00:01:49.979> products<00:01:50.340> the

is actually really awesome one of the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
most unique features of the case is the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.649 
most unique features of the case is the
impact<00:01:56.369> trust<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.939> runs<00:01:57.090> along<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.420> side<00:01:57.630> of

the<00:01:57.840> case<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.680> material<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> seismic

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the case the material that the seismic

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340 
the case the material that the seismic
is<00:01:59.820> made<00:02:00.000> out<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.659> rubbery<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.229> it's

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
is made out of it is rubbery but it's

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.080 
is made out of it is rubbery but it's
not<00:02:01.530> too<00:02:01.740> slick<00:02:02.009> at<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> same<00:02:02.430> time<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.909> it's

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
not too slick at the same time so it's

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.520 
not too slick at the same time so it's
not<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.689> stuck<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.079> your<00:02:04.170> pocket

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
not going to get stuck in your pocket

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.260 
not going to get stuck in your pocket
but<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.040> not<00:02:05.159> going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.399> go<00:02:05.490> fly<00:02:05.700> off<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> table

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.419 
but it's not going to go fly off a table
I<00:02:06.630> will<00:02:07.140> add<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> impact<00:02:08.009> trusts

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
I will add that the impact trusts

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.790 
I will add that the impact trusts
forward<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.000> seismic<00:02:09.479> isn't<00:02:09.840> quite<00:02:10.080> as<00:02:10.259> big

and<00:03:09.010> instead<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.910> having<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.180> cutout<00:03:10.450> they've

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
and instead of having a cutout they've

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.509 
and instead of having a cutout they've
got<00:03:10.989> this<00:03:11.200> switch<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.709> it's<00:03:11.860> so<00:03:12.130> nice<00:03:12.340> it

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.920 
got this switch and it's so nice it
works<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:13.060> well<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.360> don't<00:03:13.630> know<00:03:13.690> why<00:03:13.810> other

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
works so well I don't know why other

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.319 
works so well I don't know why other
cases<00:03:14.470> don't<00:03:14.620> copy<00:03:14.950> them<00:03:15.250> getting<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.209> the

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
cases don't copy them getting to the

hardware<00:03:16.660> ports<00:03:17.019> is<00:03:17.140> pretty<00:03:17.350> easy<00:03:17.500> because

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
hardware ports is pretty easy because

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.530 
hardware ports is pretty easy because
the<00:03:17.890> bomb<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:18.190> pretty<00:03:18.489> open<00:03:18.760> but<00:03:19.120> it's<00:03:19.269> still
