 even a little too strong 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:09.940

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.330

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.710

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.900

 he doesn't have a thousand excesses these right things 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.180

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.980

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.440

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.260

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.870

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.260
 from 18 years up starting to be 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.250
