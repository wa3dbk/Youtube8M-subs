um<00:00:01.460> once<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.580> get<00:00:02.730> that<00:00:02.879> all<00:00:03.090> set<00:00:03.360> I<00:00:03.540> got<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:03.810> lip

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
um once I get that all set I got the lip

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.380 
um once I get that all set I got the lip
mate<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.440> got<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.710> wiring<00:00:05.190> all<00:00:05.370> done<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.850> use<00:00:06.359> a

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
mate I got the wiring all done I use a

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.900 
mate I got the wiring all done I use a
two-part<00:00:06.899> epoxy<00:00:07.099> now<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> 60-minute

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
two-part epoxy now this is a 60-minute

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.299 
two-part epoxy now this is a 60-minute
epoxy<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.570> but<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.840> use<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.410> because<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.889> slow

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
epoxy I but I use this because of slow

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.340 
epoxy I but I use this because of slow
reacting<00:00:11.730> at<00:00:12.630> all<00:00:14.030> it<00:00:15.030> allows<00:00:15.299> me<00:00:15.509> enough<00:00:16.109> work

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
reacting at all it allows me enough work

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.590 
reacting at all it allows me enough work
time<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:17.010> mix<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.910> batch<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
time I can mix a batch of it and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.900 
time I can mix a batch of it and
actually<00:00:18.750> make<00:00:19.140> three<00:00:19.680> four<00:00:20.010> five<00:00:20.310> lures<00:00:20.730> at

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
actually make three four five lures at

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.029 
actually make three four five lures at
once<00:00:21.180> rather<00:00:22.080> than<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> five<00:00:22.710> minute<00:00:22.980> epoxy

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
once rather than the five minute epoxy

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.730 
once rather than the five minute epoxy
where<00:00:23.609> if<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.119> mix<00:00:24.359> some<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.600> better<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:25.170> at

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
where if I mix some I better have at

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.290 
where if I mix some I better have at
least<00:00:25.949> one<00:00:26.279> lower<00:00:26.460> done<00:00:26.699> within<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.150> couple

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
least one lower done within a couple

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.080 
least one lower done within a couple
minutes<00:00:27.539> before<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.050> starts<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.410> thicken<00:00:29.060> so<00:00:30.060> I

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
minutes before it starts to thicken so I

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.089 
minutes before it starts to thicken so I
use<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> 60<00:00:30.929> minute<00:00:31.140> epoxy<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
use the 60 minute epoxy just for the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.220 
use the 60 minute epoxy just for the
simple<00:00:32.369> fact<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.820> can<00:00:33.210> get<00:00:33.450> more<00:00:33.840> lures

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
simple fact that I can get more lures

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.069 
simple fact that I can get more lures
done<00:00:34.530> at<00:00:34.950> once<00:00:36.290> after<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.559> get<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:39.079> everything

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
done at once after I get the everything

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.889 
done at once after I get the everything
glued<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.890> let<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.160> sit<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.460> about<00:00:41.899> five

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
glued in and I let it sit for about five

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.500 
glued in and I let it sit for about five
or<00:00:42.930> six<00:00:43.260> hours<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:44.059> make<00:00:45.059> sure<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.329> all
