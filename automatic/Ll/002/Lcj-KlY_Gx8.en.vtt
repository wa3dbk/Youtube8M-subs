00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.739
 stuffing the video as the anime 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.089
 of naruto shippuden shit I want it to be 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.949
 finish the filling or whatever it is today I come 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.440
 to talk about a miniseries that came out in 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.870
 Latin America a few months ago that being 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.330
 frank I ended up liking until I 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.880
 I surprised ha ha ha ha ha the series is 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.770
 call the young titans in action to 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.899
 since many doing zapping in the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.820
 tele will have seen a commercial this 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.320
 series that goes saying in these times 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.450
 about new episodes 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.720
 I expect one especially ha ha ha ha 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.360
 They think I'm going to tell them 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.520
 toy because they do not see them good good you 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.670
 I keep putting stuffing, let's start with a 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.340
 once this series created obviously by dc 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.110
 comics is in my opinion a parody to the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.780
 original series of 2003 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.700
 the young titans this series to 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.860
 comparison of the original between 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.780
 quotes exists does not follow at all the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.640
 history so we will not see new 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.659
 adventures or anything haha but that 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.280
 adventures we will see 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.469
 but of crazy things that our 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.319
 little heroes and that one day very 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:52.390
 far they will be able to save their city on 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.350
 animation work is done style 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.509
 anime civil 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.399
 I say style because obviously it's not anime in 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.679
 where the characters are now more 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.170
 small and bigheaded also counting 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.209
 enemies haha the plot would say that it 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.520
 try to see the comic part of the old 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:09.729
 2003 series in a simpler way 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.040
 less serious was my seriousness and it exists in 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.230
 where enemies appear that I would say that 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.239
 enemies have nothing dangerous ha ha 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.400
 and also things from his life that 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.470
 they have to solve what 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.599
 I want to tell you that the crc maybe 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.489
 they wanted us to see the lives of our 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.650
 heroes in different ways in that of 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.349
 save the world since the other series was 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.319
 epic with its battles story the plot 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.360
 it was great counting the comedy and in this 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.640
 series took everything but the comedy 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.370
 so summarized I tell you if you did not have me 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.379
 understood a new x the characters 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.180
 obvious are the same with some 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.670
 changes that we will see right away when we see 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.739
 just one chapter of the obvious series that 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.720
 we already know them but I will name what 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.570
 changed them in personality 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.400
 robin the boy wonder xd in the series 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.280
 original was a serious leader worried 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.800
 for your city very smart for me what 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.530
 it was xd and he had a strong spirit of 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.110
 justice yes yes very nice what he said 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.660
 robing of the new muguru 8 change series 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.940
 compared to his old good self 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.580
 although robin still has his spirit 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.410
 of justice something intact x of its 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.480
 intelligence seems to have dropped 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.490
 when I was on a motorcycle since this robin 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.620
 in my opinion and as we say in my 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.720
 city exists is a crazy barbarian with 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.300
 Doves on the head your martial art 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.640
 it goes on like I think as I said there are not many 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.980
 fights haha is more presumptuous since he 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.320
 in a chapter it is considered I say 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.230
 I do not exaggerate the best hero that could have 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.209
 existed ah I forgot it is also 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.580
 much more active in this series has 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.310
 energy and sometimes I hope the 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.110
 will use to combat the bad x of being 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.420
 fire she is still the same 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.130
 sweet extraterrestrial who cares about 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.260
 others and that is surprised by the 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.570
 things that are on earth the truth was 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.100
 half obvious that she would not change but 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.680
 you see that she does not show much interest 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.829
 in robin here we would have the famous 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.840
 with which I forgot to say is 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.719
 fully in love with being yes 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.640
 fully in love he likes both the 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.709
 things on earth that can reach 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.200
 commit crazy things to do them and to 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.230
 add always getting into raven too 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.299
 since they are the only girls to be added 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.430
 something else is also that she is very 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.320
 good in the art of cooking those who saw 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.889
 the obvious series that you know what I'm talking about 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.500
 xdddd good taste the change its 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.690
 medium average personality would be for a 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.759
 more cheerful and carefree his 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.860
 good intelligence I think what 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.530
 formatted so borghi was like the one 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.930
 we see in the current series x of his car the 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.030
 famous auto t nothing to do with the old 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.880
 auto but he continues to treat him as his 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.710
 baby to add something there are also gorg 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.110
 in this series you can transform your 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.889
 body in every crazy thing if it seems that 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.169
 something like that was improved xdddd psycho beast my 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.300
 favorite character if before in the 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.919
 original series he showed a spirit 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.770
 of strong justice and also a good 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.960
 intelligence sometimes the beast boy of 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.009
 this series like I lost a bit by 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.619
 do not say everything 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:08.110
 and the spirit of justice I do not say no 

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:10.869
 be still righteous but a lazy 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.699
 I think they will understand me better if they see a 

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:15.129
 chapter that he shows his good 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.960
 laziness x intelligence 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.909
 if you want intelligence cni go with 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.399
 that boy does not have any hair 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:23.740
 smart he at least goes on with his 

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:26.259
 old habits of joking eat everything 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.719
 say phrases at silly moments and a 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.939
 great and perfect etcetera along with flavor 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:33.129
 I could say that they give the greatest comedy of 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:36.279
 the series since they are a great duo those two 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:38.169
 fools rave in my second character 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:41.139
 favorite her in the series though 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.909
 we knew it was something cold reserved from their 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.399
 emotions and preferred to be albos 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:47.710
 now the one in this series although it keeps 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:50.080
 its coldness be something reserved and be 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.180
 alone just to meditate she became 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.399
 in a sarcastic girl in several of the 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.860
 comments from your peers or enemies 

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:59.919
 it's easier to get angry and when it does 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.559
 hehehe good is not nothing seeing what you 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.539
 It also shows an obsession with 

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:07.330
 a series that is a parody of my little 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:09.129
 pony my cute piece x that is something 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.910
 curious that you like the Gothic 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.220
 team the truth 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.230
 besides, I think the cdc saw 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.600
 many fans who wanted her with boy 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.730
 beast I say that friends because they 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.920
 they always had moments and what do I know in 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.320
 the current series raven shows that to her 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.990
 he likes beast boy do not respect that 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.150
 I hate but it shows good 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.760
 we could see that this series had great 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.460
 many changes mean crazy and bad but 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.770
 I really do not complain much jaka my 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.500
 opinion of this series is that I never the 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.990
 I would recommend and stop so you do not put your finger 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.910
 down I still say it because you're 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.740
 series and the time you may get to like 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.630
 or not as there are many who cry and 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.550
 they want to burn df and the gringos because 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.250
 they ruined the series but obvious and 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.620
 let's be honest this series is 100% 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.870
 different from the original is never about 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.570
 give a continuation or nothing just try 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.460
 to give their own comedy and adventures if 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.860
 let's say the cdc say it's the 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.570
 below and I would understand it but 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.180
 as it is not I do not see the sense 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.310
 so many complaints I give a four of 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.560
 five stars since I like it 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.450
 obvious there are things that do not and that if I say them 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.800
 It would be a lot spoiler if some 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.379
 they decide to give it a try 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.970
 friends I leave this here see you in 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:21.800
 a few more months because I'm already 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.710
 studying the tertiary to be able 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.080
 look for then work the fucking mother goodbye 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.819
 friends and do not exaggerate because a series 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.770
 they looked they made it back 

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:33.680
 as a comedy because if they are true 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:36.849
 fans or what do I know will not care goodbye 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.849
 and see youtube
