00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.120 

today<00:00:01.949> we'll<00:00:02.220> be<00:00:02.399> using<00:00:02.659> wet<00:00:03.659> cleaning<00:00:04.130> using

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
today we'll be using wet cleaning using

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.839 
today we'll be using wet cleaning using
visible<00:00:05.879> dust<00:00:06.029> products<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:07.560> Nikon<00:00:08.599> d70<00:00:09.599> 100

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
visible dust products on Nikon d70 100

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.060 
visible dust products on Nikon d70 100
in<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:12.059> case<00:00:12.330> we'll<00:00:12.960> be<00:00:13.110> using<00:00:13.320> green<00:00:13.650> swab

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
in this case we'll be using green swab

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.130 
in this case we'll be using green swab
it<00:00:14.280> makes<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.700> 100<00:00:15.299> from<00:00:15.570> visible<00:00:15.929> desta<00:00:17.000> with

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
it makes the 100 from visible desta with

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.120 
it makes the 100 from visible desta with
Reedus<00:00:19.140> plus<00:00:19.670> liquid<00:00:20.670> from<00:00:21.060> visible<00:00:21.449> dust

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
Reedus plus liquid from visible dust

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.700 
Reedus plus liquid from visible dust
basically<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.970> start<00:00:24.300> with<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.230> make<00:00:25.470> sure

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
basically to start with and make sure

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.460 
basically to start with and make sure
you<00:00:26.130> use<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> blower<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.960> case<00:00:28.199> we'll<00:00:28.439> be

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
you use a blower in this case we'll be

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.440 
you use a blower in this case we'll be
using<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:29.130> CRM<00:00:30.109> and<00:00:31.109> blowing<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.669> sensor<00:00:33.180> so

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
using a CRM and blowing the sensor so

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.920 
using a CRM and blowing the sensor so
make<00:00:33.630> sure<00:00:33.660> there<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.200> no<00:00:34.520> particles<00:00:35.930> floating

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
make sure there is no particles floating

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.180 
make sure there is no particles floating
on<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.530> sensor<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.370> case<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.510> once<00:00:40.190> you've

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
on the sensor this case so once you've

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.180 
on the sensor this case so once you've
done<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:42.440> so<00:00:43.789> we<00:00:44.789> try<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:46.610> to<00:00:47.610> use<00:00:48.379> a<00:00:49.379> few

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
done that so we try to to use a few

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.760 
done that so we try to to use a few
drops<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.960> solutions<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:53.000> this<00:00:54.000> swab

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
drops of solutions on this swab

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.490 
drops of solutions on this swab
basically<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:56.670> use<00:00:59.000> almost<00:01:00.000> three<00:01:00.750> three

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
basically we use almost three three

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.060 
basically we use almost three three
drops<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:03.059> allow<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:04.379> solution<00:01:04.769> to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
drops and you allow the solution to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.179 
drops and you allow the solution to
saturate<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.850> entire<00:01:07.700> tip<00:01:08.700> up<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.150> fabric

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
saturate the entire tip up the fabric

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.550 
saturate the entire tip up the fabric
and<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.760> gently<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:13.439> horizontal<00:01:14.869> way<00:01:15.869> we

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
and then gently on a horizontal way we

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.130 
and then gently on a horizontal way we
entered<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.070> chamber<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.850> urinated<00:01:18.750> 90

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
entered the chamber and urinated 90

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.820 
entered the chamber and urinated 90
degrees<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.810> then<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.869> start<00:01:22.380> from<00:01:22.590> one

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
degrees and then you start from one

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
degrees and then you start from one
corner<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.320> go<00:01:28.500> all<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.680> way<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.549> another

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
corner and you go all the way to another

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.399 
corner and you go all the way to another
corner<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:31.490> then<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.759> start<00:01:33.299> rotating<00:01:33.750> 90

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
corner and then you start rotating 90

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.859 
corner and then you start rotating 90
degrees<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:34.979> take<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.689> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
degrees you take it out if you want to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.550 
degrees you take it out if you want to
start<00:01:37.259> second<00:01:38.220> swap<00:01:39.079> basically<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.380> to

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
start second swap basically you have to

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.639 
start second swap basically you have to
turn<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.400> 180<00:01:42.329> degrees<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.110> use<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
turn this 180 degrees so you use the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.160 
turn this 180 degrees so you use the
opposite<00:01:44.640> side<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.210> swab<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.990> go

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
opposite side of the swab and you go

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.770 
opposite side of the swab and you go
from<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.950> same<00:01:47.189> direction<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:48.060> make<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.479> well

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
from the same direction you make is well

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.830 
from the same direction you make is well
then<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.740> use<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.250> inspection<00:01:51.180> device<00:01:51.479> for

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
then you use the inspection device for

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.560 
then you use the inspection device for
visible<00:01:52.229> dust<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.829> case<00:01:53.159> called<00:01:53.880> quasar

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
visible dust in this case called quasar

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.950 
visible dust in this case called quasar
sensor<00:01:55.320> loop<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.969> you<00:01:56.969> try<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.329> see<00:01:57.659> if<00:01:57.719> there

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
sensor loop and you try to see if there

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.670 
sensor loop and you try to see if there
is<00:01:58.049> any<00:01:58.290> dust<00:01:58.680> or<00:01:59.180> any<00:02:00.180> particles<00:02:00.810> up<00:02:00.990> left<00:02:01.320> on

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
is any dust or any particles up left on

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.020 
is any dust or any particles up left on
the<00:02:02.040> sensor<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:03.479> time<00:02:03.810> basically<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
the sensor and this time basically the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.310 
the sensor and this time basically the
cleaning<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.210> over

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
cleaning is over

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.380 
cleaning is over
you
