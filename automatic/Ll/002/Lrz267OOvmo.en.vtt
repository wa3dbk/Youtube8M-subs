00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.050
 6 things you did not know about zombies 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.990
 and 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.340
 Hello, friends, how are you? 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.410
 better and welcome all gentlemen to a 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.880
 new minecraft video on this occasion 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.890
 I bring you 6 things that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.660
 you probably do not know about the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.130
 zombies obviously probably because 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.640
 you can maybe some of you 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.870
 they put these things or something like that obviously 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.250
 this is more or less for player by 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.020
 medium of minecraft should not leave 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.600
 these things and they are curiosities 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.010
 interesting then good if you have 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.629
 videos like this one let's see if we can 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.640
 overcome the challenge of this 2000 direction 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.930
 I like it and can also comment on 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.840
 who want it to be the next video 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.670
 well of curiosities and well this was to 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.739
 petition of Juan Carlos of the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.770
 zombies then well to see what comes out 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.010
 for the next video a zombie has 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.150
 0.04 percent to appear with the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.550
 Diamond armor 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.290
 if we throw an infected villager 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.690
 weak position and we give it a 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.970
 We can transform the golden apple 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.320
 in the day not again nothing else we have 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.540
 to wait a little while 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.770
 to leave red particles and will return 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.770
 to its original state 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.290
 wallace we can appear the version 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.159
 Giant Zombie if we put the command 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:34.149
 diagonal summon giant space 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.069
 and in this way the giant and the 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.530
 zombies can not be burned if they are 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:44.280
 inside a cobweb if they come out 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.650
 goodbye the zombies can see you from 40 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.250
 blocks away the other modes you 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.960
 come from 16 is to say for the zombies 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.450
 are chasing for how long 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.950
 in old minecraft versions the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.950
 zombies released the most 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.690
 and good friends this is true came back from 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.280
