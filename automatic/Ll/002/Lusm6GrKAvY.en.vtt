00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.550 

long<00:00:00.480> board<00:00:01.340> this<00:00:02.340> is<00:00:02.610> short<00:00:03.120> board<00:00:03.529> what<00:00:04.529> is

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
long board this is short board what is

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.280 
long board this is short board what is
the<00:00:04.740> difference<00:00:05.100> between<00:00:05.190> this<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.000> this

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.290 
the difference between this and this

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.360 
the difference between this and this
well<00:00:07.290> basically<00:00:07.500> this<00:00:07.890> one<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.250> long<00:00:10.219> so<00:00:11.219> this

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
well basically this one is long so this

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.950 
well basically this one is long so this
is<00:00:11.490> another<00:00:11.790> episode<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.269> verse<00:00:12.570> where<00:00:12.870> we

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
is another episode of verse where we

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.010 
is another episode of verse where we
take<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.440> entirely<00:00:14.000> opinion<00:00:15.000> istic<00:00:15.420> if<00:00:15.660> that's

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
take to entirely opinion istic if that's

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.470 
take to entirely opinion istic if that's
even<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.350> word<00:00:16.379> things<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:18.210> talk<00:00:18.449> about

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
even a word things and we talk about

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.599 
even a word things and we talk about
them<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.199> then<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.770> guys<00:00:19.949> fight<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.520> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
them and then you guys fight in the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.519 
them and then you guys fight in the
comments<00:00:21.029> about<00:00:21.150> what's<00:00:21.570> better<00:00:21.810> or<00:00:22.050> worse<00:00:22.260> or

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
comments about what's better or worse or

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.920 
comments about what's better or worse or
what<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.890> guys<00:00:23.010> think<00:00:23.460> well<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.660> board

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
what do you guys think well this board

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.480 
what do you guys think well this board
is<00:00:25.109> obviously<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.740> long<00:00:25.980> board<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.430> board

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
is obviously a long board and this board

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.929 
is obviously a long board and this board
is<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> short<00:00:27.119> board<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:28.220> essentially<00:00:29.220> what<00:00:29.820> it

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
is a short board and essentially what it

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.910 
is a short board and essentially what it
is<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.330> like<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.990> board<00:00:31.260> right<00:00:31.410> here<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.710> more

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
is is like this board right here is more

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.650 
is is like this board right here is more
of<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.099> trick<00:00:32.309> skateboard<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:33.030> short<00:00:33.420> and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
of a trick skateboard it's short and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.930 
of a trick skateboard it's short and
it's<00:00:33.809> more<00:00:34.170> able<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.920> flipped<00:00:35.309> around<00:00:35.430> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
it's more able to be flipped around and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.420 
it's more able to be flipped around and
you<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.450> do<00:00:36.660> tricks<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.230> easier<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.890> then

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
you can do tricks on it easier and then

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.910 
you can do tricks on it easier and then
this<00:00:38.520> board<00:00:38.850> has<00:00:39.420> these<00:00:39.600> giant<00:00:39.660> soft<00:00:40.559> wheels

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
this board has these giant soft wheels

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.000 
this board has these giant soft wheels
and<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:42.090> more<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> cruiser<00:00:43.020> board<00:00:43.440> so

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and it's more of like a cruiser board so

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.590 
and it's more of like a cruiser board so
what<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.340> doing<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.700> board<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.329> like

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
what are you doing this board you like

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.380 
what are you doing this board you like
cruise<00:00:46.489> kind<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.789> skate<00:00:48.030> around<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
cruise kind of just skate around the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.200 
cruise kind of just skate around the
city<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.460> you<00:00:50.460> probably<00:00:50.640> can't<00:00:50.940> hear

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
city like this you probably can't hear

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.150 
city like this you probably can't hear
it<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.510> super<00:00:51.750> well<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
it like super well but you can the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.880 
it like super well but you can the
wheels<00:00:53.370> are<00:00:53.610> nice<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.090> soft<00:00:54.410> like<00:00:55.410> one<00:00:55.620> push

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
wheels are nice and soft like one push

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.340 
wheels are nice and soft like one push
on<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.160> cruiser<00:00:56.430> board<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.940> you're<00:00:57.030> just

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
on this cruiser board and you're just

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.960 
on this cruiser board and you're just
just<00:00:58.350> straight<00:00:58.620> cruising

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.610 

see<00:01:04.970> that<00:01:05.090> Cruiser<00:01:05.420> board<00:01:05.630> style<00:01:08.620> longboard

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
see that Cruiser board style longboard

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.620 
see that Cruiser board style longboard
surfer<00:01:10.070> style<00:01:10.370> but<00:01:11.060> then<00:01:11.180> I<00:01:11.240> get<00:01:11.390> on<00:01:11.420> this

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
surfer style but then I get on this

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.790 
surfer style but then I get on this
board<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:15.380> it's<00:01:16.070> just<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.460> different<00:01:16.880> a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
board and it's just a different a

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.130 
board and it's just a different a
different<00:01:18.800> feel<00:01:19.040> a<00:01:19.070> different<00:01:19.640> style<00:01:20.140> the

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
different feel a different style the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.700 
different feel a different style the
sport<00:01:21.470> is<00:01:21.560> obviously<00:01:21.950> more<00:01:22.250> for<00:01:22.460> tricks<00:01:23.710> I'm

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
sport is obviously more for tricks I'm

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.050 
sport is obviously more for tricks I'm
probably<00:01:24.980> not<00:01:25.190> going<00:01:25.370> to<00:01:25.430> do<00:01:25.580> that<00:01:25.730> on<00:01:25.910> that

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
probably not going to do that on that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.090 
probably not going to do that on that
board<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:26.870> can<00:01:27.080> be<00:01:27.230> done<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:27.590> can<00:01:27.620> do<00:01:27.860> tricks

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
board it can be done you can do tricks

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.190 
board it can be done you can do tricks
on<00:01:28.190> a<00:01:28.250> longboard<00:01:28.580> but<00:01:28.900> definitely<00:01:29.900> not<00:01:30.020> as

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
on a longboard but definitely not as

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.420 
on a longboard but definitely not as
easy<00:01:32.620> essentially<00:01:33.620> that's<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.980> difference

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
easy essentially that's the difference

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.880 
easy essentially that's the difference
between<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:35.030> long<00:01:35.450> board<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.440> short<00:01:36.619> board

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
between a long board and a short board

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.160 
between a long board and a short board
now<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.729> lot<00:01:37.970> of<00:01:38.090> people<00:01:38.390> I<00:01:38.479> feel<00:01:38.690> like<00:01:38.930> are

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
now a lot of people I feel like are

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.990 
now a lot of people I feel like are
going<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.590> college<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.130> they<00:01:40.369> start<00:01:40.729> out<00:01:40.850> with

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
going to college and they start out with

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.859 
going to college and they start out with
this<00:01:41.180> kind<00:01:41.420> of<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:41.690> board<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.290> they<00:01:43.190> go<00:01:43.369> I<00:01:43.869> want

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
this kind of a board and they go I want

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.590 
this kind of a board and they go I want
something<00:01:45.140> that's<00:01:45.380> going<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.590> get<00:01:45.740> me<00:01:45.920> from

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
something that's going to get me from

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.450 
something that's going to get me from
this<00:01:47.600> class<00:01:47.960> over<00:01:48.290> here<00:01:48.320> to<00:01:48.770> that<00:01:48.800> class<00:01:49.160> over

this class over here to that class over

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.180 
this class over here to that class over
here<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:50.630> I'm<00:01:51.290> going<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.590> like<00:01:51.800> be

comfortable on it roll nice and smooth

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.530 
comfortable on it roll nice and smooth
that's<00:01:55.340> kind<00:01:55.550> of<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.700> purpose<00:01:55.940> of<00:01:56.240> these<00:01:56.390> you

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
that's kind of the purpose of these you

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.980 
that's kind of the purpose of these you
can<00:01:56.690> just<00:01:57.610> take<00:01:58.610> one<00:01:58.640> nice<00:01:59.180> big<00:01:59.450> push<00:01:59.720> and<00:01:59.960> just

not a lot of effort involved and that's

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.210 
not a lot of effort involved and that's
kind<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.690> what<00:02:05.810> these<00:02:05.960> are<00:02:06.110> good<00:02:06.229> for<00:02:06.470> the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
to like step up to the next level you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.750 
to like step up to the next level you
might<00:02:20.030> be<00:02:20.180> good<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.510> go<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.900> board<00:02:21.140> like<00:02:21.290> this

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
might be good to go to a board like this

might be good to go to a board like this
it<00:02:22.760> might<00:02:22.970> be<00:02:23.120> good<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.510> have<00:02:23.750> both<00:02:24.200> of<00:02:24.260> these

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
it might be good to have both of these

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.620 
it might be good to have both of these
boards<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.460> start<00:02:25.790> out<00:02:25.910> learning<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.420> ride

two<00:04:22.910> things<00:04:23.180> against<00:04:23.540> each<00:04:23.750> other<00:04:23.990> like<00:04:24.860> why

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
two things against each other like why

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.220 
two things against each other like why
do<00:04:25.160> we<00:04:25.370> have<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.730> argue<00:04:25.910> between<00:04:26.510> longboarders

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
do we have to argue between longboarders

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.830 
do we have to argue between longboarders
and<00:04:27.620> short<00:04:27.920> boarders<00:04:28.310> when<00:04:29.120> we<00:04:29.240> can<00:04:29.390> all<00:04:29.540> just

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
and short boarders when we can all just

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.530 
and short boarders when we can all just
agree<00:04:30.170> that<00:04:30.200> we<00:04:31.010> like<00:04:31.190> riding<00:04:31.820> skateboards

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
agree that we like riding skateboards

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.410 
agree that we like riding skateboards
with<00:04:33.320> wheels<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:33.950> kind<00:04:34.580> of<00:04:34.670> go<00:04:34.820> from<00:04:34.970> there

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
with wheels and kind of go from there

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.490 
with wheels and kind of go from there
I<00:04:35.450> think<00:04:36.320> more<00:04:36.950> longboarders<00:04:37.940> should<00:04:38.510> learn

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
I think more longboarders should learn

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.440 
I think more longboarders should learn
to<00:04:39.800> ride<00:04:39.980> this<00:04:40.010> kind<00:04:40.610> of<00:04:40.730> board<00:04:40.970> just<00:04:41.210> so<00:04:41.330> they

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.030 
to ride this kind of board just so they
can<00:04:41.510> do<00:04:41.750> tricks<00:04:42.050> and<00:04:42.350> they<00:04:42.410> can<00:04:42.590> feel<00:04:42.860> the
