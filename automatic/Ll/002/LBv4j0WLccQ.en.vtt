00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.160 
should go on for quite a while this
should<00:01:37.350> go<00:01:37.439> down<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:39.920> don't<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.009> ever<00:01:41.579> a

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
should go down for I don't know ever a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.889 
should go down for I don't know ever a
long<00:01:43.170> long<00:01:43.350> time<00:01:43.530> anyway<00:01:43.890> okay<00:01:44.759> sugar<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:45.720> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
long long time anyway okay sugar down to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.319 
long long time anyway okay sugar down to
here<00:01:46.259> where<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.280> shows<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.729> type<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.000> rock

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
here where it shows that type of rock

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.080 
here where it shows that type of rock
black<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.380> gray<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.549> end<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
black and gray that is the end of the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.730 
black and gray that is the end of the
world<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.659> can't<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.170> can't<00:01:52.530> really

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
world and you can't you can't really

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.170 
world and you can't you can't really
break<00:01:52.920> past<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.430> at<00:01:53.549> all<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:54.659> will<00:01:54.869> take

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
break past that at all this will take

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.490 
break past that at all this will take
actually<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.210> don't<00:01:57.360> think<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.600> does<00:01:57.750> break<00:01:58.049> you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
actually I don't think it does break you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.230 
actually I don't think it does break you
can<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.829> hit<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.460> forever<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.119> will

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
can just hit that forever and it will

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.539 
can just hit that forever and it will
never<00:02:00.390> break<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.170> yeah<00:02:01.770> that's<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.130> bottom<00:02:02.430> of

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
never break so yeah that's the bottom of

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.410 
never break so yeah that's the bottom of
the<00:02:02.670> world<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:04.009> then<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.100> go<00:02:05.280> up

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
the world and then you go up

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.550 
the world and then you go up
I<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:07.170> would<00:02:07.619> say<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:07.920> five<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:09.289> five<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.440> eight

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
I I would say like five to five to eight

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.620 
I I would say like five to five to eight
steps<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.190> think<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.819> did<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.120> six<00:02:12.330> or<00:02:12.480> seven

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
steps I think I did like six or seven

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.960 
steps I think I did like six or seven
here<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.250> then<00:02:14.250> go<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.360> side<00:02:16.489> okay<00:02:17.489> I

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
here and then go to the side okay I

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.710 
here and then go to the side okay I
don't<00:02:18.630> know<00:02:18.780> why<00:02:18.870> that's<00:02:19.080> there<00:02:19.290> anyway<00:02:20.190> and

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
don't know why that's there anyway and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.199 
don't know why that's there anyway and

just<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:48.000> case<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.269> needed<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.690> but<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:48.989> took<00:02:49.140> that

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
just in case I needed to but I took that

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.840 
just in case I needed to but I took that
out<00:02:49.410> earlier<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.090> then<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.209> go<00:02:51.450> one<00:02:52.850> one

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
out earlier and then you go one one

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.789 
out earlier and then you go one one
direction<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.690> when<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:54.989> cut<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.410> like

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
direction and when you cut and like

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.110 
direction and when you cut and like
whenever<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.190> want<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.459> stop<00:02:56.519> or<00:02:56.970> whenever

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
you reach a ravine or something I had to

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.630 
you reach a ravine or something I had to
kind<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.640> like<00:03:00.170> redirect<00:03:01.170> because<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.190> found<00:03:02.549> a

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
kind of like redirect because I found a

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.020 
kind of like redirect because I found a
bunch<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.940> lava<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:04.069> now<00:03:05.069> there's<00:03:05.670> still<00:03:06.000> a

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
bunch of lava and now there's still a

bunch of lava and now there's still a
bunch<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.330> lava<00:03:06.540> anyway<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:09.140> get<00:03:10.140> here

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
bunch of lava anyway so and get here

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.780 
bunch of lava anyway so and get here
this<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.519> where<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.820> was<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.799> then<00:03:13.799> keep<00:03:14.760> going

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
this is where it was and then keep going

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.520 
this is where it was and then keep going
one<00:03:15.239> direction<00:03:15.359> until<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:15.959> reach<00:03:16.109> an<00:03:16.260> end<00:03:16.410> i'm

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
one direction until you reach an end i'm

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.750 
one direction until you reach an end i'm
not<00:03:16.650> going<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.799> go<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.010> far<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.280> takes<00:03:17.640> way

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
not going to go that far that takes way

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.490 
not going to go that far that takes way
too<00:03:17.790> long<00:03:18.109> anyway<00:03:19.109> and<00:03:19.910> then<00:03:20.910> go<00:03:21.359> back<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:22.140> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
too long anyway and then go back to the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.590 
too long anyway and then go back to the
beginning<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:23.100> your<00:03:24.030> hub<00:03:24.269> right<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.970> move<00:03:26.970> two

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
beginning of your hub right and move two

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.380 
beginning of your hub right and move two
blocks<00:03:27.930> over<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.730> start<00:03:29.730> another<00:03:29.970> one<00:03:30.150> and

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
blocks over and start another one and

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.110 
blocks over and start another one and
then<00:03:30.450> go<00:03:30.690> down<00:03:31.010> so<00:03:32.010> you've<00:03:32.190> exposed<00:03:32.609> this

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
then go down so you've exposed this

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.940 
then go down so you've exposed this
you've<00:03:33.510> exposed<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:34.109> side<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.890> side

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
you've exposed this side and that side

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.699 
you've exposed this side and that side
on<00:03:35.459> either<00:03:36.150> side<00:03:36.480> see<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.079> then<00:03:37.350> move<00:03:37.500> two

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
on either side see and then move two

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.710 
on either side see and then move two
blocks<00:03:37.920> down<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.430> go<00:03:39.209> all<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.420> way<00:03:39.450> down<00:03:39.690> to

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
blocks down and go all the way down to

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.780 
blocks down and go all the way down to
you<00:03:39.930> reach<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.170> end<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.890> then<00:03:41.489> move<00:03:41.640> two

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
you reach that end and then move two

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.819 
you reach that end and then move two
blocks<00:03:42.000> down<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.510> haven't<00:03:42.989> done<00:03:43.109> these<00:03:43.260> yet<00:03:43.560> but

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
blocks down I haven't done these yet but

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.640 
blocks down I haven't done these yet but
and<00:03:44.209> that's<00:03:45.209> how<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.450> mind<00:03:45.780> because<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.500> can

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
and that's how you mind because you can

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.280 
and that's how you mind because you can
see<00:03:47.010> this<00:03:47.700> block<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.299> this<00:03:48.570> block<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.109> you

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
see this block and this block and you

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.830 
see this block and this block and you
can<00:03:49.470> see<00:03:49.620> these<00:03:49.769> blocks<00:03:50.100> so<00:03:50.970> you've<00:03:51.420> exposed

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
can see these blocks so you've exposed

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.780 
can see these blocks so you've exposed
effectively<00:03:52.560> every<00:03:52.920> block<00:03:53.160> without<00:03:53.400> having

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
effectively every block without having

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.410 
effectively every block without having
to<00:03:53.880> open<00:03:53.910> every<00:03:54.540> block<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:57.109> yeah<00:03:59.090> any<00:04:00.090> number

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
to open every block so yeah any number

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.190 
to open every block so yeah any number
of<00:04:02.329> diamonds<00:04:03.329> could<00:04:03.510> be<00:04:03.630> found<00:04:03.870> with<00:04:04.019> this

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
of diamonds could be found with this

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.440 
of diamonds could be found with this
like<00:04:05.010> yeah<00:04:05.940> copious<00:04:06.569> amounts<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:08.359> after<00:04:09.359> you

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
like yeah copious amounts and after you

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.620 
like yeah copious amounts and after you
do<00:04:09.600> this<00:04:09.780> go<00:04:10.530> down<00:04:10.739> I<00:04:11.670> think<00:04:12.180> three<00:04:12.389> or<00:04:12.420> four

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
do this go down I think three or four

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.130 
do this go down I think three or four
steps<00:04:12.840> from<00:04:13.549> your<00:04:14.549> first<00:04:14.879> like<00:04:15.360> turn<00:04:15.690> off<00:04:15.870> of

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
steps from your first like turn off of

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.330 
steps from your first like turn off of
the<00:04:16.260> main

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
the main

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.229 
the main
like<00:04:17.940> tunnel<00:04:18.660> this<00:04:19.230> is<00:04:19.380> why<00:04:19.910> went<00:04:20.910> with<00:04:21.090> the

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
like tunnel this is why went with the

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.670 
like tunnel this is why went with the
thing<00:04:21.449> earlier<00:04:21.750> see<00:04:22.049> these<00:04:22.320> are<00:04:22.440> my<00:04:22.530> other

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
thing earlier see these are my other

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.370 
thing earlier see these are my other
hubs<00:04:23.300> that<00:04:24.300> this<00:04:24.600> one<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:24.750> had<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:24.930> like<00:04:25.169> turn

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
hubs that this one I had to like turn

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.120 
hubs that this one I had to like turn
off<00:04:25.910> because<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:27.060> went<00:04:27.210> around<00:04:27.440> yeah<00:04:28.440> anyway

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
off because it went around yeah anyway

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.909 
off because it went around yeah anyway
and<00:04:30.020> after<00:04:31.020> you<00:04:31.110> get<00:04:31.229> all<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.470> way<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.770> end

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
and after you get all the way to the end

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.159 
and after you get all the way to the end
do<00:04:32.220> you<00:04:32.250> turret<00:04:32.610> you<00:04:32.729> turn<00:04:32.970> right<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.510> keep

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
do you turret you turn right and keep

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.469 
do you turret you turn right and keep
going<00:04:34.440> so<00:04:35.220> it<00:04:35.370> like<00:04:35.550> open<00:04:36.000> so<00:04:36.180> you'll<00:04:36.330> know

going so it like open so you'll know
when<00:04:36.660> you've<00:04:36.780> gotten<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.260> end<00:04:37.290> of<00:04:38.090> this

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
when you've gotten to the end of this

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.950 
when you've gotten to the end of this
particular<00:04:39.330> hub<00:04:40.820> anyway<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:41.880> I'm<00:04:42.180> on<00:04:42.360> this<00:04:42.750> one

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
particular hub anyway so I'm on this one

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.740 
particular hub anyway so I'm on this one
I<00:04:42.990> believe<00:04:43.310> yeah<00:04:44.419> and<00:04:45.830> that<00:04:46.830> is<00:04:47.040> how<00:04:47.220> you<00:04:47.750> mine

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
I believe yeah and that is how you mine

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.570 
I believe yeah and that is how you mine
for<00:04:49.110> diamonds<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.740> most<00:04:49.919> efficient<00:04:50.400> and

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
for diamonds the most efficient and

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.820 
for diamonds the most efficient and
effective<00:04:50.790> way<00:04:51.380> remember<00:04:52.380> you<00:04:52.470> have<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.740> go

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
effective way remember you have to go

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.010 
effective way remember you have to go
very<00:04:52.860> very<00:04:53.160> deep<00:04:53.580> as<00:04:54.210> deep<00:04:54.270> as<00:04:54.630> like<00:04:54.840> the

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
very very deep as deep as like the

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.219 
very very deep as deep as like the
bottom<00:04:55.169> of<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.560> world<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:56.130> then<00:04:56.250> up<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.610> few

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
bottom of the world and then up a few

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.440 
bottom of the world and then up a few
cuz<00:04:58.229> diamonds<00:04:58.860> are<00:04:59.040> only<00:04:59.400> in<00:04:59.760> very<00:05:00.120> deep

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
cuz diamonds are only in very deep

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.560 
cuz diamonds are only in very deep
places<00:05:01.220> here's<00:05:02.220> another<00:05:02.370> layer<00:05:02.639> of<00:05:02.669> dirt<00:05:03.210> see
