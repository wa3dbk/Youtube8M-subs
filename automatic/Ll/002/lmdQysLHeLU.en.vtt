00:00:02.238 --> 00:00:02.718
Want a slap?

00:00:02.838 --> 00:00:03.218
Dog!

00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:04.102
Right or left?

00:00:04.244 --> 00:00:04.902
Lick my shoe!

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:05.679
Wanna eat my shoe?

00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:06.398
Why are you quiet?

00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:07.105
Idiot!

00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:08.038
Why are you quiet?

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:09.299
Shut up and go to sleep!

00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:11.095
Oh, shut up and speak.

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:11.822
You want a shoe?

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:12.318
Shut up!

00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:12.930
Fool!

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:13.445
Shut up!

00:00:13.587 --> 00:00:14.053
Get out!

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:14.529
Shut up!

00:00:15.183 --> 00:00:15.922
Ssshhhh!

00:00:16.638 --> 00:00:17.113
Shut up!

00:00:20.647 --> 00:00:21.328
SAMEER!!!

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:29.602
Only you can lose such
a big car, by God!

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.131
Why don't you get lost yourself
sometime, please!?

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:39.950
Isn't there some scheme...

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.861
...where we can pay 5 to 10,000
rupees as down payment now...

00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:43.761
...and then sell ourselves
for the rest of our lives...

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:44.758
...to repay the rest?

00:00:48.626 --> 00:00:50.183
I'm sure our baby got switched
in the hospital!

00:00:53.638 --> 00:00:54.615
Kid, I'm a Don!

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.648
Sir, whenever we need a stolen car,
we'll only come to you.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.227
In fact, we'll never buy
an original car, ever again!

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.008
Aren't you the same thief
who stole my car?!

00:01:05.217 --> 00:01:05.678
WHAT!!

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.308
Kid, where's my money?

00:01:10.953 --> 00:01:12.551
Do you see 'LOSER' written
on my forehead?

00:01:13.812 --> 00:01:15.185
Be it Tiger Woods or Bill Clinton...

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.322
...they've all been ruined by women...

00:01:17.526 --> 00:01:18.380
Are you love me?

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:19.521
Cause I'm really love you.

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:20.575
Shit... Jazzleen...

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:23.294
Dude, if you say "I love you" in such
bad English, what do you expect?

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:26.850
I'm the Shakira of Chandigarh!

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:28.187
It's Jazzleen!

00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:30.618
Come here.

00:01:34.158 --> 00:01:34.438
Hunh?

00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:35.045
HUNH!

00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:52.262
I realize now, why some animals
eat up their own kids.

00:01:57.096 --> 00:01:59.141
Dude, now what!
