 The rest was brought to the museum 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.880
 restoration process very slow because 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.070
 it's a very big material and I think if 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.360
 is to those guidelines currently I 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.100
 I belong to the national university of 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.750
 córdoba so I'm a bit away from 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.580
 that material and the glyptodont here 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.740

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.230
