00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
right there so you can get a nice

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.340 
right there so you can get a nice
rotation<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:18.000> foot<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.570> front<00:00:19.109> foot<00:00:19.230> it

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
rotation and this foot it front foot it

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.650 
rotation and this foot it front foot it
doesn't<00:00:19.680> really<00:00:19.800> matter<00:00:20.039> because<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.699> does<00:00:21.480> not

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
doesn't really matter because I does not

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.390 
doesn't really matter because I does not
do<00:00:21.869> anything<00:00:22.199> it's<00:00:22.470> just<00:00:22.529> lifting<00:00:23.010> off<00:00:23.160> and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
do anything it's just lifting off and

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.390 
do anything it's just lifting off and
then<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.640> rotate<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.990> get<00:00:25.680> right<00:00:25.859> there<00:00:26.070> and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
then you rotate so get right there and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.220 
then you rotate so get right there and
what<00:00:26.550> you're<00:00:26.670> going<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.090> do<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:28.109> can

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
what you're going on to do is you can

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.740 
what you're going on to do is you can
pop<00:00:28.619> but<00:00:29.310> that's<00:00:29.490> when<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.849> act<00:00:30.090> after<00:00:30.480> you

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
pop but that's when you act after you

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.280 
pop but that's when you act after you
get<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.279> the<00:00:32.279> initial<00:00:32.610> spin<00:00:32.910> down<00:00:33.090> first<00:00:33.510> so

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
get the the initial spin down first so

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.240 
get the the initial spin down first so
what<00:00:34.380> you're<00:00:34.500> going<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.739> do<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:34.950> you're<00:00:35.070> going

might<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> big<00:01:13.440> spin<00:01:14.000> there's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
might have with the big spin there's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.910 
might have with the big spin there's
quite<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.270> few<00:01:15.300> of<00:01:15.510> them<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.440> biggest<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:16.890> that

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
quite a few of them the biggest one that

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.010 
quite a few of them the biggest one that
I<00:01:17.070> had<00:01:17.280> when<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.640> first<00:01:17.729> learning<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.600> I

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
I had when I first learning it is I

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.140 
I had when I first learning it is I
under<00:01:19.440> rotate<00:01:19.800> it<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:19.950> I'd<00:01:20.070> rotate<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.550> 70

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
under rotate it and I'd rotate it to 70

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.480 
under rotate it and I'd rotate it to 70
which<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.110> one<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.840> then<00:01:24.840> I'd<00:01:25.100> land<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.280> that

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
which is one and then I'd land like that

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.999 
which is one and then I'd land like that
follow<00:01:26.820> my<00:01:26.940> face<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:28.350> way<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.530> compensate

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
follow my face and one way to compensate

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.450 
follow my face and one way to compensate
it<00:01:29.430> was<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.790> tub<00:01:30.210> ways<00:01:30.680> you<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.860> put<00:01:32.369> your

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
it was the tub ways you can put your

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.430 
it was the tub ways you can put your
foot<00:01:32.700> more<00:01:32.910> in<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> pocket<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.660> have<00:01:33.990> more<00:01:34.320> of

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
foot more in the pocket and have more of

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.310 
foot more in the pocket and have more of
a<00:01:34.880> getting<00:01:35.880> fling<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.240> back<00:01:36.270> more<00:01:36.690> get<00:01:37.050> more<00:01:37.229> of

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
a getting fling it back more get more of

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.820 
a getting fling it back more get more of
a<00:01:37.380> shuvit<00:01:37.740> rotation<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.369> there<00:01:39.560> another<00:01:40.560> way

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
a shuvit rotation in there another way

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.950 
a shuvit rotation in there another way
you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.160> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.580> find<00:01:41.940> that<00:01:42.030> more<00:01:42.330> I<00:01:42.570> mean

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you can you can find that more I mean

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.719 
you can you can find that more I mean
you<00:01:43.289> might<00:01:43.410> not<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.770> winding<00:01:44.160> up<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.580> might

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
you might not be winding up so you might

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.130 
you might not be winding up so you might
just<00:01:44.759> be<00:01:45.060> doing<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> chick<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:45.720> that's<00:01:46.020> just

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
just be doing the chick and that's just

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.130 
just be doing the chick and that's just
kind<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.399> do<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.030> if<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.750> wind<00:01:48.990> up

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
kind of do that for you if you wind up

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.020 
kind of do that for you if you wind up
you'll<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.530> lot<00:01:49.680> more<00:01:49.850> spinning<00:01:50.850> there

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
you'll get a lot more spinning there

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.660 
you'll get a lot more spinning there
with<00:01:51.270> your<00:01:51.420> body<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.960> board<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.670> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
with your body and the board and the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.420 
with your body and the board and the
next<00:01:54.330> one<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.259> rotate<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.950> land<00:01:56.160> like

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
next one is if you rotate and land like

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.850 
next one is if you rotate and land like
this<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:57.030> mean<00:01:57.690> you<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.960> always<00:01:58.289> compensate<00:01:58.950> by

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
this I mean you can always compensate by

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.309 
this I mean you can always compensate by
by<00:02:01.860> doing<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.429> pivot<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.420> we're<00:02:03.929> just<00:02:04.020> kind<00:02:04.259> of

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
by doing it pivot out we're just kind of

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.510 
by doing it pivot out we're just kind of
scraping<00:02:04.679> you<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:07.560> doesn't<00:02:07.890> look<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.099> good<00:02:08.280> but

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
scraping you it doesn't look as good but

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.390 
scraping you it doesn't look as good but
it<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.910> works

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.449 

another<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.299> I<00:02:12.360> had<00:02:12.540> was<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:13.459> over

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
another one that I had was a over

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.020 
another one that I had was a over

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
rotating the board which is easy fix

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.649 
rotating the board which is easy fix
just<00:02:18.150> don't<00:02:18.840> rotate<00:02:19.829> it<00:02:20.159> as<00:02:20.280> much<00:02:20.549> just<00:02:21.540> don't

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
there's one were you you get the whole

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.240
