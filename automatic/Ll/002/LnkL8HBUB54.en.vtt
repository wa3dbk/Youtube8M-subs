00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.660
 The highlight was Vedad Ibisevic when needed in other public 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.859
 Driving means of transport 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.129
 Percent until the 11th 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:15.500
 Of course, we collected that with a broad chest 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.929
 sample space 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.070
 as well 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.630
 and that's just such a small one 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.660
 she is safe there 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.449
 really quiet 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.159
 Julio Cesar slowly together 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.649
 Percent must sneak up like this 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.449
 what should happen to them 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.700
 but unfortunately not who that is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.940
 and what he hears from me 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.790
 4 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.690
 Dosa above are even softer 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.920
 for help 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.920
 record 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.490
 to stay in operation extras in that we seduced 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.310
 the back door 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.780
 has survived 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.970
 pretty good 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.970
 Percent 4 percent 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.200
 Sometimes it is enough to get out of the market 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.440
 he is not finished yet 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.840
 the cans and with a golden October 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.900
 not there 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.510
 Ing 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.570
 The next time I think Steam should close Steam if I am 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.790
 Games because that's not seen 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.829
 if he 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.780
 the multi-layered worry 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.780
 Hippler 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.380
 miller 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 Ulm 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.960
 that was the crucial game 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.020
 which basically 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.710
 damn that could easily take another hand if they did that 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.170
 now the end and that he himself must have riverbed from today 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.460
 Parliaments we are now in the ground just keep doing 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.010
 underneath that are certainly not the Finke next to Henkel want to stimulate 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.270
 So we read in ten years, just being a company here will be easy 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.439
 Pathogens Lehtinen 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.629
 the seven cent percent too 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.919
 what happened and do not give up 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.789
 it is hot on us 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.789
 he renounces 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:26.199
 Petric 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.709
 under the microscope how many you can 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.439
 where obviously embarrassing 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:38.749
 Century though 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.859
 Max 81 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:49.679
 rek 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.509
 asked 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.509
 H 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.420
 not that one 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.420
 2 8 percent 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.419
 Most contact Tel and sloshed over 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:18.669
 here is praised and you know you are waiting 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.379
 and that the dives still do matter so now the 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.189
 string 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:31.619
 0 percent reduces the 2 because you do not come around 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:35.049
 and now comes the next collection of over 320 dead 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.739
 is 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.199
 but just Truelsen not here it is dead too 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:45.539
 opening the tournament is realistic is always goal to achieve 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.519
 up to 40 percent off 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:54.969
 What is 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.159
 I hope that it works 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.420
 these goals reveal tips for the defensive man Adil our best man 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.360
 from the immediate delivery 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.469
 until Saturday morning at St 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:06.969
 TVP 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:08.489
 by a success 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.249
 the well-known investor finds 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:14.699
 Secretary of State is replete with light therapy Versace peppered team 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.699
 becomes 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.219
 carries in the future 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.580
 13 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.819
 The same applies to Lucerne 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:35.309
 goal of the season 

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:37.129
 somehow I have shit 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:39.270
 leading index 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.270
 Munich but to the future 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:05.259
 no one was injured 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.180
 nurses 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.889
 from the previous day tie 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.430
 continues to benefit 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.430
 is represented 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.009
 the carcasses would not exist 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:38.469
 if you think the law will leave you confused 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.879
 Goody's estate 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.520
 with it must 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.659
 In the medium term, continue to be whirling 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:45.620
 if we are with 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.499
 Brinkmann did 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:51.929
 the old broken Dresden 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:56.490
 three seriously injured partially 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.699
 There are not many 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.159
 the layer 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.159
 in future they will be for the airports

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:18.020
 we are already on the road only for a short time 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.129
 could not dismount 

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:22.500

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.840
 Petersburg are 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.380
