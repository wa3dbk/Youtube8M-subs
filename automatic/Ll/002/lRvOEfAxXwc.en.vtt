00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.310
 new 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.590
 dedicated real this time 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.940
 Samsung Galaxy Note 2 in this tutorial 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.760
 you will learn how to update 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.710
 your version of android so there are two 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.810
 ways to do either by the way 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.300
 directly from your smartphone either 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.910
 since the samsung kies software we are going 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.740
 see immediately the first method 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:34.520
 so you start your smartphone you 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.850
 go in the settings you scrolled 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.940
 down and you take the option to 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.000
 about the device then you go 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.940
 in software update then there is 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.970
 a little hidden tip of android 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.940
 version 4.1 could here you click 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.380
 several times above 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.750
 here you have a kind of little game 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.580
 which starts in application you can 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.020
 aulas we had so I do not see 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.630
 really useful but it's funny 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.689
 that's just a little secret kosher thing 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.150

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.039
