00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
first pregnancy so I kept a lot of that

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.480 
first pregnancy so I kept a lot of that
way

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
way

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.060 
way
it<00:02:12.490> was<00:02:12.640> horrible<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.930> anyways<00:02:14.530> we've<00:02:14.830> been

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
it was horrible so anyways we've been
