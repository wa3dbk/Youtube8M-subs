there's<00:00:18.070> a<00:00:18.130> lot<00:00:18.369> of<00:00:18.400> different<00:00:18.760> devices<00:00:18.880> out

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
there's a lot of different devices out

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.839 
there's a lot of different devices out
there<00:00:19.720> that<00:00:20.410> have<00:00:20.650> been<00:00:20.800> shown<00:00:21.099> to<00:00:21.340> work<00:00:21.369> for

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
there that have been shown to work for

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.800 
there that have been shown to work for
acne<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:24.189> what's<00:00:24.550> happened<00:00:25.000> is<00:00:25.090> we've<00:00:25.570> seen<00:00:25.750> a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
acne so what's happened is we've seen a

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.319 
acne so what's happened is we've seen a
lot<00:00:26.140> of<00:00:26.169> different<00:00:26.710> devices<00:00:27.060> over<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.150> last

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
lot of different devices over the last

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.630 
lot of different devices over the last
five<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.660> ten<00:00:28.989> years<00:00:29.259> come<00:00:29.680> out<00:00:29.859> that<00:00:30.430> have

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
five to ten years come out that have

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.670 
five to ten years come out that have
been<00:00:30.849> able<00:00:30.970> to<00:00:31.119> help<00:00:31.419> acne<00:00:31.840> in<00:00:31.930> some<00:00:32.169> way<00:00:32.349> and

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
been able to help acne in some way and

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.310 
been able to help acne in some way and
they<00:00:32.920> approach<00:00:33.489> it<00:00:33.519> slightly<00:00:33.970> differently

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
they approach it slightly differently

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.640 
they approach it slightly differently
the<00:00:35.320> trend<00:00:36.100> has<00:00:36.280> been<00:00:36.339> for<00:00:37.260> smaller<00:00:38.260> and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
the trend has been for smaller and

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.040 
the trend has been for smaller and
smaller<00:00:38.949> units<00:00:39.280> and<00:00:39.640> what<00:00:40.329> radiancy<00:00:40.839> has<00:00:40.960> been

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
smaller units and what radiancy has been

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.479 
smaller units and what radiancy has been
able<00:00:41.170> to<00:00:41.290> come<00:00:41.500> up<00:00:41.559> with<00:00:41.829> is<00:00:42.070> a<00:00:42.100> device<00:00:42.460> that's

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
able to come up with is a device that's

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.880 
able to come up with is a device that's
actually<00:00:43.300> going<00:00:43.930> to<00:00:44.019> be<00:00:44.110> able<00:00:44.199> to<00:00:44.440> be<00:00:44.530> used

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
actually going to be able to be used

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.240 
actually going to be able to be used
safely<00:00:45.220> by<00:00:45.730> consumers<00:00:46.449> themselves<00:00:47.040> to<00:00:48.040> treat

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
safely by consumers themselves to treat

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.119 
safely by consumers themselves to treat
their<00:00:48.400> acne<00:00:48.780> or<00:00:49.780> obviously<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:50.469> patient<00:00:50.859> can't

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
their acne or obviously a patient can't

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.520 
their acne or obviously a patient can't
take<00:00:51.550> a<00:00:51.579> laser<00:00:51.850> home<00:00:52.149> with<00:00:52.390> them<00:00:52.600> so<00:00:52.930> what

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
take a laser home with them so what

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.200 
take a laser home with them so what
we're<00:00:53.739> trying<00:00:53.949> to<00:00:54.070> do<00:00:54.190> is<00:00:54.309> get<00:00:54.460> these<00:00:54.640> devices

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
we're trying to do is get these devices

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.479 
we're trying to do is get these devices
smaller<00:00:55.449> and<00:00:55.719> smaller<00:00:55.989> keep<00:00:56.739> them<00:00:56.949> effective

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
smaller and smaller keep them effective

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.819 
smaller and smaller keep them effective
make<00:00:58.120> them<00:00:58.329> even<00:00:58.690> safer<00:00:59.170> and<00:00:59.350> allow<00:00:59.769> the

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
make them even safer and allow the

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.040 
make them even safer and allow the
patients<00:01:00.340> to<00:01:00.460> treat<00:01:00.670> themselves<00:01:00.879> at<00:01:01.300> home<00:01:01.570> and

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
patients to treat themselves at home and

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.750 
patients to treat themselves at home and
I<00:01:02.530> think<00:01:02.590> that's<00:01:02.859> what<00:01:03.039> we're<00:01:03.370> going<00:01:03.460> to<00:01:03.579> see

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
I think that's what we're going to see

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.880 
I think that's what we're going to see
in<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.030> future<00:01:04.360> as<00:01:04.509> time<00:01:04.809> goes<00:01:05.080> on<00:01:05.259> a<00:01:05.590> lot<00:01:05.860> of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
in the future as time goes on a lot of

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.320 
in the future as time goes on a lot of
the<00:01:06.190> things<00:01:06.429> that<00:01:06.520> we're<00:01:06.700> treating<00:01:06.880> right<00:01:07.179> now

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
the things that we're treating right now

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.719 
the things that we're treating right now
with<00:01:07.570> large<00:01:07.899> expensive<00:01:08.530> lasers<00:01:08.920> are<00:01:09.429> going<00:01:09.670> to

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
with large expensive lasers are going to

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.639 
with large expensive lasers are going to
be<00:01:09.820> treated<00:01:10.240> with<00:01:10.450> smaller<00:01:11.170> less<00:01:11.619> expensive

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
be treated with smaller less expensive

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.070 
be treated with smaller less expensive
more<00:01:12.580> portable<00:01:13.060> devices<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.690> hopefully

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
more portable devices that hopefully

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.430 
more portable devices that hopefully
people<00:01:14.380> can<00:01:14.560> be<00:01:14.920> taught<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.190> use<00:01:15.610> themselves

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
people can be taught to use themselves

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.570 
people can be taught to use themselves
so<00:01:17.440> it's<00:01:17.740> going<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:17.979> be<00:01:18.070> a<00:01:18.100> very<00:01:18.340> interesting

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
so it's going to be a very interesting

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.430 
so it's going to be a very interesting
time<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.119> next<00:01:19.330> five<00:01:19.509> to<00:01:19.720> ten<00:01:19.899> years<00:01:20.110> to<00:01:20.259> see

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
time the next five to ten years to see

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.300 
time the next five to ten years to see
where<00:01:20.649> this<00:01:20.860> develops<00:01:21.689> pretty<00:01:22.689> much<00:01:22.840> all

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
where this develops pretty much all

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.640 
where this develops pretty much all
dermatologists<00:01:24.310> are<00:01:24.490> treating<00:01:25.119> acne<00:01:25.650> mostly

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
dermatologists are treating acne mostly

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.340 
dermatologists are treating acne mostly
with<00:01:26.950> prescriptions<00:01:27.549> a<00:01:28.320> handful<00:01:29.320> of

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
with prescriptions a handful of

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.710 
with prescriptions a handful of
dermatologists<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:30.909> other<00:01:31.150> physicians<00:01:31.390> are

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
dermatologists and other physicians are

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.510 
dermatologists and other physicians are
now<00:01:31.869> treating<00:01:32.290> acne<00:01:32.470> with<00:01:32.829> the<00:01:33.009> lasers<00:01:33.369> and

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
now treating acne with the lasers and

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.060 
now treating acne with the lasers and
light<00:01:33.729> sources<00:01:34.149> I<00:01:34.450> think<00:01:35.409> with<00:01:35.560> these<00:01:35.740> home

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
light sources I think with these home

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.950 
light sources I think with these home
units<00:01:36.520> one<00:01:36.729> of<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:36.970> things<00:01:37.210> it<00:01:37.509> will<00:01:37.720> offer

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
units one of the things it will offer

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.649 
units one of the things it will offer
are<00:01:38.470> for<00:01:38.860> physicians<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:40.030> dermatologists

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
are for physicians and dermatologists

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.090 
are for physicians and dermatologists
who<00:01:40.810> treat<00:01:41.290> acne<00:01:41.439> but<00:01:41.829> don't<00:01:42.009> necessarily

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
who treat acne but don't necessarily

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.340 
who treat acne but don't necessarily
have<00:01:42.759> hundreds<00:01:43.240> of<00:01:43.299> thousand<00:01:43.689> dollar<00:01:43.810> lasers

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
have hundreds of thousand dollar lasers

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.950 
have hundreds of thousand dollar lasers
to<00:01:45.040> actually<00:01:45.460> be<00:01:45.579> able<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.909> prescribe<00:01:46.750> for

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
to actually be able to prescribe for

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.740 
to actually be able to prescribe for
their<00:01:47.320> patients<00:01:47.829> a<00:01:47.950> light<00:01:48.369> based<00:01:48.640> device<00:01:49.060> it

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
their patients a light based device it

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.990 
their patients a light based device it
sort<00:01:50.079> of<00:01:50.170> gives<00:01:50.380> them<00:01:50.590> one<00:01:50.979> more<00:01:51.189> tool<00:01:51.520> to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
sort of gives them one more tool to

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.109 
sort of gives them one more tool to
attack<00:01:52.360> acne<00:01:52.810> with<00:01:53.310> because<00:01:54.310> acne<00:01:54.670> sometimes

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
attack acne with because acne sometimes

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.850 
attack acne with because acne sometimes
for<00:01:55.600> some<00:01:55.719> patients<00:01:55.930> will<00:01:56.229> respond<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.649> one

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
for some patients will respond to one

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.319 
for some patients will respond to one
thing<00:01:57.070> other<00:01:57.340> patients<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:57.909> will<00:01:58.000> respond

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
thing other patients that will respond

00:01:58.329 --> 00:01:59.850 
thing other patients that will respond
to<00:01:58.420> something<00:01:58.630> completely<00:01:59.200> different<00:01:59.229> so

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
to something completely different so

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.529 
to something completely different so
it's<00:01:59.979> just<00:02:00.100> another<00:02:00.280> approach<00:02:00.969> to<00:02:01.000> attack

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
it's just another approach to attack

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.910 
it's just another approach to attack
acne

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
acne

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.359 
acne
I<00:02:04.479> think<00:02:05.479> most<00:02:05.810> physicians<00:02:06.259> right<00:02:06.770> now<00:02:06.950> when

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
I think most physicians right now when

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.600 
I think most physicians right now when
we<00:02:07.490> treat<00:02:07.729> acne<00:02:07.939> approached<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:09.170> from

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
we treat acne approached it from

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.130 
we treat acne approached it from
different<00:02:10.610> angles<00:02:10.849> all<00:02:11.150> at<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.360> same<00:02:11.540> time<00:02:11.599> my

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
different angles all at the same time my

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.650 
different angles all at the same time my
personal<00:02:12.650> approach<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:13.099> really<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.610> attack<00:02:14.510> it

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
personal approach is really to attack it

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.360 
personal approach is really to attack it
from<00:02:14.690> as<00:02:14.900> many<00:02:15.020> angles<00:02:15.200> as<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.590> can<00:02:15.830> at<00:02:15.950> first<00:02:15.980> to

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
from as many angles as I can at first to

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.280 
from as many angles as I can at first to
clear<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.790> acne<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.330> then<00:02:17.540> go<00:02:18.050> ahead<00:02:18.140> and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
clear the acne and then go ahead and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.990 
clear the acne and then go ahead and
start<00:02:18.620> removing<00:02:18.800> things<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.610> may<00:02:19.790> not<00:02:19.940> be

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
start removing things that may not be

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.540 
start removing things that may not be
necessary<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.930> what<00:02:21.709> this<00:02:21.860> device<00:02:22.160> will<00:02:22.370> do

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
necessary and what this device will do

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.449 
necessary and what this device will do
is<00:02:22.760> allow<00:02:22.910> one<00:02:23.810> more<00:02:24.440> approach<00:02:25.010> from<00:02:25.340> a

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
is allow one more approach from a

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.220 
is allow one more approach from a
different<00:02:25.640> angle<00:02:25.940> at<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.360> acne<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.810> try<00:02:27.050> and

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
different angle at the acne to try and

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.320 
different angle at the acne to try and
attack<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.340> get<00:02:28.459> rid<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:29.000> then

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
attack it and get rid of it and then

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.229 
attack it and get rid of it and then
start<00:02:29.750> pulling<00:02:30.170> other<00:02:30.319> things<00:02:30.709> off<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.310> lot<00:02:32.120> of

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
start pulling other things off a lot of

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.490 
start pulling other things off a lot of
patients<00:02:32.569> don't<00:02:32.690> like<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:32.989> be<00:02:33.080> on<00:02:33.110> antibiotics

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
patients don't like to be on antibiotics

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.979 
patients don't like to be on antibiotics
for<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:34.040> long<00:02:34.220> period<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.730> time<00:02:34.900> there<00:02:35.900> are

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
for a long period of time there are

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.449 
for a long period of time there are
different<00:02:36.319> associated<00:02:36.800> problems<00:02:37.069> with<00:02:37.370> the

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
different associated problems with the

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.790 
different associated problems with the
antibiotics<00:02:38.030> there's<00:02:38.330> also<00:02:38.510> problems<00:02:39.050> that

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
antibiotics there's also problems that

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.350 
antibiotics there's also problems that
some<00:02:40.010> patients<00:02:40.130> have<00:02:40.459> even<00:02:40.730> with<00:02:40.880> topicals

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
some patients have even with topicals

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.090 
some patients have even with topicals
just<00:02:41.569> being<00:02:41.750> too<00:02:41.900> irritating<00:02:42.500> for<00:02:42.650> their<00:02:42.799> skin

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
just being too irritating for their skin

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.910 
just being too irritating for their skin
so<00:02:43.610> this<00:02:43.730> device<00:02:44.150> may<00:02:44.420> allow<00:02:44.690> us<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.959> pull<00:02:45.560> some

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
so this device may allow us to pull some

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.680 
so this device may allow us to pull some
of<00:02:45.950> those<00:02:46.100> other<00:02:46.340> more<00:02:46.790> irritating<00:02:47.450> and

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
of those other more irritating and

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.460 
of those other more irritating and
problematic<00:02:48.500> treatments<00:02:49.100> off<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.819> patients

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.280 

a<00:02:52.610> lot<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.640> practices<00:02:54.300> don't<00:02:54.660> have<00:02:54.960> these

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
a lot of practices don't have these

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.260 
a lot of practices don't have these
hundred-thousand-dollar<00:02:56.130> lasers<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:57.120> the

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
hundred-thousand-dollar lasers in the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.050 
hundred-thousand-dollar lasers in the
office<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.960> use<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.130> what<00:02:59.670> this<00:02:59.790> home

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
office to use and so what this home

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.030 
office to use and so what this home
device<00:03:00.420> will<00:03:00.720> do<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:01.080> actually<00:03:01.230> allow<00:03:01.680> those

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
device will do is actually allow those

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.790 
device will do is actually allow those
practices<00:03:02.670> in<00:03:02.790> particular<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:04.110> be<00:03:04.530> able<00:03:04.620> to

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
practices in particular to be able to

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.980 
practices in particular to be able to
prescribe<00:03:05.070> light<00:03:05.580> based<00:03:05.850> therapy<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.780> give

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
prescribe light based therapy to give

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.010 
prescribe light based therapy to give
another<00:03:07.320> prong<00:03:07.740> in<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.580> attack<00:03:08.910> against<00:03:09.330> acne

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.570 

there's<00:03:13.020> certainly<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.349> convenience<00:03:13.950> also<00:03:14.310> for

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
there's certainly a convenience also for

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.520 
there's certainly a convenience also for
our<00:03:14.670> patients<00:03:15.240> to<00:03:15.420> have<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.660> device<00:03:16.110> where<00:03:16.380> they

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
our patients to have a device where they

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.410 
our patients to have a device where they
can<00:03:16.709> use<00:03:16.890> at<00:03:17.040> home<00:03:17.069> so<00:03:17.580> they<00:03:17.700> don't<00:03:17.880> have<00:03:18.150> to

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
can use at home so they don't have to

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.420 
can use at home so they don't have to
make<00:03:19.020> that<00:03:19.200> monthly<00:03:19.709> trip<00:03:20.069> into<00:03:20.400> the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
make that monthly trip into the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.210 
make that monthly trip into the
physician's<00:03:21.150> office<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:22.500> sit<00:03:22.800> in<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:22.950> waiting

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
physician's office and sit in a waiting

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.460 
physician's office and sit in a waiting
room<00:03:23.250> for<00:03:23.640> 10<00:03:24.180> minutes<00:03:24.540> -<00:03:24.720> sometimes<00:03:25.170> an<00:03:25.319> hour

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
room for 10 minutes - sometimes an hour

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.190 
room for 10 minutes - sometimes an hour
to<00:03:26.370> be<00:03:26.489> treated<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:27.780> think<00:03:27.870> they're<00:03:28.110> gonna

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
to be treated so I think they're gonna

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.570 
to be treated so I think they're gonna
appreciate<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:30.860> but<00:03:31.860> our<00:03:31.980> whole<00:03:32.160> goal<00:03:32.370> is

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
appreciate that but our whole goal is

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.449 
appreciate that but our whole goal is
physicians<00:03:33.090> is<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.330> help<00:03:33.959> people<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.560> when

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
physicians is to help people and when

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.890 
physicians is to help people and when
we're<00:03:35.580> talking<00:03:35.700> about<00:03:35.880> acne<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:36.600> can<00:03:36.780> be<00:03:36.870> a

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
we're talking about acne this can be a

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.370 
we're talking about acne this can be a
real<00:03:37.730> psychosocial<00:03:38.730> problem<00:03:39.450> for<00:03:39.810> the

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
real psychosocial problem for the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.979 
real psychosocial problem for the
adolescents<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.130> even<00:03:41.310> adults<00:03:41.700> with<00:03:41.849> acne<00:03:42.239> so

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
adolescents and even adults with acne so

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.750 
adolescents and even adults with acne so
we<00:03:43.110> really<00:03:43.410> want<00:03:43.590> these<00:03:43.709> patients<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.190> clear

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
we really want these patients to clear

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.550 
we really want these patients to clear
and<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:44.970> think<00:03:45.209> what<00:03:45.390> this<00:03:45.660> device<00:03:45.989> is<00:03:46.170> going<00:03:46.500> to

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
and I think what this device is going to

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.430 
and I think what this device is going to
do<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:47.010> give<00:03:47.220> us<00:03:47.370> one<00:03:47.610> more<00:03:47.819> way<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.230> help<00:03:49.230> them

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
do is give us one more way to help them

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.229 
do is give us one more way to help them
and<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:50.190> may<00:03:50.340> be<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.700> one<00:03:50.819> thing<00:03:51.060> that

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
and it may be the one thing that

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.330 
and it may be the one thing that
actually<00:03:51.390> really<00:03:51.870> breaks<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.950> certain

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
actually really breaks that certain

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.250 
actually really breaks that certain
particular<00:03:53.610> patient<00:03:54.269> through<00:03:54.569> and<00:03:54.810> clears

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
particular patient through and clears

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.820 
particular patient through and clears
their<00:03:55.500> acne

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
their acne

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.020 
their acne
you<00:03:58.830> know<00:03:58.950> it's<00:03:59.280> interesting<00:03:59.550> if<00:03:59.850> we've

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
you know it's interesting if we've

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.960 
you know it's interesting if we've
looked<00:04:00.270> at<00:04:00.420> computers<00:04:01.140> as<00:04:01.920> a<00:04:01.980> model<00:04:02.580> over<00:04:02.880> the

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
looked at computers as a model over the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.300 
looked at computers as a model over the
years<00:04:03.330> you<00:04:03.510> know<00:04:03.540> at<00:04:03.990> first<00:04:04.380> in<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.709> 60s<00:04:05.190> they

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
years you know at first in the 60s they

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.460 
years you know at first in the 60s they
were<00:04:05.340> these<00:04:05.550> huge<00:04:06.000> computers<00:04:06.630> that<00:04:07.110> did<00:04:07.319> very

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
were these huge computers that did very

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.830 
were these huge computers that did very
little<00:04:07.590> by<00:04:07.950> today's<00:04:08.280> standards<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.030> every

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
little by today's standards and every

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.260 
little by today's standards and every
few<00:04:10.140> years<00:04:10.440> they<00:04:10.680> got<00:04:10.830> smaller<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:12.030> more

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
few years they got smaller and more

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.990 
few years they got smaller and more
efficient<00:04:12.810> more<00:04:13.080> effective<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:13.920> it<00:04:14.640> just

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
efficient more effective and it just

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.909 
efficient more effective and it just
kept<00:04:15.270> happening<00:04:15.360> and<00:04:15.780> kept<00:04:15.930> marching<00:04:16.140> on<00:04:16.500> if

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
kept happening and kept marching on if

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.130 
kept happening and kept marching on if
we<00:04:17.130> look<00:04:17.340> at<00:04:17.430> lasers<00:04:17.880> it's<00:04:18.090> very<00:04:18.359> similar<00:04:18.690> back

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
we look at lasers it's very similar back

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.580 
we look at lasers it's very similar back
in<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.680> late<00:04:20.549> 70s<00:04:21.180> early<00:04:21.359> 80s<00:04:21.570> we<00:04:22.169> had<00:04:22.200> these

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
in the late 70s early 80s we had these

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.340 
in the late 70s early 80s we had these
gigantic<00:04:23.520> lasers<00:04:24.030> that<00:04:24.270> by<00:04:24.780> today's

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
gigantic lasers that by today's

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.620 
gigantic lasers that by today's
standards<00:04:25.800> did<00:04:26.010> very<00:04:26.220> little<00:04:26.550> but<00:04:27.210> as<00:04:27.330> time

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
standards did very little but as time

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.390 
standards did very little but as time
went<00:04:27.810> on<00:04:27.900> they<00:04:28.110> got<00:04:28.230> smaller<00:04:28.650> they<00:04:28.980> got<00:04:29.130> more

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
went on they got smaller they got more

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.060 
went on they got smaller they got more
effective<00:04:29.940> they<00:04:30.419> got<00:04:30.660> safer<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:31.560> what<00:04:31.919> we've

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
effective they got safer and what we've

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.890 
effective they got safer and what we've
seen<00:04:32.250> radiancy<00:04:32.820> do<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:33.150> actually<00:04:33.600> sort<00:04:33.840> of

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
seen radiancy do is actually sort of

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.280 
seen radiancy do is actually sort of
push<00:04:34.140> that<00:04:34.380> ahead<00:04:34.740> even<00:04:35.400> more<00:04:35.840> towards<00:04:36.840> the

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
push that ahead even more towards the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.860 
push that ahead even more towards the
home<00:04:37.919> usage<00:04:38.580> front<00:04:39.000> which<00:04:39.240> i<00:04:39.390> think<00:04:39.600> is<00:04:39.720> sort

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
home usage front which i think is sort

home usage front which i think is sort

of the next frontier and Radiance he's
been<00:04:43.320> very<00:04:43.500> innovative<00:04:43.890> and<00:04:44.610> ahead<00:04:45.060> of<00:04:45.090> the
