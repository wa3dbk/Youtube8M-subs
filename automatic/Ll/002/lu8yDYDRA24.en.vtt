them<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:01.199> they<00:01:01.230> needed<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.710> move<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
them that they needed to move on and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.940 
you're also talking about a guy that is
totally<00:01:39.570> deficient<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> defensive<00:01:40.829> end

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
totally deficient on the defensive end

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.310 
totally deficient on the defensive end
of<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.189> ball<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.000> Bulls<00:01:42.210> team<00:01:42.720> defense<00:01:43.170> as

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
of the ball so the Bulls team defense as

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.690 
of the ball so the Bulls team defense as
a<00:01:43.350> whole<00:01:43.439> would<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.890> suffered<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> result

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
a whole would have suffered as a result

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.429 
a whole would have suffered as a result
because<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.570> would<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.930> mask

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
because they would have to mask

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.710 
because they would have to mask
Carmelo's<00:01:47.070> defensive<00:01:47.579> deficiencies<00:01:48.180> and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
Carmelo's defensive deficiencies and

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.850 
Carmelo's defensive deficiencies and
some<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.110> will<00:01:49.170> sit<00:01:49.380> there<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.560> say<00:01:49.680> well

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
some of you will sit there and say well

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.260 
some of you will sit there and say well
Thibodeau<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.399> great<00:01:50.610> at<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.850> yeah<00:01:51.090> he's

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
Thibodeau is great at that yeah he's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.120 
Thibodeau is great at that yeah he's
great<00:01:51.450> at<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.750> but<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.290> he<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.680> great<00:01:53.009> at

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
great at that but is he that great at

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.370 
great at that but is he that great at
that<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.520> ultimately<00:01:53.939> would<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.720> offensive

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
that and ultimately would that offensive

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.709 
that and ultimately would that offensive
punch<00:01:55.579> negated<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> defensive<00:01:57.360> deficiencies

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
punch negated the defensive deficiencies

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.660 
punch negated the defensive deficiencies
and<00:01:58.290> I'm<00:01:58.469> not<00:01:58.680> sure<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.250> would<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.520> to

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and I'm not sure that it would have to

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.039 
and I'm not sure that it would have to
the<00:01:59.790> point<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> Bulls<00:02:00.509> could<00:02:00.719> consider

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
the point that the Bulls could consider

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.050 
the point that the Bulls could consider
themselves<00:02:01.290> championship<00:02:02.040> contenders<00:02:02.549> but

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
themselves championship contenders but

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.580 
themselves championship contenders but
what<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.299> get<00:02:03.450> with<00:02:03.570> Pau<00:02:03.780> Gasol<00:02:04.200> now<00:02:04.560> I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
what do you get with Pau Gasol now I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.620 
what do you get with Pau Gasol now I
haven't<00:02:04.890> seen<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.520> financial<00:02:06.060> particulars

haven't seen the financial particulars

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.139 
haven't seen the financial particulars
but<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:07.469> i<00:02:07.619> had<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:08.039> guess<00:02:08.069> at<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.700> point<00:02:08.819> i

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
but if i had to guess at this point i

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.940 
but if i had to guess at this point i
would<00:02:09.360> assume<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.810> would<00:02:10.020> be<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> two<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.530> three

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
would assume it would be a two to three
