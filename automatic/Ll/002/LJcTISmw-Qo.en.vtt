to see these long pleats we do get this

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.370 
to see these long pleats we do get this
manual<00:01:18.119> sorting<00:01:18.450> although<00:01:18.929> it's<00:01:19.049> not<00:01:19.109> really

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
buying it for the pieces and then just

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.020 
buying it for the pieces and then just
doing<00:01:45.090> them<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.479> your<00:01:45.689> child<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.249> then<00:01:47.549> I'm

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
doing them to your child and then I'm

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.449 
doing them to your child and then I'm
playing<00:01:48.539> with<00:01:48.719> them<00:01:48.929> just<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.289> that<00:01:49.530> but

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.440 
and by the way guys the only thing that
is<00:02:43.080> compatible<00:02:43.530> from<00:02:43.980> what<00:02:44.099> I<00:02:44.129> believe<00:02:44.610> with

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
is compatible from what I believe with

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.869 
is compatible from what I believe with
the<00:02:45.720> actual<00:02:46.140> Lego<00:02:46.470> system<00:02:46.799> you<00:02:47.280> know<00:02:47.400> they<00:02:47.670> can

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
the actual Lego system you know they can

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.339 
the actual Lego system you know they can
go<00:02:47.970> on<00:02:48.060> Lego<00:02:48.209> base<00:02:48.420> plates<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.870> such<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.319> the

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
go on Lego base plates and such is the

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.100 
go on Lego base plates and such is the
actual<00:02:49.680> bricks<00:02:50.180> when<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.209> say<00:02:51.480> bricks<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.930> am

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
actual bricks when I say bricks I am

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.080 
actual bricks when I say bricks I am
including<00:02:52.440> these<00:02:52.860> which<00:02:53.400> are<00:02:53.549> very<00:02:53.790> nice

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
including these which are very nice

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.839 
including these which are very nice
pieces<00:02:54.420> don't<00:02:55.230> write<00:02:55.620> get<00:02:55.890> those<00:02:56.400> molds<00:02:56.790> and

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
pieces don't write get those molds and

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.509 
pieces don't write get those molds and
Lego<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.209> don't<00:02:57.390> think<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.890> very<00:02:59.099> nice<00:02:59.280> there

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
Lego I don't think so very nice there

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.380 
Lego I don't think so very nice there
and<00:03:02.390> again<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.420> do<00:03:03.810> get<00:03:04.190> this<00:03:05.190> very<00:03:06.000> nice

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
fence pieces and you do get this like I

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.520 
fence pieces and you do get this like I
show<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:11.970> guys<00:03:12.120> in<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.599> minifigure<00:03:13.079> close<00:03:13.290> up

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
got this little piece right there which

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.030 
got this little piece right there which
will<00:03:44.370> just<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:45.209> can<00:03:45.329> stick<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:45.840> brick<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.319> one

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
will just you can stick a brick to one

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.370 
will just you can stick a brick to one
looks<00:03:47.190> like<00:03:47.359> so<00:03:48.359> very<00:03:48.569> nice<00:03:48.750> there<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.200> then

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
looks like so very nice there and then

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.990 
looks like so very nice there and then
this<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.709> two<00:03:49.889> separate<00:03:50.250> pieces<00:03:50.430> actually<00:03:50.700> if

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
this is two separate pieces actually if

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.890 
this is two separate pieces actually if
you<00:03:51.180> want<00:03:51.389> it<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:52.220> step<00:03:53.220> right<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:54.049> then<00:03:56.900> you

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
you want it to step right that then you

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.099 
you want it to step right that then you
again<00:03:58.349> may<00:03:58.859> think<00:03:59.130> does<00:03:59.310> fit<00:03:59.639> on<00:03:59.940> that<00:04:00.019> so<00:04:01.019> you

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
again may think does fit on that so you

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.229 
again may think does fit on that so you
just<00:04:01.139> put<00:04:01.470> like<00:04:01.859> that<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.459> then<00:04:02.579> this<00:04:02.910> does

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
just put like that and then this does

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.280 
just put like that and then this does
have<00:04:03.389> a<00:04:03.419> connection<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:04.019> if<00:04:04.079> you<00:04:04.169> have<00:04:04.290> another

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
have a connection so if you have another

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.289 
have a connection so if you have another
vehicle<00:04:07.290> our<00:04:07.560> duplo<00:04:07.919> vehicle<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.910> has<00:04:09.060> on

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
vehicle our duplo vehicle that has on

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.720 
vehicle our duplo vehicle that has on
the<00:04:10.169> opposite<00:04:10.799> connection<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.430> can<00:04:11.579> just

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
the opposite connection you can just

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.140 
the opposite connection you can just
connect<00:04:12.000> them<00:04:12.120> together<00:04:13.160> so<00:04:14.160> very<00:04:14.669> cool<00:04:14.940> there

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
connect them together so very cool there

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.870 
connect them together so very cool there
and<00:04:16.370> so<00:04:18.500> another<00:04:19.500> thing<00:04:19.650> though<00:04:20.010> guys<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.489> that

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
and so another thing though guys is that

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.980 
and so another thing though guys is that
these<00:04:22.550> fun<00:04:23.550> pieces<00:04:23.789> I<00:04:24.120> don't<00:04:24.300> think<00:04:24.360> kids<00:04:24.870> I

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
these fun pieces I don't think kids I
