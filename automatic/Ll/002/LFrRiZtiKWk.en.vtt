plays out on the Snapdragon 805 which is
inside<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:14.130> little<00:00:14.370> phone<00:00:14.670> over

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
inside of the this little phone over

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.630 
inside of the this little phone over
here<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.150> note<00:00:15.420> 4<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:16.770> not<00:00:16.859> taking<00:00:16.949> 805

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
here it is note 4 so it's not taking 805

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.990 
here it is note 4 so it's not taking 805
to<00:00:17.880> win<00:00:18.029> 7<00:00:18.539> gigahertz<00:00:18.779> quad-core<00:00:19.760> so<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> little

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
to win 7 gigahertz quad-core so a little

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.620 
to win 7 gigahertz quad-core so a little
bit<00:00:21.119> higher<00:00:21.180> than<00:00:21.600> 2.5<00:00:21.930> gigahertz<00:00:22.640> and<00:00:23.640> you

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
bit higher than 2.5 gigahertz and you

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.880 
bit higher than 2.5 gigahertz and you
can<00:00:24.750> also<00:00:24.869> see<00:00:25.519> when<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.730> go<00:00:27.090> into<00:00:29.029> man<00:00:30.029> go<00:00:30.330> into

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
can also see when I go into man go into

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.620 
can also see when I go into man go into
the<00:00:31.890> display<00:00:32.279> here<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.059> see<00:00:33.210> everything

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the display here you can see everything

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:56.570 
the display here you can see everything
is<00:00:33.690> maxed<00:00:34.050> out

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.200 

No

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
No

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.940 
No
let's<00:00:59.930> get<00:01:00.110> inside<00:01:00.500> of<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.680> car<00:01:00.890> here<00:01:02.950> obviously

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
let's get inside of a car here obviously

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.970 
let's get inside of a car here obviously
they<00:01:04.130> don't<00:01:04.489> update<00:01:05.210> every<00:01:06.170> game<00:01:06.410> to<00:01:06.740> the

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
they don't update every game to the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.640 
they don't update every game to the
likeliness<00:01:07.520> performance<00:01:08.420> or<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:09.230> the<00:01:09.350> latest

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
likeliness performance or to the latest

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.510 
likeliness performance or to the latest
hardware<00:01:10.100> especially<00:01:10.940> not<00:01:11.090> for<00:01:11.300> Android<00:01:11.750> so

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
hardware especially not for Android so

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.950 
hardware especially not for Android so
that<00:01:13.520> could<00:01:13.700> be<00:01:13.760> something<00:01:13.970> that's<00:01:14.240> good<00:01:14.810> to

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
that could be something that's good to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.260 
that could be something that's good to
know

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
know

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.750 
know
but<00:01:17.740> definitely<00:01:18.740> of<00:01:18.800> course<00:01:18.830> play<00:01:19.340> ball<00:01:19.550> here

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
but definitely of course play ball here

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.020 
but definitely of course play ball here
on<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:20.030> highest<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:21.490> very<00:01:22.490> good<00:01:22.760> performance

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
on the highest and very good performance

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.610 
on the highest and very good performance
sometimes<00:01:23.360> when<00:01:23.840> you<00:01:23.930> don't<00:01:24.050> have<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:24.440> many

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
sometimes when you don't have that many

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
sometimes when you don't have that many
objects<00:01:25.580> in<00:01:26.120> front<00:01:26.420> like<00:01:27.080> me<00:01:27.560> don't<00:01:27.740> have<00:01:27.890> that

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
objects in front like me don't have that

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.150 
objects in front like me don't have that
many<00:01:28.820> cars<00:01:29.300> or<00:01:30.110> anything<00:01:30.350> like<00:01:30.620> that<00:01:30.680> the

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
many cars or anything like that the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.420 
many cars or anything like that the
performance<00:01:31.610> is<00:01:31.700> really<00:01:32.030> really<00:01:32.330> good<00:01:33.070> but<00:01:34.070> I

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
performance is really really good but I

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.859 
performance is really really good but I
can<00:01:34.820> have<00:01:34.910> an<00:01:35.000> appeal<00:01:35.270> that<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.479> frame<00:01:35.690> rate

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
can have an appeal that the frame rate

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.510 
can have an appeal that the frame rate
is<00:01:36.050> going<00:01:36.229> down<00:01:36.350> here<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:36.770> little<00:01:36.950> bit<00:01:37.070> when<00:01:37.369> you

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
is going down here a little bit when you

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.190 
is going down here a little bit when you
are<00:01:40.000> when<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.240> have<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.420> lot<00:01:41.600> of<00:01:41.690> objects<00:01:42.050> in

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
are when you have a lot of objects in

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.900 
are when you have a lot of objects in
front<00:01:44.770> but<00:01:45.770> let's<00:01:46.010> see<00:01:46.250> over<00:01:46.430> here<00:01:46.460> it's

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
front but let's see over here it's

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.520 
front but let's see over here it's
really<00:01:47.300> really<00:01:47.510> good<00:01:47.630> performance<00:01:47.840> on<00:01:48.410> the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
really really good performance on the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.310 
really really good performance on the
highest<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.630> possible<00:01:50.630> graphics<00:01:52.869> Wow<00:01:53.930> it's

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
highest and possible graphics Wow it's

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.760 
highest and possible graphics Wow it's
weird

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
weird

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.710 
weird
people<00:01:55.430> shouldn't<00:01:55.670> be<00:01:55.820> able<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:56.119> stop<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.390> car

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
people shouldn't be able to stop a car

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.870 
people shouldn't be able to stop a car
like<00:01:56.900> this<00:01:57.369> it<00:01:58.369> feels<00:01:58.729> like<00:02:00.520> see<00:02:01.520> if<00:02:01.610> you<00:02:01.729> can

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
like this it feels like see if you can

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:14.920 
like this it feels like see if you can
kill<00:02:02.090> someone<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:13.220> also<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.360> performance<00:02:14.570> is

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
kill someone and also the performance is

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.509 
kill someone and also the performance is
really<00:02:15.170> really<00:02:15.470> good<00:02:15.650> here<00:02:15.980> when<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.370> don't

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
really really good here when you don't

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.479 
really really good here when you don't
have<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.120> when<00:02:17.510> you're<00:02:17.720> not<00:02:17.930> in<00:02:17.989> a<00:02:18.230> car<00:02:18.560> and

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
have and when you're not in a car and

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.570 
have and when you're not in a car and
you<00:02:19.730> run<00:02:20.000> around<00:02:20.150> like<00:02:20.390> this<00:02:20.630> for<00:02:21.580> nice

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
you run around like this for nice

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.280 
you run around like this for nice
sometimes<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.600> can<00:02:23.750> see<00:02:23.900> there's<00:02:24.110> some

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
sometimes you can see there's some

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.340 
sometimes you can see there's some
pretty<00:02:24.470> intense<00:02:24.769> frame<00:02:25.070> drops<00:02:25.310> though<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:27.260> you

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
pretty intense frame drops though so you

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.600 
pretty intense frame drops though so you
probably<00:02:27.560> don't<00:02:27.800> want<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.160> play<00:02:28.400> on<00:02:28.459> the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
probably don't want to play on the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:36.910 
probably don't want to play on the
highest<00:02:28.880> possible<00:02:29.510> graphics<00:02:34.930> Wow<00:02:35.930> very<00:02:36.530> bad

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
highest possible graphics Wow very bad

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.479 
highest possible graphics Wow very bad
