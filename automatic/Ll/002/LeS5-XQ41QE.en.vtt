in<00:05:54.620> contact<00:05:55.310> with<00:05:55.520> electrical<00:05:56.120> boxes<00:05:56.570> we

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
in contact with electrical boxes we

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:58.960 
in contact with electrical boxes we
didn't<00:05:57.530> know<00:05:57.650> if<00:05:57.979> we<00:05:58.009> were<00:05:58.190> dealing<00:05:58.400> with<00:05:58.580> live

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
didn't know if we were dealing with live

didn't know if we were dealing with live
wires<00:05:59.410> or<00:06:00.410> not<00:06:00.979> so<00:06:01.430> crews<00:06:02.030> haven't<00:06:02.389> really

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:31.119 
our time to make sure that we were going
to<00:06:29.239> jeopardize<00:06:29.479> the<00:06:30.019> rescuers<00:06:30.619> going<00:06:30.979> in

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:31.129 
to jeopardize the rescuers going in

there by coming to contact with of the
water<00:06:34.190> that<00:06:34.490> could<00:06:34.669> be<00:06:34.789> electrically<00:06:35.180> charged

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
water that could be electrically charged

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.700 
water that could be electrically charged
or<00:06:36.169> the<00:06:36.319> boxes<00:06:36.800> so<00:06:37.810> by<00:06:38.810> making<00:06:38.960> a<00:06:39.199> good<00:06:39.410> scene

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
or the boxes so by making a good scene

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.309 
or the boxes so by making a good scene
assessment<00:06:40.370> certainly<00:06:41.090> the<00:06:41.300> area<00:06:41.990> several

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 
assessment certainly the area several

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.180 
assessment certainly the area several
times<00:06:42.710> crews<00:06:43.639> determined<00:06:44.360> that<00:06:44.539> the

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
times crews determined that the

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.650 
times crews determined that the
electrical<00:06:46.190> wasn't<00:06:46.669> an<00:06:46.759> issue<00:06:46.880> the<00:06:47.240> boxes

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
electrical wasn't an issue the boxes

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.719 
electrical wasn't an issue the boxes
were<00:06:47.720> knocked<00:06:48.470> off<00:06:48.740> but<00:06:49.550> did

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729 
were knocked off but did

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.149 
were knocked off but did
rule<00:06:51.029> wasn't<00:06:51.509> an<00:06:51.599> issue<00:06:51.749> so<00:06:52.620> first

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:53.159 
rule wasn't an issue so first

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:54.860 
rule wasn't an issue so first
consideration<00:06:53.819> was<00:06:53.909> to<00:06:53.999> get<00:06:54.150> somebody<00:06:54.569> in<00:06:54.719> the

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
consideration was to get somebody in the

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.920 
consideration was to get somebody in the
car<00:06:55.110> we<00:06:55.259> got<00:06:55.349> a<00:06:55.409> firefighter<00:06:56.009> in<00:06:56.249> the<00:06:56.339> car

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
car we got a firefighter in the car

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.629 
car we got a firefighter in the car
doing<00:06:57.930> as<00:06:58.169> he<00:06:58.499> was<00:06:58.770> going<00:06:58.979> to<00:06:59.069> assess<00:06:59.339> with<00:06:59.550> the

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 
doing as he was going to assess with the

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:02.360 
doing as he was going to assess with the
best<00:06:59.849> he<00:06:59.999> can<00:07:00.270> but<00:07:00.839> with<00:07:01.020> all<00:07:01.169> that<00:07:01.199> water<00:07:01.620> it

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
best he can but with all that water it

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.489 
best he can but with all that water it
was<00:07:02.520> really<00:07:02.759> loud<00:07:03.029> in<00:07:03.300> there<00:07:03.449> so<00:07:04.020> it<00:07:04.110> took<00:07:04.259> us<00:07:04.469> a

00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:04.499 
was really loud in there so it took us a

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:06.529 
was really loud in there so it took us a
long<00:07:04.770> time<00:07:04.830> to<00:07:05.069> get<00:07:05.460> the<00:07:05.669> information<00:07:05.849> back<00:07:06.330> to

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:06.539 
long time to get the information back to

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:11.329 
long time to get the information back to
him<00:07:07.819> by<00:07:08.819> that<00:07:08.849> time<00:07:09.270> our<00:07:09.779> option<00:07:10.680> was<00:07:10.889> the<00:07:11.159> best

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:11.339 
him by that time our option was the best

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:13.159 
him by that time our option was the best
option<00:07:11.819> was<00:07:12.059> to<00:07:12.120> pull<00:07:12.509> the<00:07:12.539> car<00:07:12.839> off<00:07:13.020> the

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:13.169 
option was to pull the car off the

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:16.129 
option was to pull the car off the
hydrant<00:07:13.620> so<00:07:13.830> our<00:07:13.979> rescue<00:07:14.490> for<00:07:14.900> more<00:07:15.900> heavy

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:16.139 
hydrant so our rescue for more heavy

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:18.920 
hydrant so our rescue for more heavy
rescue<00:07:16.439> unit<00:07:17.009> has<00:07:17.370> a<00:07:17.400> jack<00:07:17.939> on<00:07:18.300> it<00:07:18.569> and<00:07:18.779> they

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:20.669 
were able to for work to do our heavy

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:22.760 
were able to for work to do our heavy
rescue<00:07:20.969> unit<00:07:21.449> because<00:07:21.960> their<00:07:22.110> big<00:07:22.289> open<00:07:22.589> fight

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
rescue unit because their big open fight

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.170 
rescue unit because their big open fight
the<00:07:23.309> Jack<00:07:23.520> Paar

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:25.180 
the Jack Paar

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.900 
the Jack Paar
our<00:07:25.690> rescue<00:07:26.169> poor<00:07:26.440> has<00:07:26.710> a<00:07:26.740> winch<00:07:27.070> on<00:07:27.340> it<00:07:27.370> so<00:07:27.759> we

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:27.910 
our rescue poor has a winch on it so we

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.909 
our rescue poor has a winch on it so we
decided<00:07:28.270> the<00:07:28.570> best<00:07:28.780> option<00:07:29.229> was<00:07:29.380> to<00:07:29.410> pull<00:07:29.770> the

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 
decided the best option was to pull the

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:33.220 
decided the best option was to pull the
car<00:07:30.220> off<00:07:31.000> the<00:07:31.360> winch

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:33.230 
car off the winch

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.770 
car off the winch
pull<00:07:33.500> the<00:07:33.590> car<00:07:33.620> off<00:07:34.550> the<00:07:34.790> hydrant<00:07:35.270> with<00:07:35.600> the

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:35.780 
pull the car off the hydrant with the

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.960 
pull the car off the hydrant with the
