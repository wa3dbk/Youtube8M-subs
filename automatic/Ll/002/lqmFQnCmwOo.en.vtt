00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:10.230
 save company galley is easy 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.049
 today the opportunity that is making a 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.759
 video here the very common thing and happens 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.020
 in the alarms 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.180
 there today the customer passed the car here 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.750
 to be installing in a kit of 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.680
 cast 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.340
 a celtic and and passed the recommendation is 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:34.590
 not to leave the key in the ignition 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:36.090
 because the can by locking it locks and 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.510
 believe that the issue 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.320
 this is a problem that happens is the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.989
 person plays who is who is a layman in the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.820
 if the consumer customer 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.120
 he's going to put that blame and not the side 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.039
 but responsible for this many of the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.070
 times when the person does not know what 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.160
 happens the car has the auto lupi function 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.350
 that is when you turn the key 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.650
 ignition and it will spend 15 seconds on 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.790
 a room and will lock the doors 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:19.020
 but this can only happen with 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.409
 the car door closed so great 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.720
 villain is not there the villain in case will be the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.380
 door switch and it will be 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.140
 causing this the person should always 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.909
 observe the door time when you 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.600
 open the door 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.060
 the LED giving it away trying always on right 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.479
 a way for you to give birth néné 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.210
 the time is not even in case you can see the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.090
 door is open and the ceiling light 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.890
 car is not being so automatically 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.930
 he is not sending a signal either 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.560
 with Allah being led dollar then cause 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.189
 that person sometimes does not even turn on the key 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.680
 ignition and within this range of 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.509
 door leaves the car and closes the door 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.479
 then logically it will happen 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.460
 lock the key here inside 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.790
 bailing there problem for you 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:18.390
 and there is another situation there also when 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.530
 You trigger it, right? 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.800
 if you turn off the alarm and do not open the 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.150
 port it also goes neither the function of 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.780
 set the alarm 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.450
 then as a door switch in this 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.240
 oxidized here in the case and will also send 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.470
 will not send a signal to when it was 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.390
 open the door 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.910
 so sometimes the person use an alarm 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.340
 already inserts the key in the ignition 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.820
 door the team realized that a door 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.070
 was opened there was deactivated in LED 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.910
 It will spend about 40 seconds to a minute 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.790
 it will give a real because it does not 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.550
 received the command of the stereotype of 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.210
 doors then everything is causing né 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.220
 this problem right to edit trantando 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.690
 alarm is causing is online 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.360
 there is not receiving the signal from the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.630
 switch will not happen that there 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.350
 will pass this interval there not let 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.920
 served in the ignition key and lock 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.380
 doors will not be able to guarantee some models 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.710
 also thought against the movement here already 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.870
 captures that it will not arm some 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.750
 models is the census already lacking a problem 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:38.010
 It's just that I'm making move is to rescue 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:41.300
 the arming function will pass the interval 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.680
 There it will be reactivated. 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.560
 logically will lock the doors 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.240
 there to the door there activated now 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.980
 back to 'clean' the switch nothing 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.640
 This is happening because when 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.620
 I opened the door and will not even 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.290
 end of the switch that is connected to the 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.850
 kalameh that's a green wire there goes 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.980
 solving it all there a 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:12.580
 open door and will not have the reset 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.319
 nor will automatically arm right not 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.950
 is locking the doors that the door is 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.919
 open 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.769
 so you're not okay 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.919
 always watching this door open the 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.229
 east is lit he never took the team to 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.900
 people are doing the cleaning is many 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.960
 Sometimes a simple cleaning is grand 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.410
 solve you have not put the 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.729
 new switch so that it is 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.380
 functioning properly to avoid 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:46.110
 this problem I removed the switch 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:48.669
 To notice here is very rusty then, right? 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.370
 even if the door is open it will not 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.710
 It's sending the signal to the door. 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.160
 I'll repeat here you can spend a 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.590
 little contact clean here if it is 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.960
 solved, calm can come back even 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.690
 if it does not solve the ideal, you 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.639
 replaces a new one because that is 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.960
 essential because the alarm works 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:14.169
 correctly avoid you are locking the 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.550
 car will be setting alarm leaving 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.710
 key in the ignition is locking 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:25.180
 Even though it's not very quiet, the cleaning is only 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:28.060
 by the company that will already solve 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:32.919
 works perfectly there riding it 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:37.889
 here showing you that you leave perfect and 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:45.190
 now asked closing here turn off 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:46.419
 releasing the light from the ceiling is also 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.810
 sure it 's working 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.610
 correctly then it is always notice to leave 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.910
 huh 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:58.450
 the customer is observing that there case 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:00.669
 the switch to edit is not triggering 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.740
 Will this problem happen here now? 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:06.460
 How are you with the door open? 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.470
 you can turn on the ignition key is that 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.260
 He will not arm the key. 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.390
 the car attached to an open door does not 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.330
 got the real so will not have the problem 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:21.560
 is locking or when turning off the 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:24.610
 here I'm going to turn the alarm on 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.610
 party has a twist 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:39.280
 I can trigger the alarm is normal I 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:45.580
 I'm usually when I hang up and 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:48.670
 Open the door, he does not have any right 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.310
 Sharmarke the door was opened to 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.710
 apostles closed is normal rearmament 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:59.350
 the door did not know until opened the door and 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:07:01.540
 Sent the red light, no problem. 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:05.470
 the guys who want this tip today 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:08.080
 do not tell the person that the alarm is 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:11.800
 locking alone the alarm passes a 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.940
 time right then locked alone give 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.010
 this whole time running 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.260
 They are working perfectly 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:20.560
 correctly it is required is 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.280
 connected to the switch 100 wire 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.410
 switched on 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.950
 this model already makes it clear 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:29.800
 models already there in the item giving 

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:33.690
