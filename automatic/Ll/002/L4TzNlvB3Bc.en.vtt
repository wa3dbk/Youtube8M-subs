00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:06.070
 preud'homme we are therefore in his room when she refused to extradite 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.079
 however, it doesn't work 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:12.319
 another switch 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.349
 and it all gets a bit more up than a large part of the room 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.909
 of commerce team 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.689
 the worst thing there is 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.689
 9 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.489
 what do you think 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.269
 this is incorrect 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.560
 the city thus a source 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.819
 an analysis 

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:37.350
 I hear 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.350
 independence 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.650
 the residents of a residential care center 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.650
 anp 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.710
 anp 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.810
 it is impossible for us 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.810
 yes breskens 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.280
 It's a good thing he was no longer there, a Mr. Director 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.600
 together 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.909
 has your l 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.909
 but I agree with the relevant editors 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.040
 haha 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.370
 that especially year 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.370
 with the residents 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
 check 6 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.409
 also there is all k 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.190
 Algeria 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.190
 five hit 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.410
 especially in the first half 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.990
 years of edwin vinke 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.100
 only the british were 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.570
 to control the decline I think it is right that more is needed 8 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.170
 well embassy 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.340
 I also have great memories 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.100
 but with that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.100
 filming piet together 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.170
 even if it is just a little better on all those banks 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:11.749
 the Netherlands is 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:17.549
 if only in the longer term more than half more than reasonable not 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:17.909
 beautiful
