00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
notes of the chord because you don't

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.010 
notes of the chord because you don't

using your full forefinger chord we're
going<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.490> use<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.880> three-finger<00:03:23.810> version

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200
