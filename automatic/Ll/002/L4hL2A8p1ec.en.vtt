up<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.489> idea<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:22.680> another<00:03:23.580> thing<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.940> note<00:03:23.970> is

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
up the idea and another thing to note is

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.830 
up the idea and another thing to note is
that<00:03:24.270> these<00:03:25.110> locations<00:03:25.650> also<00:03:25.800> work<00:03:26.040> for<00:03:26.070> a

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
that these locations also work for a

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.550 
that these locations also work for a
multiplayer<00:03:27.840> so

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.020 

cops<00:03:33.560> come<00:03:33.980> from<00:03:34.190> both<00:03:34.340> ends<00:03:34.519> of<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.700> street
