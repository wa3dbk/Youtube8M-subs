00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
see I usually hold on to the harness

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.210 
see I usually hold on to the harness
just<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.720> make<00:02:12.840> sure<00:02:12.990> my<00:02:13.320> trip<00:02:13.800> he's<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.010> little

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
just to make sure my trip he's a little

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.800 
just to make sure my trip he's a little
nervous<00:02:14.340> at<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.700> moment<00:02:14.730> because<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.360> have<00:02:15.540> fan

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
nervous at the moment because I have fan

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.320 
nervous at the moment because I have fan
going<00:02:16.020> probably<00:02:16.380> just<00:02:16.590> like<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.330> cheap

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
going probably just like that and cheap

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.230 
going probably just like that and cheap
he<00:02:18.390> has<00:02:18.510> some<00:02:18.690> eye<00:02:18.840> trouble<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.590> he's<00:02:20.370> uh<00:02:20.400> this

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
he has some eye trouble so he's uh this

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.610 
he has some eye trouble so he's uh this
is<00:02:21.420> especially<00:02:21.840> why<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:21.990> put<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.260> harness<00:02:22.440> on

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
is especially why I put the harness on

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.800 
is especially why I put the harness on
is<00:02:22.770> because<00:02:23.100> everybody<00:02:24.150> he<00:02:24.330> has<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> hard<00:02:24.780> time

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
is because everybody he has a hard time

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.990 
is because everybody he has a hard time
seeing<00:02:25.290> where<00:02:25.500> he's<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.220> especially

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
seeing where he's going and especially

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.460 
seeing where he's going and especially
outside<00:02:27.210> like<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.780> last<00:02:27.930> thing<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.170> wanted<00:02:28.410> to

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
outside like the last thing I wanted to

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.380 
outside like the last thing I wanted to
do<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.710> spoof<00:02:29.130> take<00:02:29.580> off<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.090> then<00:02:30.180> hit

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
do a spoof take off and then hit

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.590 
do a spoof take off and then hit
something<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:32.000> there<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.150> have<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.330> that's

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
something so there you have it that's

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.270 
something so there you have it that's
pretty<00:02:33.930> much<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.440> take<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.100> off

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
pretty much it you take it off

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.000 
pretty much it you take it off
essentially<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.880> same<00:02:36.060> way<00:02:36.120> um<00:02:36.890> just<00:02:37.890> be

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
essentially the same way um just be

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.400 
essentially the same way um just be
careful<00:02:38.370> with<00:02:38.490> their<00:02:38.640> crests<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.200> little

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
careful with their crests it's a little

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.690 
careful with their crests it's a little
bit<00:02:40.530> more<00:02:40.740> difficult<00:02:41.130> with<00:02:41.190> them<00:02:41.340> for<00:02:41.520> the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
bit more difficult with them for the

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.130 
bit more difficult with them for the
competent<00:02:42.210> because<00:02:42.270> their<00:02:42.540> crests<00:02:42.840> are<00:02:42.930> so

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
competent because their crests are so

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.990 
competent because their crests are so
big<00:02:43.440> but<00:02:44.400> just<00:02:44.900> make<00:02:45.900> sure<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.110> your<00:02:46.410> bird<00:02:46.620> is

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
big but just make sure that your bird is

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.700 
big but just make sure that your bird is
in<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.150> place<00:02:48.450> where<00:02:48.660> if<00:02:48.960> you're<00:02:49.140> inside<00:02:49.440> you're

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
in a place where if you're inside you're

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.050 
in a place where if you're inside you're
taking<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.100> harness<00:02:50.370> off<00:02:50.490> that<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.880> can't

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
taking the harness off that it can't

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.670 
taking the harness off that it can't
hurt<00:02:51.150> itself<00:02:51.450> expects<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.290> take<00:02:52.440> off<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.300> make

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
hurt itself expects to take off and make

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.290 
hurt itself expects to take off and make
sure<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.830> your<00:02:56.100> birds<00:02:56.340> up<00:02:56.700> doesn't<00:02:57.180> have

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
sure that your birds up doesn't have

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.940 
sure that your birds up doesn't have
access<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.810> chew<00:02:57.990> on<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.470> last<00:02:58.620> thing<00:02:58.860> you

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
access to chew on it the last thing you

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.680 
access to chew on it the last thing you
want<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.190> video<00:02:59.520> is<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.880> on<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> bunch<00:03:00.300> of<00:03:00.420> horse

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
want the video is to on a bunch of horse

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.000 
want the video is to on a bunch of horse
and<00:03:00.870> then<00:03:01.860> them<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:03.060> fly<00:03:03.690> off<00:03:03.870> at<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.350> break

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
hopefully I can get other harnesses done

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.050 
hopefully I can get other harnesses done
just<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.190> want<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.489> see<00:03:23.670> how<00:03:23.760> they<00:03:23.910> work
