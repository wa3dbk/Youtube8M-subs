been taught we've been discussing this
for<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.829> while<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.609> know<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> future<00:01:00.239> of

mixed in there and I think this this

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.800 
mixed in there and I think this this
kind<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.670> fits<00:01:05.850> into<00:01:06.000> what<00:01:06.240> we're<00:01:06.420> talking

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
kind of fits into what we're talking

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
people to really grasp the idea of

completely<00:01:17.640> other<00:01:17.970> than<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> fact<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
completely other than the fact that it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.539 
completely other than the fact that it

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.569 
out there like myself who's been
watching<00:01:49.770> The<00:01:50.040> Jetsons<00:01:50.250> growing<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:51.229> this

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
watching The Jetsons growing up this

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.910 
watching The Jetsons growing up this
walmart<00:01:53.579> went<00:01:53.729> hard<00:01:54.290> it's<00:01:55.290> an<00:01:55.350> electric<00:01:55.649> plane

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
walmart went hard it's an electric plane

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.530 
walmart went hard it's an electric plane
so<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.399> quite<00:01:56.700> like<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.060> Jetsons<00:01:57.420> like

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
so it's not quite like the Jetsons like

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.330 
so it's not quite like the Jetsons like
we<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.780> any<00:01:57.899> hovercraft<00:01:58.560> ability<00:01:58.979> built<00:01:59.159> in

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
we have any hovercraft ability built in

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.840 
we have any hovercraft ability built in
but<00:01:59.640> a<00:02:00.270> company<00:02:01.110> called<00:02:01.259> yanko<00:02:02.009> design<00:02:02.040> design

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850

this<00:02:03.509> right<00:02:03.780> here<00:02:03.990> you're<00:02:04.170> seeing<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:04.680> kind

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
this right here you're seeing it's kind

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.600 
this right here you're seeing it's kind
of<00:02:04.979> like<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.280> personal<00:02:05.939> two-seater<00:02:06.630> aircraft

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
of like a personal two-seater aircraft

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.279 
of like a personal two-seater aircraft
completely<00:02:08.610> electric<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.209> called<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.450> eqp

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
completely electric it's called the eqp

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.180 
completely electric it's called the eqp
2x

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
2x

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.020 
2x
it's<00:02:13.190> like<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.760> Miata<00:02:14.630> with<00:02:15.170> wings<00:02:16.000> except<00:02:17.000> for

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
it's like a Miata with wings except for

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.449 
it's like a Miata with wings except for
a<00:02:17.209> heck<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.540> lot<00:02:17.569> faster<00:02:17.720> yeah<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.739> has<00:02:19.190> more

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
a heck of a lot faster yeah and has more

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.160 
a heck of a lot faster yeah and has more
range<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.209> what<00:02:20.420> they<00:02:20.599> are<00:02:20.660> what<00:02:20.989> they're

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
range so what they are what they're

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.479 
range so what they are what they're
saying<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:21.739> that<00:02:21.830> once<00:02:22.099> they've<00:02:22.310> actually

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
saying is that once they've actually

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.339 
saying is that once they've actually
build<00:02:22.880> this<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.239> this<00:02:23.420> plane<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:24.110> will<00:02:24.200> have

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
build this to this plane it will have

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.400 
build this to this plane it will have
speeds<00:02:25.190> up<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.459> 250<00:02:26.150> miles<00:02:26.330> an<00:02:26.510> hour<00:02:26.599> in<00:02:27.020> a

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
speeds up to 250 miles an hour in a

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.470 
speeds up to 250 miles an hour in a
range<00:02:27.709> over<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.220> thousand<00:02:28.670> miles<00:02:28.790> like<00:02:29.300> it's

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
range over a thousand miles like it's

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.970 
range over a thousand miles like it's
like<00:02:29.600> twelve<00:02:29.870> hundred<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.230> sixty<00:02:30.560> miles<00:02:30.770> is

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
like twelve hundred and sixty miles is

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.729 
like twelve hundred and sixty miles is
what<00:02:31.160> they're<00:02:31.420> claiming<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.380> range<00:02:33.560> on

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
what they're claiming the the range on

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.170 
what they're claiming the the range on
this<00:02:33.830> thing<00:02:33.890> would<00:02:34.100> be<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.489> that's<00:02:34.760> like<00:02:35.000> per

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
this thing would be and that's like per

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.000 
this thing would be and that's like per
charge<00:02:35.510> yeah<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.380> know<00:02:36.470> considering

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
charge yeah you know considering

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.620 
charge yeah you know considering
electronic<00:02:37.730> technology<00:02:38.269> or<00:02:38.330> electric

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
electronic technology or electric

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.300 
electronic technology or electric
technology<00:02:38.780> where<00:02:39.350> it<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.530> today<00:02:39.709> for<00:02:40.190> like

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
technology where it is today for like

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.040 
technology where it is today for like
hybrid<00:02:40.640> vehicles<00:02:40.940> new<00:02:41.030> electric<00:02:41.480> cars<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.930> do

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
hybrid vehicles new electric cars to do

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.140 
hybrid vehicles new electric cars to do
that<00:02:42.170> with<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.349> plane<00:02:42.650> be<00:02:43.340> pretty<00:02:43.819> interesting

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
that with a plane be pretty interesting

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.750 
that with a plane be pretty interesting
yeah<00:02:44.450> i<00:02:44.660> mean<00:02:44.930> i<00:02:44.959> i'm<00:02:45.350> really<00:02:45.800> excited<00:02:45.890> if<00:02:46.489> this

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
yeah i mean i i'm really excited if this

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.850 
yeah i mean i i'm really excited if this
actually<00:02:47.090> came<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.870> be<00:02:48.350> because<00:02:48.530> then<00:02:48.650> i<00:02:48.830> could

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
actually came to be because then i could

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.800 
actually came to be because then i could
fly<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.220> whoever<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.610> wanted<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.060> park<00:02:50.420> my<00:02:50.569> plane

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
fly to whoever I wanted to park my plane

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.600 
fly to whoever I wanted to park my plane
at<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.019> local<00:02:51.200> airstrip<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.920> do<00:02:52.459> my<00:02:52.580> thing

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
at the local airstrip and do my thing

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.070 
at the local airstrip and do my thing
yeah<00:02:53.150> don't<00:02:53.450> think<00:02:53.569> it<00:02:53.630> needs<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.900> have<00:02:54.049> some

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
yeah don't think it needs to have some

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.509 
yeah don't think it needs to have some
wings<00:02:54.350> tuck<00:02:54.590> away<00:02:54.709> I<00:02:54.830> can<00:02:55.040> just<00:02:55.130> drive<00:02:55.280> off<00:02:55.459> the

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
wings tuck away I can just drive off the

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.940 
wings tuck away I can just drive off the
that<00:02:56.239> would<00:02:56.360> be<00:02:56.510> would<00:02:56.900> be<00:02:56.930> ideal<00:02:57.140> but<00:02:57.739> he

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
that would be would be ideal but he

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.009 
that would be would be ideal but he
could<00:02:58.069> drive<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.400> on<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.700> highway<00:02:59.360> after<00:02:59.510> how

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
could drive it on the highway after how

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.259 
could drive it on the highway after how
cool<00:03:00.260> would<00:03:00.319> that<00:03:00.380> be<00:03:01.000> anyway<00:03:02.000> we<00:03:02.120> thought

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
cool would that be anyway we thought

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.430 
cool would that be anyway we thought
this<00:03:02.420> was<00:03:02.540> cool<00:03:02.750> we<00:03:02.840> wanted<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.140> share<00:03:03.319> it<00:03:03.410> with
