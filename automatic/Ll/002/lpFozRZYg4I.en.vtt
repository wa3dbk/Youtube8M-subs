00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.850
 karim el ahmadi became loyal 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.349
 listener that sms with every week and that 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.269
 is eddy couplers from hendrik ido craft 

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:10.799
 in thailand here than listening radio 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.360
 rijnmond and he just texted me 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.730
 el ahmadi by far the best this afternoon 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.049
 does the dieers look on or show it 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.250
 a bit through 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.990
 well i just think we as a team 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.870
 actually don't have groningen at all 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.600
 let it breathe today and yes I think 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.420
 that it is also one after such a tough game 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.170
 if thunder always just yes for that 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.369
 keep going and the opponent 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.960
 don't let your opponent play football and 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.089
 also be the boss in the cockpit than me 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.679
 to have proven things is that line 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:38.850
 mainly used against you 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.600
 fell this but there must still be one 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.519
 intentions 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.350
 therefore a conscious what is what us too 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.609
 and even if you go to the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.920
 We just knew the rankings 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:50.460
 that nothing had to be done with the three points 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.539
 and yes with nothing less went for that 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.550
 just had to have three points it was 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.749
 I think something clear from minute 1 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.609
 if you lived first do it yourself you must 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:58.530
 have to make at least more out of it 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.699
 everything to be finished already before the rest yes me 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.960
 you think i think if you are the first 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.729
 ten minutes fifteen minutes if we just one 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.559
 or totally that it still has many 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.120
 easier but I think the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.219
 when we did or did that one did 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.689
 We knew we would just go here 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.710
 win or get red quickly or 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.759
 not 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.219
 I think we want to match the 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.079
 parent party were with beautiful 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.579
 moments where you and clasie meet 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.020
 find each time to find 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.399
 creates something beautiful between you 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.799
 those other midfielders 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.060
 yes I have I can grow well 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.670
 with those with all middle photos 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.829
 play football and it feels good and yes jordi 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.210
 jordi klaassen is i think 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.289
 so what I have just said if I 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.840
 compare with two years ago 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.490
 that boy they see two or three more times 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.399
 I think I got better already 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.649
 but how he plays now is just that 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.939
 goes the absolute top all brands it too 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.219
 to restart your moves in such 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.479
 group as a leader maybe for years 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.390
 that I just told you two and a half years 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.009
 ago it was now possible with a like 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.840
 he yes a bit calmer he played football 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.579
 overall good but yeah now it's just 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.869
 really a leader and well I'm his 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.219
 enjoying but also the rest of me 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.689
 team that is important to you in the 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.909
 make three more goals in the second half of you 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.289
 with imfolozi goalscorer we have 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.280
 said the other half 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.109
 enter with the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.759
 with a zero zero position because if 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.170
 it's only one zero so you know 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.940
 never what can happen 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.250
 I think we two hand full of gas 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.959
 have given and indeed the red 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.920
 card helped us but someone else 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.659
 also had shaken 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.280
 for their bones belt red I have 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.480
 saw those images on the press stand immediately 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.099
 who is kicking more Groningen 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.080
 face without a ball nearby yes I was 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.720
 very close and I saw the 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.190
 know very long balls and 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.170
 just kick it but I can't 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.510
 imagine the fine child and really do 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.739
 injuries or something because a crazy impulse 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.040
 or so I assume that nobody would 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.470
 to do 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.610
 So what does it say you flood a fred 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.099
 rutten such as the genius Least 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.319
 also have passed defense 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.640
 yes i think we are also with quite 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.519
 We actually defend a lot of risks 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.260
 very far to the front just to defend 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.409
 I think with players in the back with a lot 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.610
 speed so yes it's you but daring 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.319
 sees that we don't let anyone play football 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.540
 in a tub and that's how we should do it each 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.599
 try to radiate here and week 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.040
 ow-cup competition of course very different 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.019
 but down here and in the Premier League 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.030
 just have to try just from 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.230
 put minute 1 pressure and yes it is 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.489
 actually started with ajax because we 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.650
 I have already seen it in Ajax 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.939
 when we didn't really have three points 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.739
 got 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.930
 what do you think of the role of toornstra that 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.830
 who sincerely plays on paper occasionally 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.209
 the midfielder is on those four 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.689
 enthusiastically close to the insult 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.430
 to playful 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.799
 yes it is very tasty 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.209
 you can always lose the banana and yes it 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.709
 is just a very smart player 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.840
 actually and i could find him at utrecht 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.640
 always good and yes you just see now 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.469
 that he just effortlessly surrendered 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.299
 goes international player now I believe yes 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:32.609
 I am a bit troubled by my 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.319
 groin again just to see if we finished I 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.810
 go there or not but it washes up 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.560
 Morocco to the two exhibition games 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.840
 kenya and 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.549
 another country where you doubt 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.930
 a bit or even goes yes I have 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.760
 a bit bothered after i like you too 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.319
 dated out went to wait 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.299
 communicate with the national team 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.299
 see what 's best for me
