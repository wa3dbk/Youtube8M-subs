00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.090
 the first thing to do is go to 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.940
 prepare the filling what we do 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.820
 take the Sufi of the squid and the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.429
 fins and we are going to chop enough 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.740
 we say roughly but not too much 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:25.019
 large naturally goes into the pan with 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.550
 a little olive oil and let them cook for 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.259
 about 10 minutes no more then yes 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.150
 they go to remove in the pan leaving 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.580
 but the sauce a pan where there 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.560
 I add a little thorium we go to 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.450
 put the breadcrumbs that you must 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.790
 toast lightly but it is especially useful 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.710
 to collect all the sauce 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.990
 that sure easy to prepare a nice 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.390
 chopped garlic and parsley and it 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.730
 we do enough and add ourselves to it 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.910
 then once we have already chopped 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:59.820
 I also love glass capers 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.400
 these are fairly coarse and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.890
 they are added to the calamari then there 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.210
 we put the necessary amount of bread 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.640
 grated in such a way as to have a 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.859
 dough that is neither too dry nor 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.109
 too wet and naturally added 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.179
 add a little pepper and a little salt 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:16.649
 and we re that he was ready for this 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:18.840
 let's not go what we go to 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.189
 do it but fill the bags there 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.140
 you can also worry about them 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.810
 enough of filling because not 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.819
 since there are no eggs it will not inflate this 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.920
 this filling once we have it 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:32.549
 then finished all stuffed in the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.560
 bags close we place the toothpick e 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.130
 let's go in put in a baking dish from 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.710
 bake a nice oil spin over and let's go 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.389
 in the oven to cook at 200 degrees for about 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.090
 the total cooking will be twenty 

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:48.030
 minutes when half cooked and what we do 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.520
 open we fade with some wine and 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.920
 let it cook for another 5 minutes 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.590
 we retire out practically at the end 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.550
 of the cooking we wet the bags and 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.580
 we dust ball breadcrumbs 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.670
 a trickle of oil and put it back in the oven 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.740
 at most the oven temperature for 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.979
 few minutes 3 and 4 walls the time of 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.630
 make them become as long as they serve 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.850
 these squid, for example, are there 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.250
 very good just plain tomatoes 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.540
 a tomato salad, however, choose 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.570
 you the outline you want 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.870
 in this case I will put gods 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.330
 cloud and some tomatoes to present it yes 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.330
 cut the squid you put the salad 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.330
 of rocket and tomatoes and good appetite
