medium<00:00:44.550> again<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.140> think<00:00:47.129> gives<00:00:47.280> them<00:00:47.399> all

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
medium again so I think gives them all

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.450 
medium again so I think gives them all
your<00:00:47.940> songs<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:48.930> something<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.039> locks<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
your songs or something and it locks a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.180 
your songs or something and it locks a
couple<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.149> when<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.390> locked<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.020> says<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:53.039> is

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
couple so when it's locked it says it is

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.799 
couple so when it's locked it says it is
locked<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.670> unlock<00:00:53.969> yet<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> complete<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.690> is

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
locked to unlock yet to complete this is

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.529 
locked to unlock yet to complete this is
a<00:00:54.899> difficulty<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.829> accuracy<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.520> 85<00:00:57.120> or<00:00:57.420> better
