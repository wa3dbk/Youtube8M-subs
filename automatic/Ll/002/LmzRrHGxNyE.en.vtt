00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
focused on the road so have everything

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.229

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
concentrate on driving I suppose it's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.620

fair<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> presume<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> lot<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> people

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
fair to presume not a lot of people

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.719 
fair to presume not a lot of people
would<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.080> taken<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.530> Forester<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.430> real

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729

would have taken the Forester as a real
SUV<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.260> that's<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.650> thing<00:01:10.830> they<00:01:11.070> are

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
breaking through that through the wheel

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.219 
breaking through that through the wheel
speed<00:01:44.759> sensors<00:01:45.119> effectively<00:01:45.630> with<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> with

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
speed sensors effectively with it with

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.740 
speed sensors effectively with it with
the<00:01:46.259> electronic<00:01:46.920> accelerator<00:01:47.850> dan<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> can

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the electronic accelerator dan I can

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.450 
the electronic accelerator dan I can
actually<00:01:48.869> feel<00:01:49.259> taking<00:01:49.920> my<00:01:50.009> foot<00:01:50.130> off<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
actually feel taking my foot off the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.109 
actually feel taking my foot off the
accelerator<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> car<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.630> still

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
accelerator but the car is still

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.510 
accelerator but the car is still
coasting<00:01:54.119> along<00:01:54.270> now<00:01:54.770> ordinarily<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.340> car

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
coasting along now ordinarily that car

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.190 
coasting along now ordinarily that car
would<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.759> almost<00:01:56.939> rolled<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.990> stop

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
would have almost rolled to it to a stop

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.830 
would have almost rolled to it to a stop
yeah<00:01:58.680> look<00:01:59.430> it's<00:01:59.579> designed<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.420> give<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
yeah look it's designed to give you a

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.510 
yeah look it's designed to give you a
good<00:02:01.140> throttle<00:02:01.530> response<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.070> feeling<00:02:02.460> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
good throttle response and feeling and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.429 
good throttle response and feeling and
that's<00:02:02.670> when<00:02:02.909> when<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.659> come<00:02:03.840> into<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.170> play

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
that's when when you come into this play

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.870 
that's when when you come into this play
and<00:02:04.500> we're<00:02:04.680> doing<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.189> driving<00:02:05.759> it's

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
and we're doing this for driving it's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.310 
and we're doing this for driving it's
the<00:02:06.000> balance<00:02:06.390> between<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.200> only

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
the balance between that so you only

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.080 
the balance between that so you only
have<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.500> little<00:02:07.619> bit<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.829> throttle<00:02:08.039> ex-mo<00:02:08.910> can

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
have a little bit of throttle ex-mo can

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.760 
have a little bit of throttle ex-mo can
come<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.390> or<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.569> can<00:02:09.690> use<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.020> break<00:02:10.259> now

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
come in or you can use the break now

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.229 
come in or you can use the break now
already<00:02:11.129> what<00:02:11.370> would<00:02:11.459> we<00:02:11.580> experience<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.150> this

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
already what would we experience on this

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.250 
already what would we experience on this
track<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.690> more<00:02:12.930> than

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
track is more than

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.380 
track is more than
some<00:02:13.349> people<00:02:13.650> would<00:02:13.769> put<00:02:14.010> their<00:02:14.189> SUV<00:02:15.030> through

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
some people would put their SUV through

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.630 
some people would put their SUV through
a<00:02:15.599> lot<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.840> people<00:02:16.080> use<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.470> as<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:17.159> weekend

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
a lot of people use it as a weekend

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.640 
a lot of people use it as a weekend
drive<00:02:17.879> but<00:02:18.150> with<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> car<00:02:18.989> like<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.590> think

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
drive but with a car like this I think

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.170 
drive but with a car like this I think
people<00:02:20.010> underestimate<00:02:20.250> how<00:02:20.700> much<00:02:20.730> fun<00:02:21.090> you

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
people underestimate how much fun you

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.580 
people underestimate how much fun you
can<00:02:21.299> actually<00:02:21.450> have<00:02:21.750> like<00:02:21.959> going<00:02:22.379> to<00:02:22.409> those

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
can actually have like going to those

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.289

need<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.319> go<00:03:01.440> out<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:01.650> low<00:03:01.920> speed<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.370> just

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
need to go out this low speed so just

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.069 
need to go out this low speed so just
put<00:03:02.639> a<00:03:02.670> bit<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:02.849> throttle<00:03:03.090> on<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.629> speed<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.019> up

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
a bit and then come straight off it

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.830 
a bit and then come straight off it
again<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.909> you're<00:03:06.000> now<00:03:06.120> see<00:03:06.299> it's<00:03:06.420> maintain

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
again and you're now see it's maintain

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.569 
again and you're now see it's maintain
that<00:03:07.079> speed<00:03:07.230> will<00:03:07.530> go<00:03:07.680> up<00:03:07.739> in<00:03:07.859> four<00:03:08.069> kilometer

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579

that speed will go up in four kilometer
an<00:03:08.760> hour<00:03:08.879> increments<00:03:09.299> up<00:03:09.629> to<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.870> 20<00:03:10.170> that's

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
an hour increments up to that 20 that's

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.020 
an hour increments up to that 20 that's
like<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> low<00:03:11.220> yeah<00:03:11.609> cruise<00:03:11.940> control
