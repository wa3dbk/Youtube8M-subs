00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
to it and a dryness to it I think that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.730 
to it and a dryness to it I think that
the<00:01:24.510> partner<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.290> going<00:01:25.440> to<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.620> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the partner for that is going to be the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.770 
the partner for that is going to be the
big<00:01:25.890> guy<00:01:26.040> here<00:01:26.370> is<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.270> wild<00:01:27.479> devil

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
big guy here is going to be wild devil

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.690 
big guy here is going to be wild devil
because<00:01:28.020> wild<00:01:28.380> devil<00:01:28.500> has<00:01:28.740> sort<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.159> tannic

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
because wild devil has sort of a tannic

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.180 
because wild devil has sort of a tannic
edge<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:31.350> think<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.860> those<00:01:32.010> two

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
edge to it and I think that those two

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.680 
edge to it and I think that those two
are<00:01:32.220> definitely<00:01:32.549> going<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.119> pair<00:01:33.479> together

has got dryness it's got a refreshing

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.160 
has got dryness it's got a refreshing
character<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> reason<00:01:52.080> I'm

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
character to it and the reason I'm

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.570 
character to it and the reason I'm
saying<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.830> looks<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.340> cheese

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
saying that is it looks like this cheese

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.219 
saying that is it looks like this cheese
was<00:01:53.729> probably<00:01:54.000> modeled<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> Spanish

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
was probably modeled on a Spanish

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.810 
was probably modeled on a Spanish
manchego<00:01:55.799> cheese<00:01:55.830> I<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.400> see<00:01:56.520> from<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
manchego cheese I can see from the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.690 
manchego cheese I can see from the
flakiness<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.720> firmness<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:59.670> I

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
flakiness and the firmness of it that I

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.190 
flakiness and the firmness of it that I
think<00:01:59.970> that<00:02:00.000> there's<00:02:00.240> going<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> be<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.659> dry

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
think that there's going to be a dry

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
was interesting and it's very

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.330 
was interesting and it's very
interesting<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.050> pair<00:02:20.320> this<00:02:20.710> type<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.040> cheese

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
interesting to pair this type of cheese

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.510
