to be answering a question sent by unki
and<00:00:06.480> they're<00:00:06.810> asking<00:00:07.259> why<00:00:07.589> do<00:00:07.649> Phalaenopsis

and they're asking why do Phalaenopsis
orchids<00:00:08.760> produce<00:00:09.210> different<00:00:09.540> sized<00:00:10.110> flowers

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
orchids produce different sized flowers

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.249 
orchids produce different sized flowers
and<00:00:11.340> she's<00:00:11.580> referring<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.059> flowers<00:00:12.750> on<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
and she's referring to flowers on the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.910 
and she's referring to flowers on the
same<00:00:13.469> orchid<00:00:13.920> or<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.660> same<00:00:15.900> flower<00:00:16.529> spike

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
same orchid or on the same flower spike

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.710 
same orchid or on the same flower spike
now<00:00:17.520> I've<00:00:17.789> discovered<00:00:18.029> there<00:00:18.359> are<00:00:18.480> two

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
now I've discovered there are two

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.920 
now I've discovered there are two
instances<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.380> which<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.890> can<00:00:20.100> find<00:00:20.369> smaller

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
instances in which you can find smaller

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.720 
instances in which you can find smaller
flowers<00:00:21.930> than<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.289> previous<00:00:22.769> ones<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
flowers than the previous ones and the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.580 
flowers than the previous ones and the
first<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.539> first<00:00:24.750> one<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.170> most<00:00:25.320> obvious

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
first the first one in the most obvious

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.189 
first the first one in the most obvious
one<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.189> when<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.730> just<00:00:26.760> purchase<00:00:27.660> an<00:00:27.810> orchid

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
one is when you just purchase an orchid

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.339 
one is when you just purchase an orchid
if<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.250> still<00:00:29.519> has<00:00:29.730> some<00:00:29.760> buds<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.810> buds<00:00:31.050> in

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
if it still has some buds the buds in

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.889 
if it still has some buds the buds in
most<00:00:31.800> cases<00:00:32.130> when<00:00:32.969> they<00:00:33.090> open<00:00:33.390> will<00:00:33.630> be

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
most cases when they open will be

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.049 
most cases when they open will be
smaller<00:00:34.320> than<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> previous<00:00:35.160> flowers<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:36.000> I

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
smaller than the previous flowers like I

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.150 
smaller than the previous flowers like I
have<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:36.840> here<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.559> there<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
have this one here and there is a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.400 
have this one here and there is a
logical<00:00:38.610> explanation<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.690> because<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
logical explanation for this because the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.260 
logical explanation for this because the
orchid<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.950> trying<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.550> adapt<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:42.030> new

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
orchid is trying to adapt to your new

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.060 
orchid is trying to adapt to your new
environment<00:00:42.600> which<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.649> totally<00:00:44.040> different

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
environment which is totally different

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.490 
environment which is totally different
from<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> one<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> store<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:46.079> now

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
from the one in the store it's now

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.220 
from the one in the store it's now
really<00:00:46.800> diverting<00:00:47.370> enough<00:00:47.760> energy<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.690> for

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
really diverting enough energy for for

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.680 
really diverting enough energy for for
the<00:00:49.410> flower<00:00:49.860> production<00:00:50.430> because<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.449> not

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the flower production because it's not

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.540 
the flower production because it's not
that<00:00:51.870> important<00:00:52.379> at<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.829> moment<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that important at the moment for the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.299 
that important at the moment for the
orchid<00:00:53.940> now<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.660> can<00:00:54.960> expand<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
orchid now you can expand this to a

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.520 
orchid now you can expand this to a
suffering<00:00:56.879> workit<00:00:57.420> or<00:00:57.570> an<00:00:57.690> orchid<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.109> just

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
suffering workit or an orchid that just

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.580 
suffering workit or an orchid that just
went<00:00:58.800> through<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.820> stress<00:01:00.359> period<00:01:00.780> maybe<00:01:01.350> you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
went through a stress period maybe you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.860 
went through a stress period maybe you
just<00:01:01.739> repotted<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.520> maybe<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.510> has<00:01:03.660> some

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
just repotted it maybe it has some

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.560 
just repotted it maybe it has some
issues<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:05.129> roots<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.390> it's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
issues with the roots and so on if it's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.719 
issues with the roots and so on if it's
not<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.810> new<00:01:07.020> orchid<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:08.010> definitely<00:01:08.460> going

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
not a new orchid it's definitely going

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.690 
not a new orchid it's definitely going
through<00:01:08.880> some<00:01:09.450> sort<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.830> stress<00:01:11.220> also

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
through some sort of a stress also

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.870 
through some sort of a stress also
smaller<00:01:12.299> flowers<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.920> associated<00:01:14.220> with<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
smaller flowers can be associated with a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.270 
smaller flowers can be associated with a
more<00:01:15.119> washed<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.750> color<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.100> see

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
more washed out color as you can see

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.520 
more washed out color as you can see
this<00:01:17.490> flower<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.509> looks<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> really

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
this flower it looks like it really

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.890 
this flower it looks like it really
didn't<00:01:20.040> open<00:01:20.430> enough<00:01:20.909> as<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.509> see<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
didn't open enough as you can see the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.140 
didn't open enough as you can see the
green<00:01:22.500> patches<00:01:22.830> here<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.520> looks<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:23.970> it's

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
green patches here it looks like it's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.210 
green patches here it looks like it's
more<00:01:24.509> concentrated<00:01:25.470> than<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.100> actually

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
more concentrated than it actually

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.039 
more concentrated than it actually
should<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.479> because<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.960> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
should be and this is because it's a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.770 
should be and this is because it's a
recent<00:01:28.409> purchase<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.040> she<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.850> gets

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
recent purchase and she just gets

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.679 
recent purchase and she just gets
adjusted<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.530> my<00:01:31.710> environment<00:01:32.689> unhealthy

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
adjusted to my environment unhealthy

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.350 
adjusted to my environment unhealthy
Phalaenopsis<00:01:34.320> orchids<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.729> see<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
Phalaenopsis orchids you can see a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.240 
Phalaenopsis orchids you can see a
slight<00:01:36.720> difference<00:01:36.900> between<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.560> last

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
slight difference between the last

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.609 
slight difference between the last
flower<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:39.000> will<00:01:39.150> bloom<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.049> first<00:01:40.320> one

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
flower that will bloom and the first one

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.429 
flower that will bloom and the first one
usually<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:42.210> flowers<00:01:42.540> from<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.990> tip<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
usually the flowers from the tip of the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.850 
usually the flowers from the tip of the
orchid<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:45.020> slightly<00:01:46.020> smaller<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.770> course

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
orchid can be slightly smaller of course

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.219 
orchid can be slightly smaller of course
it's<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.579> going<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.790> be<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.210> obvious<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.049> so

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
it's not going to be so obvious and so

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:49.789 
it's not going to be so obvious and so
dramatic

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
dramatic

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.880 
dramatic
like<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:51.119> other<00:01:51.299> case<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.810> showed<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:52.770> it

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
like the other case I showed you but it

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.389 
like the other case I showed you but it
is<00:01:53.009> quite<00:01:53.340> normal<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:55.439> last<00:01:55.680> flowers<00:01:56.189> to

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
is quite normal for the last flowers to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.630 
is quite normal for the last flowers to
be<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.969> slightly<00:01:57.240> smaller<00:01:57.979> than<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.399> first

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
be just slightly smaller than the first

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.389 
be just slightly smaller than the first
flowers<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.509> opened<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.649> noticed<00:02:02.070> this

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
flowers that opened I just noticed this

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.850 
flowers that opened I just noticed this
with<00:02:02.700> most<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.119> my<00:02:03.180> Phalaenopsis<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.530> not<00:02:04.829> a

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
with most of my Phalaenopsis it's not a

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.370 
with most of my Phalaenopsis it's not a
general<00:02:05.490> rule<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.630> happen<00:02:06.930> sometimes

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
general rule but it can happen sometimes

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.230 
general rule but it can happen sometimes
and<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.009> doesn't<00:02:08.340> mean<00:02:08.550> anything

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
and it doesn't mean anything

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.450 
and it doesn't mean anything
just<00:02:09.960> keep<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.200> mind<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:11.070> actual

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
just keep in mind that the actual

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.940 
just keep in mind that the actual
difference<00:02:11.850> is<00:02:12.060> slight<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:13.020> very<00:02:13.260> subtile

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
difference is slight it's very subtile

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.040 
difference is slight it's very subtile
so<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> need<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.640> be<00:02:14.760> very<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.600> need<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.870> pay<00:02:16.020> a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
so you need to be very you need to pay a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.840 
so you need to be very you need to pay a
lot<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.380> attention<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.830> actually<00:02:17.310> notice<00:02:17.520> it

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
lot of attention to actually notice it

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.500 
lot of attention to actually notice it
this<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.260> case<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.800> healthy

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
this is in the case of a healthy

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.690

really small compared to the previous

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.280 
really small compared to the previous
flower<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:35.040> then<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:36.240> definitely<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.720> sign<00:02:36.960> of

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
flower is then it's definitely a sign of

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.100 
flower is then it's definitely a sign of
a<00:02:37.500> problem<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.820> stress<00:02:39.180> factor<00:02:39.480> for<00:02:39.960> the
