00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
lens you're going to get some fringing

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.380 
lens you're going to get some fringing
on<00:01:47.219> the<00:01:47.399> outside<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.030> you're<00:01:48.119> going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.299> see

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
on the outside so you're going to see

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.060 
on the outside so you're going to see
these<00:01:48.479> little<00:01:48.630> dark<00:01:48.960> corners<00:01:49.999> but<00:01:50.999> you<00:01:51.479> could

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
these little dark corners but you could

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.039 
these little dark corners but you could
use<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> nap<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.579> filmic<00:01:54.090> Pro<00:01:55.009> shoot<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:57.049> 2k

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
use a nap like filmic Pro shoot it in 2k

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.370 
use a nap like filmic Pro shoot it in 2k
resolution<00:01:58.320> which<00:01:58.950> they<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.689> and<00:02:00.689> then<00:02:00.869> scan

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
resolution which they have and then scan

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.989 
resolution which they have and then scan
down<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> little<00:02:02.070> bit<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.549> post-production

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
down a little bit in post-production

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:04.489 
down a little bit in post-production

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
just going to try and do it one one-hand

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:06.350 
just going to try and do it one one-hand
it<00:02:52.569> but<00:02:53.400> what<00:02:54.400> little<00:02:54.430> little<00:02:54.970> faster

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.800 

okay<00:03:07.360> so<00:03:07.750> that<00:03:07.930> opened<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.349> up<00:03:08.470> let<00:03:09.010> me<00:03:09.040> see

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
okay so that opened it up let me see

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.600 
okay so that opened it up let me see
let's<00:03:10.810> peel<00:03:11.110> away<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.379> plastic<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:14.739> that

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
let's peel away the plastic and that

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.240 
let's peel away the plastic and that
should<00:03:15.970> be<00:03:16.239> enough<00:03:16.659> to<00:03:17.349> get<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.680> going<00:03:17.890> so

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
should be enough to get it going so

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:26.460 
should be enough to get it going so
let's<00:03:18.430> put<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:18.760> back<00:03:19.030> in<00:03:20.580> here<00:03:21.580> we<00:03:21.730> go<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:25.690> as

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
let's put that back in here we go and as

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.680 
let's put that back in here we go and as
you<00:03:26.590> can<00:03:26.709> see<00:03:26.739> just<00:03:26.920> maybe<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.400> little<00:03:27.849> bit<00:03:28.450> more

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
you can see just maybe a little bit more

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.050 
you can see just maybe a little bit more
up<00:03:29.080> on<00:03:29.319> top<00:03:29.560> there<00:03:29.620> just<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.280> make<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.549> perfect

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
up on top there just to make it perfect

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.949 
up on top there just to make it perfect
so<00:03:31.209> let's<00:03:31.480> do<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.750> one<00:03:31.900> more<00:03:32.049> time<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:37.239> on

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
so let's do that one more time and on

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.569 
so let's do that one more time and on
the<00:03:38.140> dremel<00:03:38.560> tool<00:03:38.739> one<00:03:38.950> more<00:03:39.069> time<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.519> I'll

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
the dremel tool one more time and I'll

00:03:39.579 --> 00:04:04.570 
the dremel tool one more time and I'll
hold<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:39.879> nice<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.269> safe

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.540 

okay<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:05.910> should<00:04:06.150> work<00:04:06.330> really<00:04:06.720> well

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
okay and that should work really well

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.780 
okay and that should work really well
clean<00:04:08.550> it<00:04:08.580> up<00:04:08.820> a<00:04:08.940> little<00:04:08.970> bit<00:04:10.790> there's

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
clean it up a little bit there's

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.370 
clean it up a little bit there's
actually<00:04:12.150> some<00:04:12.330> other<00:04:12.480> parts<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:12.990> the<00:04:13.080> dremel

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
actually some other parts in the dremel

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.860 
actually some other parts in the dremel
tool<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:13.800> like<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.430> little<00:04:14.970> buffers<00:04:15.570> and
