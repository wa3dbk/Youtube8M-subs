00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
to to keep doing more damage as he goes

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.060 
to to keep doing more damage as he goes
and<00:00:43.789> damages<00:00:44.359> me<00:00:44.539> but<00:00:45.199> the<00:00:45.649> good<00:00:45.859> thing<00:00:46.039> about

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
and damages me but the good thing about

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.700 
and damages me but the good thing about
having<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.940> brown<00:00:47.269> mammoth<00:00:47.659> here<00:00:47.870> is<00:00:48.050> that<00:00:48.649> I

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
having the brown mammoth here is that I

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.649 
having the brown mammoth here is that I
have<00:00:48.799> the<00:00:49.039> variability<00:00:49.579> which<00:00:49.969> means<00:00:50.210> I<00:00:50.420> can

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
have the variability which means I can

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.079 
have the variability which means I can
avoid<00:00:51.409> the<00:00:51.649> eyes<00:00:51.860> too<00:00:52.329> so<00:00:53.329> we're<00:00:54.110> gonna<00:00:54.320> do

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
avoid the eyes too so we're gonna do

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.569 
avoid the eyes too so we're gonna do
come<00:00:56.089> back<00:00:56.210> again<00:00:56.479> which<00:00:56.890> won't<00:00:57.890> actually<00:00:58.190> do

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
come back again which won't actually do

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.049 
come back again which won't actually do
as<00:00:59.119> much<00:00:59.449> damage<00:00:59.479> because<00:01:00.289> I<00:01:00.649> have<00:01:01.399> much<00:01:01.760> more

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
as much damage because I have much more

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.329 
as much damage because I have much more
health<00:01:02.329> than<00:01:02.510> him<00:01:02.719> but<00:01:03.409> that's<00:01:03.920> a<00:01:04.009> good<00:01:04.129> thing

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
health than him but that's a good thing

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.279 
health than him but that's a good thing
and<00:01:04.489> he<00:01:05.030> keeps<00:01:05.500> casting<00:01:06.500> frostbite<00:01:06.979> here<00:01:07.220> and

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
and he keeps casting frostbite here and

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.429 
and he keeps casting frostbite here and
down<00:01:09.289> he<00:01:09.440> goes<00:01:09.470> at

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
down he goes at

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.340 
down he goes at
yeah<00:01:11.950> what<00:01:12.159> is<00:01:12.280> this<00:01:12.490> half<00:01:13.240> of<00:01:13.390> my<00:01:13.600> health<00:01:13.869> now

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
obviously because he's under it I'll

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.599 
obviously because he's under it I'll
have<00:01:16.929> to<00:01:17.109> survive<00:01:17.289> a<00:01:17.469> couple<00:01:17.979> of<00:01:18.069> more<00:01:18.310> rounds

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:18.609

first and a week against week against
the<00:03:14.239> critters<00:03:14.569> and<00:03:14.870> then<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:15.799> just<00:03:16.010> can

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
the critters and then you just can

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.990 
the critters and then you just can
continue<00:03:16.879> and<00:03:17.980> poison<00:03:18.980> him

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.080

it's pretty easy to to win this way you

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.720 
it's pretty easy to to win this way you
could<00:04:12.000> probably<00:04:12.799> on<00:04:13.799> live<00:04:14.099> where<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.430> have<00:04:14.700> a
