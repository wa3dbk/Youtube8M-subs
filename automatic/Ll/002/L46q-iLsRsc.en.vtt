threat<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:52.790> said<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.150> work<00:01:53.240> eradicating

them<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:54.380> fought<00:01:55.100> many<00:01:55.310> evolutionary

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
them I fought many evolutionary

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.390 
them I fought many evolutionary

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
last in the end all that stood in my way

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.950 
last in the end all that stood in my way
was<00:02:04.310> a<00:02:04.340> creature<00:02:04.640> capable<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.450> giving<00:02:05.600> birth

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
naturally I came close to death but

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.720

before my eyes and a small Metroid
emerged<00:02:28.989> since<00:02:29.989> I<00:02:30.170> was<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.470> first<00:02:30.709> thing<00:02:30.980> it

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
emerged since I was the first thing it

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.520

saw<00:02:31.310> after<00:02:31.640> hatching<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.150> baby<00:02:33.050> seemed<00:02:33.410> to

saw after hatching the baby seemed to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:43.039 
saw after hatching the baby seemed to
think<00:02:33.709> I<00:02:33.860> was<00:02:34.040> its<00:02:34.220> mother

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.020 

at<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.560> time<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.920> Galactic<00:02:45.370> Federation<00:02:45.400> was

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
at the time the Galactic Federation was

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.670 
at the time the Galactic Federation was
looking<00:02:46.360> for<00:02:46.540> alternate<00:02:46.959> sources<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.500> energy

looking for alternate sources of energy

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.399 
looking for alternate sources of energy
it<00:02:48.640> came<00:02:48.849> to<00:02:49.030> me<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.390> unique<00:02:49.659> physiology

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
it came to me that the unique physiology

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.050 
it came to me that the unique physiology
of<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.620> Metroid's<00:02:51.069> might<00:02:51.310> be<00:02:51.489> valuable<00:02:51.730> to

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
of the Metroid's might be valuable to

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.600 
of the Metroid's might be valuable to
the<00:02:52.269> energy<00:02:52.659> researchers<00:02:53.349> so<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.190> took<00:02:54.310> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
the energy researchers so I took the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.610 
the energy researchers so I took the
helpless<00:02:55.000> baby<00:02:55.269> with<00:02:55.569> me<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:55.989> entrusted<00:02:56.500> its
