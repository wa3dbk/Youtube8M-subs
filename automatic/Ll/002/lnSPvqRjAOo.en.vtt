00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.760
 good 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.600
 I know that not long ago that rises 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:13.080
 video but with the announcement of the 37 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.879
 they thought it was something you my game 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.879
 favorite of all time so 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.019
 and the truth is that I have been there all day 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.809
 working out on the mobile without 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.650
 internet because they were say something 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:31.199
 special but silence 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.270
 the market nothing pending of internet 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.270
 until 4 in the afternoon more or less 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.660
 today 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.660
 or not yesterday afternoon 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.960
 once again it is the remake that is not going to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.500
 make world 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.770
 and this afternoon with the fluid and internet 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.370
 of the internet on the mobile again 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.920
 I find an avalanche of messages 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.390
 telling me a crime 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.009
 it really scares me from the start and gives me 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.480
 a lot of confidence from the square team 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.730
 enix now 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.860
 I like them for 13, unlike the 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.580
 most of the world so it seems but 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.650
 even more sign 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.210
 I am prejudging the scope is like this 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.790
 maybe the team when it seems like a 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.070
 really final 71 because it's not the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.450
 adequate but because it will not be original and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.370
 when you see and because it's my game 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.640
 but that's how many do 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.640
 tests 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.880
 I have not seen the video yet and 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.390
 this can be right here 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.390
 prepared 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:49.200
 and so the mind of what I think to the 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.880
 respect I'm a little nervous 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.520
 is that it has really been that 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.009
 make some bread the 7 but is that of 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.289
 agree to follow the movie so 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.299
 close so every day every day I have been given 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.979
 what would he do with the hi still 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.200
 I do not know anything because they see new capture of 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.050
 yourself new capture from the cloud 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.300
 to them he will do the rest 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.760
 and then see the intense that misfortune 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.500
 what a waste of time for stability 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.080
 looking for information looking for images 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.080
 virgin of the remake 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.080
 ah 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.049
 the doctor was poor 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.510
 I got bored of this 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.209
 but not better 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.750
 the fire that they see their fans 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.230
 Huichapan of height 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.220
 Y 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.940
 but there is a band man or soloist 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.989
 nowadays when they kept ways 40 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.989
 broadway 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.010
 3 days are coming back 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.010
 wrong 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.350
 mortal 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.140
 the person who is not going to be 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.140
 I'm fine 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.620
 there's our any tip 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.570
 In our view, we have not seen much 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.570
 thing or a lot and it's already really 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.730
 and that there are people in a background 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.760
 surely physically know why this 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.760
 is the ninth 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:44.290
 is that sometimes it does not seem crazy to me 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.290
 things now 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.400
 I've already put a little bit of everything 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.700
 Let's see 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.740
 I hope there is something something cool 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.220
 I do not want to have too many 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.820
 hopes 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.000
 as it happened with the movie 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.360
 I hope you are very faithful to what 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.740
 they make very faithful what they reconstruct that 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.080
 do not change views that do not 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.790
 combinations that do not change the story 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.400
 and finally the way to tell it 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:28.210
 also the graphics and everything 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.200
 dance as for better but that vision 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.200
 of that game be the same 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.150
 I have inclusion 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.620
 that everyone does what he wants and that 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.410
 many people complaining that others 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.150
 rejoice is not my case I love that 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.830
 the people leaving I would like to have the 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.020
 same hope that they 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.640
 I want to see it well to see we have 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.640
 scared to see the video 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.860
 as it woke up to the feelings of 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:10.009
 say when I was little and played 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:14.300
 constantly about 11 times in a row 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:16.879
 no time was the fifteenth or sixth 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.430
 that the games for a couple of years as 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.130
 much 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.410
 recalling all of the careers of 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:27.540
 soccer getting all the 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.540
 invocations killing all weapons 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:36.750
 agassi I would like to go over it again 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.050
 I understand that something is new in the 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.050
 graphics 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.240
 in imitate 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.270
 until the translation this for me is 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.430
 wonderful 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.080
 you do not have such mythical things as 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.000
 led today 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.409
 text changes Aeris was 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.370
 a very special girl 

00:06:54.409 --> 00:07:01.050
 I was very depressed 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.050
 that objectively that's bullshit 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.330
 but like those 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:15.520
 here do not live if I have no interest in 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:18.650
 world of video games that interests me 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.360
 thanks to this page 7 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.710
 and I do not want to roll up much more because 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.620
 I've been a long time 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.969
 to see what comes out to see what happens I hope that 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.910
 be all good hopefully 

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:33.060
 the ugliest 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:35.400
 but we will give you a chance to 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.289
 follow the news I will try to be the 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.529
 hayes minimum and that's 

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:44.550
 and nothing you see the video because thank you 

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:46.440
 I hope it was too bad 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:49.370
 and this next you're on when it will be 

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.370
 friends
