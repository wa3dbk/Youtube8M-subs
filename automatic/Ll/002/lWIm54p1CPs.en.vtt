00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.730
 this video is going to be very short and it's a 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.710
 video that by the way has been very requested 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.409
 for you through facebook so 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.749
 let's talk about the different cuts 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:14.989
 in wedding dress do not find the 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:18.080
 better way to explain it more than with 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:19.400
 images so there you go remember that 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.580
 I care that we are chubby 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.039
 low high low girls girls as 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.119
 there's always a dress for us like that 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.119
 that we do not swallow 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.900
 and traditional cut is a way 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.090
 tight the torso and from the waist a 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.770
 Flared skirt is ideal for 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.780
 fancy girlfriends who want to look 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.620
 like a princess fairy tale 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.620
 your wedding day 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.750
 the princess cut definitely elevates 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.370
 more to the people who are what 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.860
 high enough and what 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.860
 sufficiently slender with their curves 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.500
 natural as the dress skirt comes out 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.930
 of the waist is vertical and snug 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.730
 body this cuts ideal for brides 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.730
 romantic and elegant 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.080
 this cut is my favorite because despite 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.450
 of being stuck to the course the skirt falls in 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.030
 a slight form of what it does to us 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.040
 feel very comfortable this cut is 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.920
 perfect for brides who want to see 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.130
 elegant and at the same time simple that great 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.130
 day 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.300
 the empire court is characterized because 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.300
 just below the bust line comes out 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.010
 the skirt and it's loose not in carved and 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.260
 This dress is ideal for the bride and groom 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.770
 They want to give her dress a very touch 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.770
 old 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.600
 and so is the dress type siren 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.700
 It is characterized by being straight envelope 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.280
 and very close to the body and you have to 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.380
 admit it women this dress is ideal 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.100
 for those brides with a body 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.100
