00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.980
 Jose Luis solution as is welcome 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.480
 and the truth is that clearly clearly that 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.910
 is one of the favorites in this tournament 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.560
 the people who visit 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.450
 and you who won it because you see that 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.100
 you started with that voice you have marked the 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.140
 difference that not everything that is repeated 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.270
 in almost all your performance is up to 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.920
 like half of you come singing from a 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.090
 way you just did a trick like that 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.470
 like you sang a girl and 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.570
 you turned the stage singing more 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.400

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.260
 enter singing in that condition from 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.970
 the beginning of the song with sun and 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.970
