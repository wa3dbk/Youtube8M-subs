kinetic<00:00:20.640> field<00:00:20.789> because<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.150> not<00:00:21.270> level<00:00:21.420> two

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
kinetic field because it's not level two

whether or not our gliding level two is
ever<00:00:26.189> acceptable<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.269> said<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.660> was

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
ever acceptable and I said it was

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.509 
ever acceptable and I said it was
because<00:00:28.109> one<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:28.949> better<00:00:29.130> farming

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
because one it's better farming

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.099 
because one it's better farming

that<00:06:45.180> I<00:06:45.210> don't<00:06:45.480> think<00:06:45.630> it<00:06:45.720> was<00:06:45.810> possible<00:06:46.020> for

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
that I don't think it was possible for

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.940 
that I don't think it was possible for
them<00:06:46.680> to<00:06:46.710> come<00:06:46.920> back<00:06:46.980> but<00:06:48.530> they<00:06:49.530> tried<00:06:49.800> out

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
them to come back but they tried out

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.520 
them to come back but they tried out
anyway<00:06:50.310> not<00:06:50.580> a<00:06:50.610> pad<00:06:50.940> like<00:06:51.300> the<00:06:51.780> the<00:06:52.260> place

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
anyway not a pad like the the place

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.800 
anyway not a pad like the the place
overall<00:06:52.920> like<00:06:53.760> bottom<00:06:54.180> lane<00:06:54.300> push<00:06:54.570> and

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
overall like bottom lane push and

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.180 
overall like bottom lane push and
everything<00:06:55.080> else<00:06:55.230> they<00:06:55.410> were<00:06:55.500> all<00:06:55.620> kind<00:06:56.130> of

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190 
everything else they were all kind of

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.890 
everything else they were all kind of
the<00:06:56.310> right<00:06:56.460> ideas<00:06:56.850> they<00:06:57.030> just<00:06:57.210> lost<00:06:57.450> so<00:06:57.750> much

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
the right ideas they just lost so much

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.050 
the right ideas they just lost so much
control<00:06:58.380> in<00:06:58.470> the<00:06:58.560> early<00:06:58.800> game<00:06:59.010> and<00:06:59.310> it<00:06:59.790> just

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
control in the early game and it just

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.610 
control in the early game and it just
built<00:07:00.300> up<00:07:00.450> too<00:07:00.660> much<00:07:00.780> against<00:07:01.140> them<00:07:01.350> that<00:07:01.530> it

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
built up too much against them that it

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.470 
built up too much against them that it
wasn't<00:07:01.890> possible<00:07:02.010> no<00:07:02.400> matter<00:07:02.430> how<00:07:02.850> many<00:07:03.030> you

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480 
wasn't possible no matter how many you

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.780 
wasn't possible no matter how many you
know<00:07:03.710> strategically<00:07:04.710> sound<00:07:05.010> plays<00:07:05.340> they<00:07:05.550> pull

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:05.790 
know strategically sound plays they pull

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.460 
know strategically sound plays they pull
that<00:07:05.970> it<00:07:06.150> wasn't<00:07:06.390> going<00:07:06.480> to<00:07:06.540> be<00:07:06.600> one<00:07:06.840> victory

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
that it wasn't going to be one victory

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.340 
that it wasn't going to be one victory
yeah<00:07:07.950> they<00:07:08.940> need<00:07:09.900> to<00:07:09.960> go<00:07:10.050> back<00:07:10.200> to<00:07:10.320> the

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.350 
yeah they need to go back to the

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.620 
yeah they need to go back to the
drafting<00:07:10.800> ball<00:07:10.980> as<00:07:11.160> far<00:07:11.190> as<00:07:11.640> a<00:07:11.670> not<00:07:12.300> even<00:07:12.510> just

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630 
drafting ball as far as a not even just

goes<00:07:14.670> of<00:07:14.910> it<00:07:15.060> so<00:07:15.510> what<00:07:15.870> they<00:07:16.080> do<00:07:16.140> have

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 
goes of it so what they do have

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.480 
goes of it so what they do have
themselves<00:07:16.590> a<00:07:16.800> little<00:07:16.860> bit<00:07:17.040> a<00:07:17.100> moment<00:07:17.430> to
