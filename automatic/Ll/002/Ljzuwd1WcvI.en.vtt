00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 very good kids here we are a 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.040
 new video this I bring you a video 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.960
 interesting that has come up tonight 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.250
 by the head has been thinking I've 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.660
 said good why not make a video 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.440
 as you see in the miniature a boat 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.260
 Giant why in gta 5 of him that 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.960
 no huge ships or a low ferry 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.490
 jesse like a cruise ship or some ship 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.470
 a cruise ship or a transatlantic or something 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.930
 so be of quite dimensions 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.970
 raised because there is no in this in gta 5 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.560
 online I also give the example that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.539
 in no other objective does it seem to me that 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.189
 there has been such a big ship masters has not 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.450
 there was no ship that a ship that is 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.870
 as big as the one I put the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.460
 miniature but good why not 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.579
 I understand the truth I do not understand 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.379
 because it's one thing that 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.210
 I would like to have a boat 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.710
 great also I tell you that it would be a bit 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.929
 boring because it would be very slow but 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.409
 well then that was explained the truth I 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:53.030
 I played 33 Call of Duty 3 and GT as 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.979
 the 3 that I have played I have not seen any 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.780
 ferry no ship that has been named 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:58.879
 previously so be very big 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.320
 so I asked myself a question last night 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.359
 why do not you have a ship like that 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.280
 has or why they did not put it 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.110
 graphically they can put anything 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.909
 there are people who study this and know how to do 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.369
 a lot of things I'm already seeing the 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.799
 videogames of now put fighters put 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.960
 some effects of the host in the campaign 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.690
 for example it looks but and why not 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.880
 they put a huge ship because you do not put it 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.920
 I'm going to give my opinion I want it to be 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.959
 feedback on the channel and you tell me 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.000
 your opinion in comments please 

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.380
 it's a theme that came to me like this one night 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.789
 that I have decided to make the video of 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.929
 video to see what you think 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.209
 and well I'm going to do it, I think my 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.250
 opinion is the following a huge ship 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:35.600
 it enters a lot through the eyes obviously 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.729
 with as soon as you have seen the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.590
 miniature aviv entered directly but 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.030
 what happens that you use it llosa for 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.009
 example I think that a video game for 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.060
 do things that you do not normally do in 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.520
 real life 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.820
 for example I would run every host to hit you 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.049
 a having an accident and do not die 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.600
 things you do not usually do in life 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.360
 real for example a very large ship does not 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.159
 I think it had much speed 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.039
 would make it so realistic that I did not have so much 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.840
 speed as we wanted 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.820
 expand we took the boat that is very 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.429
 big is I do not know what but we would leave it 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.099
 to use two days because it is not very 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.260
 striking because the boat with the by the 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.819
 ship by sea ​​to bear wherever and 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.560
 at the end you get tired of how slow will not 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.209
 I know that's my opinion. I think not what 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.650
 they put on that because it's so slow and 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.850
 final you get tired they said bad for 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.040
 what are we going to put this if I'm not going to 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.080
 use nobody I do not know I think that's 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.160
 my opinion everything goes through the eyes then 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.049
 we let it use until what 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.760
 we try and see what a crap I 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.590
 I think it would be a fucking shit the truth 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.970
 about putting a huge ship but it would be 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.680
 blue or not to use it a couple of 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.840
 sometimes even if it's standing there but good 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.459
 to use it would not be bad please 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.739
 As I said, leave your opinion in 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.690
