00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
making the barrel curl so now it is a

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.930 
making the barrel curl so now it is a
bit<00:04:56.350> time-consuming<00:04:56.620> to<00:04:57.250> create<00:04:57.520> this<00:04:57.670> look

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
bit time-consuming to create this look

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
however it is well worth it in the end

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.780 
actually sing oh you guys do not want to
hear<00:05:50.360> my<00:05:50.510> singing<00:05:50.750> voice<00:05:50.870> awful<00:05:51.770> but<00:05:52.280> yeah<00:05:52.460> so

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
hear my singing voice awful but yeah so

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.720 
hear my singing voice awful but yeah so
that's<00:05:53.150> the<00:05:53.390> last<00:05:53.600> one

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
that's the last one

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.190 
that's the last one
so<00:05:55.730> this<00:05:55.940> is<00:05:56.090> what<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.300> end<00:05:56.450> results<00:05:56.960> look

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
so this is what the end results look

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.020 
so this is what the end results look
like<00:05:57.230> and<00:05:57.680> I<00:05:57.980> actually<00:05:58.130> kept<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:58.610> curls<00:05:58.910> in

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
like and I actually kept the curls in

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.180 
like and I actually kept the curls in
for<00:05:59.240> about<00:05:59.420> 30<00:05:59.990> minutes<00:06:00.290> before<00:06:00.800> I<00:06:00.830> started

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
for about 30 minutes before I started

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.900 
for about 30 minutes before I started
taking<00:06:01.310> them<00:06:01.580> out<00:06:03.190> now<00:06:04.190> to<00:06:04.250> remove<00:06:04.580> the<00:06:04.730> bobby

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
taking them out now to remove the bobby

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.640 
taking them out now to remove the bobby
pins<00:06:05.210> I<00:06:05.330> think<00:06:05.510> it's<00:06:05.630> best<00:06:05.840> to<00:06:05.960> start<00:06:06.260> taking

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
pins I think it's best to start taking

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.620 
pins I think it's best to start taking
out<00:06:06.770> the<00:06:06.920> ones<00:06:07.100> at<00:06:07.250> the<00:06:07.340> back<00:06:07.550> first<00:06:07.970> but<00:06:08.420> I<00:06:08.450> was

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
out the ones at the back first but I was

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.180 
out the ones at the back first but I was
pretty<00:06:08.810> much<00:06:08.960> all<00:06:09.260> over<00:06:09.500> the<00:06:09.590> place<00:06:09.800> with<00:06:10.040> this

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
pretty much all over the place with this

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.240 
pretty much all over the place with this
one<00:06:10.460> so<00:06:11.030> yeah<00:06:11.480> just<00:06:12.290> start<00:06:12.500> at<00:06:12.620> the<00:06:12.650> back<00:06:12.920> and

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
one so yeah just start at the back and

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.280 
one so yeah just start at the back and
pretty<00:06:13.430> much<00:06:13.640> work<00:06:13.880> your<00:06:14.090> way<00:06:14.210> up<00:06:14.390> to<00:06:14.420> the<00:06:14.690> top

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
pretty much work your way up to the top

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:27.230

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.530 
so this is pretty much what the hair
looks<00:06:29.740> like<00:06:30.190> once<00:06:30.490> the<00:06:30.670> bobby<00:06:30.880> pins<00:06:31.180> are<00:06:31.390> out

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540
