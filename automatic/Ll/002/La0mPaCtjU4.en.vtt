it's<00:00:12.240> just<00:00:12.480> thin<00:00:12.719> like<00:00:13.290> air<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.830> it's<00:00:14.790> so

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
it's just thin like air and it's so

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.570 
it's just thin like air and it's so
expensive<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.379> just<00:00:16.590> does<00:00:16.890> like<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
expensive and it just does like the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
processor is so weak and it's thin and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.609 
processor is so weak and it's thin and
look<00:00:20.550> like<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> like<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> makeup<00:00:22.080> bag<00:00:22.350> like<00:00:22.590> a

oh yeah let me get like the most
expensive<00:00:40.320> computer<00:00:40.920> because<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.280> thin<00:00:41.489> but

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
expensive computer because it's thin but

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.910 
expensive computer because it's thin but
the<00:00:42.000> processor<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> shit<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.379> know<00:00:43.500> yeah

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the processor a shit but you know yeah

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.740 
the processor a shit but you know yeah
because<00:00:44.040> thin<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:45.059> know<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.300> really<00:00:45.420> thin
