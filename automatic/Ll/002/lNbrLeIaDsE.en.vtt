00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hi there, you are watching a video on the channel 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.680
 android insider dot ru my name is Ilya 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.130
 Ilyin 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.950
 and in my hands a new smartphone tablet 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.550
 sony is xperia t2 ultra 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.110
 dual 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:25.080
 let's see what it is 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:27.269
 the device is traditional bad cardboard 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.130
 sony package with a short set 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.590
 information about what awaits us inside 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.200
 For the device itself, opening it, we will see 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.660
 the device itself is sony xperia t2 ultra 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.370
 dual sim put it off for a moment 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.170
 let's see what else to produce put 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.579
 in the box 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.829
 devices can also be detected 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.840
 the headset is suddenly becoming 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.300
 popular again with manufacturers 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.910
 mobile phones droplets as well 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.920
 charger and micro usb cable to 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.440
 he is not a small set of waste paper 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.750
 there is nothing particularly outstanding in stock 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.309
 the kit itself will not be able to find 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.100
 we don't need to postpone it anymore 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.260
 and proceed to inspect the device itself 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.970
 it's all the same mind not balance design 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.380
 which sony continues 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.000
 still use your devices 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.159
 dimensions this device only 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.990
 little inferior to last year's goliath 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.909
 among the tablet phones 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.159
 this sony xperia z ultra is just here 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.650
 six inches versus six with virtually 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.840
 half and resolution of this display 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.189
 just wait though for someone it 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.170
 It can actually be just as 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.240
 someone quite happy and so 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.070
 permissions on this device though 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.060
 the display looks pretty cool quite 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.220
 and quite for its size 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.530
 quality and complaints are not special 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.900
 causes nowhere and technology 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.299
 improve the input pictures this and 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.210
 triluminos display technology 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.460
 and the second generation maps engine right 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.409
 there is everything that we could see before 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.759
 principle only in flagship solutions 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.290
 main technical companies 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.430
 characteristics of this device from 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.890
 of course quad - core processor 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.350
 qualcomm snapdragon 400 frequency 1 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.060
 a whole 4 tenths gigahertz and gigabytes 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.560
 RAM internal memory 8 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.509
 gigabytes of which is available to the user 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.549
 about five what by modern standards 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.049
 pretty little set in a couple of games and 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.790
 in general, all the memory is practically 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.439
 It ended, of course, under multimedia 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.789
 data can be used and a memory card 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.560
 micro of dice la for which 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.090
 provided by the manufacturer in sony 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.129
 xperia t2 ultra 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.170
 but actually would like to still 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.670
 see a solution with a lot of 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.890
 It is the internal memory in this 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.269
 price segment device costs 17 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.069
 a half thousand rubles is managed 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.290
 device android operating system 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.540
 version 4.3 on top which runs 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.069
 xperia ray shell which company 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.349
 sony applies to the device almost 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.299
 all the diagonals present in her 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.769
 rulers and which looks pretty 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.019
 nice with regular standard 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.849
 camera control widgets and 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.290
 so similar by the way so much here 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.750
 module applied in 13 mega pixels 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.760
 which we previously could see in 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.440
 devices like sony xperia z 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.360
 izabel ie flagships of the spring of the past 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.310
 year there is a complete set 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.299
 standard add-on for cameras like 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.549
 time she first 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.110
 effects of augmented reality some 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.299
 graphic effects panoramic view 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.920
 defocusing the background rather unexpectedly 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.650
 was see face retouching mode which 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.400
 allows you to tweak your face a little 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.799
 rented person by the standards is not very 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.629
 close Russian beauty culture like 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.519
 huge amount of shadows and the 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.470
 similar quality as photo and video 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.060
 is at a fairly high level by 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.280
 one simple reason for sony 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.590
 for a long time has been using these modules in 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.970
 their devices and has already fully managed 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.440
 debug software and hardware 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.940
 interaction option device 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.680
 we have present presence 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.660
 possibility to update 2 sim cards 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.359
 both of them will operate in mode 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.579
 waiting but during the conversation one of 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.720
 they will still be unavailable for communication 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.489
 for those who have this device 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.739
 satisfied with almost all 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.299
 parameters and no need for 2 sim 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.819
 sony company provided a 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.250
 also option xperia t2 ultra 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.750
 without a second module of sim cards but with 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.010
 lte support and which is in this 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.750
 device is missing 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.090
 over the device manufacturers of course 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.739
 can not be called and despite the fact that 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.169
 some games including asphalt 8 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.900
 you can turn on the maximum graphic 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:59.790
 adjusting with them the dimensions of the display and its 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.709
 permissions can negatively affect 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.480
 on perception issued by the device 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.130
 pictures however it's all obvious on 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.200
 Amateur watching the same video including in 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.870
 such superior resolution 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.880
 at the display itself does not cause the device 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.620
 no problem xperia t2 ultra dual 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.989
 equipped with rechargeable battery 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.609
 with a capacity of 3000 milliampere hours what are you 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.320
 such a device is quite enough for 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.489
 under full load at 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.850
 attempt to maximize 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.710
 this device is in operation 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.390
 the device quietly lived out until the evening with 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.460
 five or six percent charge what 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.990
 looks pretty cool summing up 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.240
 a brief summary I would like to say that 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.780
 sony turned out pretty interesting 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.310
 phablet who are not representatives of higher 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.930
 price category value or given 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.510
 the device as I already reported is 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.310
 17 and a half thousand rubles 2 sim cards 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.260
 good display the ultimate camera and 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.700
 good case material for such 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.530
 devices leave a very, very 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.080
 good impression of the other side 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.610
 combination of diagonal and resolution as well 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.660
 8 gigabytes of internal memory can 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.910
 push away from this device 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.460
 lovers of quite demanding games 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.110
 since there all resources are directed 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.980
 it is to achieve high quality 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.500
 Pictures 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.210
 and here it will get pretty 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.370
 problematic either because you don't 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.290
 You can install a lot of good games 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.420
 either because you can't get 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.190
 from them the best picture 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.750
 But whether to buy such devices 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.430
 I think I know very well why they 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.690
 they do it so what thanks to all of you
