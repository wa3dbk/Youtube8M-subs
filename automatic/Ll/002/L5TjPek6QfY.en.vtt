00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:15.980
Yeah
This is Zambai

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.980
Coming at you

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.980
Brace yourself, brace yourself
It's real

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.170
There's a solution
To the confusion

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.680
In our world
There's a solution

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.180
To the confusion
In our world

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.220
When I open up my eyes
All that I See

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.960
Is this beautiful place
God-has-made for you and me

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.400
No matter what you go through
Live within your means

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.070
Don't hate your brother
No matter how hard it seems

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.930
Simply make the best
Of every situation

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.140
Love is all you need

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.660
It's simply just a test
Don't see it as frustration

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.020
Learn to Live in Peace

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.179
Live in Peace
oh yes

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:22.409
Learn to live in peace
oh yes

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.579
Live in Peace
oh yes

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.750
Learn to live in peace

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:42.049
It matters not where
As Long as your here

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.179
Close by my side

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:52.999
I'll go through any test
I'll climb the highest mountain

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:57.229
Just to make you mine

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.509
I'll simply make the best
Of every situation

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:09.349
Your loves all I need

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:38.431
It's simply just a test
Don't see it as frustration

00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:39.431
Learn to Live in Peace

00:02:39.431 --> 00:02:40.431
Break:
Check yourself and the life that you're living

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:42.420
It matter no how much you get
But it's how much that you're giving

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.720
Before you see the light
You must first see what's missing

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.330
Open up your eyes

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.350
Be not a part of the problem
But a part of the solution

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:59.200
Let's get together and end this confusion
This thing is real it is not an illusion

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:16.890
Check your situation and

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:35.610
Live in Peace

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:44.900
oh yes
Learn to live in peace

00:03:44.900 --> 00:04:02.090
oh yes
Live in Peace

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:12.610

Learn to live in peace
