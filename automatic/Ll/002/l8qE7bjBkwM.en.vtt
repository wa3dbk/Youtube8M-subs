what<00:02:11.590> is<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.890> curriculum<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.700> structure<00:02:13.150> of

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
what is the curriculum and structure of

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.620 
what is the curriculum and structure of
the<00:02:13.599> courses<00:02:14.110> in<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.349> program<00:02:15.450> well<00:02:16.450> it's<00:02:16.569> a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
the courses in the program well it's a

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.320 
the courses in the program well it's a
four-year<00:02:16.989> program<00:02:17.440> actually<00:02:18.209> we<00:02:19.209> have

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
four-year program actually we have

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.830 
four-year program actually we have
recently<00:02:19.569> revised<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:21.370> get<00:02:21.880> get<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.690> so

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
recently revised it to get get it so

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.420 
recently revised it to get get it so
that<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.019> person<00:02:23.200> could<00:02:23.500> actually<00:02:23.739> complete<00:02:24.280> it

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
that a person could actually complete it

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.100 
that a person could actually complete it
in<00:02:24.519> four<00:02:24.760> years<00:02:24.970> they<00:02:25.750> they<00:02:26.260> cover<00:02:27.870> really<00:02:28.870> the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
in four years they they cover really the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.620 
in four years they they cover really the
four<00:02:29.440> main<00:02:29.830> what<00:02:30.280> we<00:02:30.400> would<00:02:30.580> call<00:02:30.730> upstream

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
four main what we would call upstream

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.590 
four main what we would call upstream
petroleum<00:02:32.260> engineering<00:02:33.330> disciplines<00:02:34.330> those

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
petroleum engineering disciplines those

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.870 
petroleum engineering disciplines those
are<00:02:34.810> drilling<00:02:35.310> which<00:02:36.310> are<00:02:36.519> primarily

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
engineers to go to work I mean that's

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.080 
engineers to go to work I mean that's
basically<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.959> issue<00:03:02.230> they<00:03:02.590> want<00:03:02.859> jobs<00:03:03.220> the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
basically the issue they want jobs the

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.590 
basically the issue they want jobs the
industry<00:03:04.570> wants<00:03:04.780> them<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:07.120> course<00:03:07.150> we

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
industry wants them and of course we

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.319 
industry wants them and of course we
we've<00:03:08.019> got<00:03:08.320> to<00:03:08.500> really<00:03:08.890> hammer<00:03:09.609> in<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.030> issues

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
we've got to really hammer in the issues

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.460 
we've got to really hammer in the issues
of<00:03:10.359> ethics<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:10.989> safety<00:03:11.350> and<00:03:11.620> competence<00:03:12.400> so

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
of ethics and safety and competence so

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.479 
of ethics and safety and competence so
those<00:03:14.470> are<00:03:14.620> my<00:03:14.650> goals<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.190> we<00:03:15.340> can<00:03:15.430> achieve

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
those are my goals and we can achieve

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.699 
those are my goals and we can achieve
those<00:03:15.820> then<00:03:16.180> we're<00:03:16.720> in<00:03:16.810> good<00:03:16.840> shape<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.620> know

company's play a role with internships

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.879 
company's play a role with internships
also<00:03:37.120> our<00:03:37.329> students<00:03:37.840> we're<00:03:38.350> very<00:03:38.380> interested

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
also our students we're very interested

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.199 
also our students we're very interested
in<00:03:39.250> our<00:03:39.340> students<00:03:39.730> get<00:03:39.819> real<00:03:40.030> world

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
in our students get real world

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.840 
in our students get real world
experience<00:03:40.389> and<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:42.160> companies<00:03:42.489> provide

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
experience and the companies provide

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.390 
experience and the companies provide
that<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:44.470> we<00:03:44.680> have<00:03:44.799> a<00:03:44.829> number<00:03:45.040> of<00:03:45.190> our

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
that and so we have a number of our

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.789 
that and so we have a number of our
students<00:03:45.819> who<00:03:46.569> are<00:03:46.750> doing<00:03:46.900> internships<00:03:47.500> right

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
students who are doing internships right

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.559 
students who are doing internships right
now<00:03:48.010> this<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.430> one<00:03:48.609> of<00:03:48.639> the<00:03:48.790> advantages<00:03:49.180> that

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
now this is one of the advantages that

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.979 
now this is one of the advantages that
you<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:50.079> age<00:03:50.260> students<00:03:50.920> have<00:03:51.160> over<00:03:51.819> a<00:03:52.090> student

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
you of age students have over a student

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.710 
you of age students have over a student
living<00:03:53.200> far<00:03:53.560> from<00:03:53.590> Houston<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.459> that<00:03:55.299> is<00:03:55.480> that

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
living far from Houston and that is that

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.240 
living far from Houston and that is that
you<00:03:55.840> can<00:03:55.989> do<00:03:56.079> an<00:03:56.170> internship<00:03:56.500> during<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:57.010> year

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
you can do an internship during the year

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.330 
you can do an internship during the year
not<00:03:57.459> just<00:03:57.700> during<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.239> summer<00:03:59.070> so<00:04:00.070> I<00:04:00.100> guess

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
not just during the summer so I guess

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.740 
not just during the summer so I guess
the<00:04:00.549> benefits<00:04:00.970> of

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
the benefits of

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.450 
the benefits of
being<00:04:01.930> in<00:04:02.080> Houston<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.830> trying<00:04:03.100> to<00:04:03.160> look<00:04:03.310> for

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
being in Houston and trying to look for

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.570 
being in Houston and trying to look for
an<00:04:03.520> internship<00:04:03.880> is<00:04:05.160> like<00:04:06.160> when<00:04:06.310> you're<00:04:06.460> in

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
an internship is like when you're in

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.190 
an internship is like when you're in
Houston<00:04:06.970> all<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.210> oil<00:04:07.360> companies<00:04:07.750> are<00:04:07.930> here

is<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.690> know<00:04:16.780> energy<00:04:17.109> base<00:04:17.290> of<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:18.070> world<00:04:18.280> I

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
is you know energy base of the world I

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.520 
is you know energy base of the world I
guess<00:04:18.510> usually<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.600> summer<00:04:19.780> internships<00:04:20.290> are

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
guess usually the summer internships are

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.000 
guess usually the summer internships are
in<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.040> field<00:04:21.280> but<00:04:22.380> for<00:04:23.380> your<00:04:23.500> first<00:04:23.680> one<00:04:23.860> if

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
in the field but for your first one if

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.260 
in the field but for your first one if
you<00:04:24.130> have<00:04:24.280> two<00:04:24.430> summers<00:04:24.760> left<00:04:24.880> you<00:04:25.060> do<00:04:25.180> the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
you have two summers left you do the

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.970 
you have two summers left you do the
first<00:04:25.480> one<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.810> field<00:04:25.990> second<00:04:26.380> one<00:04:26.470> in<00:04:26.590> office

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
first one the field second one in office

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.430 
first one the field second one in office
and<00:04:27.160> a<00:04:27.850> big<00:04:28.120> benefit<00:04:28.540> is<00:04:28.750> when<00:04:29.230> you're<00:04:29.350> in

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
and a big benefit is when you're in

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.930 
and a big benefit is when you're in
Houston<00:04:29.890> and<00:04:30.070> you're<00:04:30.190> studying<00:04:30.490> petroleum

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
Houston and you're studying petroleum

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.580 
Houston and you're studying petroleum
engineering<00:04:31.210> here<00:04:31.420> you<00:04:31.870> can<00:04:32.020> also<00:04:32.170> do<00:04:32.470> the

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
engineering here you can also do the

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.280 
engineering here you can also do the
office<00:04:32.830> work<00:04:33.220> while<00:04:33.550> you're<00:04:34.200> during<00:04:35.200> the

but<00:05:25.360> of<00:05:25.479> course<00:05:25.690> the<00:05:25.810> demand<00:05:26.169> now<00:05:26.500> is<00:05:26.860> very

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
but of course the demand now is very

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.530 
but of course the demand now is very
very<00:05:28.030> high<00:05:28.360> it's<00:05:28.780> pretty<00:05:29.080> clear<00:05:29.169> that<00:05:30.540> the

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
very high it's pretty clear that the

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.360 
very high it's pretty clear that the
universities<00:05:32.140> have<00:05:32.500> not<00:05:32.680> been<00:05:32.890> producing

universities have not been producing
enough<00:05:33.729> graduates<00:05:34.690> to<00:05:34.930> meet<00:05:35.110> the<00:05:36.000> demographic

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
enough graduates to meet the demographic

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.730 
enough graduates to meet the demographic
issues<00:05:37.270> that<00:05:37.750> all<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.110> companies<00:05:38.440> are<00:05:38.560> facing

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
issues that all the companies are facing

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.219 
issues that all the companies are facing
in<00:05:39.070> terms<00:05:39.250> of<00:05:39.490> retirement<00:05:40.000> spy<00:05:40.390> folks<00:05:40.780> of<00:05:41.020> my

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
in terms of retirement spy folks of my

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.969 
in terms of retirement spy folks of my
age<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:41.800> so<00:05:42.870> so<00:05:43.870> that<00:05:44.050> demand<00:05:44.410> is<00:05:44.530> really<00:05:44.800> up

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
age and so so that demand is really up

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.100 
age and so so that demand is really up
now<00:05:45.280> and<00:05:45.669> that's<00:05:45.820> that's<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.450> reason<00:05:46.810> to<00:05:46.840> have
