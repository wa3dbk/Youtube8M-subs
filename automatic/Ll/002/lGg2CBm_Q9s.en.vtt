 Ryanair 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
 free 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.280
 bags and beethoven and I would have an energetic man 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.630
 and not of all composer of all beethoven artists who showed that not 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.940
 just a genius that even a genius of virginia and we hear in the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.490
 music and this 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.960
 for this it is the deceased in couscous in particular to create and listeners 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.360
 the www 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.909
 for this it is the clearest message to 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.120
 fields and a center a total triumph after so much effort 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.000
 and this is important in the world 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.780
 - we open the hopes that a total triumph will be in your life 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.470
 er and this presages very very strong in the fifth 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.420
 and so the fifth 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.100
 halo a 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.740
 always even so 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.060
 appreciated by the public, you can freely sit here 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.320
 this is the development of genius 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.320
 and we at bono or with an order 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.149
 very energetic credo energy 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.529
 the first east 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.529
 the first is together with the third 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.399
 that means 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:19.600
 liked the years day via 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.759
 absolutely do one thing i'm bad 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:28.289
 starting crown at court can be at any. I owe a symphony but not 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.389
 this is the first agreement 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.959
 so fantastic this young appraiser this is the first 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.849
 claire second proclaims the second is the sixth 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.230
 are all written two is born at elegance tact is that vienna where one is 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.230
 drinks very well cubbi, I love wine very well 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.359
 and 2 symphonies are very intimate in the center 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.899
 hahaha 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:53.599
 funny 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.579
 you always take it with the depth of a pinewood but where it can be said fun 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.149
 brilliant 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:07.359
 and instead the second where everyone thought now he still finds one 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.089
 start more 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:14.099
 sophisticated of the first he does just the classic interrogation now as it goes 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.889
 idem is an avatar clip 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.739
 and then the sixth and the famous one of pastoral sentiments 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.980
 to the heart must go to the heart written yellow, so 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:29.129
 laterza then the fourth and fifth are a fantastic one 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.629
 couple 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.840
 and then I tavano it and we oppose it seem the most classic table of the symphonies you 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.930
 see also how he returns to classicism and then hellas seventh that 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.079
 19 weeks sicily where are my energies so let me fill 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.670
 last moment 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.250
 habbo is the grandmother did well is always one to a show I have to say 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.979
 dragon 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.109
 message of Peter's music video a human message 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.299
 with you rather like today 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.299
 the human vision the 

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:22.580
 the importance of being 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.389
 a human being perhaps bigger but still very important today with everyone 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:34.909
 these techniques. all this world's most important clean for this 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:41.090
 funny beton we say very modern also in ours in our days and if 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.610
 you want interpreting must interpret 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.760
 really with all my heart as I see. he says from the color I have to go to his heart 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:55.129
 does not that pathetic way hey this is the way as the character and must 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.849
 must hear this message 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.879
 and this neon tube this evidence we are of bridge but nice beautiful nice 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.379
 now he asked me a young composer but how to do it 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:40.889
 he studies composition buffetti called costumes and the 9 symphonies of beethoven then 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:44.639
 you know everything and for me it's incredible incredible 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.379
 me emg and women in the way of bolzano tribastone 12 ok this 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.610
 this flower of the human being this a gift of God 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:00.259
 instead I see white and study how you feel like not those things there 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:01.409
 expression 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.409
 but also the composition technique 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.970
 no this is 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.060
 maybe we do now let's do it with the or the 9 symphonies 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:16.509
 and then we do once the 9 symphonies now are the preventive measures. 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:23.339
 said so it seems virgil 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.770
 me 

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:50.589
 in 

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:58.589
 I know 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.940
 I know
