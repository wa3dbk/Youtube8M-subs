picture basically if you sell stuff
you'll<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.530> getting<00:01:28.650> more<00:01:28.950> coins<00:01:29.280> back

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
you'll be getting more coins back

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.520 
you'll be getting more coins back
because<00:01:29.970> EA<00:01:30.119> won't<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.509> taking<00:01:30.659> as<00:01:30.960> many<00:01:31.229> coins

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
because EA won't be taking as many coins

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.710 
because EA won't be taking as many coins
out<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> game<00:01:32.100> from<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.520> now<00:01:33.360> there<00:01:33.570> isn't

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
out of the game from you now there isn't

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.780 
out of the game from you now there isn't
any<00:01:33.960> technical<00:01:34.710> purpose<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> tax<00:01:35.549> there's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
any technical purpose to the tax there's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.310 
any technical purpose to the tax there's
no<00:01:35.909> real<00:01:36.210> reason<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.900> other<00:01:37.049> than<00:01:37.200> they

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
no real reason for it other than they

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.100 
no real reason for it other than they
want<00:01:37.560> or<00:01:37.829> EA<00:01:38.490> once<00:01:38.820> basically<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.900> buy

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
want or EA once basically you to buy

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.200 
want or EA once basically you to buy
more<00:01:40.500> packs<00:01:41.040> with<00:01:41.340> money<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.670> essentially

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
more packs with money is essentially

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.990 
more packs with money is essentially
what<00:01:42.240> they<00:01:42.420> want<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:43.729> they<00:01:44.729> want<00:01:44.939> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
what they want you to do they want to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.429 
what they want you to do they want to
take<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.329> coins<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.899> game<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.290> try

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
take the coins out of the game to try

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.789 
take the coins out of the game to try
and<00:01:47.450> basically<00:01:48.450> create<00:01:48.990> an<00:01:49.110> economy<00:01:49.380> where

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and basically create an economy where

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.340 
and basically create an economy where
you<00:01:50.040> need<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.460> buy<00:01:50.670> packs<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.750> actually<00:01:52.079> make

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
you need to buy packs to actually make

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.469 
you need to buy packs to actually make
coins<00:01:52.619> back<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.100> things<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.390> it

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
coins back and things like that so it

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.429 
coins back and things like that so it
certainly<00:01:54.600> makes<00:01:54.869> sense<00:01:54.930> from<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.229> business

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
certainly makes sense from a business

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.740 
certainly makes sense from a business
perspective<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.250> hope<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.729> are<00:01:57.270> nice

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
perspective but I hope they are nice

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.539 
perspective but I hope they are nice
about<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.229> put<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.340> lower

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
about it this put this up here and lower

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.280 
about it this put this up here and lower
the<00:01:59.729> text<00:02:00.030> or<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.450> they<00:02:00.600> want<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.869> really<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.170> it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
the text or if they want to really do it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.230 
the text or if they want to really do it
eliminate<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.009> would<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.219> amazing<00:02:02.430> no

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
eliminate it that would be amazing no

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.730 
eliminate it that would be amazing no
tax<00:02:03.540> would<00:02:03.719> be<00:02:03.780> absolutely<00:02:03.990> fantastic<00:02:04.680> i

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
tax would be absolutely fantastic i

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.289

thousand coins for this Darren Sproles

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.999 
thousand coins for this Darren Sproles
but<00:02:08.250> that's<00:02:08.429> likely<00:02:08.789> not<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:10.080> happen<00:02:10.289> so

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
but that's likely not going to happen so

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.710 
but that's likely not going to happen so
