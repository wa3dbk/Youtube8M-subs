00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.100
 the classroom 10 welcome to my channel today you 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.110
 I will comment 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.960
 5 reasons why you should not wash 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.310
 your hair every day I have the 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.630
 Oily hair and I know what I am 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.759
 speaking first for your health if the sheet 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.500
 and streets every day is being very 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.149
 aggressive relating sebaceous that is 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.790
 find on your face and in your head 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.780
 the changes in your scalp 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.120
 then what we are going to do is 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.640
 clarifying the rebel rebels we're going 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.290
 to produce more fat and work is the 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.240
 double 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.710
 second hair while 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.170
 permanence for example I have the 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.750
 straight hair 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.230
 there are hairstyles that fall out that I do not 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.210
 cost three items and so on sometimes 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.159
 that natural hair fat is 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.769
 necessary for you to do the curlers 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.829
 so you have not needed for you 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.229
 grab certain hairstyles the buns 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.390
 Etc. You can control your face 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.710
 the fourth is for the economy you imagine 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.920
 spending every day shampoo 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.220
 Blister or botox conditioner 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.220
 etc 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.020
 this helps you now all those products 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.880
 the fourth is because you keep the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.260
 other hair treatments example the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.350
 dye the root and ironing 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.790
 because it's a vicious circle what happens if 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.120
 I have located it every day I am 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.000
 losing the color I'm losing the 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.250
 ironed in such a case as the ironed 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.420
 then I'm going to have to paint myself the 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.490
 faster or ironing menu again and 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.860
 that is damaging the hair then 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.260
 care of treatment your color you 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.190
 drying etcetera and lavalle - 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.680
 and the fifth reason is for the chemicals 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.210
 more use the shampoos although they are a 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.870
 conditional wonder 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.670
 that has chemical depositing hair is 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.420
 It is necessary to review the washing with a 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.649
 shampoo that cleans all the chemicals that 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.769
 they are also staining 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.810
 in our voice then less washed 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.299
 less chemicals in part we're 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.930
 saving water which is a resource 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:24.030
 very precious 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.030
 and that move more crazy 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.659
 high 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.230
 and then they put me another fence because it 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.390
 they feel alone 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.360
 and the rest of the hair when I'm going 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.510
 to wash completely in the mouth 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.920
 in this way we guarantee the hair 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.050
 because the top part if you need the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.500
 washed but on the bottom is more 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.270
 dry because not part of melo painter not 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.070
 it's running, I do not let it run 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.080
 natural grace is what I have here 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.050
 up for the fat the chapu of salar 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.480
 Fat control is like very cheap what 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.720
 get the Chinese where they wanted it 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.190
 everywhere the last time these 22 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.190
 fireballs and down here 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.980
 the greasy hair suddenly so that 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.210
 had painted by the ironed hair 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.610
 for hair 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.740
 then girls I hope the genre with 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.540
 advice if they have other advice may 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.540
 leave them down here if you liked
