change forewarning this move does take a
lot<00:00:43.730> of<00:00:43.760> practice<00:00:44.450> to<00:00:44.989> get<00:00:45.080> it<00:00:45.200> down<00:00:45.320> fluidly

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
lot of practice to get it down fluidly

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.299 
lot of practice to get it down fluidly
and<00:00:46.040> smooth<00:00:47.200> but<00:00:48.200> once<00:00:48.559> you<00:00:48.680> get<00:00:48.830> it<00:00:48.980> it's<00:00:49.160> a

and smooth but once you get it it's a

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.970 
and smooth but once you get it it's a
pretty<00:00:49.580> devastating<00:00:49.850> change<00:00:50.710> I'll<00:00:51.710> show<00:00:51.920> you

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
pretty devastating change I'll show you

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.740 
pretty devastating change I'll show you
an<00:00:52.129> example<00:00:52.190> watch<00:00:52.790> will<00:00:53.000> take<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.300> top<00:00:53.480> card

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
an example watch will take the top card

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.200 
an example watch will take the top card
the<00:00:53.930> seven<00:00:54.260> of<00:00:54.379> diamonds<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:55.100> just<00:00:55.970> with<00:00:56.180> a

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
the seven of diamonds and just with a

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
as well so let's get started on the ego

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.070 
as well so let's get started on the ego
change<00:01:22.060> okay<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:23.120> first<00:01:23.510> thing<00:01:23.720> I'm<00:01:23.870> going<00:01:23.990> to

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
change okay so first thing I'm going to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.859 
change okay so first thing I'm going to
go<00:01:24.170> over<00:01:24.200> this<00:01:24.500> change<00:01:24.770> is<00:01:25.600> what<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:26.690> looks

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
go over this change is what it looks

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.719 
go over this change is what it looks
like<00:01:27.020> without<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.409> cover<00:01:27.740> hand<00:01:28.039> now<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.310> ego

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
like without the cover hand now the ego

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.139 
like without the cover hand now the ego
change<00:01:29.000> involves<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.810> lot<00:01:30.079> of<00:01:30.229> angles<00:01:30.710> and

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
change involves a lot of angles and

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.550 
change involves a lot of angles and
making<00:01:32.149> sure<00:01:32.329> you<00:01:32.509> keep<00:01:32.719> things<00:01:32.990> covered<00:01:33.380> from

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
making sure you keep things covered from

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.770 
making sure you keep things covered from
the<00:01:33.649> spectators<00:01:34.189> eyes<00:01:34.369> I'll<00:01:35.210> give<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:35.719> a

the spectators eyes I'll give you a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.840 
the spectators eyes I'll give you a
couple<00:01:36.049> tips<00:01:36.170> later<00:01:36.710> in<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:36.979> video<00:01:37.100> on<00:01:37.579> how<00:01:37.789> to

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
couple tips later in the video on how to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.370 
couple tips later in the video on how to
make<00:01:38.030> sure<00:01:38.210> your<00:01:38.359> angles<00:01:38.689> are<00:01:38.810> perfect<00:01:39.170> every

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
make sure your angles are perfect every

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.800 
make sure your angles are perfect every
time<00:01:39.609> the<00:01:40.609> cover<00:01:40.820> hand<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:41.180> really<00:01:41.450> important

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
time the cover hand is really important

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.599 
time the cover hand is really important
in<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:41.990> ego<00:01:42.170> change<00:01:42.469> but<00:01:43.100> I'm<00:01:43.219> going<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.369> do<00:01:43.460> it

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
in the ego change but I'm going to do it

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.090 
in the ego change but I'm going to do it
one-handed<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.509> can<00:01:44.659> see<00:01:45.039> how<00:01:46.039> the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
one-handed so you can see how the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.810 
one-handed so you can see how the
mechanics<00:01:46.789> work<00:01:47.859> now<00:01:48.859> to<00:01:48.920> do<00:01:49.219> this<00:01:49.369> change<00:01:49.640> you

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
mechanics work now to do this change you

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.270 
mechanics work now to do this change you
have<00:01:49.939> to<00:01:50.000> have<00:01:50.299> two<00:01:50.960> cards<00:01:51.259> loaded<00:01:51.770> behind<00:01:52.070> one

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
have to have two cards loaded behind one

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.419 
have to have two cards loaded behind one
another<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:52.850> for<00:01:53.329> example<00:01:54.159> you<00:01:55.159> can<00:01:55.310> do<00:01:55.399> a

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
another so for example you can do a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.789 
another so for example you can do a
double<00:01:55.640> lift<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:56.060> get<00:01:56.179> into<00:01:56.359> this<00:01:56.479> but<00:01:56.799> you

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
double lift to get into this but you

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.499 
double lift to get into this but you
have<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.399> card<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:58.759> you<00:01:58.820> want<00:01:59.119> to<00:01:59.240> change

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
have the card that you want to change

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.209 
have the card that you want to change
and<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.020> card<00:02:00.259> that<00:02:00.320> you<00:02:00.469> want<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.950> change

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
and the card that you want to change

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.959 
and the card that you want to change
into<00:02:01.460> is<00:02:01.939> beneath<00:02:02.479> it<00:02:02.770> okay<00:02:03.770> that's<00:02:03.950> how<00:02:04.189> you

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
into is beneath it okay that's how you

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.580 
into is beneath it okay that's how you
load<00:02:05.329> this<00:02:05.539> trick<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:05.990> can<00:02:06.049> do<00:02:06.259> it<00:02:06.350> off<00:02:06.439> the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
load this trick you can do it off the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
load this trick you can do it off the
bottom<00:02:07.869> or<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:09.259> can<00:02:09.440> just<00:02:09.679> do<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.130> double<00:02:10.340> lift

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
bottom or you can just do a double lift

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.840 
bottom or you can just do a double lift
or<00:02:11.510> incorporate<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.440> any<00:02:12.650> other<00:02:12.770> way<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.670> you

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
or incorporate it any other way that you

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.560 
or incorporate it any other way that you
wish<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:15.470> once<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.770> have<00:02:15.890> this<00:02:16.130> a

situation where you have this two card
the<00:02:20.030> spectator<00:02:20.480> thinks<00:02:20.810> it's<00:02:20.930> one<00:02:21.170> but

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
the spectator thinks it's one but

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.410 
the spectator thinks it's one but
there's<00:02:21.770> secretly<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.250> card<00:02:22.580> behind<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.150> that's

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.840 
there's secretly a card behind it that's
going<00:02:23.600> to<00:02:23.660> change<00:02:23.930> into<00:02:24.400> this<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.580> what<00:02:25.730> the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
going to change into this is what the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.240 
going to change into this is what the
actual<00:02:26.240> move<00:02:26.480> looks<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:26.990> without<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.980> cover

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
actual move looks like without the cover

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.230 
actual move looks like without the cover
hand<00:02:29.950> okay

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
hand okay

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.910 
hand okay
now<00:02:32.240> I<00:02:32.270> add<00:02:32.690> my<00:02:32.900> own<00:02:32.930> little<00:02:33.050> cleanup<00:02:33.590> into

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
now I add my own little cleanup into

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.320 
now I add my own little cleanup into
this<00:02:34.010> people<00:02:34.280> do<00:02:34.520> different<00:02:34.670> things<00:02:35.060> but

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
this people do different things but

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.650 
this people do different things but
personally<00:02:36.020> when<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:36.860> do<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.220> change<00:02:37.520> I<00:02:37.850> pull

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
personally when I do the change I pull

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.240 
personally when I do the change I pull
it<00:02:38.810> underneath<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.260> bottom<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.770> deck<00:02:39.980> and

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
it underneath the bottom of the deck and

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.570 
it underneath the bottom of the deck and
it<00:02:40.340> leaves<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:40.730> pretty<00:02:41.060> clean<00:02:41.590> like<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.890> okay

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
it leaves it pretty clean like that okay

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.050 
it leaves it pretty clean like that okay
so<00:02:44.650> let's<00:02:45.650> see<00:02:45.830> that<00:02:45.860> one<00:02:46.190> more<00:02:46.250> time<00:02:46.400> we<00:02:46.850> do

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
so let's see that one more time we do

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.360 
so let's see that one more time we do
the<00:02:47.360> double<00:02:47.720> lift<00:02:50.590> that's<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.920> move<00:02:52.100> right

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
the double lift that's the move right

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.590 
the double lift that's the move right
there<00:02:53.440> okay<00:02:57.580> now<00:02:58.580> like<00:02:58.880> I<00:02:59.030> said<00:02:59.090> this<00:02:59.420> move

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
there okay now like I said this move

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.380 
there okay now like I said this move
takes<00:02:59.810> a<00:02:59.990> lot<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.260> practice<00:03:00.830> but<00:03:01.730> let's<00:03:02.180> get<00:03:02.360> a

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
takes a lot of practice but let's get a

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.150 
takes a lot of practice but let's get a
little<00:03:02.570> more<00:03:02.690> in-depth<00:03:03.200> about<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.680> mechanics

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
little more in-depth about the mechanics

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.080 
little more in-depth about the mechanics
of<00:03:04.280> how<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.490> actually<00:03:04.700> do<00:03:05.030> that

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
of how to actually do that

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.670 
of how to actually do that
okay<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.150> let's<00:03:08.480> work<00:03:08.630> on<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:09.050> actual<00:03:09.440> move

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
okay so let's work on the actual move

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.880 
okay so let's work on the actual move
real<00:03:09.950> quick<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.400> pull<00:03:10.580> a<00:03:10.610> card<00:03:11.440> now<00:03:12.440> this<00:03:12.710> is

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
real quick to pull a card now this is

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.710 
real quick to pull a card now this is
done<00:03:13.100> from<00:03:13.370> normal<00:03:13.820> mechanics<00:03:14.330> script<00:03:14.570> so

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
done from normal mechanics script so

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.690 
done from normal mechanics script so
just<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.990> normal<00:03:15.380> way<00:03:15.470> of<00:03:15.500> holding<00:03:15.830> a<00:03:16.130> pack<00:03:16.670> of

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
just a normal way of holding a pack of

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.490 
just a normal way of holding a pack of
cards<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:17.360> have<00:03:17.510> your<00:03:17.660> index<00:03:17.900> finger<00:03:18.140> up<00:03:18.260> top

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
cards you have your index finger up top

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.010 
cards you have your index finger up top
your<00:03:19.130> thumb<00:03:19.370> along<00:03:19.850> this<00:03:20.030> side<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.540> these

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
your thumb along this side and these

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.830 
your thumb along this side and these
three<00:03:21.260> fingers<00:03:21.500> over<00:03:22.160> here<00:03:22.570> okay<00:03:23.570> you<00:03:23.630> don't

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
three fingers over here okay you don't

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.300 
three fingers over here okay you don't
need<00:03:23.990> to<00:03:24.110> change<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.530> grip<00:03:24.710> at<00:03:24.830> all<00:03:24.980> for<00:03:25.220> this

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
need to change the grip at all for this

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.160 
need to change the grip at all for this
we<00:03:28.310> can<00:03:28.460> just<00:03:28.580> practice<00:03:29.000> with<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.600> top<00:03:29.840> card

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
we can just practice with the top card

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.090 
we can just practice with the top card
for<00:03:30.710> this<00:03:30.830> move<00:03:31.100> so<00:03:31.940> this<00:03:32.300> finger<00:03:32.740> stays<00:03:33.740> still

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
for this move so this finger stays still

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.920 
for this move so this finger stays still
it<00:03:34.250> keeps<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.640> pack<00:03:34.850> square<00:03:35.300> same<00:03:35.660> with<00:03:35.810> the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
it keeps the pack square same with the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.680 
it keeps the pack square same with the
thumb<00:03:36.230> oh<00:03:36.500> no<00:03:37.490> none<00:03:37.880> of<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.120> fingers<00:03:38.450> move

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
thumb oh no none of the fingers move

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.790 
thumb oh no none of the fingers move
except<00:03:39.200> for<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.470> pinkie<00:03:39.860> okay<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:42.650> are

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.970 
except for the pinkie okay you are
pulling<00:03:43.160> here<00:03:43.700> let<00:03:43.850> me<00:03:43.880> try<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.120> explain<00:03:44.210> this

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
pulling here let me try to explain this

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.200 
pulling here let me try to explain this
differently<00:03:45.980> all<00:03:46.340> of<00:03:46.580> these<00:03:46.730> cards<00:03:47.000> are

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
differently all of these cards are

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.630 
differently all of these cards are
trying<00:03:47.510> these<00:03:47.960> fingers<00:03:48.350> my<00:03:48.530> bad<00:03:48.740> are<00:03:49.340> trying

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
trying these fingers my bad are trying

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.590 
trying these fingers my bad are trying
to<00:03:49.790> keep<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.120> cards<00:03:51.100> still<00:03:52.270> while<00:03:53.270> letting

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
to keep the cards still while letting

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.020 
to keep the cards still while letting
the<00:03:53.690> pinkie<00:03:54.110> drag<00:03:54.800> solely<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.460> top<00:03:55.640> card<00:03:55.910> off

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
the pinkie drag solely the top card off

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.900 
the pinkie drag solely the top card off
this<00:03:56.270> takes<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.660> lot<00:03:56.810> of<00:03:56.870> practice<00:03:57.380> to<00:03:57.410> do<00:03:57.910> but

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
this takes a lot of practice to do but

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.770 
this takes a lot of practice to do but
just<00:03:59.140> practice<00:04:00.140> holding<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.890> deck<00:04:01.070> tight<00:04:01.340> and

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
just practice holding the deck tight and

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.270 
just practice holding the deck tight and
just<00:04:02.780> using<00:04:03.140> your<00:04:03.260> pinkie<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.650> forcefully

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
just using your pinkie to forcefully

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.960 
just using your pinkie to forcefully
pull<00:04:04.730> down<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.240> top<00:04:05.420> card<00:04:06.310> now<00:04:07.310> what<00:04:07.790> makes

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
pull down the top card now what makes

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.699 
pull down the top card now what makes
this<00:04:08.180> work<00:04:08.390> as<00:04:08.570> well<00:04:08.840> as<00:04:09.140> your<00:04:09.320> thumb<00:04:09.560> is

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
this work as well as your thumb is

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.620 
this work as well as your thumb is
pressed<00:04:10.010> against<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.459> top<00:04:10.760> corner<00:04:11.480> of<00:04:11.540> the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
pressed against the top corner of the

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.730 
pressed against the top corner of the
deck<00:04:11.870> like<00:04:12.680> so<00:04:13.810> so<00:04:14.810> when<00:04:15.080> you<00:04:15.170> are<00:04:15.350> ready<00:04:15.560> to

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
deck like so so when you are ready to

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.470 
deck like so so when you are ready to
release<00:04:15.830> your<00:04:16.220> thumb<00:04:16.430> just<00:04:16.459> slightly<00:04:17.060> moves

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
release your thumb just slightly moves

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.599 
release your thumb just slightly moves
out<00:04:17.690> of<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:17.870> way<00:04:18.020> and<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:19.040> force<00:04:19.310> that<00:04:19.489> your

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
out of the way and the force that your

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.310 
out of the way and the force that your
pinkie<00:04:19.940> is<00:04:20.030> putting<00:04:20.359> on<00:04:20.540> the<00:04:20.690> bottom<00:04:21.049> of<00:04:21.200> the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
pinkie is putting on the bottom of the

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.950 
pinkie is putting on the bottom of the
card<00:04:21.590> will<00:04:22.460> drag<00:04:22.760> it<00:04:22.940> down<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:23.180> create<00:04:23.690> an

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
card will drag it down and create an

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.780 
card will drag it down and create an
angle<00:04:24.260> like<00:04:24.530> that<00:04:26.140> okay

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
angle like that okay

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.220 
angle like that okay
so<00:04:28.790> that's<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.180> actual<00:04:29.300> move<00:04:29.660> now<00:04:29.900> let's<00:04:30.080> get

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
so that's the actual move now let's get

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.120 
so that's the actual move now let's get
into<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:31.160> cover<00:04:31.430> for<00:04:31.820> it<00:04:32.800> okay<00:04:33.800> so<00:04:33.860> when

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
into the cover for it okay so when

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.740 
into the cover for it okay so when
you're<00:04:34.220> doing<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.550> ego<00:04:34.760> change<00:04:35.090> it's<00:04:35.480> really

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
you're doing the ego change it's really

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.969 
you're doing the ego change it's really
important<00:04:36.170> to<00:04:36.230> keep<00:04:36.350> angles<00:04:36.860> in<00:04:37.040> mind<00:04:37.510> so<00:04:38.510> and

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
important to keep angles in mind so and

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.260 
important to keep angles in mind so and
timing<00:04:39.979> as<00:04:40.100> well<00:04:40.130> that's<00:04:40.550> also<00:04:40.760> important

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
timing as well that's also important

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.850 
timing as well that's also important
this<00:04:41.360> change<00:04:41.660> when<00:04:41.930> you<00:04:42.050> drag<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:42.470> card<00:04:42.680> down

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
this change when you drag the card down

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.760 
this change when you drag the card down
and<00:04:43.190> when<00:04:43.850> you<00:04:43.940> do<00:04:44.090> your<00:04:44.210> flip<00:04:44.450> motion

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
and when you do your flip motion

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.300 
and when you do your flip motion
so<00:04:46.160> kind<00:04:46.520> of<00:04:47.199> they<00:04:48.199> might<00:04:48.410> hear<00:04:48.620> a<00:04:48.650> snap<00:04:49.039> or

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
so kind of they might hear a snap or

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.670 
so kind of they might hear a snap or
something<00:04:49.819> but<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.300> spectator<00:04:51.139> will<00:04:51.350> see<00:04:51.530> you

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
something but a spectator will see you

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.129 
something but a spectator will see you
just<00:04:51.949> flicking<00:04:52.280> like<00:04:52.880> that<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.449> the<00:04:53.930> card
