here's<00:00:01.439> my<00:00:01.620> atlas<00:00:01.949> shape<00:00:02.190> or<00:00:02.399> cleaning<00:00:02.669> up<00:00:02.790> a

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
here's my atlas shape or cleaning up a

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.660 
here's my atlas shape or cleaning up a
block<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.330> aluminum<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:04.250> see<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.279> don't<00:00:05.580> know

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
block of aluminum and see I don't know

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.390 
block of aluminum and see I don't know
how<00:00:05.930> how<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:06.990> lighting<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.740> but<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.010> can<00:00:08.160> see

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
how how the lighting is but you can see

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.940 
how how the lighting is but you can see
that<00:00:08.610> it's<00:00:08.790> just<00:00:09.000> taking<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.450> pretty<00:00:10.440> well<00:00:10.710> worn

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
that it's just taking a pretty well worn

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.720 
that it's just taking a pretty well worn
piece<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:12.110> oxidized<00:00:13.110> aluminum<00:00:13.429> it's<00:00:14.429> got<00:00:14.580> some

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
piece of oxidized aluminum it's got some

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.019 
piece of oxidized aluminum it's got some
gouges<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.210> whatnot<00:00:16.550> and<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.670> can<00:00:17.820> really

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
gouges and whatnot and you can really

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.380 
gouges and whatnot and you can really
polish<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> mirror-like<00:00:19.050> finish<00:00:19.199> I

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
polish it to a mirror-like finish I

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.310 
polish it to a mirror-like finish I
wouldn't<00:00:21.390> say<00:00:21.480> polish<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.199> actually

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
wouldn't say polish it it actually

scrapes taking off I have a very light
cut<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> bit<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.840> made<00:00:28.400> that's

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
cut with a bit that I made that's

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400 
cut with a bit that I made that's
rounded<00:00:30.179> that's<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.900> put<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> finishing

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
rounded that's going to put a finishing

touch<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.040> thing<00:00:33.260> you<00:00:34.260> look<00:00:34.440> I'm<00:00:34.559> just

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
touch on this thing you look I'm just

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.670 
touch on this thing you look I'm just
barely<00:00:35.070> taking<00:00:35.790> anything<00:00:36.000> off<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.840> actually

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
barely taking anything off I actually

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.670 
barely taking anything off I actually
had<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:37.980> go<00:00:38.129> back<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.930> make<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.989> pass<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.500> this

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
had to go back and make a pass on this

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.410 
had to go back and make a pass on this
cheap<00:00:40.980> vice<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.430> had<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.790> make<00:00:41.910> sure<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.300> it

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
cheap vice I had to make sure that it

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.170 
cheap vice I had to make sure that it
was<00:00:42.680> planed<00:00:43.680> off<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:45.980> this<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.129> my<00:00:47.280> new<00:00:47.520> toy<00:00:47.760> I

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
was planed off but this is my new toy I

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.459 
was planed off but this is my new toy I
have<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.320> guards<00:00:50.190> off<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.700> at<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.030> moment

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
have the guards off of it at the moment

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.810 
have the guards off of it at the moment
because<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.680> put<00:00:52.829> some<00:00:52.920> new<00:00:53.070> belts<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.610> I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
because I put some new belts on it I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.069 
because I put some new belts on it I
just<00:00:54.210> shredded<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> bill<00:00:54.899> yesterday<00:00:57.079> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
just shredded the bill yesterday the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.849 
just shredded the bill yesterday the
existing<00:00:58.469> build<00:00:58.649> anyway<00:00:58.980> so<00:01:00.680> basically<00:01:01.680> what

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
existing build anyway so basically what

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.570 
existing build anyway so basically what
you<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.579> motor<00:01:03.000> drives<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.989> common<00:01:04.580> belt

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you have is a motor drives a common belt

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.940 
you have is a motor drives a common belt
shaft<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> speed<00:01:07.350> pulley<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.799> can

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
shaft this is the speed pulley you can

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.890 
shaft this is the speed pulley you can
you<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.369> operate<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> RAM<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.479> runs<00:01:09.720> back

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
you can operate the RAM that runs back

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.090 
you can operate the RAM that runs back
and<00:01:10.080> forth<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.320> different<00:01:10.680> speeds<00:01:10.890> depending

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and forth the different speeds depending

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.480 
and forth the different speeds depending
upon<00:01:11.400> where<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.700> put<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.320> belt<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
upon where you put the belt this is a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.510 
upon where you put the belt this is a
tensioner<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.150> actually<00:01:15.450> lifts<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.520> list

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
tensioner that actually lifts the list

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.370 
tensioner that actually lifts the list
the<00:01:17.700> axle<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.390> put<00:01:18.509> tension<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> belts<00:01:19.290> to

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the axle to put tension on the belts to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.570 
the axle to put tension on the belts to
put<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.619> into<00:01:19.770> operation<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:22.369> this<00:01:23.369> is

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
put it into operation and then this is

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.920 
put it into operation and then this is
actually<00:01:23.909> driven<00:01:24.060> by<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.330> bull<00:01:24.570> gear<00:01:24.780> that's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
actually driven by the bull gear that's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.510 
actually driven by the bull gear that's
also<00:01:25.200> driving<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.590> RAM<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.950> what<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.159> does<00:01:26.280> is

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
also driving the RAM and what it does is

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.210 
also driving the RAM and what it does is
it<00:01:26.689> drives<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.380> little<00:01:28.530> shaft<00:01:28.920> here

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
it drives this this little shaft here

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.030 
it drives this this little shaft here
you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.759> set<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> depth<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.710> drives<00:01:31.950> us

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you can set the depth and that drives us

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.830 
you can set the depth and that drives us
a<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.250> clicker<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.509> what<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
a little clicker here and what the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.080 
a little clicker here and what the
clicker<00:01:34.049> does<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.579> you<00:01:35.579> set<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> direction

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
clicker does is you set the direction

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.510 
clicker does is you set the direction
that<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.479> want<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.750> table<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.049> go<00:01:37.369> it's<00:01:38.369> got<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
that you want the table to go it's got a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.200 
that you want the table to go it's got a
little<00:01:38.960> clicker<00:01:39.960> inside<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.500> rocks<00:01:40.740> and

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
little clicker inside that rocks and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.050 
little clicker inside that rocks and
that<00:01:42.210> drives<00:01:42.390> another<00:01:42.780> gear<00:01:43.850> which<00:01:44.850> actually

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that drives another gear which actually

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.780 
that drives another gear which actually
turns<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.630> table<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.399> depending<00:01:47.399> upon<00:01:47.490> how

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
turns the table and depending upon how

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.850 
turns the table and depending upon how
far<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.509> want<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.810> move<00:01:48.899> each<00:01:49.110> click<00:01:49.439> you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
far you want it to move each click you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.380 
far you want it to move each click you
adjust<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.369> length<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.820> stroke<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.360> this

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
adjust the length of this stroke on this

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.630 
adjust the length of this stroke on this
particular<00:01:51.720> rod<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.009> moves<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> table

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
particular rod and it moves the table

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.050 
particular rod and it moves the table
over<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.030> if<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.240> look<00:01:54.780> inside<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.350> see

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
over so if you look inside you can see

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.219 
over so if you look inside you can see
you<00:01:57.060> look<00:01:57.240> here<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.570> see<00:01:57.869> then<00:01:58.020> that

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
you look here you can see then that

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.840 
you look here you can see then that
knobs<00:01:58.740> actually<00:01:59.189> being<00:01:59.340> turned<00:01:59.549> just<00:01:59.729> a
