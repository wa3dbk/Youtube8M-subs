you<00:05:19.740> have<00:05:19.889> to<00:05:19.919> have<00:05:20.069> the<00:05:20.430> simple<00:05:21.120> idea

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
you have to have the simple idea

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.249 
you have to have the simple idea
extension<00:05:21.930> on<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.169> browser<00:05:22.590> so<00:05:23.069> if<00:05:23.389> you're<00:05:24.389> in
