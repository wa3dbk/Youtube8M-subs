 to look broccoli we take I put here 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.329
 I need you to explain chive and 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.090
 garlic onion so slice and garlic 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.650
 laminate very well I'm putting salt already 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.500
 You know I'm going to be very happy 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.239
 cook I'm a witch, sail the broccoli 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.610
 great and today we are going to say three 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.470
 properties and the first one to everything 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.960
 the world already sounds to them that it is very good 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.579
 for cancer and you know why a 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.739
 food can be good for cancer 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.910
 Well look with the broccoli it has been seen that 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.410
 not only the substances that have combat 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.269
 possible carcinogens that we can have 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.280
 in our body but it has been seen 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.060
 in animals that once they already have 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.360
 Cancer 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.759
 help that cancer heal yourself imagine 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.159
 prevents and heals and hears like the 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.970
 broccoli the whole family the cauliflower 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.500
 cruciferous cabbages lucifer as that and look 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.810
 another property that has broccoli that 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.490
 it also has garlic is an effect 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.780
 anti-inflammatory 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.670
 is to say that you for example if you have 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.500
 predisposition to develop allergies or 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.869
 develop diseases that are 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.570
 as frequent as intolerances those 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.240
 foods help prevent them by 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.850
 curiosity is there any food 4 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.679
 that combining well with broccoli 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.000
 favor the actions or we can 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.470
 combine with any vegetable with 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.030
 any street can combine with what 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.649
 that you want what happens is that it is true 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.630
 that broccoli acquires those properties 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.610
 just when we do what you're 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.830
 doing that is cooking it and in addition 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.390
 also with digestion and I also 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.939
 I'm cooking doneness 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.310
 It is always very relative to each person 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.810
 us I'll cook enough is 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.179
 little fact that I like to stay with 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.890
 force because then I add it to the 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.399
 pan and I give it a shot it ended in 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.100
 the pan 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.780
 we follow pepper look we cut through the 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.530
 half is worth 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.540
 we remove the stem and cut it this 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.060
 like in dice is your short half me 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.740
 short the other half the ideal in the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.990
 kitchen and says it always javier is 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.120
 combine colors because the broccoli that 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.980
 it is green for example with the pepper that 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.140
 It is red that is giving you vitamins 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.830
 different and then I said that I was going to 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.840
 say 3 good the third one is that it 's a 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.760
 powerful antioxidant and we always talk 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.700
 of antioxidants what are they for? 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.200
 so that we age less because the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.810
 aging is that solar cells 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.760
 dying good as broccoli prevents 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.760
 that those cells die 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.230
 let's go for the turkey breast fillet 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.930
 the ingredients are very easy broccoli 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.640
 vegetables you want, I've put 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.980
 chive garlic mushrooms red pepper 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.050
 and put the turkey breast 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.420
 finite cut fillets and you're done 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.459
 I still do not put salt and pepper and now 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.500
 what I said and I will hide 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.350
 directly the broccoli did not let it 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.450
 do a lot then we take 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.250
 and we're not pushing broccoli 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.940
 To know him a lot you are going to notice because 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.530
 it's still very green look good 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.380
 Green broccoli wonderful lemon juice 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.630
 Well I'll teach me a juicer 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.180
 they have sent a juicer from Miami a 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.180
 fellow cook that I have there 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.180
 wonderful 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.660
 which is good and you can find it in 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.170
 all the houses plus lame does not look like 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.290
 much to your hand given we do not move 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.120
 we skipped a little and now look said 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.770
 Javier said Javier on one of his tables 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.750
 that we can give them certain touches of 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.010
 joy to our dishes with the sauces 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.560
 I have a little sauce here 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.910
 barbecue a tad alone and then we go 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.500
 to give it that different but same 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.060
 that we give things sauce will be 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.540
 we can give it with a little bit of tomato 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.610
 fried then look I put one and 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.900
 two we are talking about a dish for 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.910
 several people that out there and now look 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.729
 simple easy everything would be related 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.070
 at the end of looking at what we do what 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.570
 moved away from the fire once it is out 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.800
 I miss them we love them because what they do not 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.720
 I want the ham to cook a lot 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.710
 barbarians and I cook a lot the more you lose the 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.270
 flavor I put it here I mix even 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.330
 if you want to put it over chopped 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.070
 because over chopped we mix and go 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.430
 putting up 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.830
 we put the half a little vegetables 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.950
 of course the broccoli that we lack well 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.680
 of broccoli we put there 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.360
 that falls and now what we do only 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.420
 to give it a different touch look with 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.700
 the sauce itself we make a little picture 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.320
 around the plate and we finished though 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.730
 broccoli is green with a herb 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.590
 aromatic is simply decoration 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.860
 Peppermint parsley you want me to 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.170
 I put a small leaf of basil and 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.780
 suddenly we have so easy a healthy dish 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.620
 with broccoli and simple you like the 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.620
