00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
now let's look at some exercises you can

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.430 
now let's look at some exercises you can
do<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.550> improve<00:00:03.330> your<00:00:03.570> right<00:00:03.750> hands<00:00:04.200> playing

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
do to improve your right hands playing

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.849 
do to improve your right hands playing
if<00:00:04.770> you<00:00:05.339> press<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.089> load<00:00:06.600> here<00:00:07.259> are<00:00:07.770> the

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
if you press and a load here are the

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.839 
if you press and a load here are the
fifth<00:00:08.069> friends<00:00:08.719> and<00:00:09.719> play<00:00:10.679> each<00:00:10.950> string<00:00:11.400> but

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
fifth friends and play each string but

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.030 
fifth friends and play each string but
by<00:00:12.030> skipping<00:00:12.389> them<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.200> start<00:00:13.650> off<00:00:13.799> with

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
by skipping them so you start off with

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.849 
by skipping them so you start off with
the<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.250> notes<00:00:14.730> on<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.420> sixth<00:00:15.809> string<00:00:15.839> then<00:00:16.740> you

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
the a notes on the sixth string then you

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.359 
the a notes on the sixth string then you
go<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.070> 30<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.609> each<00:00:18.240> room<00:00:18.539> like<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:20.750> then<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
go to 30 in each room like this then the

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.310 
go to 30 in each room like this then the
ninos<00:00:23.369> from<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> string<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.810> C<00:00:25.019> sharp

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
ninos from the a string and the C sharp

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.550 
ninos from the a string and the C sharp
and<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.590> g<00:00:25.800> string

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
and the g string

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.190 
and the g string
and<00:00:28.130> so<00:00:28.400> on<00:00:28.609> so<00:00:28.820> you<00:00:29.000> get<00:00:29.240> this<00:00:29.359> kind<00:00:29.630> of<00:00:29.779> effect

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.770 

I'll<00:00:34.890> play<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.310> more<00:00:35.460> time

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.319 

you<00:00:40.190> know<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.489> way<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.789> is<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
you know the way this is going to

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.720 
you know the way this is going to
improve<00:00:42.539> your<00:00:42.660> right<00:00:43.170> hand<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.519> should

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
improve your right hand in so you should

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.780 
improve your right hand in so you should
alternate<00:00:45.269> pick<00:00:45.629> every<00:00:46.079> single<00:00:46.440> string

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
alternate pick every single string

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.340 
alternate pick every single string
starting<00:00:47.790> with<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> down<00:00:48.180> stroke<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.899> then

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
starting with the down stroke and then

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:59.130 
starting with the down stroke and then
with<00:00:49.559> an<00:00:49.680> upstroke<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.550> this

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.220 

and<00:00:59.800> to<00:01:00.280> go<00:01:00.430> out<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.670> sequence<00:01:01.120> you<00:01:02.020> should

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
and to go out the sequence you should

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.510 
and to go out the sequence you should
get<00:01:02.410> a<00:01:02.620> c-sharp<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.750> on<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:05.080> e<00:01:05.110> string<00:01:05.370> to<00:01:06.370> go

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
get a c-sharp it on the e string to go

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:14.710 
get a c-sharp it on the e string to go
back<00:01:06.700> up<00:01:06.880> so<00:01:07.360> you<00:01:07.420> you<00:01:07.780> get<00:01:07.930> this

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.640 

I<00:01:15.070> one<00:01:16.070> more<00:01:16.190> time

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.040 

you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.990 

again<00:01:24.050> always<00:01:24.410> strikes<00:01:24.950> will<00:01:25.220> turn<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.460> pecking

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
again always strikes will turn a pecking

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.710 
again always strikes will turn a pecking
down<00:01:26.390> up<00:01:26.690> down<00:01:26.960> up<00:01:27.560> down<00:01:27.680> up<00:01:28.340> but<00:01:29.270> I'll<00:01:29.510> play

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
down up down up down up but I'll play

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:39.040 
down up down up down up but I'll play
one<00:01:29.870> more<00:01:30.020> time<00:01:30.230> p

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.630 

now<00:01:40.050> you've<00:01:40.200> got<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.380> sorted<00:01:40.800> plain<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.280> open

tailor picking because obviously you're

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.530 
tailor picking because obviously you're
alternating<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.580> strategy<00:02:01.910> string<00:02:02.210> up<00:02:02.360> and

alternating the strategy string up and
down<00:02:02.720> or<00:02:03.080> down<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.560> up<00:02:04.030> once<00:02:05.030> you've<00:02:05.150> got<00:02:05.240> two

notes per string sorted out try playing
triplets<00:02:08.149> like<00:02:08.390> this

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:26.580 

of<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.659> one<00:02:18.870> more<00:02:18.989> time

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.620 

there

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
there

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.910 
there
again<00:02:29.630> we<00:02:29.870> have<00:02:29.960> strict<00:02:30.260> alternate<00:02:30.770> picking

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
again we have strict alternate picking

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.350 
again we have strict alternate picking
so<00:02:31.490> it's<00:02:31.910> up<00:02:32.090> down<00:02:32.120> up<00:02:32.750> down<00:02:32.780> up<00:02:33.320> down<00:02:33.850> now<00:02:34.850> try

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
so it's up down up down up down now try

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.810 
so it's up down up down up down now try
playing<00:02:35.660> all<00:02:36.080> of<00:02:36.260> those<00:02:36.410> exercises<00:02:37.130> but

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
playing all of those exercises but

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.270 
playing all of those exercises but
starting<00:02:38.480> moving<00:02:38.720> up<00:02:39.320> instead<00:02:39.890> of<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.100> Down

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
starting moving up instead of a Down

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.180 
starting moving up instead of a Down
stroke<00:02:41.080> it's<00:02:42.080> much<00:02:42.260> more<00:02:42.410> challenging<00:02:42.620> and

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
stroke it's much more challenging and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.310 
stroke it's much more challenging and
it's<00:02:43.340> good<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:44.210> sort<00:02:44.480> out<00:02:44.690> your<00:02:44.840> alternate

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
it's good to sort out your alternate

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:54.780 
it's good to sort out your alternate
picking<00:02:45.500> style<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:47.150> single<00:02:47.570> version

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.450

I<00:03:21.000> finally<00:03:22.000> d<00:03:22.420> triplet<00:03:22.840> version<00:03:23.320> three<00:03:23.620> notes

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
I finally d triplet version three notes

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.720 
I finally d triplet version three notes
per<00:03:23.950> string<00:03:24.010> starting<00:03:24.730> with<00:03:24.850> an<00:03:24.970> upstroke

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.970 

hmm
