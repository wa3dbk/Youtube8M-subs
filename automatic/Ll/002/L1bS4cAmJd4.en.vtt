00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.189
 Hello, today I will tell you about the clock 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.309
 Winner Skeleton 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:14.880
 which recently received parcels from 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.520
 aliexpress here looks like this clock itself 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.279
 Yes, there is still a knife with me, I am a little bit 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.029
 I'll tell you later why this is possible 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.220
 say such one of the most necessary 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.650
 tools that should go together 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.340
 with this watch 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:36.090
 what is the thickness of the watch on one side 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.840
 on the other hand in front you already 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.860
 have looked 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.489
 we have a transparent cover at the back 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.739
 pendulum by the way on the pendulum 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.559
 as you see it is written china 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.039
 nothing is usually written on 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:58.109
 pendulum writes nothing means they 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:02.070
 they know how to but not to wind up like this 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.290
 way they can start not 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.860
 every day if you wear them all the time 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:13.350
 until the pendulum will be under waving 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.630
 hands he will also hang out and 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.140
 start arrow clock 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.710
 blue ones with this coating so 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.560
 fluorescent or whatever it is called 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.920
 phosphorus is shorter, but now to the light bulb 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.119
 closer and raised the need to turn off the light 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.680
 be seen this is how you see it 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.680
 greenish highlighted 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.680
 so let's tell why here 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.080
 I need a knife, this one here is the head that 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.610
 that you need to translate the arrows 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.190
 soak it very tight I honestly 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.840
 faces do not want to break legs 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:02.520
 so I use a knife here with a knife all 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:06.680
 works great and now i'm 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.179
 I twist this thing it turns in jerks 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.340
 I can't tell you this 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.220
 there is something easy, something difficult, something easy 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.590
 hard but maybe over time 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.540
 will be developed and will spin well 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.130
 but the new ones like this 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.040
 ok and gum right here pike this 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:30.060
 kosyachok incomprehensible here on the body 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.370
 see whether it's some kind of glue drop about 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.320
 exactly this glue turned out to be 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:40.610
 I picked picked to keep all 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.920
 it means there are no jambs on the body 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:48.290
 so what else to say means bracelet 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.239
 bracelet standard ordinary clasp 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.300
 so here with the buttons on the sides 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.780
 which is pretty convenient in principle 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.700
 let's wear on hand to 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.280
 demonstrate how it is approximately 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.570
 looks like 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.100
 look something like this to me 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.680
 honestly don't like it very much when 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.590
 watches are so thick for me after all 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.989
 thinner but surely there are people 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:22.280
 who like such watches 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.280
 quite interesting made glass 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:32.850
 look it like a little bit 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:35.989
 rises above the hull and gives more 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.989
 extra thickness 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.550
 so the clock was ordered on aliexpress for 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:47.300
 18 dollars 99 cents in terms of 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.849
 Russian money is about 620 rubles yes 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.860
 here here is another around the edge 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.360
 transport and pasted film 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.099
 not yet cleaned so therefore here 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.630
 sometimes not very good fucking discount 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:05.269
 bubble principle is not so important the parcel 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.980
 came pretty quickly took only 29 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.160

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.739

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.270
