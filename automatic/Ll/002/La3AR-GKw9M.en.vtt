 Christian civilization the right to

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.640
 by the environmental movement 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.090
 the institution of the property is being

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.630
 environmentalism that's that are 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.030
 same ones that used to use 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.799
 classical communist arguments for 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.110
 destroy the property destroy the 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.810
 property rights and disrupt the

 agribusiness they see that the arguments 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.070
 it does not work are now using the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.460
 environmentalism are watermelons green by 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.110
 outside and red inside and they use the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.000
 that our common sense 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.100
 we want to preserve nature is 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.740
 preserve nature without this 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.459
 preservation and this we are the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.520
 achieved 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.290
 now they are taking our common sense 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.990
 and wanting to transform into a true 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.120
 environmental psychosis today everything has to 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.580
 be ecologically correct 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.990
 everything has to be this glue came back from 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.000
 would have been a psychosis 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.050
 see for example the new penal code that 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.550
 want to approve at the congress 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.680
 now equates man is an animal one 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.850
 child if abandoned by the new 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.920
 penal code 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.410
 the person who left the child has 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.690
 only eight times smaller than the person 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.610
 who abandoned an animal the owners 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.250
 with this new forest code with these 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.400
 calls app preservation area 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.130
 are receiving a levy 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.540
 the state on your property to 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.350
 say what they should preserve what 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.970
 should not 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.160
 in an abusive manner in a manner 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.680
 totalitarian and that deep down in the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.110
 serves the same communist ideology that is 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.630
 End Property Rights 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.870
 Another issue addressed was the 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.020
 complementary law 122 bar 2006 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.700
 known as the law of homophobia that goes 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.750
 to get back on the agenda at the congress 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.580
 national 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.350
 with the new text authored by the senator 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.380
 marta suplicy 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.970
 according to the students of the institute the text 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.090
 would be a real persecution 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.860
 religious faith and places the same 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.560
 rights of older children and 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.980
 disabled people and the homosexual 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:39.000
 according to them it is a vice contrary to the law 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:42.240
 God made the man and woman 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.960
 marriage only exists between a man and 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.300
 a woman 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.170
 sometimes it 's more this is homophobia 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.270
 homophobia works 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.430
 Then god is homophobic he destroyed 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.820
 two cities on Sunday die because of 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.420
 of the sin of homosexuality and above all 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.000
 what is at stake is the following is that the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.240
 homosexual movement is an improvement but 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.260
 is a minority assured by NGOs 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.730
 international 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.459
 the effort of the UN itself and the government 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.780
 federal what they want when they 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.950
 they talk about homosexual marriage not 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.680
 They want to get married. 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.660
 the vast majority of homosexuals 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.220
 declared that they do not want to get married 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.510
 they want because they want the 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.169
 homosexual marriage so that the 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.820
 society deems normal conduct that is 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.890
 condemned by God's law 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.630
 condemned by the Catholic doctrine of the 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.760
 plínio correia de oliveira institute 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.220
 we do not campaign against 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.380
 homosexual people is not the case we 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.060
 we do against ideology against 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.060
 agenda of the homosexual movement
