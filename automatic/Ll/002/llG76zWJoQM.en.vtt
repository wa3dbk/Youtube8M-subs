00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
this I would have to say is definitely

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.319 
this I would have to say is definitely
the<00:00:32.090> device<00:00:32.540> to<00:00:32.780> get<00:00:33.250> so<00:00:34.250> in<00:00:34.610> addition<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:35.030> the

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
the device to get so in addition to the

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.490 
the device to get so in addition to the
3g<00:00:36.310> you<00:00:37.310> also<00:00:37.490> have<00:00:37.880> Wi-Fi<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:38.930> as<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:39.380> can

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
3g you also have Wi-Fi and as you can

3g you also have Wi-Fi and as you can
see<00:00:39.530> let's<00:00:40.460> see<00:00:40.730> if<00:00:40.880> i<00:00:40.970> can<00:00:41.150> get<00:00:41.270> closer<00:00:41.630> in<00:00:42.050> the

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
see let's see if i can get closer in the

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.100 
see let's see if i can get closer in the
upper<00:00:42.560> right<00:00:42.770> um<00:00:43.670> a<00:00:43.790> so<00:00:44.360> i<00:00:44.390> have<00:00:44.690> a<00:00:44.720> tmobile

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
upper right um a so i have a tmobile

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.000 
upper right um a so i have a tmobile
Wi-Fi<00:00:45.950> router<00:00:46.550> here<00:00:46.880> and<00:00:47.060> with<00:00:47.930> i<00:00:48.440> guess<00:00:48.890> with

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
Wi-Fi router here and with i guess with

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.810 
Wi-Fi router here and with i guess with
any<00:00:49.160> router<00:00:49.400> this<00:00:49.700> will<00:00:49.880> work<00:00:50.030> so<00:00:50.710> t-mobile<00:00:51.820> um

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
any router this will work so t-mobile um

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.840 
any router this will work so t-mobile um
a<00:00:52.970> which<00:00:53.900> is<00:00:54.079> there<00:00:54.320> at<00:00:54.530> home<00:00:55.040> hot<00:00:55.430> spot<00:00:55.730> at

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
a which is there at home hot spot at

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.770 
a which is there at home hot spot at
home<00:00:56.500> capability<00:00:57.500> does<00:00:57.710> work<00:00:57.950> on<00:00:58.130> this<00:00:58.220> device

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
home capability does work on this device

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.590 
home capability does work on this device
so<00:00:59.780> in<00:01:00.440> addition<00:01:00.620> to<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:01.130> 3g<00:01:01.610> it<00:01:01.820> has<00:01:02.329> the

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
so in addition to the 3g it has the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.639 
so in addition to the 3g it has the
latest<00:01:02.930> BlackBerry<00:01:03.500> OS<00:01:03.909> five-point<00:01:05.380> right<00:01:06.380> on

latest BlackBerry OS five-point right on

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.370 
latest BlackBerry OS five-point right on
it<00:01:06.799> as<00:01:06.920> well<00:01:07.539> let's<00:01:08.539> take<00:01:08.719> a<00:01:08.780> look<00:01:08.869> at<00:01:09.229> the

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
it as well let's take a look at the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.340 
it as well let's take a look at the
hardware<00:01:09.649> so<00:01:10.460> this<00:01:10.609> is<00:01:10.639> the<00:01:10.880> updated<00:01:11.719> bold<00:01:12.020> and

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
hardware so this is the updated bold and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.080 
hardware so this is the updated bold and
I<00:01:12.439> don't<00:01:12.649> have<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.009> original<00:01:13.609> bolt<00:01:13.819> to

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
I don't have the original bolt to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.639 
I don't have the original bolt to
compare<00:01:14.509> but<00:01:14.719> the<00:01:14.810> original<00:01:14.899> bold<00:01:15.200> was<00:01:15.380> a<00:01:15.409> bit

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
compare but the original bold was a bit

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.370 
compare but the original bold was a bit
wider<00:01:15.889> have<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:16.969> same<00:01:17.210> kind<00:01:17.450> of<00:01:17.539> angled<00:01:18.079> keys

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
wider have the same kind of angled keys

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.289 
wider have the same kind of angled keys
you<00:01:19.159> can<00:01:19.189> kind<00:01:19.429> of<00:01:19.459> see<00:01:19.549> in<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.789> design<00:01:20.119> the

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
you can kind of see in the design the

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.139 
you can kind of see in the design the
key<00:01:20.479> design<00:01:20.899> is<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:21.380> same<00:01:21.649> as<00:01:21.859> the<00:01:22.009> bold<00:01:22.310> with

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
key design is the same as the bold with

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.289 
key design is the same as the bold with
a<00:01:23.179> little<00:01:23.479> tighter<00:01:24.469> closer<00:01:25.189> proximity<00:01:25.579> and

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
a little tighter closer proximity and

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.779 
a little tighter closer proximity and
slightly<00:01:26.959> smaller<00:01:27.289> buttons<00:01:27.679> but<00:01:28.399> it<00:01:28.490> has<00:01:28.609> the

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
slightly smaller buttons but it has the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.569 
slightly smaller buttons but it has the
same<00:01:28.999> angle<00:01:29.420> design<00:01:29.749> there<00:01:30.249> one<00:01:31.249> thing<00:01:31.459> you

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
same angle design there one thing you

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.669 
same angle design there one thing you
also<00:01:31.759> notice<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:32.539> has<00:01:32.749> the<00:01:32.959> track<00:01:33.319> pad

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
also notice this has the track pad

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.300 
also notice this has the track pad
rather<00:01:34.340> than<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:34.729> trackball<00:01:35.469> which<00:01:36.469> takes<00:01:37.249> a

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
rather than the trackball which takes a

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.969 
rather than the trackball which takes a
bit<00:01:37.429> of<00:01:37.459> practice<00:01:37.719> but<00:01:38.719> actually<00:01:39.109> I<00:01:39.499> used<00:01:39.829> it

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
bit of practice but actually I used it

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.190 
bit of practice but actually I used it
before<00:01:40.100> on<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.639> earlier<00:01:41.139> blackberry<00:01:42.139> curve

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
before on the earlier blackberry curve

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.379 
before on the earlier blackberry curve
from<00:01:43.009> t-mobile<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.670> actually<00:01:44.029> found<00:01:44.209> that<00:01:44.270> i

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:44.389 
from t-mobile and actually found that i

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:45.969 
from t-mobile and actually found that i
liked<00:01:44.659> it<00:01:44.810> i<00:01:44.929> just<00:01:44.990> have<00:01:45.289> to<00:01:45.380> get<00:01:45.469> used<00:01:45.770> have<00:01:45.889> to

the<00:01:53.149> exact<00:01:53.479> shell<00:01:53.799> display<00:01:54.799> resolution<00:01:55.459> put

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:55.639 
the exact shell display resolution put

00:01:55.639 --> 00:02:00.519 
the exact shell display resolution put
that<00:01:55.759> into<00:01:55.880> my<00:01:55.999> review<00:01:58.779> so<00:01:59.779> ended<00:02:00.169> up<00:02:00.289> top<00:02:00.499> of
