hey<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.089> is<00:00:21.240> Jason<00:00:21.419> national<00:00:21.869> camera

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
hey this is Jason national camera

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.330 
hey this is Jason national camera
exchange<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.710> tutorial<00:00:23.160> we're<00:00:23.250> gonna

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
exchange in this tutorial we're gonna

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.200 
exchange in this tutorial we're gonna
look<00:00:23.519> at<00:00:23.699> noise<00:00:24.000> reduction<00:00:24.419> in<00:00:25.189> Lightroom<00:00:26.210> so

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
look at noise reduction in Lightroom so

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.569 
look at noise reduction in Lightroom so
you<00:00:27.269> can<00:00:27.359> see<00:00:27.480> down<00:00:27.599> here<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:28.140> my<00:00:28.230> detail<00:00:28.470> panel

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
you can see down here in my detail panel

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.040 
you can see down here in my detail panel
I<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:31.669> noise<00:00:32.669> reduction<00:00:32.970> and<00:00:33.329> sharpening<00:00:33.809> in

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
I have noise reduction and sharpening in

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.780 
I have noise reduction and sharpening in
a<00:00:34.110> previous<00:00:34.470> video<00:00:34.590> we<00:00:34.769> went<00:00:34.920> through<00:00:35.430> some<00:00:35.760> of

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
a previous video we went through some of

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.899 
a previous video we went through some of
the<00:00:35.910> sharpening<00:00:37.339> but<00:00:38.339> they<00:00:38.460> kind<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.670> need<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:38.909 
the sharpening but they kind of need to

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:42.860 
the sharpening but they kind of need to
be<00:00:38.970> done<00:00:39.269> a<00:00:39.600> little<00:00:40.050> bit<00:00:40.170> hand-in-hand<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.870> as

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
be done a little bit hand-in-hand so as

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.899 
be done a little bit hand-in-hand so as
you<00:00:43.079> sharpen<00:00:43.589> sometimes<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.399> bring<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.760> more

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
you sharpen sometimes you bring out more

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.360 
you sharpen sometimes you bring out more
noise<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.659> as<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.290> add<00:00:46.710> noise<00:00:46.979> reduction

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
noise and as you add noise reduction

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.410 
noise and as you add noise reduction
sometimes<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.769> soften<00:00:49.769> your<00:00:49.890> image<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.430> but

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
sometimes you soften your image so but

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.549 
sometimes you soften your image so but
this<00:00:51.540> portion<00:00:51.809> we're<00:00:52.019> gonna<00:00:52.140> look<00:00:52.290> at<00:00:52.439> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
this portion we're gonna look at the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.320 
this portion we're gonna look at the
noise<00:00:52.739> reduction<00:00:52.890> specifically<00:00:53.729> it's

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
noise reduction specifically it's

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.969 
noise reduction specifically it's
important<00:00:54.809> when<00:00:54.930> you're<00:00:55.049> doing<00:00:55.229> these<00:00:55.559> kind

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
important when you're doing these kind

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:57.469 
important when you're doing these kind
of<00:00:56.010> adjustments<00:00:56.549> you're<00:00:56.610> gonna<00:00:56.820> really<00:00:57.119> find

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
of adjustments you're gonna really find

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.179 
of adjustments you're gonna really find
details<00:00:58.049> in<00:00:58.229> the<00:00:58.290> image<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.860> important

00:00:59.179 --> 00:00:59.189 
details in the image and it's important

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:02.780 
details in the image and it's important
to<00:00:59.220> zoom<00:00:59.610> in<00:01:00.799> so<00:01:01.799> that<00:01:01.830> you<00:01:02.040> can<00:01:02.159> see<00:01:02.460> what's

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
to zoom in so that you can see what's

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.030 
to zoom in so that you can see what's
going<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.239> as<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.930> add<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.439> noise<00:01:04.739> reduction

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
going on as you add this noise reduction

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.160 
going on as you add this noise reduction
or<00:01:05.610> do<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.000> sharpen<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.750> they<00:01:06.840> put<00:01:07.080> in

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
or do this sharpen and so they put in

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.570 
or do this sharpen and so they put in
this<00:01:07.259> little<00:01:07.409> panel<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.369> kind<00:01:08.520> of

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
this little panel here we can kind of

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.319 
this little panel here we can kind of
see<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:10.500> closer<00:01:11.310> view<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.759> what's<00:01:12.030> going<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.270> on

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
see a closer view of what's going on on

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:13.760 
see a closer view of what's going on on
the<00:01:12.509> image<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.320> image<00:01:13.619> it's

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the image you can see this image it's

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.670 
the image you can see this image it's
got<00:01:13.890> some<00:01:14.040> noise<00:01:14.220> up<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.509> at<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> top<00:01:16.350> here

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
got some noise up here at the top here

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.109 
got some noise up here at the top here
in<00:01:16.740> our<00:01:16.860> histogram<00:01:17.189> window<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.090> I

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
in our histogram window you can see I

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.200 
in our histogram window you can see I
shot<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.810> ISO<00:01:19.380> 1250<00:01:20.130> which<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:21.060> some

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
shot this at ISO 1250 which on some

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.420 
shot this at ISO 1250 which on some
cameras<00:01:21.540> isn't<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.409> big<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.829> problem<00:01:23.070> this

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
cameras isn't that big of a problem this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.149 
cameras isn't that big of a problem this
is<00:01:23.579> my<00:01:23.700> Micro<00:01:24.000> Four<00:01:24.179> Thirds<00:01:24.210> body<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.159> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
is my Micro Four Thirds body and the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.739 
is my Micro Four Thirds body and the
smaller<00:01:26.429> sensor<00:01:26.819> just<00:01:26.969> doesn't<00:01:27.329> handle<00:01:27.569> this

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:27.749 
smaller sensor just doesn't handle this

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:29.840 
smaller sensor just doesn't handle this
type<00:01:28.079> of<00:01:28.109> lighting<00:01:28.439> quite<00:01:28.710> as<00:01:28.799> well<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.219> we're

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
type of lighting quite as well so we're

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.980 
type of lighting quite as well so we're
going<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:29.999> do<00:01:30.090> some<00:01:30.270> noise<00:01:30.420> reduction<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.869> this

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
going to do some noise reduction on this

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.580 
going to do some noise reduction on this
image<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.880> actually<00:01:33.179> don't<00:01:33.719> use<00:01:33.869> this

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
image so I actually don't use this

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.330 
image so I actually don't use this
window<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:36.289> instead<00:01:37.289> I<00:01:37.350> zoom<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.189> my

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
window here instead I zoom in in my

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.660 
window here instead I zoom in in my
workspace<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.840> see<00:01:40.159> better<00:01:41.159> there<00:01:41.429> so<00:01:41.639> i

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
workspace so I can see better there so i

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.550 
workspace so I can see better there so i
zoom<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:42.149> I'm<00:01:42.539> actually<00:01:42.869> up<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.200> three<00:01:43.469> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
zoom in here I'm actually up to three to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.950 
zoom in here I'm actually up to three to
one<00:01:43.799> here<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.639> you<00:01:44.819> can<00:01:44.939> see<00:01:45.179> in<00:01:45.389> here<00:01:45.719> that

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
one here and you can see in here that

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.989 
one here and you can see in here that
there's<00:01:46.200> some<00:01:46.530> definite<00:01:47.009> noise<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.819> you

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
there's some definite noise going on you

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:49.730 
there's some definite noise going on you
can<00:01:48.119> see<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> little<00:01:48.420> bit<00:01:48.539> of<00:01:48.659> color<00:01:48.840> noise<00:01:49.109> and

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
can see a little bit of color noise and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.770 
can see a little bit of color noise and
some<00:01:50.189> luminance<00:01:50.579> noise<00:01:50.639> a<00:01:51.090> lot<00:01:51.389> of<00:01:51.509> cameras

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
some luminance noise a lot of cameras

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.480 
some luminance noise a lot of cameras
don't<00:01:51.959> have<00:01:52.259> as<00:01:52.469> much<00:01:52.619> color<00:01:52.920> noise<00:01:53.100> anymore

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
don't have as much color noise anymore

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.069 
don't have as much color noise anymore
so<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> lot<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.270> times<00:01:54.659> you're<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.990> be

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
so a lot of times you're going to be

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.109 
so a lot of times you're going to be
focusing<00:01:55.469> more<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:56.130> luminance<00:01:56.670> portion

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
focusing more on this luminance portion

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.239 
focusing more on this luminance portion
of<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.359> noise<00:01:57.569> reduction<00:01:57.749> instead<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.249 
of the noise reduction instead of the

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:01.910 
of the noise reduction instead of the
color<00:01:59.459> portion<00:01:59.789> but<00:02:00.539> I<00:02:00.810> found<00:02:01.289> an<00:02:01.469> image<00:02:01.590> where

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
color portion but I found an image where

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.580 
color portion but I found an image where
we're<00:02:02.039> gonna<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.639> some<00:02:03.029> color<00:02:03.929> noise<00:02:04.139> and<00:02:04.499> I'm

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
we're gonna see some color noise and I'm

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.929 
we're gonna see some color noise and I'm
actually<00:02:04.709> gonna<00:02:04.920> go<00:02:05.159> up<00:02:05.310> here<00:02:05.639> into<00:02:05.819> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
actually gonna go up here into the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.480 
actually gonna go up here into the
basics<00:02:06.359> panel<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.139> basic<00:02:07.499> panel<00:02:07.709> here<00:02:08.069> and

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.890 

overexposed<00:02:11.490> my<00:02:11.850> image<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.510> I'm<00:02:12.569> gonna<00:02:12.660> bring

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
overexposed my image so I'm gonna bring

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.420 
overexposed my image so I'm gonna bring
up<00:02:13.080> these<00:02:13.200> shadows<00:02:13.709> which<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.040> one<00:02:14.190> place

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
up these shadows which is one place

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.590 
up these shadows which is one place
where<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.670> can<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:15.090> start<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.360> see<00:02:15.510> this

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
where you can really start to see this

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.030 
where you can really start to see this
noise<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.020> can<00:02:16.110> really<00:02:16.440> see<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.680> color

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
noise so you can really see that color

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.699 
noise so you can really see that color
noise<00:02:17.280> appearing<00:02:17.880> in<00:02:18.000> my<00:02:18.090> sky<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.720> if<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:19.590> go

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
noise appearing in my sky and if we go

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.650 
noise appearing in my sky and if we go
back<00:02:19.890> down<00:02:20.099> here<00:02:20.430> then<00:02:20.670> now<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.150> can<00:02:21.450> kind<00:02:21.630> of

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
back down here then now I can kind of

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.300 
back down here then now I can kind of
adjust<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.349> noise<00:02:22.650> reduction<00:02:22.860> but<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.130> really

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
adjust this noise reduction but I really

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.920 
adjust this noise reduction but I really
want<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.610> see<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.030> noise<00:02:24.180> that's<00:02:24.569> there

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
want you to see the noise that's there

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.930 
want you to see the noise that's there
so<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.709> can<00:02:25.860> tell<00:02:26.099> what's<00:02:26.340> going<00:02:26.520> on<00:02:26.640> so

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
so that you can tell what's going on so

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.180 
so that you can tell what's going on so
here<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.900> can<00:02:27.990> see<00:02:28.230> I've<00:02:28.350> got<00:02:28.530> both<00:02:28.770> some

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
here you can see I've got both some

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.920 
here you can see I've got both some
luminance<00:02:29.550> noise<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.090> some<00:02:30.210> color<00:02:30.390> noise<00:02:30.600> a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
luminance noise and some color noise a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.100 
luminance noise and some color noise a
lot<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.470> times<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.800> don't<00:02:31.950> need<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.430> actually

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
lot of times you don't need to actually

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.080 
lot of times you don't need to actually
just<00:02:33.350> some<00:02:34.100> of<00:02:34.160> these<00:02:34.250> separate<00:02:34.730> controls

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
just some of these separate controls

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.360 
just some of these separate controls
detail<00:02:35.540> contrast<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.530> detailed<00:02:36.860> smoothness

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
detail contrast and detailed smoothness

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.250 
detail contrast and detailed smoothness
you<00:02:37.490> don't<00:02:37.670> necessarily<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.810> work<00:02:39.080> with

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
you don't necessarily have to work with

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.870 
you don't necessarily have to work with
those<00:02:39.410> often<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.950> defaults<00:02:40.400> work<00:02:40.610> pretty

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
those often the defaults work pretty

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.590 
those often the defaults work pretty
well<00:02:41.060> so

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
well so

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.800 
well so
but<00:02:42.260> illuminance<00:02:42.950> here<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.820> go<00:02:44.300> up<00:02:44.480> here

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
but illuminance here is I go up here

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.410 
but illuminance here is I go up here
basically<00:02:45.800> what<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.010> do<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.850> soften

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
basically what you do is you you soften

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.060 
basically what you do is you you soften
the<00:02:47.510> image<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.990> a<00:02:48.020> certain<00:02:48.290> extent<00:02:48.620> so<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.890> do

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
the image to a certain extent so you do

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.350 
the image to a certain extent so you do
have<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.250> be<00:02:49.370> aware<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.850> fact<00:02:50.060> that's<00:02:50.270> why

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
have to be aware of the fact that's why

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.730 
have to be aware of the fact that's why
I<00:02:50.420> was<00:02:50.540> saying<00:02:50.720> sharpening<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.710> noise

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
I was saying sharpening and noise

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.030 
I was saying sharpening and noise
reduction<00:02:52.010> kind<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.580> go<00:02:52.790> hand<00:02:53.000> in<00:02:53.150> hand<00:02:53.210> so<00:02:54.040> as

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
reduction kind of go hand in hand so as

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.830 
reduction kind of go hand in hand so as
you<00:02:55.190> can<00:02:55.250> see<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.550> can<00:02:55.670> see<00:02:55.850> I'm<00:02:55.970> losing<00:02:56.630> some

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
you can see you can see I'm losing some

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.330 
you can see you can see I'm losing some
of<00:02:56.870> my<00:02:56.930> noise<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.500> image<00:02:57.740> is<00:02:57.860> becoming<00:02:58.130> less

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
of my noise the image is becoming less

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.010 
of my noise the image is becoming less
grainy<00:02:58.670> I<00:02:58.790> do<00:02:59.000> still<00:02:59.330> have<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.510> color<00:02:59.840> noise

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
grainy I do still have that color noise

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.660 
grainy I do still have that color noise
in<00:03:00.290> there<00:03:00.410> though<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:02.200> if<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.320> go<00:03:03.560> down<00:03:03.890> here<00:03:04.520> to

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
in there though so if I go down here to

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.480 
in there though so if I go down here to
detail<00:03:05.560> I'm<00:03:06.560> gonna<00:03:06.740> preserve<00:03:07.100> some<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.370> the

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
detail I'm gonna preserve some of the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.520 
detail I'm gonna preserve some of the
detail<00:03:07.820> that<00:03:08.030> might<00:03:08.209> be<00:03:08.390> eaten<00:03:08.750> up<00:03:08.840> by<00:03:09.350> my

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
detail that might be eaten up by my

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.650 
detail that might be eaten up by my
noise<00:03:09.770> reduction<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.490> but<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.270> higher<00:03:11.450> this

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
noise reduction so but the higher this

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.930 
noise reduction so but the higher this
gets<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.620> know<00:03:12.709> I<00:03:12.739> kind<00:03:13.130> of<00:03:13.190> take<00:03:13.400> away<00:03:13.640> some

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
gets you know I kind of take away some

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.690 
gets you know I kind of take away some
of<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.090> effect<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.540> my<00:03:14.630> noise<00:03:14.810> reduction<00:03:15.110> and

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
of the effect of my noise reduction and

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.790 
of the effect of my noise reduction and
the<00:03:16.700> lower<00:03:16.910> this<00:03:17.120> gets<00:03:17.390> I<00:03:17.660> kind<00:03:18.140> of<00:03:18.230> soften<00:03:18.739> the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
the lower this gets I kind of soften the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.770 
the lower this gets I kind of soften the
image<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:19.070> little<00:03:19.190> bit<00:03:19.370> more<00:03:19.550> so<00:03:19.820> 50<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.600> where

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
image a little bit more so 50 is where

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.240 
image a little bit more so 50 is where
defaults<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.530> that<00:03:21.680> tends<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.100> work<00:03:22.190> pretty

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
defaults and that tends to work pretty

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.030 
defaults and that tends to work pretty
well<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.880> then<00:03:23.090> contrast<00:03:23.770> preserve<00:03:24.770> some<00:03:24.980> of

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
well and then contrast preserve some of

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.910 
well and then contrast preserve some of
the<00:03:25.100> contrast<00:03:25.670> in<00:03:25.970> areas<00:03:26.630> where<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.709> noise

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
the contrast in areas where the noise

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.180 
the contrast in areas where the noise
reduction<00:03:28.100> is<00:03:28.580> kind<00:03:28.880> of<00:03:29.890> overriding<00:03:30.890> that<00:03:31.040> but

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
reduction is kind of overriding that but

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.190 
reduction is kind of overriding that but
again<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:32.180> have<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:32.420> too<00:03:32.570> high<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.140> you

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
again you have that too high and you

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.530 
again you have that too high and you
kind<00:03:33.410> of<00:03:33.730> override<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:35.030> effect<00:03:35.330> of<00:03:35.450> the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
kind of override the effect of the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.650 
kind of override the effect of the
luminance<00:03:35.930> slider<00:03:36.200> so<00:03:36.790> in<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:38.209> case<00:03:38.450> I'll

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
luminance slider so in this case I'll

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.470 
luminance slider so in this case I'll
leave<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:38.989> at<00:03:39.140> zero<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:40.190> like<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.090> said<00:03:41.239> I<00:03:41.269> found

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
leave it at zero so like I said I found

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.880 
leave it at zero so like I said I found
an<00:03:41.630> image<00:03:41.720> specifically<00:03:42.440> that's<00:03:42.590> gonna<00:03:42.680> have

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
an image specifically that's gonna have

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.170 
an image specifically that's gonna have
some<00:03:42.920> color<00:03:43.280> noise<00:03:43.489> because<00:03:43.910> a<00:03:43.940> lot<00:03:44.150> of

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
some color noise because a lot of

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.580 
some color noise because a lot of
cameras<00:03:44.540> don't<00:03:44.720> have<00:03:44.930> as<00:03:45.049> much<00:03:45.230> color<00:03:45.440> noise

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
cameras don't have as much color noise

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.770 
cameras don't have as much color noise
anymore<00:03:46.100> so<00:03:46.549> if<00:03:46.700> you<00:03:46.820> look<00:03:47.030> here<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.540> color

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
anymore so if you look here the color

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.070 
anymore so if you look here the color
slider<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:48.590> can<00:03:48.739> see<00:03:48.980> that<00:03:49.280> just<00:03:49.549> by<00:03:50.269> barely

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
slider you can see that just by barely

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.770 
slider you can see that just by barely
touching<00:03:51.470> in<00:03:51.730> most<00:03:52.730> my<00:03:52.940> color<00:03:53.209> noise<00:03:53.420> went

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
touching in most my color noise went

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.210 
touching in most my color noise went
away<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.910> as<00:03:55.910> I<00:03:56.299> go<00:03:56.420> up<00:03:56.450> again<00:03:57.049> you<00:03:57.950> have<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.130> be

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
away and as I go up again you have to be

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.190 
away and as I go up again you have to be
careful<00:03:58.640> it's<00:03:59.120> softening<00:03:59.570> my<00:03:59.660> image<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.080> little

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
careful it's softening my image a little

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.630 
careful it's softening my image a little
bit<00:04:00.350> too<00:04:00.470> much<00:04:00.680> it's<00:04:00.980> kind<00:04:01.190> of<00:04:01.250> taking<00:04:01.549> out

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
bit too much it's kind of taking out

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.729 
bit too much it's kind of taking out
some<00:04:01.850> of<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:02.000> saturation<00:04:02.690> so<00:04:03.410> we'll<00:04:03.530> go<00:04:03.590> back

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
some of the saturation so we'll go back

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.729 
some of the saturation so we'll go back
down<00:04:03.950> here<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:05.180> we'll<00:04:06.080> go<00:04:06.200> up<00:04:06.320> into<00:04:06.500> maybe

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
down here and we'll go up into maybe

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.190 
down here and we'll go up into maybe
this<00:04:07.450> you<00:04:08.450> know<00:04:08.540> 10<00:04:08.870> area<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:11.510> again<00:04:11.870> kind<00:04:12.170> of

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
this you know 10 area and again kind of

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.140 
this you know 10 area and again kind of
similar<00:04:12.560> detail<00:04:13.070> preserve<00:04:13.790> some<00:04:14.000> of<00:04:14.030> the

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
similar detail preserve some of the

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.430 
similar detail preserve some of the
detail<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:14.510> might<00:04:14.630> be<00:04:14.750> losing<00:04:14.930> and

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
detail you might be losing and

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.349 
detail you might be losing and
smoothness<00:04:15.920> actually<00:04:18.729> kind<00:04:19.729> of<00:04:19.820> smooths<00:04:20.150> out

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
smoothness actually kind of smooths out

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.990 
smoothness actually kind of smooths out
some<00:04:20.750> of<00:04:20.870> that<00:04:20.989> color<00:04:21.530> noise<00:04:21.799> where<00:04:22.460> you<00:04:22.820> get

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
some of that color noise where you get

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.610 
some of that color noise where you get
some<00:04:23.180> blotchiness<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:25.540> now<00:04:26.540> that<00:04:26.600> I<00:04:26.780> have<00:04:26.840> lost

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
some blotchiness so now that I have lost

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.140 
some blotchiness so now that I have lost
some<00:04:27.860> of<00:04:27.919> my<00:04:27.979> color<00:04:28.190> noise<00:04:28.370> I<00:04:28.640> can<00:04:28.760> see<00:04:28.940> that<00:04:29.120> I

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
some of my color noise I can see that I

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.090 
some of my color noise I can see that I
have<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.360> little<00:04:29.600> bit<00:04:29.840> more<00:04:30.020> luminance<00:04:30.620> you

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
have a little bit more luminance you

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.770 
have a little bit more luminance you
know<00:04:31.220> noise<00:04:31.490> going<00:04:32.000> on<00:04:32.120> here<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:32.600> can

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
know noise going on here and I can

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.260 
know noise going on here and I can
actually<00:04:32.960> raise<00:04:33.800> that<00:04:34.070> if<00:04:34.310> I<00:04:34.430> want<00:04:34.669> to<00:04:34.850> but<00:04:35.120> you

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
actually raise that if I want to but you

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.360 
actually raise that if I want to but you
have<00:04:35.390> to<00:04:35.479> be<00:04:35.570> aware<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:36.050> I'm<00:04:36.229> losing<00:04:36.830> some<00:04:37.340> of

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
have to be aware that I'm losing some of

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.840 
have to be aware that I'm losing some of
the<00:04:37.490> finer<00:04:37.700> details<00:04:38.210> in<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.450> image<00:04:39.820> so<00:04:40.820> you

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
the finer details in the image so you

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.969 
the finer details in the image so you
can<00:04:41.060> see<00:04:41.270> that<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.960> overall<00:04:42.380> image<00:04:42.590> might

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
can see that the overall image might

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.800 
can see that the overall image might
suffer<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.550> little<00:04:43.700> bit<00:04:43.849> but<00:04:44.210> if<00:04:44.330> we<00:04:44.419> go<00:04:44.510> back<00:04:44.660> up

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
suffer a little bit but if we go back up

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.510 
suffer a little bit but if we go back up
into<00:04:44.930> these<00:04:45.050> trees<00:04:45.289> real<00:04:45.500> quick<00:04:45.650> again

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
into these trees real quick again

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.279 
into these trees real quick again
like<00:04:46.669> a<00:04:46.940> lot<00:04:47.240> of<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.389> other<00:04:47.509> tools<00:04:47.780> if<00:04:48.169> you

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
like a lot of the other tools if you

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.740 
like a lot of the other tools if you
hold<00:04:48.500> alt<00:04:48.770> down<00:04:48.910> some<00:04:49.910> of<00:04:49.940> these<00:04:50.060> sliders<00:04:50.330> you

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
hold alt down some of these sliders you

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.089 
hold alt down some of these sliders you
know<00:04:50.840> we<00:04:50.990> we<00:04:51.229> switch<00:04:51.560> to<00:04:51.710> black<00:04:51.860> and<00:04:52.039> white

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
know we we switch to black and white

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:53.439 
know we we switch to black and white
again<00:04:52.340> because<00:04:52.729> we<00:04:52.819> can<00:04:52.940> kind<00:04:53.090> of<00:04:53.120> see<00:04:53.270> what's

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
again because we can kind of see what's

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.719 
again because we can kind of see what's
going<00:04:53.509> on<00:04:53.750> a<00:04:53.810> little<00:04:53.960> bit<00:04:54.400> contrast<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.699> can

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
going on a little bit contrast you can

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.490 
going on a little bit contrast you can
you<00:04:56.150> know<00:04:56.240> see<00:04:56.840> what's<00:04:56.990> going<00:04:57.110> on<00:04:57.199> a<00:04:57.259> little

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
you know see what's going on a little

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.499 
you know see what's going on a little
bit<00:04:57.620> more<00:04:57.800> so<00:04:58.009> using<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.550> Alt<00:04:58.699> key<00:04:58.789> along<00:04:59.449> with

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
bit more so using the Alt key along with

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.119 
bit more so using the Alt key along with
some<00:04:59.870> of<00:04:59.930> these<00:04:59.990> sliders<00:05:00.289> it's<00:05:00.650> definitely<00:05:01.069> a

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.129 
some of these sliders it's definitely a

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.040 
some of these sliders it's definitely a
good<00:05:01.849> way<00:05:01.970> to<00:05:02.030> kind<00:05:02.330> of<00:05:02.360> measure<00:05:02.539> what's<00:05:02.870> going

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
good way to kind of measure what's going

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.879 
good way to kind of measure what's going
on<00:05:03.229> and<00:05:04.330> that<00:05:05.330> is<00:05:05.539> noise<00:05:05.780> reduction<00:05:06.229> in

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
on and that is noise reduction in

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.830 
on and that is noise reduction in
Lightroom<00:05:07.580> so<00:05:07.819> it's<00:05:08.120> important<00:05:08.569> to<00:05:08.599> kind<00:05:08.810> of

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
Lightroom so it's important to kind of

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.360 
Lightroom so it's important to kind of
run<00:05:09.020> that<00:05:09.199> on<00:05:09.319> a<00:05:09.349> lot<00:05:09.590> of<00:05:09.620> your<00:05:09.889> low-light

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
run that on a lot of your low-light

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.240 
run that on a lot of your low-light
shots<00:05:10.610> and/or<00:05:11.449> shots<00:05:12.020> where<00:05:12.289> you<00:05:12.409> really

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
shots and/or shots where you really

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.730 
shots and/or shots where you really
start<00:05:13.879> to<00:05:14.150> over<00:05:14.479> expose<00:05:14.840> those<00:05:15.050> shadows<00:05:15.500> like

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
start to over expose those shadows like

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.460 
start to over expose those shadows like
we<00:05:15.860> did<00:05:16.009> on<00:05:16.129> this<00:05:16.250> one<00:05:17.020> thanks<00:05:18.020> for<00:05:18.139> watching
