00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
set that here of course that can be

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.580 
set that here of course that can be
adjusted<00:00:35.910> let's<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.600> hit<00:00:36.690> start<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.200> there

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
adjusted let's just hit start and there

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
closed out of the timer bar itself so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.389 
closed out of the timer bar itself so
just<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.649> like<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.770> kind<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.190> fades

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
just like that I like I kind of fades

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.130 
just like that I like I kind of fades
out<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.670> view<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.879> pretty<00:01:00.030> slick<00:01:00.390> isn't<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.750> so

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
out of view is pretty slick isn't it so

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.229 
out of view is pretty slick isn't it so
let<00:01:01.289> me<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.530> show<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:02.699> happens<00:01:03.059> when

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
let me just show you what happens when

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.850 
let me just show you what happens when
the<00:01:03.329> timer<00:01:03.539> actually<00:01:03.960> gets<00:01:04.170> down<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.559> zero

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the timer actually gets down to zero

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.100 
the timer actually gets down to zero
here<00:01:05.100> let<00:01:05.280> me<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.580> speed<00:01:06.479> things<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.080> bit

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
here let me just speed things up a bit

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.940 
here let me just speed things up a bit
and<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.549> go<00:01:08.580> three<00:01:09.090> two<00:01:09.720> one<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:12.950> there

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and there we go three two one and there

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.999 
and there we go three two one and there
we<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.570> hear<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> timer<00:01:16.710> go<00:01:16.979> off

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
we go so you can hear the timer go off

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.850 
we go so you can hear the timer go off
and<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.299> how<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.450> are<00:01:18.750> alerted<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.350> when

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and that is how you are alerted to when

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.310 
and that is how you are alerted to when
time<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.299> pretty<00:01:21.780> straightforward

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
time is up so pretty straightforward

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.710 
time is up so pretty straightforward
pretty<00:01:22.500> simple<00:01:22.890> ok<00:01:23.820> now<00:01:24.000> let's<00:01:24.030> show<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
pretty simple ok now let's show you the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.380 
pretty simple ok now let's show you the
stopwatch<00:01:25.259> functionality<00:01:26.220> we'll<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.180> tap

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
stopwatch functionality we'll just tap

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.539 
stopwatch functionality we'll just tap
stopwatch<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.229> there<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.310> pretty

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
stopwatch here and there it's pretty

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.960 
stopwatch here and there it's pretty
much<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.360> same<00:01:31.460> functionality<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.759> tap

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
much the same functionality you just tap

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.030 
much the same functionality you just tap
the<00:01:33.000> time<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.869> start<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.259> stopwatch<00:01:34.409> tap<00:01:34.920> it

can switch out any app and it works just

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.339 
can switch out any app and it works just
well<00:02:40.159> and<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.549> still<00:02:40.819> stays<00:02:41.180> there<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:42.019> if

to what you're doing the timer bar is

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:48.159 
to what you're doing the timer bar is
going<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.120> be<00:02:47.180> nice<00:02:47.359> because<00:02:47.569> it's<00:02:47.810> always

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:48.169 
going to be nice because it's always

with something like sbsettings and

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.599 
with something like sbsettings and
you're<00:02:57.650> going<00:02:57.769> to<00:02:57.859> have<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> little<00:02:58.129> conflict

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
you're going to have a little conflict

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.580 
you're going to have a little conflict
there<00:02:58.909> instead<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.659> actually<00:02:59.959> invoking

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
there instead of actually invoking

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.349 
there instead of actually invoking
sbsettings<00:03:01.220> it'll<00:03:01.579> probably<00:03:01.760> just<00:03:02.030> start<00:03:02.209> or

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
sbsettings it'll probably just start or

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.300 
sbsettings it'll probably just start or
stop<00:03:02.389> the<00:03:02.720> timer<00:03:02.959> so<00:03:03.560> just<00:03:03.739> keep<00:03:03.829> that<00:03:03.889> in<00:03:04.129> mind

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
stop the timer so just keep that in mind

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.399
