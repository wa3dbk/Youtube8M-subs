00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
Peggy's 16 see ya motion has a whole new

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.480 
Peggy's 16 see ya motion has a whole new
set<00:00:17.960> of<00:00:17.990> units<00:00:18.350> gone<00:00:18.620> into<00:00:18.860> the<00:00:18.950> game<00:00:19.100> so<00:00:19.370> it

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
set of units gone into the game so it

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.470 
set of units gone into the game so it
creates<00:00:19.850> a<00:00:20.000> completely<00:00:20.480> different<00:00:20.810> style

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
creates a completely different style

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.700 
creates a completely different style
rather<00:00:23.480> than<00:00:23.690> being<00:00:23.930> predominantly<00:00:24.200> ballet

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
rather than being predominantly ballet

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.650 
rather than being predominantly ballet
based<00:00:25.100> and<00:00:25.460> archers<00:00:26.119> you've<00:00:26.360> now<00:00:26.600> got

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
based and archers you've now got

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.109 
based and archers you've now got
gunpowder<00:00:27.200> units<00:00:27.920> line<00:00:28.100> at<00:00:28.280> Street<00:00:28.550> firing<00:00:29.030> of

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
gunpowder units line at Street firing of

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.610 
gunpowder units line at Street firing of
each<00:00:29.210> other

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:31.620 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.530 

and<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.280> really<00:00:32.490> creates<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.970> lot<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.150> extra

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
and it really creates a lot of extra

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.170 
and it really creates a lot of extra
nuances<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.050> techniques<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.460> strategies

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
nuances and techniques and strategies

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.680 
nuances and techniques and strategies
for<00:00:36.660> players<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.050> play<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.470> in<00:00:37.650> the<00:00:37.740> battle

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.090 

the<00:00:42.690> early<00:00:42.870> informations<00:00:43.379> are<00:00:43.500> actually<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the early informations are actually the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.380 
the early informations are actually the
balance<00:00:44.430> at<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.579> moment<00:00:44.850> was<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.180> quite

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
balance at the moment was really quite

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.170 
balance at the moment was really quite
good<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:47.219> just<00:00:47.489> creates<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.790> hell<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.059> lot

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
good so it just creates a hell of a lot

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.060 
good so it just creates a hell of a lot
more<00:00:48.210> depth<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.720> interest<00:00:48.989> into<00:00:49.410> all<00:00:49.920> the

plater<00:01:16.690> to<00:01:17.560> play<00:01:22.080> example<00:01:23.080> you<00:01:23.170> can<00:01:23.320> now<00:01:23.440> have

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
plater to play example you can now have

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.219 
plater to play example you can now have
multiple<00:01:24.040> avatars<00:01:24.280> where<00:01:24.760> you<00:01:24.940> could<00:01:25.150> have<00:01:25.330> a

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
multiple avatars where you could have a

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.460 
multiple avatars where you could have a
Shogun<00:01:26.800> to<00:01:26.920> avatar<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.520> devotion<00:01:28.090> avatar<00:01:28.840> but

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
Shogun to avatar and devotion avatar but

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.230 
Shogun to avatar and devotion avatar but
they're<00:01:29.619> all<00:01:29.740> feeding<00:01:30.220> into<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.670> same<00:01:30.820> system

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
they're all feeding into the same system

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.000 
they're all feeding into the same system
so<00:01:31.360> there's<00:01:31.540> still<00:01:31.600> one<00:01:31.990> community<00:01:32.560> fighting

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
so there's still one community fighting

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.560 
so there's still one community fighting
battles<00:01:33.220> against<00:01:33.700> each<00:01:33.790> other<00:01:34.030> but<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.420> could

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
battles against each other but you could

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.660 
battles against each other but you could
have<00:01:34.600> a<00:01:34.750> motion<00:01:35.050> army<00:01:35.590> up<00:01:36.130> against<00:01:36.520> the
