Good morning, it's the morning of day 4,
Tuesday, for us guys. We're here on a 7-night

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.630
carp fishing session with my mates and I've
just had fish no5 and it's a bit special...

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:03.100
Well, here she is, I've only gone and bagged
the biggest carp in the lake, Grey Scar, 48lbs

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.820
4oz of breeze block mirror. 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:16.270
Taken on the Beausoleil carp rig with double
Blue Oyster baits, off the snake bank margin,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.910
very small amount of bait, literally just a
handful of chops, pellets and whole boilies.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.230
The carp was absolutely nailed 1in in the
bottom of the mouth and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.780
I'm blown away, I'm shaking like a leaf.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:52.330
What a fish, what a stunning mirror, you can
see the star burst scale pattern there on his

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:11.460
tail, it's in mint condition. What a session.
Thanks to Mr. Cottam of Nutrabaits for the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:22.990
base mix that I rolled last week to make the
Blue Oyster boilies, it certainly does the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.340
business.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.700
Well, here we are, it's my second forty pound
carp of this session. This carp is called Patch,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.200
43lbs in weight, caught on Blue Oyster
boilies, off the snake bank margin again.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:10.360
It's our third carp of this morning, Alexandre
had 2 fish, a beautiful common carp of 36lbs.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.010
This is fish number 4 for me and it's fish
number 10 in total for us for the week. 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.370
I'm absolutely blown away, carp fishing does
not get better than this. It's the first time that

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.760
I've caught a brace of 40lbs carp in a week,
and they just happen to be from my lake here

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.900
in France. What a result.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.470
Thank you Patch, it's nice to see you again,
maybe next year.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.950
That's what it's all about, catching a few fish,
happy days.
