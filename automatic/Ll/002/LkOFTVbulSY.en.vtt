00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hey everyone, I want to tell you sincerely that I love you. 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.750
 I really love you to come and kiss one, just kiss it. 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.200
 The first film today is two people, in a place I guess is a safari park. 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.160
 This is a rhinoceros 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.300
 If you want to go up, yes! Come on, go up. 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.160
 Don't do this, don't do this. 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.000
 Come on! Right! Come on, ah, ah. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.370
 I know what you are thinking, but it is not like this, he has no sexual intercourse with the rhino. 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.330
 Come on! Oh, my God, that's it! 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:55.680
 This video has already been red-hot. You may have recognized these two people. Rob Dyrdek and Scott Pfaff Rob are the guys who hold the camera. He must have a narration on the video of the National Geographic Channel. 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.660
 Look at these zebras quickly.. Look at the ass of those ass. 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.510
 But what I am worried about is that it seems to be using all life to achieve this moment. 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.970
 Just like my son said to Dad: Dad! I got a full Fellowship from Harvard (A FULL RIDE)! 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.810
 It’s awkward, but do you have a whole rhinoceros on the ride (A FULL RIDE literally)? 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.950
 The next movie has more than 2 million viewers in a week. 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.290
 This is the two anchors reporting on a great event about sausages. 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.870
 This is a .. a sausage competition, judged by me 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.850
 Hey... is it a sausage game? 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.500
 Yes, it is the sausage you put in your mouth or mouth, Ms. 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.560
 Hey! Wait, there is more exciting behind. 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.060
 You can vote online, just on the "Sorrow" website... 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.940
 Um...because you are just thinking about sausages, so... 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.180
 Request Dick.... Oh my God! 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.300
 So just connect to "Sorrow.com" 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.850
 Pick a dick! That was the game I played when I was young! 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.410
 I play black kids at the end of the street every time. 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.410
 Pick a Dick sounds like a TV show. 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.120
 Welcome back to the Pick a Dick scene 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.720
 Are you all ready? 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.990
 Win the big prize! Win the big prize! 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.640
 The two broadcasters are from Canada 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.810
 In detail, the province of Saskatchewan 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.960
 Check it well, Ray, it’s good to figure things out. 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.910
 Yeah, check it out and make things clear... it’s a good thing. 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.480
 The best part of this film is that the two ladies performed really well. 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.880
 I have seen a lot of these situations. When the news anchor said something wrong, he was stuck there. It looked like "God, I want to be fired." 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.990
 But the two ladies are different. They laughed and thought it was fun. 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.760
 We didn’t drink alcohol today, we really didn’t drink alcohol. 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.170
 Ladies, you are amazing! 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.750
 The last film content today is something we have never introduced. 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.620
 This is a grandparent who wants to give their grandson Josh a birthday wish through Youtube. 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.550
 Let's start to smash it! Baby! 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.190
 Send you a 18th birthday blues 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.320
 You are a man now. 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.580
 Have to make your own choices 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.050
 Today is your birthday Josh, this will be news!! 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.610
 Since my grandmother was diagnosed with glaucoma, I found a lot of interesting things with my grandfather. 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.330
 I am just kidding. 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.640
 I found a lot of creative places in the film, especially the grandmother, to see her strange action! 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.310
 But this song has a bit of strangeness in some places. 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.170
 What ingredients would you choose to put on pizza? 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.510
 I think this is unusual. You can't choose pizza ingredients until you are 18 years old!? 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.790
 In this way, you can only eat the squid jalapeno flavor pizza before you reach adulthood!! 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.860
 Dancing your 18th birthday blues 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.840
 Then our program decided to also present a homemade birthday song to Josh. 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.710
 =3Happy birthday to you~Equals 3 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.870
 You can legally buy pornographic books~ legally 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.820
 You can also smoke and tattoos~ go tattoos 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.790
 Suddenly it suddenly became a bag of sticks - a bag of penieis (the term he invented, referring to something that is gay or bad) 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.530
 Happy birthday Josh! 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.660
 Seriously, Josh, no matter who you are or not, only 85,000 people watch this video. 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.530
 Your grandparents are really cool for him x! 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.480
 But do you know what other performances I have introduced? 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.730
 Today's question from netizen Danny DeVito 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.510
嗨Ray! Attention, my problem today is... 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.560
 How do you play tricks? 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.850
 Ok, how do you all play white? 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.490
 Use a whole bag of sticks 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.890
 Leave your creative or interesting answers below, or leave a message on facebook, twitter or google+ 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.450
 Thanks for watching this episode. I am Ray William Johnson. The above information is provided by me. 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.950
 Then tell me, everyone, who do you want to copy, why? 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.590
 (Copy a copyman soldier, then 2 I will) 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.910
 (Only I think Ray is sexy? I am a woman) 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.460
 (Copy Megan Fox, then my little oo will become a cross-eyed eye) 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.530
 (I want to copy a bag of sticks) 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.080
 (I want to copy fenton) (a set of chasing deer dogs) 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.870
 "Pick a Dick" sounds like an iPhone app for gays to find. 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.250
