pretty cool so I've tried to stick with
the<00:02:19.870> dark<00:02:20.620> gray<00:02:20.830> color<00:02:21.220> but<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:22.000> can<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.360> see

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
the dark gray color but you can just see

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.030 
the dark gray color but you can just see
some<00:02:22.810> patches<00:02:23.740> of<00:02:23.770> light<00:02:24.130> gray<00:02:24.660> got<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:26.040> lunch

some patches of light gray got the lunch

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.560 
some patches of light gray got the lunch
there<00:02:27.370> but<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.820> doesn't<00:02:28.060> have<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.210> hook<00:02:28.420> on

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
there but it doesn't have a hook on

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.010 
there but it doesn't have a hook on
there<00:02:28.870> so

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.950 

yeah<00:02:33.590> it's<00:02:33.830> not<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.220> heavy<00:02:34.490> actually<00:02:35.300> I'm

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
yeah it's not that heavy actually I'm

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.850 
yeah it's not that heavy actually I'm
not<00:02:36.170> I'm<00:02:36.470> not<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.950> hundred<00:02:37.160> percent<00:02:37.400> sure<00:02:38.860> about

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
not I'm not a hundred percent sure about

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.990 
not I'm not a hundred percent sure about
how<00:02:40.130> much<00:02:40.340> pieces<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.120> contains<00:02:41.570> but<00:02:43.000> and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
how much pieces it contains but and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.740 
how much pieces it contains but and
there's<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.240> great<00:02:44.390> design<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:47.180> windshield

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
there's a great design so a windshield

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.230 
there's a great design so a windshield
that's<00:02:48.680> my<00:02:49.520> idea<00:02:50.800> if<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:52.070> have<00:02:52.280> done<00:02:52.610> anything

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
that's my idea if you have done anything

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.870 
that's my idea if you have done anything
like<00:02:53.840> that<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:54.260> completely<00:02:54.890> coincidental

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
like that is completely coincidental

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.970 
like that is completely coincidental
coincidence<00:02:57.750> aria

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.820 

so<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.879> still<00:03:03.239> got<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.659> thing<00:03:04.200> except<00:03:04.590> at<00:03:04.709> the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
so it still got that thing except at the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.830 
so it still got that thing except at the
stats<00:03:05.280> attached<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.060> ones<00:03:06.209> you'll<00:03:06.420> not<00:03:06.659> to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
stats attached to the ones you'll not to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.130 
stats attached to the ones you'll not to
the<00:03:06.959> on<00:03:07.650> hood<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.489> car<00:03:08.519> so

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.160 

so<00:03:13.140> yeah<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.660> spots<00:03:15.930> basically

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
so yeah that so the spots basically

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.390 
so yeah that so the spots basically
schools<00:03:16.890> design

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:29.600 

here<00:03:21.030> it's<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:21.720> one<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:21.900> these<00:03:22.110> pieces

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.240 

just<00:03:30.210> like<00:03:30.360> that

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
just like that

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
there's nothing really much to it but

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.650 
there's nothing really much to it but
because<00:04:03.480> it<00:04:03.930> is<00:04:04.280> basically<00:04:05.280> just<00:04:05.660> scoops

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
because it is basically just scoops

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.720
