00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
heard this issue before this game

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.520 
heard this issue before this game
happened<00:05:48.000> I<00:05:49.000> know<00:05:49.750> that<00:05:49.900> make<00:05:50.080> it<00:05:50.200> worse<00:05:50.320> if

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
happened I know that make it worse if

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.560 
happened I know that make it worse if
anything<00:05:53.670> recent<00:05:54.670> new<00:05:55.030> theory<00:05:55.300> that<00:05:55.390> would

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
anything recent new theory that would

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.480 
anything recent new theory that would
make<00:05:55.750> it<00:05:55.900> worse<00:05:56.020> I<00:05:56.230> thought<00:05:56.710> to<00:05:56.830> fix<00:05:57.040> that<00:05:57.220> I

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
make it worse I thought to fix that I

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.040 
make it worse I thought to fix that I
never<00:05:57.820> had<00:05:57.970> that<00:05:58.000> issue<00:06:00.630> and<00:06:01.630> them<00:06:01.840> off<00:06:01.930> the
