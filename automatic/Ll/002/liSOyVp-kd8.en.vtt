00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.690 
we talked about we were creating this
series<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.530> know<00:01:32.650> we<00:01:32.799> wanted<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.280> have

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
series but you know we wanted to have

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.920 
series but you know we wanted to have
these<00:01:33.880> kids<00:01:34.120> that<00:01:34.330> went<00:01:34.450> out<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.659> did<00:01:34.810> the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
these kids that went out and did the

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.960 
these kids that went out and did the
things<00:01:34.960> that<00:01:35.260> we<00:01:35.500> did<00:01:35.710> some<00:01:36.370> it<00:01:36.520> was<00:01:36.700> kind<00:01:36.909> of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
things that we did some it was kind of

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.520 
things that we did some it was kind of
dangerous<00:01:37.090> no<00:01:37.420> I<00:01:37.870> think<00:01:37.990> about<00:01:38.320> it<00:01:38.470> in

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
dangerous no I think about it in

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.190 
dangerous no I think about it in
hindsight<00:01:38.799> but<00:01:39.370> I<00:01:40.060> think<00:01:40.390> we<00:01:40.479> try<00:01:40.869> to<00:01:40.930> make<00:01:41.080> the

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
hindsight but I think we try to make the

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.039 
hindsight but I think we try to make the
show<00:01:42.130> sort<00:01:42.369> of<00:01:42.460> embody<00:01:42.760> what<00:01:43.119> a<00:01:43.330> nine-year-old

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
show sort of embody what a nine-year-old

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.410 
show sort of embody what a nine-year-old
boy<00:01:44.200> could<00:01:44.619> get<00:01:44.770> up<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.130> if<00:01:45.460> if<00:01:46.000> they<00:01:46.180> were<00:01:46.210> not

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
boy could get up to if if they were not

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.899 
boy could get up to if if they were not
hampered<00:01:47.049> at<00:01:47.140> all<00:01:47.290> by<00:01:47.500> reality<00:01:48.040> by<00:01:48.310> budget<00:01:48.610> or

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
hampered at all by reality by budget or

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.020 
hampered at all by reality by budget or
time<00:01:49.830> so<00:01:50.830> we<00:01:50.950> always<00:01:51.070> think<00:01:51.340> like<00:01:51.460> when<00:01:51.909> we

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
time so we always think like when we

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.960 
time so we always think like when we
were<00:01:52.150> nine<00:01:52.590> what<00:01:53.590> would<00:01:53.770> we<00:01:53.979> most<00:01:54.310> want<00:01:54.610> to<00:01:54.760> do

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
were nine what would we most want to do

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.640 
were nine what would we most want to do
if<00:01:55.119> we<00:01:55.210> could<00:01:55.390> do<00:01:55.479> anything<00:01:55.510> we<00:01:56.290> build<00:01:56.530> a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
if we could do anything we build a

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.830 
if we could do anything we build a
