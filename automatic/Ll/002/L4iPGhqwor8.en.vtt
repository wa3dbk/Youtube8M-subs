00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
on my Auto join mod you know that mod

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.880 
on my Auto join mod you know that mod
was<00:00:59.550> great<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:01.739> wasn't

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
was great and all but it really wasn't

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.850 
was great and all but it really wasn't
that<00:01:02.070> good<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.640> by<00:01:03.480> default<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:04.080> tried<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.680> join

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that good it by default it tried to join

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.370 
that good it by default it tried to join
a<00:01:04.920> server<00:01:05.280> every<00:01:05.850> 5<00:01:06.060> seconds<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.290> know

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
a server every 5 seconds and you know

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.050 
a server every 5 seconds and you know
that's<00:01:07.560> sort<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.860> taxing<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> server<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
that's sort of taxing on the server and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.230 
that's sort of taxing on the server and
it<00:01:09.540> rarely<00:01:09.869> works<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:11.250> I've<00:01:11.490> redone<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
it rarely works so now I've redone the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.469 
it rarely works so now I've redone the
mod<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.750> now<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.320> much<00:01:13.560> better<00:01:14.360> instead<00:01:15.360> of

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
mod and now it's much better instead of

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.749 
mod and now it's much better instead of
is<00:01:15.689> trying<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.170> join<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.439> server<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.490> mod

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
is trying to join the server this mod

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.260 
is trying to join the server this mod
will<00:01:18.090> actually<00:01:18.840> ping<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> server<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.030> if<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
will actually ping the server and if the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.030 
will actually ping the server and if the
server<00:01:21.540> responds<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> server<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.740> in

I disconnect by the server Auto join pin
number<00:02:02.990> one<00:02:03.170> you'll<00:02:03.740> see<00:02:03.890> that<00:02:04.009> it's<00:02:04.130> full<00:02:04.310> so

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
number one you'll see that it's full so

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.670 
number one you'll see that it's full so
did<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:04.759> try<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:04.970> connect<00:02:05.299> pink<00:02:06.259> number<00:02:06.500> two

did you try to connect pink number two

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.469 
did you try to connect pink number two
and<00:02:07.280> then<00:02:07.640> it's<00:02:07.729> just<00:02:07.790> gonna<00:02:07.909> keep<00:02:08.119> on<00:02:08.270> going

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479

and looks we got in now if it actually

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.140 
and looks we got in now if it actually
tries<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.980> connect<00:02:13.220> then<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.489> doesn't<00:02:13.880> work

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
tries to connect then it doesn't work

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.880 
tries to connect then it doesn't work
for<00:02:14.180> some<00:02:14.390> reason<00:02:14.569> it'll<00:02:15.410> tell<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.800> what

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
play or I've heard of mine Z it's

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.710 
play or I've heard of mine Z it's
becoming<00:02:28.250> pretty<00:02:28.489> popular<00:02:28.910> on<00:02:29.090> YouTube<00:02:29.480> and

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
becoming pretty popular on YouTube and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.150 
becoming pretty popular on YouTube and
you'll<00:02:30.319> see<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:32.239> server<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.920> always

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
you'll see that the server it always

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.920 
you'll see that the server it always
looks<00:02:34.519> like<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.150> has<00:02:35.239> five<00:02:35.480> slots<00:02:35.780> open

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
looks like that it has five slots open

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.990 
looks like that it has five slots open
sone<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.680> gotta<00:02:36.800> click<00:02:36.980> on<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.280> you're<00:02:37.790> gonna

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
sone you gotta click on it you're gonna

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000 
sone you gotta click on it you're gonna
try<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.239> join<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.900> then<00:02:39.410> it's<00:02:39.560> gonna<00:02:39.680> say<00:02:39.860> that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
try to join and then it's gonna say that

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.320 
try to join and then it's gonna say that
the<00:02:40.100> server<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.459> full<00:02:40.780> right<00:02:42.670> okay<00:02:43.670> now<00:02:43.910> the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
the server is full right okay now the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.870 
the server is full right okay now the
reason<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:45.500> says<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:46.220> it's<00:02:46.370> full<00:02:46.580> is

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
reason that it says that it's full is

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.020 
reason that it says that it's full is
because<00:02:47.390> those<00:02:47.630> five<00:02:48.410> slots<00:02:48.860> are<00:02:49.220> actually

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
because those five slots are actually

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.690 
because those five slots are actually
research<00:02:50.600> for<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.080> admins<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:52.250> what<00:02:52.549> does

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
research for the admins so what does

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.360 
research for the admins so what does
this<00:02:52.819> mean<00:02:53.170> this<00:02:54.170> mod<00:02:54.440> will<00:02:54.470> actually<00:02:55.040> try<00:02:55.340> to

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
this mean this mod will actually try to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.420 
this mean this mod will actually try to
join<00:02:55.640> even<00:02:56.030> though<00:02:56.120> it's<00:02:56.299> full<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:58.370> know

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
join even though it's full and you know

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.670 
join even though it's full and you know
that's<00:02:58.670> terrible<00:02:59.000> right<00:02:59.209> but<00:02:59.630> actually<00:03:00.200> you

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
that's terrible right but actually you

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.220 
that's terrible right but actually you
can<00:03:00.830> fix<00:03:01.069> this<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:02.000> your<00:03:02.180> configuration<00:03:02.390> file

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
can fix this in your configuration file

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.530 
can fix this in your configuration file
for<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:03.920> mod<00:03:04.130> you're<00:03:04.850> gonna<00:03:04.940> see<00:03:05.239> something

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
for this mod you're gonna see something

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.530 
for this mod you're gonna see something
called<00:03:05.810> join<00:03:06.140> offset<00:03:06.880> now<00:03:07.880> what<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.269> joint

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
called join offset now what the joint

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.170 
called join offset now what the joint
off<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:08.959> is<00:03:09.110> this<00:03:10.040> mod<00:03:10.310> only<00:03:10.610> tries<00:03:11.030> to

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
off that is this mod only tries to

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.440 
off that is this mod only tries to
connect<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.630> server<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:13.239> current<00:03:14.239> amount

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
connect to the server the current amount

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.289 
connect to the server the current amount
of<00:03:14.600> players<00:03:14.810> on<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.500> server<00:03:15.680> is<00:03:16.040> less<00:03:16.730> is<00:03:17.060> less

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
of players on the server is less is less

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.270 
of players on the server is less is less
than<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.750> maximum<00:03:17.930> number<00:03:18.590> of<00:03:18.620> players<00:03:18.920> on

the server plus this joint offset right

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.640 
the server plus this joint offset right
so<00:03:23.120> now<00:03:23.269> for<00:03:23.750> those<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:23.959> you<00:03:24.170> who<00:03:24.350> aren't<00:03:24.500> so

so now for those of you who aren't so
great<00:03:24.769> at<00:03:24.950> math<00:03:25.130> I<00:03:25.310> are<00:03:25.459> saying<00:03:25.670> what<00:03:25.880> does

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
great at math I are saying what does

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.110 
great at math I are saying what does
this<00:03:26.180> mean<00:03:26.420> so<00:03:26.630> then<00:03:27.410> if<00:03:27.709> I<00:03:28.220> set<00:03:28.579> my<00:03:28.609> joint

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
this mean so then if I set my joint

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.500 
this mean so then if I set my joint
offset<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:30.079> negative<00:03:30.440> five<00:03:31.060> this<00:03:32.060> mod<00:03:32.239> work

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
offset to negative five this mod work

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.500 
offset to negative five this mod work
will<00:03:32.930> work<00:03:33.109> fine<00:03:33.530> on<00:03:33.769> mine<00:03:34.190> Z<00:03:34.430> right<00:03:34.730> because

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
will work fine on mine Z right because

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.699 
will work fine on mine Z right because
uh<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:38.030> need<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.359> have<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:39.019> hundred<00:03:39.470> and

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
uh you need to have a hundred and

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.949 
uh you need to have a hundred and
forty-four<00:03:40.160> players<00:03:40.489> on<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.000> server<00:03:41.209> or<00:03:41.660> less

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
forty-four players on the server or less

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.130 
forty-four players on the server or less
to<00:03:42.200> actually<00:03:42.560> be<00:03:42.680> able<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:42.950> join<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:44.140> 150

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
to actually be able to join and 150

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.949 
to actually be able to join and 150
minus<00:03:46.070> five<00:03:46.370> is<00:03:46.900> 145<00:03:47.900> so<00:03:48.640> and<00:03:49.640> 144<00:03:50.630> is<00:03:50.780> less

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
minus five is 145 so and 144 is less

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.130 
minus five is 145 so and 144 is less
than<00:03:51.140> 145<00:03:51.890> so<00:03:52.790> then<00:03:53.030> it'll<00:03:53.540> work<00:03:53.720> just<00:03:53.930> fine

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
than 145 so then it'll work just fine

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.289 
than 145 so then it'll work just fine
and<00:03:55.040> I'm<00:03:55.670> going<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:55.850> show<00:03:55.940> that<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:56.239> just

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
and I'm going to show that to you just

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:56.949 
and I'm going to show that to you just
now

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
now

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.530 
now
after<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:57.650> go<00:03:57.829> and<00:03:57.980> change<00:03:58.190> my<00:03:58.760> joint<00:03:59.000> offset<00:03:59.390> in

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
after I go and change my joint offset in

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.390 
after I go and change my joint offset in
the<00:03:59.630> configuration<00:04:00.049> file<00:04:00.410> I'll<00:04:00.980> be<00:04:01.069> back<00:04:01.220> in<00:04:01.250> a

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
the configuration file I'll be back in a

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.750 
the configuration file I'll be back in a
sec<00:04:01.609> all<00:04:02.450> right<00:04:02.510> I'm<00:04:02.870> back<00:04:03.079> I've<00:04:03.350> changed<00:04:03.920> my

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
sec all right I'm back I've changed my

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.930 
sec all right I'm back I've changed my
joint<00:04:05.030> offset<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.660> negative<00:04:05.989> five<00:04:06.820> for<00:04:07.820> those

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
joint offset to negative five for those

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.030 
joint offset to negative five for those
of<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.180> that<00:04:08.299> didn't<00:04:08.600> catch<00:04:08.840> why<00:04:09.560> off<00:04:09.859> the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
of you that didn't catch why off the

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.600 
of you that didn't catch why off the
chains<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.400> negative<00:04:10.669> five<00:04:10.850> is

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
chains to negative five is

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.600 
chains to negative five is
because<00:04:11.850> there<00:04:12.090> are<00:04:12.210> five<00:04:12.480> fake<00:04:13.290> slots<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:14.460> we

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
because there are five fake slots so we

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.030 
because there are five fake slots so we
have<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.880> counteract<00:04:15.570> that<00:04:15.690> so<00:04:16.170> instead<00:04:16.980> of

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
have to counteract that so instead of

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.520 
have to counteract that so instead of
five<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.579> becomes<00:04:17.880> negative<00:04:18.359> five<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.930> that's

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
five it becomes negative five and that's

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.940 
five it becomes negative five and that's
it

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
it

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.640 
it
so<00:04:20.760> I'm<00:04:21.120> gonna<00:04:21.239> try<00:04:21.540> I'm<00:04:21.840> gonna<00:04:21.989> try<00:04:22.079> to<00:04:22.320> join

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
so I'm gonna try I'm gonna try to join

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.330 
so I'm gonna try I'm gonna try to join
and<00:04:22.970> then<00:04:23.970> I<00:04:24.900> was<00:04:25.500> kicked<00:04:25.710> because<00:04:25.830> it's<00:04:26.100> full

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
and then I was kicked because it's full

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.490 
and then I was kicked because it's full
so<00:04:27.330> now<00:04:27.450> you're<00:04:27.660> just<00:04:27.690> gonna<00:04:27.840> want<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.200> stay<00:04:28.380> at

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
so now you're just gonna want to stay at

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.560 
so now you're just gonna want to stay at
the<00:04:28.590> screen<00:04:28.890> for<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:29.760> couple<00:04:30.120> of<00:04:30.150> seconds

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
the screen for a couple of seconds

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.050 
the screen for a couple of seconds
because<00:04:31.170> this<00:04:31.380> server<00:04:31.650> they've<00:04:32.610> made<00:04:32.880> it<00:04:33.030> so

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
because this server they've made it so

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.110 
because this server they've made it so
that<00:04:33.240> if<00:04:33.510> you<00:04:33.540> try<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.840> join<00:04:34.370> too<00:04:35.370> quickly<00:04:35.640> or

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
that if you try to join too quickly or

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.770 
that if you try to join too quickly or
it'll<00:04:37.050> mess<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:37.680> up<00:04:37.770> so<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:39.060> have<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.360> actually

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
it'll mess it up so you have to actually

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.290 
it'll mess it up so you have to actually
wait<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.110> little<00:04:40.380> bit<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:41.340> my<00:04:41.520> next<00:04:41.850> version

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
wait a little bit and my next version

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.830 
wait a little bit and my next version
I'm<00:04:42.630> gonna<00:04:43.200> add<00:04:44.100> two<00:04:44.460> things<00:04:44.760> I'm<00:04:45.390> gonna<00:04:45.600> add<00:04:45.810> a

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
I'm gonna add two things I'm gonna add a

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.610 
I'm gonna add two things I'm gonna add a
way<00:04:46.050> so<00:04:46.830> that<00:04:47.480> this<00:04:48.480> mod<00:04:48.690> will<00:04:48.960> recognize<00:04:49.410> that

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
way so that this mod will recognize that

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.520 
way so that this mod will recognize that
and<00:04:49.890> then<00:04:50.460> it<00:04:50.669> will<00:04:50.760> just<00:04:50.790> wait<00:04:51.150> by<00:04:51.360> itself<00:04:51.720> you

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
and then it will just wait by itself you

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.470 
and then it will just wait by itself you
won't<00:04:52.710> have<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:52.950> change<00:04:53.940> your<00:04:54.150> delay<00:04:54.360> or

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
won't have to change your delay or

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.820 
won't have to change your delay or
anything<00:04:54.810> it'll<00:04:54.990> just<00:04:55.169> wait<00:04:55.320> for<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.560> it'll

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
anything it'll just wait for it it'll

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.220 
anything it'll just wait for it it'll
know<00:04:55.950> what<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:56.220> do<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.820> then<00:04:57.210> I'm<00:04:57.330> also<00:04:57.510> gonna

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
know what to do and then I'm also gonna

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.980 
know what to do and then I'm also gonna
add<00:04:58.320> a<00:04:58.830> way<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.400> do<00:04:59.580> configuration<00:05:00.300> by<00:05:00.540> servers

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
add a way to do configuration by servers

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.100 
add a way to do configuration by servers
so<00:05:01.919> you<00:05:01.980> won't<00:05:02.190> have<00:05:02.280> to<00:05:02.340> edit<00:05:02.640> that<00:05:02.790> file<00:05:03.120> you

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
so you won't have to edit that file you

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.920 
so you won't have to edit that file you
can<00:05:04.260> edit<00:05:04.440> it<00:05:04.590> in<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:05.310> GUI<00:05:05.669> itself<00:05:06.090> in<00:05:06.660> game

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
can edit it in the GUI itself in game

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.740 
can edit it in the GUI itself in game
and<00:05:07.200> that'll<00:05:08.100> be<00:05:08.220> much<00:05:08.340> easier<00:05:08.400> and<00:05:08.970> then<00:05:09.600> it

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
and that'll be much easier and then it

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.750 
and that'll be much easier and then it
will<00:05:09.870> actually<00:05:10.200> support<00:05:10.530> doing<00:05:11.040> this<00:05:11.130> for

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
will actually support doing this for

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.360 
will actually support doing this for
multiple<00:05:12.090> servers<00:05:12.500> without<00:05:13.500> having<00:05:14.190> to<00:05:14.280> go

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
multiple servers without having to go

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.100 
multiple servers without having to go
and<00:05:14.430> edit<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:14.760> file<00:05:14.970> so<00:05:15.630> now<00:05:15.720> I'm<00:05:15.810> gonna<00:05:15.900> click

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
and edit the file so now I'm gonna click

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.690 
and edit the file so now I'm gonna click
Auto<00:05:16.320> join<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.919> wait<00:05:17.850> and<00:05:19.250> then<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:20.340> saw<00:05:20.520> it<00:05:20.640> I

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
Auto join and wait and then you saw it I

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.290 
Auto join and wait and then you saw it I
just<00:05:20.760> got<00:05:21.030> in<00:05:21.210> with<00:05:21.810> Auto<00:05:22.260> Joey<00:05:22.500> no<00:05:22.740> problem

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
just got in with Auto Joey no problem

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.640 
just got in with Auto Joey no problem
like<00:05:24.300> I<00:05:24.419> said<00:05:24.630> if<00:05:24.750> you're<00:05:24.900> having<00:05:25.140> problems

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
like I said if you're having problems

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.020 
like I said if you're having problems
doing<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:26.010> though<00:05:26.510> just<00:05:27.919> disconnect<00:05:29.000> wait<00:05:30.000> a

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.409 
doing it though just disconnect wait a
couple<00:05:30.240> of<00:05:30.419> seconds<00:05:31.880> then<00:05:32.880> try<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.180> connect

couple of seconds then try to connect

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.590 
couple of seconds then try to connect
again<00:05:33.740> it<00:05:34.740> most<00:05:34.919> likely<00:05:35.190> it's<00:05:35.280> gonna<00:05:35.340> fail<00:05:35.729> so

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
again it most likely it's gonna fail so

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.030 
again it most likely it's gonna fail so
then<00:05:36.720> waited<00:05:37.050> that<00:05:37.169> disconnected<00:05:37.800> screen<00:05:38.010> a

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.770 
then waited that disconnected screen a
couple<00:05:38.160> of<00:05:38.340> seconds<00:05:38.669> and<00:05:38.880> then<00:05:38.970> click<00:05:39.600> Auto
