00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.910 
that are great for garden raised garden
beds<00:02:41.459> we<00:02:42.459> also<00:02:42.700> have<00:02:43.530> finials<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.740> come<00:02:44.890> off

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
beds we also have finials that come off

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.550 
beds we also have finials that come off
of<00:02:45.069> fences<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:46.030> are<00:02:46.420> great<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.840> be<00:02:46.959> used<00:02:47.230> for

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
of fences that are great to be used for

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.890 
of fences that are great to be used for
host<00:02:47.860> stops<00:02:48.190> in<00:02:48.489> your<00:02:48.610> gardens<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.360> think<00:02:49.840> that

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
host stops in your gardens I think that

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.350 
host stops in your gardens I think that
everybody<00:02:50.410> realizes<00:02:51.160> that<00:02:51.370> recycling<00:02:52.150> is

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
everybody realizes that recycling is

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.690 
everybody realizes that recycling is
really<00:02:52.660> important<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:53.800> before<00:02:53.980> recycling

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
really important but before recycling

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.910 
really important but before recycling
it's<00:02:55.510> really<00:02:55.930> great<00:02:56.140> if<00:02:56.410> people<00:02:56.770> could

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
it's really great if people could

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.400 
it's really great if people could
consider<00:02:57.400> reuse<00:02:58.230> especially<00:02:59.230> before

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
consider reuse especially before

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.250 
consider reuse especially before
throwing<00:03:00.130> things<00:03:00.580> away<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.300> that's<00:03:01.900> kind<00:03:02.200> of

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
throwing things away and that's kind of

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.110 
throwing things away and that's kind of
where<00:03:02.470> eco<00:03:02.890> stores<00:03:03.190> Nebraska<00:03:03.880> comes<00:03:04.120> in<00:03:04.420> we

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
where eco stores Nebraska comes in we

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.140 
where eco stores Nebraska comes in we
accept<00:03:07.230> used<00:03:08.230> good<00:03:09.100> quality<00:03:09.790> building

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
accept used good quality building

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.180 
accept used good quality building
materials<00:03:10.600> and<00:03:10.750> supplies<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.500> we<00:03:11.620> put<00:03:12.010> them

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
materials and supplies and we put them

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.699 
materials and supplies and we put them
back<00:03:12.370> into<00:03:12.700> circulation<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.350> they<00:03:14.500> can

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
back into circulation so that they can

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.320 
back into circulation so that they can
be<00:03:14.739> used<00:03:15.100> again<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.730> end<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:16.030> their<00:03:16.090> life

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
be used again to the end of their life

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.930 
be used again to the end of their life
cycle<00:03:16.900> so<00:03:17.380> reusing<00:03:18.010> materials<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:18.700> really

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
cycle so reusing materials is really

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.449 
cycle so reusing materials is really
important<00:03:19.450> because<00:03:19.630> we<00:03:19.989> live<00:03:20.140> on<00:03:20.319> a<00:03:20.350> planet

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
important because we live on a planet

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.280 
important because we live on a planet
with<00:03:21.459> limited<00:03:21.910> resources<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.930> we<00:03:23.050> need<00:03:23.260> to

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
with limited resources and we need to

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.900 
with limited resources and we need to
use<00:03:23.739> our<00:03:24.069> existing<00:03:24.840> resources<00:03:25.840> wisely<00:03:26.910> and

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
use our existing resources wisely and

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.670 
use our existing resources wisely and
there's<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.209> lot<00:03:28.420> of<00:03:28.450> great<00:03:28.780> benefits<00:03:29.319> to<00:03:29.500> doing

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
there's a lot of great benefits to doing

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.090 
there's a lot of great benefits to doing
that<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.700> using<00:03:31.120> reused<00:03:31.600> materials<00:03:31.890> one<00:03:32.890> is

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
that to using reused materials one is

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.759 
that to using reused materials one is
you<00:03:33.280> can<00:03:33.430> save<00:03:33.670> money<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.840> benefits<00:03:35.350> to<00:03:35.560> using

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
you can save money the benefits to using

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.620 
you can save money the benefits to using
our<00:03:36.310> materials<00:03:36.940> are<00:03:37.390> one<00:03:38.320> you<00:03:38.829> can<00:03:39.010> save<00:03:39.280> money

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
our materials are one you can save money

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.470 
our materials are one you can save money
too<00:03:40.709> many<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:41.890> our<00:03:42.040> materials<00:03:42.610> are<00:03:42.820> beautiful

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
too many of our materials are beautiful

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.380 
too many of our materials are beautiful
they<00:03:44.079> have<00:03:44.350> added<00:03:45.070> character<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:45.940> they're

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
they have added character and they're

places especially in new stores many are

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.300 
places especially in new stores many are
higher<00:03:54.910> quality<00:03:55.630> than<00:03:55.660> new<00:03:56.350> products<00:03:56.890> and

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
higher quality than new products and

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.729 
higher quality than new products and
you're<00:03:58.239> keeping<00:03:58.420> good<00:03:58.840> materials<00:03:59.440> out<00:03:59.620> of<00:03:59.680> the

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
you'll save the energy materials and

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.949 
you'll save the energy materials and
pollution<00:04:06.040> included<00:04:06.579> in<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.150> manufacture<00:04:07.930> of
