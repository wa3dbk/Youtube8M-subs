00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.579 
idea I had also a lot of you guys did
like<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.489> modded<00:01:02.789> color<00:01:03.059> idea<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.019> every<00:01:04.439> now

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
like the modded color idea so every now

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.289 
like the modded color idea so every now
and<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.129> know<00:01:05.220> every<00:01:05.460> other<00:01:05.580> week<00:01:06.150> we

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
and then you know every other week we

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.789 
and then you know every other week we
might<00:01:06.479> do<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> modded<00:01:07.080> color<00:01:07.290> because

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
might do a modded color because

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.530 
might do a modded color because
obviously<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.400> options<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:08.939> endless<00:01:09.060> with

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
obviously the options are endless with

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.780 
obviously the options are endless with
those<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> problem<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.460> guys<00:01:11.580> need

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
those but the problem is you guys need

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.280 
those but the problem is you guys need
to<00:01:11.820> tell<00:01:12.030> me<00:01:12.090> some<00:01:12.360> body<00:01:12.540> colors<00:01:12.869> or<00:01:13.080> like

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
to tell me some body colors or like

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.010 
to tell me some body colors or like
leave<00:01:13.560> me<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:14.280> crew<00:01:14.790> link<00:01:15.060> or<00:01:15.270> something<00:01:15.509> -<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
leave me a crew link or something - a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.859 
leave me a crew link or something - a
modded<00:01:16.500> colored<00:01:17.100> crew<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.420> see<00:01:18.659> what

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
modded colored crew so I can see what

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.149 
modded colored crew so I can see what
that<00:01:18.900> modded<00:01:19.380> color<00:01:19.590> looks<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.070> it

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that modded color looks like because it

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.820 
that modded color looks like because it
does<00:01:20.250> take<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> while<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:21.110> test<00:01:22.110> out<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.500> modded

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
does take a while to test out the modded

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.560 
does take a while to test out the modded
colors<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.790> crew<00:01:23.970> colors<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.509> you

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
colors or the crew colors because you

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.090

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
emerald blue now this one is a metallic

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.120 
emerald blue now this one is a metallic
galaxy<00:01:54.119> blue<00:01:54.420> mixed<00:01:55.320> with<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> bright<00:01:55.920> green

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
galaxy blue mixed with a bright green

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.520 
galaxy blue mixed with a bright green
pearlescent<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.930> one<00:01:57.930> thing<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.259> will<00:01:58.500> say

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
pearlescent and one thing I will say

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.679 
pearlescent and one thing I will say
both<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.159> these<00:01:59.219> colors<00:01:59.460> do<00:01:59.909> have<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.390> white

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
both of these colors do have a white

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.440 
both of these colors do have a white
secondary<00:02:01.350> which<00:02:02.219> personally<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.850> think<00:02:02.969> goes

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
secondary which personally I think goes

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.910 
secondary which personally I think goes
well<00:02:03.659> with<00:02:03.780> both<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.200> colors<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.680> show

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
well with both of the colors that I show

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.639 
well with both of the colors that I show
but<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:06.000> one<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.360> pretty<00:02:06.600> sweet<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.990> really<00:02:07.560> do

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
the sports grill that's why I decided to

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.310 
the sports grill that's why I decided to
choose<00:05:04.100> it<00:05:04.280> hood<00:05:05.060> like<00:05:05.870> there's<00:05:06.080> all<00:05:06.200> these

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
other ones but let's be honest the

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.120 
other ones but let's be honest the
gasser<00:05:08.600> hood<00:05:08.810> is<00:05:08.930> absolutely<00:05:09.890> awesome

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
gasser hood is absolutely awesome

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.220

looking these other ones we can get on
any<00:05:12.350> other<00:05:12.560> car<00:05:12.740> but<00:05:12.890> I<00:05:12.920> don't<00:05:13.010> think<00:05:13.220> the

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
any other car but I don't think the

of that stuff in the comment section -

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.190 
of that stuff in the comment section -
also<00:07:22.790> like<00:07:23.060> I<00:07:23.300> mentioned<00:07:23.660> at<00:07:23.720> the<00:07:23.750> beginning<00:07:23.870> I

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.200 
also like I mentioned at the beginning I

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.860 
also like I mentioned at the beginning I
did<00:07:24.470> livestream<00:07:25.160> this<00:07:25.310> last<00:07:25.520> night<00:07:25.700> me<00:07:26.510> trying

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:26.870 
did livestream this last night me trying

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:27.970 
did livestream this last night me trying
to<00:07:26.960> go<00:07:27.050> through<00:07:27.230> all<00:07:27.290> the<00:07:27.410> colors<00:07:27.680> and<00:07:27.800> stuff

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:27.980 
to go through all the colors and stuff

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.770 
to go through all the colors and stuff
so<00:07:28.280> I'll<00:07:28.730> probably<00:07:28.910> do<00:07:29.150> that<00:07:29.240> and<00:07:29.540> make<00:07:29.690> it

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780 
so I'll probably do that and make it

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.570 
so I'll probably do that and make it
look<00:07:29.870> like<00:07:29.960> a<00:07:30.020> weekly<00:07:30.380> thing<00:07:30.410> every<00:07:30.950> Monday<00:07:31.370> so

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.580 
look like a weekly thing every Monday so

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.280 
look like a weekly thing every Monday so
