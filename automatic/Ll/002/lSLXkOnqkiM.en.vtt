00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.710
 the a team it was i would be right after this the consumer will be with us 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.940
 performance vote I would like you to put something on the committee but where we 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.539
 have talked about 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.539
 well we have the natural shift to different commission mesh 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:18.960
 anyway have been here 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.679
 the six local committee in March 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.710
 whether your business as certainly two I think is fdp striving ship 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.889
 If you were still looking at the machine we work with different boards that 

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:30.390
 can 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.250
 be manually operated that can be computer controlled 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.770
 I must say we have our previous series 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.280
 who says a mark 6 percent 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.410
 computer controlled 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.390
 a 40 percent of customers are served messi in advance 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.200
 with the new model that we see here, baghdatis are a few serious 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.470
 and then but it's more the cable 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.310
 there is no masts but this model 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.040
 nevertheless choose computers that will execute but won 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.910
 it has many more benefits 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.020
 Then another idea if you just have some 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.010
 options you have the text on it 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.340
 for the customers who say I want to be ann ann bie the work is not that 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.280
 only problem 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.190
 there is also a council working group in that position 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.940
 the established programs 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.799
 Abarth that certainly succeeds without reporting is that there may be something for the past 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.070
 with some fixed 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.160
 programs 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.150
 the case is placed over there for a number of programs from this one 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.180
 machine went to develop 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.300
 how can you be as customer-friendly as possible and how user-friendly 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.260
 possible 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.970
 at the first charge, that should perhaps be a dial that 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.740
 you often get sick on other devices 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.350
 We very consciously did not opt ​​for a completely flat version 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.670
 van rompuy very easy to clean 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.329
 emma has opted for 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:38.899
 beijing china looks a bit like one 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.200
 create content 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.520
 that couple an attractive question 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.660
 it is very easy to operate intuitively 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.380
 I never exclude 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.780
 work in it 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.920
 I have never had training from the Rabo Bank or land so many Postbank from 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.600
 We are going to explain how a ATM machine employee 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.530
 this pressed the door 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.060
 a moment later button and you get very points 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.270
 choose yourself the choice that you think April would make the most sense 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.790
 the beautiful game as his brother bob a side 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.590
 npm afterwards gave birth at home weeks after it isn't the quality anyway 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.460
 he thought he should do and I sell snakes one two and three 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.989
 have to buy time 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.000
 after four years in fact he still asks afterwards you want the arrogance a 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:23.549
 program in the pipeline as an extra program or have fallen it was the one-off 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:24.309
 book profit 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.529
 So when you think about the program we have already after two minutes 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.009
 long leg but you have to do is confirmed 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:31.719
 so that machine thinks 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.239
 if only a little with it 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.239
 it was a very big very big advantage 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.369
 and what's very important is the machine 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:41.359
 established programs to az 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.099
 I also have a lot of value in two controversial ones 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.089
 so just before the machinery took place ask you 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:49.629
 to come and scream with your staff 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:50.769
 and under the guidance of 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:51.869
 6 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:54.909
 I get your piece of training on this mission 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.729
 this is the map we are talking about the architect 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.249
 that proponent to take over both club boards 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.089
 save our lady or a merger he was praised 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:04.929
 what is that in a whole mouth full 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:07.760
 With this you can start selling apple stock foundation programs 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.699
 in less than a second 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:14.579
 but also vice versa with two steams as if you were becoming western 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:15.599
 several things 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.199
 He had the press be over 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:20.280
 zero comma four seconds he was the case 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.480
 sometimes also from sales 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.779
 people between the others 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:26.639
 That is an important point where you count 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.109
 extension system standard, the machine has a semi-automatic separation 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.709
 system 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:32.829
 well over 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.439
 so where the detergent event 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.119
 and the government itself 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:39.469
 if you know that myself, I don't want to do that but had to be fully automatic 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.689
 the anp have the option of playing the current system 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.509
 nothing at all on the other side 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:46.860
 remains unchanged 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.579
 the support by a film 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.569
 exceeded the demand he is also a house twice a year at the business 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.000
 because spring and autumn would like to invite bojan 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.889
 with your wishes 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.309
 to get ideas 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:01.990
 pray that his new products are new product developments 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.390
 application of the switch 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.779
 new programs can also take the best 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.019
 on that card 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.479
 home and whether it is an ideal to put someone first 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:14.229
 further names as popular thinking with the customer is the programs 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:15.459
 secured 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.409
 8 nobody can there there are many programs leaders at the current pace 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.930
 by 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.249
 You are in income 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:25.659
 Also important to report is the open keeps track of how often a business is 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.860
 job break 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.069
 with the big advantage 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.090
 thanks professional I want to control the sector but you can tell 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.949
 look up every week and those that need to be stowed every day are cleaned and the plates 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:37.919
 be deployed 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.740
 delicious that also keep track of insight 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.720
 how that is possible how often it happens
