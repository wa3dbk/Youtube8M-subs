00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello to you channel territory 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.190
 men and today I will show you the second 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.700
 part of the video restart aquarium resun dm 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:19.350
 800 and so in the first part we pulled out 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:27.390
 the plant from the previous aquarium was washed 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:30.750
 primer fully aquarium panel laid 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.050
 top dressing nutrient covered with earth 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.829
 set the scenery as you see the view 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:42.420
 stones snag there but it will put 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.969
 a little later in the aquarium now in 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.980
 tubules that connected 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.940
 our bottom which was previously removed 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.230
 and pumps 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.820
 I drilled holes like this 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.829
 need to see a close up here 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.680
 drilled a hole for water intake 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.130
 Now water will be taken 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.760
 directly from the aquarium itself 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.420
 they are through the bottom filter now this 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.509
 we put the straw in place 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.350
 a little more water and turn on the pump 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:27.659
 it works while our water is more or less 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:31.920
 is transparent Well passed 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:37.200
 some two weeks and our aquarium here 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:40.979
 so it looks, in principle, plants are still all 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:46.020
 they are planted because they still need 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:50.970
 buy put so far 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.930
 additional filter then I will remove it or 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.549
 I will change for a little less because 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.380
 built-in does little with this 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.799
 I'll take a closer look at what's here 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.799
 And How 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:12.640
 from the left block we have this grass 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.640
 by the way grows well 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:27.560
 pebbles personally in and boiled 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.200
 snag that showed you my 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:37.459
 previous videos have done this 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:41.720
 the little dart now could begin 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:47.569
 cling to it in the background yet 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:55.700
 few plants but it will be in the process 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:59.319
 we have all the green some plants 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.360
 slightly covered with kelp 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.750
 but now I'm specifically starting with them 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.750
 fight 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.410
 here 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.080
 Well, that's basically all nutritious 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.650
 top dressing already starting to give their 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:26.210
 results and plants began to grow 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.800
 much faster and better than it was on it 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.950
 everything 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.320
 the second part of the video was finished with you 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:38.170
