00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
we have a little bit weak I mean it kind

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.640 
we have a little bit weak I mean it kind
of<00:01:17.300> narrows<00:01:17.630> down<00:01:17.660> the<00:01:17.870> middle<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.320> only<00:01:18.500> be

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
of narrows down the middle to only be

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.790

one<00:01:18.830> foot<00:01:19.190> solid<00:01:19.850> way<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.030> lameness<00:01:20.560> so<00:01:21.560> we

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
one foot solid way to lameness so we

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.190 
one foot solid way to lameness so we
kind<00:01:22.010> of<00:01:22.160> we<00:01:23.000> have<00:01:23.120> to<00:01:23.300> design<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.810> around<00:01:24.050> that

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
kind of we have to design it around that
