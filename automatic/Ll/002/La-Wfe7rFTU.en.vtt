elephants we have two or three of the
elephants<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.130> are<00:00:14.250> very<00:00:14.370> comfortable

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639

Gilly and in ponga seem to be the ones

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.870 
Gilly and in ponga seem to be the ones
that<00:00:19.140> are<00:00:19.230> checking<00:00:19.619> out<00:00:19.740> all<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.310> perimeter

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
that are checking out all the perimeter

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.880 
that are checking out all the perimeter
areas<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.779> group<00:00:21.990> as<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> whole<00:00:22.320> you'll

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
areas but the group as a whole you'll

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.009 
areas but the group as a whole you'll
see<00:00:23.100> traveling<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:24.060> sections<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.539> sections

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
see traveling the sections the sections

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.589 
see traveling the sections the sections
together<00:00:25.199> yeah<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.430> all<00:00:26.580> new<00:00:26.760> smells<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
together yeah this is all new smells and

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.839 
together yeah this is all new smells and
we<00:00:28.560> had<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> lot<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.099> construction<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.670> when

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
we had a lot of construction here when

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.790 
we had a lot of construction here when
we<00:00:29.939> put<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.330> hydraulic<00:00:31.230> gates<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.560> allow

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
we put in the hydraulic gates to allow

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.500 
we put in the hydraulic gates to allow
this<00:00:31.949> yard<00:00:32.279> connection<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.270> there's<00:00:33.450> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
this yard connection and so there's a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.819 
this yard connection and so there's a
lot<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.899> fresh<00:00:34.110> dirt<00:00:34.380> that's<00:00:34.559> out<00:00:34.710> there

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
lot of this fresh dirt that's out there

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:35.990 
lot of this fresh dirt that's out there
there's<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> big<00:00:35.219> pile<00:00:35.489> right<00:00:35.790> out<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
there's a big pile right out in the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.060 
there's a big pile right out in the
middle<00:00:36.270> there<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.570> all<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.380> little<00:00:37.890> kids

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
middle there and all the little kids

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.650 
middle there and all the little kids
were<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.340> there<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.820> having<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> good<00:00:39.450> time

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
were in there just having a good time

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.350 
were in there just having a good time
diving<00:00:39.960> into<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.670> when<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:41.790> clean<00:00:42.030> our<00:00:42.180> main

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
diving into it when we clean our main

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.869 
diving into it when we clean our main
yard<00:00:42.600> we<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.890> obviously<00:00:43.980> get<00:00:44.610> them<00:00:44.730> off

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
yard we have to obviously get them off

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.420 
yard we have to obviously get them off
that<00:00:45.059> exhibit<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:46.770> yards<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.280> had

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
that exhibit and the yards that we had

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
that exhibit and the yards that we had
existing<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.360> stalls<00:00:48.719> we're<00:00:49.680> starting

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
existing and the stalls we're starting

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.430 
existing and the stalls we're starting
to<00:00:50.010> get<00:00:50.070> cramped<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.550> far<00:00:50.700> as<00:00:50.789> space<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.870> so

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
to get cramped as far as space and so

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.650 
to get cramped as far as space and so
having<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.890> available<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.210> move<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
having this available we can move the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.029 
having this available we can move the
elephants<00:00:55.050> completely<00:00:55.469> over<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> place

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
elephants completely over to a place

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.799 
elephants completely over to a place
where<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.850> don't<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.210> even<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.420> about

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
where we don't have to even think about

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.020 
where we don't have to even think about
they're<00:00:57.960> gonna<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.260> fun<00:00:58.530> still<00:00:59.250> socializing

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
they're gonna have fun still socializing

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.340 
they're gonna have fun still socializing
we're<00:01:00.180> not<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> split<00:01:00.629> them<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:00.899> they<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.230> all

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
we're not to split them up they have all

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.990 
we're not to split them up they have all
this<00:01:01.500> room<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.949> move<00:01:02.100> while<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.430> clean<00:01:02.850> that

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
this room to move while we clean that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.240 
this room to move while we clean that
yard<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:04.199> now<00:01:04.439> we've<00:01:04.830> got<00:01:04.860> all<00:01:05.100> these

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
yard and but now we've got all these

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.219 
yard and but now we've got all these
areas<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.700> we<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.060> move<00:01:06.540> all<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.900> our

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
areas that we can move all of our

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.740 
areas that we can move all of our
elephants<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.159> at<00:01:08.850> any<00:01:09.060> point<00:01:09.390> split

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
elephants so we can at any point split

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.840 
elephants so we can at any point split
the<00:01:09.900> herd<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.229> train<00:01:11.070> them<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.580> side

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
the herd up train them on this side

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.429 
the herd up train them on this side
train<00:01:12.270> them<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.630> side<00:01:12.869> train<00:01:13.170> them<00:01:13.290> both

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
train them on this side train them both

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.230 
train them on this side train them both
at<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> same<00:01:13.860> time<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.670> all<00:01:14.790> these

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
at the same time we have all these

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.730 
at the same time we have all these
different<00:01:15.450> stations<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.409> call<00:01:16.590> them

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
different stations that we can call them

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.980 
different stations that we can call them
over<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.670> existing<00:01:18.210> yard<00:01:18.390> had<00:01:18.750> no

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
over to the existing yard had no

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.050 
over to the existing yard had no
connection<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.130> original<00:01:20.549> tram<00:01:20.820> used

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
connection in the the original tram used

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.749 
connection in the the original tram used
to<00:01:21.119> go<00:01:21.240> through<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.630> area<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.950> they<00:01:23.369> put

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
to go through that area and so they put

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.820 
to go through that area and so they put
in<00:01:23.880> these<00:01:23.970> gigantic<00:01:24.420> giant<00:01:24.810> hydraulic<00:01:25.439> gates

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
in these gigantic giant hydraulic gates

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.960 
in these gigantic giant hydraulic gates
and<00:01:26.150> they're<00:01:27.150> big<00:01:27.659> enough<00:01:27.689> 18<00:01:28.500> feet<00:01:28.650> across

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
and they're big enough 18 feet across

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.640 
and they're big enough 18 feet across
that<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.630> saw<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> elephants<00:01:31.439> felt

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
that as you saw the elephants felt

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.590 
that as you saw the elephants felt
comfortable<00:01:32.070> coming<00:01:32.970> through<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> rather

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
comfortable coming through a rather

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.149 
comfortable coming through a rather
large<00:01:33.930> space<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.439> was<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:34.680> smart<00:01:35.040> in

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
large space so it was really smart in

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.830 
large space so it was really smart in
the<00:01:35.250> planning<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.729> those<00:01:35.880> gates<00:01:36.150> they<00:01:36.689> have

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the planning of those gates they have

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.060 
the planning of those gates they have
them<00:01:37.020> wide<00:01:37.200> enough<00:01:37.470> where<00:01:37.740> they<00:01:37.860> don't<00:01:37.950> feel

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
them wide enough where they don't feel

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.410 
them wide enough where they don't feel
like<00:01:38.340> they're<00:01:38.460> coming<00:01:38.579> through<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> cramped

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
like they're coming through a cramped

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.050 
like they're coming through a cramped
channel<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.159> what<00:01:41.310> we're<00:01:41.460> seeing<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.820> here

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
channel and so what we're seeing in here

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.179 
channel and so what we're seeing in here
is<00:01:42.119> they're<00:01:42.990> exploring<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.799> they<00:01:43.920> are<00:01:44.040> all

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
is they're exploring but they are all

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.039 
is they're exploring but they are all
keeping<00:01:44.490> close<00:01:44.880> tabs<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.509> each<00:01:45.630> other<00:01:45.810> because

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
keeping close tabs on each other because

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.389 
keeping close tabs on each other because
that's<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.259> big<00:01:46.380> safety<00:01:46.770> thing<00:01:46.979> they<00:01:47.100> got<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> lot

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
that's a big safety thing they got a lot

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.950 
that's a big safety thing they got a lot
of<00:01:47.430> calves<00:01:47.700> around<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:48.540> they<00:01:48.659> think

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
of calves around so if they think

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.420 
of calves around so if they think
there's<00:01:49.140> anything<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.530> could<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.009> danger

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
there's anything that could be a danger

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.550 
there's anything that could be a danger
they<00:01:50.610> all<00:01:50.759> want<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.210> present<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:52.200> has<00:01:52.530> a
