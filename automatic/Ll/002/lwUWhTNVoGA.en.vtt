00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
this was a really quick build for me I

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.160 
this was a really quick build for me I
didn't<00:00:11.429> really<00:00:11.610> do<00:00:11.700> much<00:00:11.820> with<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.090> just<00:00:12.990> put<00:00:13.139> a

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
didn't really do much with it just put a

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.210 
didn't really do much with it just put a
couple<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.620> dry<00:00:13.799> decals<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:16.220> top

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
couple of the dry decals on and top

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.490 
couple of the dry decals on and top
coated<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:17.880> was<00:00:17.970> about<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.539> I

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
coated it and that was about it and I

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.769 
coated it and that was about it and I
was<00:00:19.619> really<00:00:19.859> happy<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.189> do<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:21.060> last<00:00:21.330> model

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
was really happy to do so the last model

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.170 
was really happy to do so the last model
I<00:00:21.810> made<00:00:22.020> was<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.410> custom<00:00:22.710> avalanche<00:00:23.490> astri

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
I made was the custom avalanche astri

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.570 
I made was the custom avalanche astri
f-type<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:25.350> took<00:00:25.470> forever<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.460> was

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
f-type and that took forever so it was

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.630 
f-type and that took forever so it was
nice<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.119> really<00:00:27.689> simple<00:00:28.250> clean<00:00:29.250> build

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
nice to have a really simple clean build

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.630 
nice to have a really simple clean build
and<00:00:30.140> it<00:00:31.140> was<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> really<00:00:31.560> fun<00:00:31.890> build<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.610> I

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
and it was a really fun build to like I

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.310 
and it was a really fun build to like I
mean<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.030> really<00:00:33.329> great<00:00:33.690> model<00:00:34.170> it's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
mean it's a really great model it's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.150 
mean it's a really great model it's
based<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.800> course<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.660> little<00:00:36.660> bit<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.100> some<00:00:38.100> of

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
based of course a little bit on some of

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.100 
based of course a little bit on some of
the<00:00:38.219> other<00:00:38.370> eeew<00:00:39.270> figures<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> Shen

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
the other eeew figures like the Shen

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.260 
the other eeew figures like the Shen
long<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.800> death<00:00:40.950> side<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.820> got<00:00:41.969> some

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
long and the death side it's got some

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.990 
long and the death side it's got some
similarities<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> most

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
similarities with that but for the most

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.139 
similarities with that but for the most
part<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.660> really<00:00:46.320> its<00:00:46.469> own<00:00:46.680> model<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:51.030> was

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
part it's really its own model it was

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.200 
part it's really its own model it was
really<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:52.260> far<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> build<00:00:53.039> goes<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
really as far as the build goes not a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.729 
really as far as the build goes not a
lot<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.510> areas<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.079> were<00:00:55.170> extremely

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
lot of areas that were extremely

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.619 
lot of areas that were extremely
difficult<00:00:56.120> there<00:00:57.120> are<00:00:57.300> some<00:00:57.480> bad<00:00:57.719> nubs<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.260> it

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
difficult there are some bad nubs on it

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.930 
difficult there are some bad nubs on it
specifically<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:01.350> were<00:01:01.500> some<00:01:01.800> down<00:01:02.460> here

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
specifically there were some down here

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.640 
specifically there were some down here
on<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.149> legs<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.750> really<00:01:04.080> showed<00:01:04.320> through

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
on the legs that really showed through

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.679 
on the legs that really showed through
and<00:01:05.010> all<00:01:05.790> along<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> heat<00:01:06.810> rod<00:01:07.020> there<00:01:07.310> um

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
and all along the heat rod there um

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.240 
and all along the heat rod there um
since<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.840> put<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> top<00:01:10.290> coat<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:10.979> so

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
since I put the top coat on it's not so

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.800 
since I put the top coat on it's not so
bad<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.729> that's<00:01:11.909> really<00:01:12.090> worked<00:01:12.360> out<00:01:12.510> well<00:01:12.570> you

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
bad so that's really worked out well you

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.600 
bad so that's really worked out well you
can<00:01:12.930> see<00:01:13.080> some<00:01:13.290> bad<00:01:13.470> nubs<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> legs

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.830 

focus<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.880> that

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
focus in on that

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.450 
focus in on that
if<00:01:19.469> you're<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> paint<00:01:19.950> your<00:01:20.070> models

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
if you're going to paint your models

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.289 
if you're going to paint your models
that's<00:01:20.670> absolutely<00:01:21.329> no<00:01:21.659> problem<00:01:24.770> however<00:01:25.770> I'm

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
that's absolutely no problem however I'm

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.599 
that's absolutely no problem however I'm
proving<00:01:27.299> myself<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.750> absolutely<00:01:28.399> terrible<00:01:29.399> at

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
proving myself be absolutely terrible at

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.319 
proving myself be absolutely terrible at
painting<00:01:29.969> so<00:01:30.439> wasn't<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.469> do<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.009> one

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
painting so wasn't I do it with this one

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.760 
painting so wasn't I do it with this one
it's<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.390> really<00:01:33.630> cool<00:01:34.049> looking<00:01:34.469> gundam<00:01:34.710> um<00:01:35.509> I

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
it's a really cool looking gundam um I

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.949 
it's a really cool looking gundam um I
met<00:01:37.770> picking<00:01:38.219> just<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> design<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.450> think

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
met picking just with the design I think

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.569 
met picking just with the design I think
it's<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.319> little<00:01:40.619> bit<00:01:40.829> too<00:01:41.549> similar<00:01:43.429> that's<00:01:44.429> not

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
it's a little bit too similar that's not

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:51.919 
it's a little bit too similar that's not
right<00:01:44.700> um<00:01:44.939> it's<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:48.350> similar<00:01:49.350> enough<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.929> the

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
right um it's just similar enough to the

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.169 
right um it's just similar enough to the
anime<00:01:52.560> epyon<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.579> definitely<00:01:53.909> brings

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
anime epyon but it definitely brings

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.270 
anime epyon but it definitely brings
like<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.659> little<00:01:55.079> bit<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.259> its<00:01:55.409> own<00:01:55.530> design<00:01:55.890> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
like a little bit of its own design to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.889 
like a little bit of its own design to
the<00:01:56.310> table<00:01:57.739> it<00:01:58.739> doesn't<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.880> me<00:01:59.909> fit<00:02:00.750> in

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
the table it doesn't to me fit in

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.770 
the table it doesn't to me fit in
entirely<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.189> other<00:02:02.369> lee<00:02:02.640> designs<00:02:02.789> like

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
entirely with the other lee designs like

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.109 
entirely with the other lee designs like
the<00:02:04.129> wing<00:02:05.129> zero<00:02:05.429> from<00:02:06.119> endless<00:02:06.539> waltz<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:07.110> um

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
the wing zero from endless waltz but um

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.410 
the wing zero from endless waltz but um
overall<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.329> pretty<00:02:09.420> good<00:02:10.940> now<00:02:11.940> getting<00:02:12.239> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
overall it's pretty good now getting it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.920 
overall it's pretty good now getting it
posed<00:02:12.780> was<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.829> tremendous<00:02:14.670> hassle<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:15.269> for

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
posed was a tremendous hassle and for

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.170 
posed was a tremendous hassle and for
that's<00:02:16.290> just<00:02:16.410> for<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.650> couple<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:16.890> reasons<00:02:17.180> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
that's just for a couple of reasons the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.670 
that's just for a couple of reasons the
site<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.720> oven<00:02:18.989> on<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.110> side<00:02:19.290> skirts<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
site the oven on the side skirts the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.470 
site the oven on the side skirts the
front<00:02:19.920> skirts<00:02:20.160> would<00:02:20.400> like<00:02:20.579> to<00:02:20.700> pop<00:02:20.879> off<00:02:21.120> for

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
front skirts would like to pop off for

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
front skirts would like to pop off for
some<00:02:21.569> reason<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:21.989> getting<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.040> wire<00:02:23.840> out<00:02:24.840> of

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
some reason and getting this wire out of

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.349 
some reason and getting this wire out of
the<00:02:25.560> way<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.859> yet<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.400> know<00:02:26.430> host

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
the way and yet kind of you know host

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.870 
the way and yet kind of you know host
somewhat<00:02:27.840> realistically<00:02:28.350> is<00:02:28.880> troublesome

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
somewhat realistically is troublesome

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.670 
somewhat realistically is troublesome
you<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.299> just<00:02:30.420> snip<00:02:30.750> most<00:02:31.109> of<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.290> wire<00:02:31.440> off

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
you can just snip most of the wire off

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.289 
you can just snip most of the wire off
and<00:02:31.859> that<00:02:31.950> would<00:02:32.180> pretty<00:02:33.180> much<00:02:33.329> solve<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:35.299> if

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
and that would pretty much solve that if

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.770 
and that would pretty much solve that if
you<00:02:36.480> don't<00:02:36.810> paint<00:02:37.310> then<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.519> heat<00:02:38.849> rod<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
you don't paint then the heat rod is a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.580 
you don't paint then the heat rod is a
little<00:02:40.709> bit<00:02:40.980> loose<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:41.849> can't<00:02:42.299> do<00:02:42.750> just

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
little bit loose so you can't do just

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.069 
little bit loose so you can't do just
anything<00:02:43.769> with<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:44.639> you<00:02:45.480> can<00:02:45.720> get<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:45.959> to

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
anything with it but you can get it to

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.569 
anything with it but you can get it to
hold<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.380> pose<00:02:46.560> pretty<00:02:47.010> well<00:02:47.220> if<00:02:47.430> you're

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
hold a pose pretty well if you're

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.900 
hold a pose pretty well if you're
willing<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:47.910> put<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.090> time<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.669> made

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
willing to put the time in so that made

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.430 
willing to put the time in so that made
it<00:02:50.940> kind<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.329> difficult<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.840> get<00:02:51.959> into<00:02:52.169> a<00:02:52.200> pose

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
it kind of difficult to get into a pose

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.900 
it kind of difficult to get into a pose
I<00:02:52.620> like<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:52.859> pose<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.370> now<00:02:53.519> it's<00:02:53.730> not

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
I like to pose it's in now it's not

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.819 
I like to pose it's in now it's not
awesome<00:02:54.389> but<00:02:55.010> yeah<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.040> think<00:02:56.099> it<00:02:56.340> shows<00:02:57.000> a

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
awesome but yeah I think it shows a

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.990 
awesome but yeah I think it shows a
enough<00:02:58.829> of<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.099> EPI<00:02:59.340> on<00:02:59.459> that<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.849> looks

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
enough of the EPI on that it looks

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.150 
enough of the EPI on that it looks
pretty<00:03:00.090> cool<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.680> definitely<00:03:01.680> recommend<00:03:01.859> this

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
pretty cool I definitely recommend this

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.039 
pretty cool I definitely recommend this
kit<00:03:02.370> without<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.940> second's<00:03:03.359> hesitation<00:03:03.389> to

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:10.919 
very simple color separation is awesome

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:12.979 
very simple color separation is awesome
you<00:03:11.910> don't<00:03:12.060> really<00:03:12.180> have<00:03:12.359> to<00:03:12.450> paint<00:03:12.720> unless

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
you don't really have to paint unless

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.770 
you don't really have to paint unless
you<00:03:13.139> want<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:14.430> decals<00:03:15.000> are<00:03:15.239> nice<00:03:15.419> but<00:03:15.660> you

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
you want to the decals are nice but you

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.940
