for<00:00:50.430> decades<00:00:50.789> now<00:00:51.690> there<00:00:51.870> are<00:00:51.960> questions

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
for decades now there are questions

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.709 
for decades now there are questions
about<00:00:52.379> China's<00:00:52.980> demographic<00:00:53.699> path<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.480> that

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
about China's demographic path and that

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.510 
about China's demographic path and that
it<00:00:54.870> because<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> one-child<00:00:55.800> policy<00:00:55.949> for

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
it because of the one-child policy for

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.400 
it because of the one-child policy for
the<00:00:56.579> past<00:00:56.789> years<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.660> China<00:00:57.899> will<00:00:58.050> begin<00:00:58.289> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the past years that China will begin to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.110 
the past years that China will begin to
age<00:00:58.590> before<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.280> become<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> fluent<00:01:00.030> enough

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
age before it's become a fluent enough

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.180 
age before it's become a fluent enough
and<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.690> will<00:01:00.840> undermine<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.530> all<00:01:02.129> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
and that that will undermine it all I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.349 
and that that will undermine it all I
can<00:01:02.399> say<00:01:02.550> about<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.059> every

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
can say about that is that every

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.509 
can say about that is that every
demographic<00:01:03.629> projection<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.650> consequences

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
demographic projection and consequences

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.929 
demographic projection and consequences
thereof<00:01:05.939> since<00:01:06.689> Malthus<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.380> been<00:01:07.560> wrong

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
thereof since Malthus have been wrong

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.280 
thereof since Malthus have been wrong
which<00:01:08.939> doesn't<00:01:09.420> mean<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:09.930> will<00:01:10.049> not

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
which doesn't mean that they will not

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.560 
which doesn't mean that they will not
eventually<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:11.340> right<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.030> means<00:01:12.390> that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
eventually be right it just means that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.630 
eventually be right it just means that
there's<00:01:12.930> no<00:01:13.080> great<00:01:13.380> reason<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.860> believe<00:01:14.130> that

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
there's no great reason to believe that

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.490 
there's no great reason to believe that
the<00:01:15.000> perception<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.689> demography<00:01:15.990> being

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the perception of demography being

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.890 
the perception of demography being
destiny<00:01:17.040> will<00:01:17.549> hold<00:01:17.790> any<00:01:18.030> more<00:01:18.240> substance<00:01:18.750> in

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
destiny will hold any more substance in

destiny will hold any more substance in
the<00:01:18.960> future<00:01:19.290> than<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.560> has<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.890> past

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
commercially in order to develop

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.859 
commercially in order to develop
internally<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.159> those<00:01:53.759> are<00:01:53.790> two<00:01:54.090> different

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
internally and those are two different

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.749 
internally and those are two different
pathways<00:01:55.320> both<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.040> which<00:01:56.189> seemed<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.640> be

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
pathways both of which seemed to be

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.920 
pathways both of which seemed to be
viable<00:01:57.030> right<00:01:57.540> now<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.920> not<00:01:59.460> competitive<00:02:00.030> so

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
viable right now and not competitive so

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.859 
viable right now and not competitive so
I<00:02:01.259> think<00:02:02.100> there's<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.520> lot<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.939> be<00:02:03.060> said<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.299> kind

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
I think there's a lot to be said of kind

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.649 
I think there's a lot to be said of kind
of<00:02:03.899> both<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.229> demographic<00:02:04.829> paths<00:02:05.070> here<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.670> I

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
of both the demographic paths here and I

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.150 
of both the demographic paths here and I
don't<00:02:06.780> think<00:02:07.110> either<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.530> going<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.710> imperil

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
don't think either is going to imperil

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.919 
don't think either is going to imperil
this<00:02:08.429> development<00:02:09.030> certainly<00:02:09.450> not<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
this development certainly not in the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.280 
this development certainly not in the
next<00:02:10.229> decade<00:02:10.950> or<00:02:11.069> so
