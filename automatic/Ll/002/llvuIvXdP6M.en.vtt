the<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.550> was<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> fabulous<00:00:48.270> feeling<00:00:50.420> everything

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the it was a fabulous feeling everything

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.779 
the it was a fabulous feeling everything
went<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.780> little<00:00:51.899> bit<00:00:52.110> quick<00:00:52.379> because<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.949> had<00:00:53.579> my

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
went a little bit quick because I had my

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.930 
went a little bit quick because I had my
first<00:00:54.030> convocation<00:00:54.840> for<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> national<00:00:55.800> team

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
first convocation for the national team

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.330 
first convocation for the national team
two<00:00:56.940> months<00:00:57.270> before<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.840> was<00:00:58.379> my<00:00:58.559> first<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
two months before I was my first one and

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.510 
two months before I was my first one and
then<00:00:59.430> two<00:00:59.879> months<00:01:00.000> later<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.570> go<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.780> Brazil

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
then two months later you go to Brazil

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.000 
then two months later you go to Brazil
it<00:01:02.520> went<00:01:02.820> all<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.420> quick<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.989> think<00:01:04.860> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
it went all so quick that I think it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.280 
it went all so quick that I think it
took<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.549> takes<00:01:05.850> more<00:01:06.150> time<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.720> realize<00:01:07.080> what

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
took it takes more time to realize what

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.630 
took it takes more time to realize what
happened<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.890> think<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.220> even<00:01:08.369> nicer

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
happened but I think it's even nicer

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.100 
happened but I think it's even nicer
because<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.240> don't<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> time<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.080> think

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
because you don't have the time to think

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.500 
because you don't have the time to think
or<00:01:10.619> what's<00:01:10.950> gonna<00:01:11.130> happen<00:01:11.580> if<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:12.000> go<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> Brazil

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
or what's gonna happen if I go to Brazil

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.929 
or what's gonna happen if I go to Brazil
or<00:01:13.049> what's<00:01:13.260> gonna<00:01:13.320> happen<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.979> win<00:01:14.189> because

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
or what's gonna happen if I win because

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.499 
or what's gonna happen if I win because
it<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.869> went<00:01:16.110> quick<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.770> now<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:18.299> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
it just went quick and now I have to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.710 
it just went quick and now I have to
realize<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.850> won<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> World<00:01:21.150> Cup<00:01:21.420> I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that it's not it's not going to be easy

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.929 
that it's not it's not going to be easy
because<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.900> played<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:29.130> all<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.490> youth<00:01:29.640> teams

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
had to to get out of my head the sadness

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.160 
had to to get out of my head the sadness
and<00:01:52.290> half<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.130> had<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.460> work<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.180> get<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.600> get

and half and I had to work to get to get
back<00:01:55.380> fit<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.159> stuck<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.820> team<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.350> I

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.380 
back fit so I stuck with the team and I
think<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.680> there<00:01:59.100> was<00:01:59.250> one<00:01:59.610> more<00:01:59.820> important

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
think that there was one more important

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.569 
think that there was one more important
thing<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:01.140> always<00:02:01.649> stay<00:02:02.040> together<00:02:02.219> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
thing that we always stay together the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.340 
thing that we always stay together the
team's<00:02:02.820> players<00:02:03.180> who<00:02:03.420> didn't<00:02:03.719> play<00:02:03.810> players

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
team's players who didn't play players

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.020 
team's players who didn't play players
who<00:02:04.469> always<00:02:04.649> play<00:02:05.040> we<00:02:05.820> always<00:02:06.149> were<00:02:06.299> wanting

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
who always play we always were wanting

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.940 
who always play we always were wanting
all<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.510> best<00:02:07.660> experience<00:02:08.290> I<00:02:08.410> think<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.770> was

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
all the best experience I think it was

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.820 
all the best experience I think it was
think<00:02:09.759> it's<00:02:09.940> there<00:02:10.119> on<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.450> on<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.470> photos

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
think it's there on the on the photos

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.830 
think it's there on the on the photos
where<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:12.040> live<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.370> trophy<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.240> now<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.420> speak

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
where I live the trophy and now I speak

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.590 
where I live the trophy and now I speak
four<00:02:14.080> languages<00:02:14.470> but<00:02:14.860> it's<00:02:15.820> not<00:02:16.060> enough<00:02:16.360> to

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
four languages but it's not enough to

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.440 
four languages but it's not enough to
describe<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.590> feeling<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.190> think<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.060> have

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
describe the feeling I think that I have

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.780 
describe the feeling I think that I have
to<00:02:19.630> learn<00:02:19.780> more<00:02:20.320> languages<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.370> put<00:02:21.640> them

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
to learn more languages and put them

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.820 
to learn more languages and put them
together<00:02:21.970> because<00:02:22.450> they're<00:02:23.020> not<00:02:23.230> not<00:02:23.560> enough

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
together because they're not not enough

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.699 
together because they're not not enough
words<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.370> describe<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:25.600> feeling

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.949 

for<00:02:30.709> me<00:02:30.890> now<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.450> this<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.810> the

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
for me now this is the this is the

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.350 
for me now this is the this is the
beginning<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.220> already<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.610> high<00:02:34.760> standard<00:02:35.330> so

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
beginning so already a high standard so

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.600 
beginning so already a high standard so

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
want to grow as a player and that was

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.570 
want to grow as a player and that was
one<00:02:54.230> more<00:02:54.440> reason<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.130> came<00:02:55.190> here<00:02:55.370> in

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
one more reason that I came here in

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.120 
one more reason that I came here in
Spain<00:02:55.880> because<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.239> think<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.709> grow<00:02:57.920> as<00:02:58.100> a

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
Spain because I think to to grow as a

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.699 
Spain because I think to to grow as a
player<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.900> have<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.050> play<00:03:00.290> against<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.680> best

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
player you have to play against the best

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.910 
player you have to play against the best
players<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.730> think<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.090> best<00:03:02.269> strikers

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
players and I think the best strikers

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.300 
players and I think the best strikers
right<00:03:03.920> now<00:03:04.130> I<00:03:04.160> are<00:03:04.970> here<00:03:05.150> in<00:03:05.239> Spain<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:06.190> for<00:03:07.190> me

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
right now I are here in Spain so for me

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.479 
right now I are here in Spain so for me
this<00:03:07.489> is<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.670> challenge<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:09.080> have<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.160> have

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
this is a challenge and I have to have

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.300 
this is a challenge and I have to have
to<00:03:11.049> play<00:03:12.049> against<00:03:12.380> these<00:03:12.590> big<00:03:12.769> players<00:03:13.069> to

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
to play against these big players to

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.979 
to play against these big players to
grow<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:14.030> grow<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.360> player<00:03:14.569> but<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.840> most

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
grow to grow the player but the most

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.830 
grow to grow the player but the most
important<00:03:15.590> thing<00:03:15.739> was<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.330> do<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.510> next<00:03:17.720> step

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
important thing was to do the next step

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.559 
important thing was to do the next step
I<00:03:18.350> think<00:03:19.010> from<00:03:19.190> some<00:03:19.370> Doria<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.880> Valencia<00:03:20.390> it

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
I think from some Doria to Valencia it

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.539 
I think from some Doria to Valencia it
was<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.959> best<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.530> best<00:03:21.709> step<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.100> do<00:03:22.220> because

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
was the best the best step to do because

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.360 
was the best the best step to do because
it<00:03:23.209> is<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.360> least<00:03:23.959> one<00:03:24.260> step<00:03:24.530> higher<00:03:24.739> all<00:03:25.310> of

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
it is the least one step higher all of

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.539 
it is the least one step higher all of
the<00:03:25.790> players<00:03:26.060> are<00:03:26.930> going<00:03:27.080> to<00:03:27.170> try<00:03:27.380> his<00:03:27.590> best<00:03:27.769> to

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
the players are going to try his best to

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.680 
the players are going to try his best to
make<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.600> team<00:03:30.160> be<00:03:31.160> in<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.850> in<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.209> top<00:03:32.420> four

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
make the team be in the in the top four

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.860 
make the team be in the in the top four
in<00:03:33.019> Spain<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.700> be<00:03:34.820> honest<00:03:35.120> for<00:03:35.209> me<00:03:35.359> after<00:03:35.660> I

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
liked the interest that they had because

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.590 
liked the interest that they had because
they<00:03:45.920> just<00:03:46.100> they<00:03:46.340> didn't<00:03:46.760> just<00:03:46.880> call<00:03:47.090> one<00:03:47.390> time

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
they just they didn't just call one time

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.000 
they just they didn't just call one time
and<00:03:47.810> say<00:03:47.959> we<00:03:48.079> would<00:03:48.230> like<00:03:48.410> to<00:03:48.440> have<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:48.859> but

and say we would like to have you but

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.670 
and say we would like to have you but
they<00:03:49.160> called<00:03:49.400> ten<00:03:49.700> times<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.329> they<00:03:51.230> showed<00:03:51.470> me

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
they called ten times and they showed me

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.039 
they called ten times and they showed me
that<00:03:51.829> they<00:03:52.489> want<00:03:52.730> me<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.209> come<00:03:53.690> here<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.019> I

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
that they want me to come here and I

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.319 
that they want me to come here and I
think<00:03:54.109> for<00:03:54.440> a<00:03:54.500> young<00:03:54.650> player<00:03:54.829> this<00:03:55.160> is<00:03:55.329> the

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
think for a young player this is the

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.180 
think for a young player this is the
most<00:03:56.510> important<00:03:56.870> thing<00:03:56.989> I<00:03:57.230> think<00:03:57.769> that<00:03:57.950> a<00:03:57.980> lot

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
most important thing I think that a lot

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.289 
most important thing I think that a lot
of<00:03:58.220> people<00:03:58.700> are<00:03:58.880> looking<00:03:59.570> looking<00:04:00.230> at<00:04:00.440> me<00:04:00.620> now

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
of people are looking looking at me now

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.080
