00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.850
 I invite you also to participate in this 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.960
 topic that is interesting that is the 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:10.209
 proliferation of bars in Havana and 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.730
 besides clothing with the flag 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:17.980
 american havana sexy as they call 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.260
 Peter, I do not know if you knew this about this 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.990
 past and some of the items that 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.359
 have come out and says there are bars that 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.880
 they are making 100 thousand dollars in five 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.210
 months that make two thousand dollars for 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.100
 night they are also full of good to 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.140
 its number is that that image looks like a 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.780
 bar of 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.970
 and obviously the call 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.100
 Westernization of the island of Cuba 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.780
 started a while ago the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.790
 Westernization in every way 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.800
 Cuban youth is increasingly being 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.230
 approaching much more trends of the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.320
 international - scale youth 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.030
 trend where it matters most to do the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.200
 sex that think matters more 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.930
 get drunk to read and how much more 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.570
 frivolity the quality as but they are put 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.180
 who hears that all that education 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.119
 wonderful of what they give you in Cuba and 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.520
 I should also have immunized you for 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.530
 the evils of decadent capitalism that 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.840
 it happens that they fall so easily 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.180
 that would be that is theory but in the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.610
 practice Cuban youth I tell you 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.810
 behaves as it behaves 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.670
 youth in all the places that I've 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.220
 traveled was in spain in mexico in 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.330
 Holland to the USA wherever I've 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.670
 lived I realized that the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.950
 Youth behavior is global 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.440
 homogenized and it's a very trend 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.210
 strong towards 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.400
 we once said the carnivalization 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.800
 of sex the clothing more and more 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.010
 impudent money as the ultimate goal of 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.010
 life 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.710
 money as the ultimate goal of life 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.810
 beyond other spiritual values 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.790
 money has a democratic value 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.750
 also because money does not distinguish 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.730
 between race religion depends on Satan 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.340
 money first were the religions and 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.930
 then communism but the money look 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.410
 everything wants in the Muslim wants 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.970
 money the catholic was more referring 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.770
 also for example there is a trend 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.400
 very strong today plus one two world 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.140
 more the gap or even so quake in Cuba 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.940
 Of course the internet is very incipient but 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.130
 everyone with mobile constantly 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.130
 they do not use it almost anything 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.180
 well I think that all the all 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.530
 countries should have these kinds of spaces 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.570
 every country democratic even 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.330
 China not even more could not finish with 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.950
 that much cultural revolution a lot 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.840
 cultural barbarism really 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.459
 but basically the passage of the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.680
 westernization as Peter says do not 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.200
 stops nobody and freedoms are the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.300
 same the same in the Muslim world that 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.690
 the western world I think that these 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.349
 spaces must exist and have their life 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.330
 actually own it had in 1958 before 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.980
 that the revolution came and it existed 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.660
 the cabaret world and the world existed 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.049
 of the shows and Cuba felt 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.130
 proud of that always the 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.730
 entertainment now that there's no 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.730
 problem 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.329
 Self-employed bar license 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.099
 or disco since the guy who is 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.610
 investing 100 thousand dollars tomorrow 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:30.100
 appears raúl castro with the momio virado 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.120
 and how it happened with 3d theaters and it's the 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.890
 closes I think that in the background always 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.990
 there must be influence peddling in 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.170
 I do not think there are people with 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:44.500
 the history that the period of 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.780
 the Cuban revolution to do well 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:53.590
 without more a type of investment than after 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:55.480
 he knows he's left behind and here the 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.330
 military caste behind all of that 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.620
 relatives must have there says someone 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.030
 that just arrived that havana that 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.400
 went to one of those bars and that because 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.070
 the owner knew that in the back there is a 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.750
 prostitution business not and that 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.470
 then the rule is that there can not be 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.780
 as the abaqua would say there can not be 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.030
 good nobody smoking marijuana because 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.660
 says that marijuana smells too much and 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:23.020
 then he gives them away but not yesterday 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:27.930
 bars like the sarao flew mine and yours 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:33.010
 shangri-la I do not know if they were written or 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.960
 it is not where I lived very nice the 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.280
 space of them also also this 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.200
 sir and the one of the boat in greeley 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.870
 where is that part of the beach that remains 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:45.820
 for the 42 42 19 17 out there I was 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.370
 48 21 then that 's what I've been 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.760
 spoken where the mail was before 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.290
 a hole down yes that's very nice that 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.960
 It's a pool bar before the 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.000
 revolution turning it for a 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.600
 house where people lived and now has 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.950
 come back for that socialism the 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.060
 communism the longest road to 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.060
 get to capitalism 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:14.970
 to die no thanks to god I tell you to the 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.710
 literature I do not say it with all the 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.150
 possible respect because they are no longer 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.009
 guys who have done the most damage to america 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.780
 latina with that awful book of the 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:26.669
 repression but after he repented 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.160
 and besides being a poet of 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.740
 frightfully bad was a scoundrel who 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.449
 it really hurt us a lot and also 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.949
 a guy with ease to write and 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.479
 difficulty in thinking I do the 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.970
 clarification so that nobody believes me 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:42.690
 I'm happy about the mental viola 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.100
 more despite its past in the ss of 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.780
 which wounds are sorry 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.729

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.840

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.539
 I can also talk about master art in 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.080
 Literature is devious for when 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.080
 let's go back
