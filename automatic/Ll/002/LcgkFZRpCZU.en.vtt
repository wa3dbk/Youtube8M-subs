00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.679
 now that hot and how are 

00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:05.630
 welcome a new video and be them 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:07.100
 I bring a boxing today and it's from a 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.680
 microphone that is really very good 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.960
 for gameplays for the sayings and it's 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.030
 good nice and cheap for those who 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.279
 like is not Colombian is good man and 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.409
 I say that that microphone is the best 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.869
 its price and really the quality is 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:22.669
 pretty good, as I see from the 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.460
 videos is because really all the 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:28.310
 tried I bought it on Saturday and it has 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.199
 come on Monday they are loud is that they are the 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.780
 better and very good attention those who 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.609
 they sell this microphone so let's go 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.050
 with the unboxing and well then really 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.000
 We wanted to improve what quality is 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.010
 of the audio because I really do not like 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.690
 the audio of my microphone because 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.000
 it really sounds like I have a 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.070
 piece here so I really do not like it 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.350
 So, well, we're going to give you the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.359
 that he really recorded 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.579
 with this what I really want either 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.960
 is that they are very bad but I do not like 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.280
 as a degree so I just go 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.010
 to leave helmet and it will be everything so if 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.409
 see you in the box and let's start 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.909
 with the one box or I do not know if I look good 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.009
 you are seeing a lot of flaws of you could 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.600
 make me on this side so we 're going to 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.860
 start with the unboxing, well, these 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.070
 are the data for those who want me 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.509
 make the visit let's start good at 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.070
 this moment I am recording with what 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.960
 is the audio of the camera already after 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.570
 I recorded a part of the video as philips 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.640
 with him with the microphone audio certain 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.110
 so let's start excuse me nice 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.119
 and it would mark the video what happens is that 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.670
 it's a pretty weird angle to record 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.670
 everything so let's start good 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.979
 the super knife 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.350
 or 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.350
 good 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.799
 it's the best thing to extract a lot of time 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:20.620
 a new stir this super microphone 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.690
 is the garbage and this the microphone 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.510
 let's see if we're going a little more 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.689
 detailed 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.209
 it's the c1 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.040
 it's a pretty good microphone in the 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.030
 microphone quality is pretty good 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.189
 and what else can you show them so to see 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.379
 that one comes by direct us but for 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.030
 those who intends to buy that microphone that 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.430
 really have the principle committed a 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.230
 error buy that one without side and 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.440
 you can simply 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.909
 a million to bring one and you need a 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.489
 console part to judge the computer 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.840
 and they made me change so thank you 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.129
 who sold it to me for doing 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.349
 good change here is what the 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.750
 characteristics of the back you see the 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.970
 reflection of the camera true good says 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.799
 over here that is provides professional of the 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.510
 garma convince google it looks good what 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.030
 he painted art what goes inside true 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.200
 so to see good let's go back to 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.569
 place the camera here 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.519
 well I do not know if it looks perfectly can 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.989
 so do not touch it like that because it will not come back 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.569
 be an imposition because it would no longer be a 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.890
 box because I already open it then those that 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.130
 did this one can come to me 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.820
 home 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.820
 good 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.730
 and now let's start 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.730
 to see 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.950
 how will it come out cutting 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.030
 well is putting in my deep 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.510
 for a box and grandson of a boxing 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.510
 spoiled by something 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.550
 8 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.419
 it's over here 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.240
 and good the microphone at first instance 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.950
 then pretty good and pretty pretty 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.110
 done I feel like buying an anti pop 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.850
 what is there and when I breathe 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.290
 do not do like ok 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.880
 Well, really, how can you see the 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.590
 microphone audio is pretty good and 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.940
 I'm talking like an announcer but like that 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.169
 has to do because it's a microphone 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.270
 pro low 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.030
 ok and good as at this moment I have the 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.130
 microphone in the hand with the right hand 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.870
 it's a pretty good microphone for the 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.490
 gays and especially for people who 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.680
 we are just beginning a study 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.960
 we even want to take this a little more 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.000
 seriously true then later you can 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.380
 stop so much chachachÃ¡ and I 'm going to 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.389
 show what's in the box I see that in 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.070
 the video I've talked a lot is true 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.070
 well I will show you what is in the 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.750
 calaca what there is mainly is of 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.910
 a usb 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.880
 and the drivers of a computer do not 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.610
 recognize what you gave the microphone but 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.170
 I really did not recognize it from one thing is 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.510
 that was very quickly and this cable 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.430
 has is quite long done and as 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.160
 four meters or I can sit down 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.200
 from the bed or tell from from my 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.650
 cable because it really is quite long 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.230
 after what is the manuals and everything is the 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.110
 bring the manuals brings this what is 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.430
 to place in a post on foot I think that 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.680
 it is said to place what is a micro 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.600
 with a drop of I do not really know how to 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.990
 pronounces but that's where it is placed 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.120
 this thing this form is placed there 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.830
 true and good because there is that which is for 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.330
 fishing so that it does not hit you for every 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.770
 the microphone is not said to be ppk 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.080
 and well, more than all this has been 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.490
 boxing and you can really see how the 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.289
 audio quality really is what 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.300
 I recommend we are also seeing each other 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.949
 in a next video and remember like or 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.819
 any comment and we come a 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.819
 next video
