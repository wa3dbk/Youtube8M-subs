00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.070
 and very good day youtube community here 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.650
 captured 3.3 with exciting news 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.349
 about the forge mode first of all 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.630
 the quantities multiplied for 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.849
 can create objects in the editor module 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.850
 instead of being 10,000 as it was 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:25.699
 engineer ruiz and 1500 as it was installed 3 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.769
 now you will have a million credits 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.630
 objects continue with your cheap value you 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.550
 ends object costs between 100 200 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.980
 credits for example what will they leave you 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.629
 basically create the map completely 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.570
 without the risk that the 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.549
 credits each object is marked green 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.650
 when you touch it and yellow when 

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:44.180
 you move this is to keep you from 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.979
 you confuse the object you want to touch 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.559
 how to see something that is done to me 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:50.119
 pretty good you can block an object 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.830
 for the one who does not move anymore 

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:53.210
 this would be for when an object is already 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.010
 very rich and now you want her to stay 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.720
 there samples when more people 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.180
 block so that joke is not moved 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.860
 by accident you can multiply a 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.750
 object with just lending to a key 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.369
 this will serve very well to not have to 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.860
 return to the object's reading menu 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.890
 again just a key and now what 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.570
 multiply 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.340
 you can select the option of 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.050
 magnetism so that all objects 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.120
 that linear with each other without much 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.640
 effort to edit the coordinates between 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.530
 other things is to say by putting magnetism 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.930
 the object will stick to the other exactly 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.970
 to the height and distance that the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.560
 another originally what will serve very 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.200
 well how are you looking to do 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.000
 bridges for example when the player is 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.159
 found in editor mode there's no 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.530
 shadows so they do not distract between 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.350
 other things when the player changes to 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.810
 player mode as the sport and mode 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.789
 to play the game the shadows 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.860
 even the objects appear 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.259
 difference of halo ruiz when you make a 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.300
 little house in force and heller ins simply 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.190
 there were no shadows went into 15,000 or 4 for 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.259
 that the map looks real as if it does not 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.090
 would have been created by a fan the map 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.429
 it will simply make shadows with any 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.440
 object the smallest object can now 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.240
 be shadows in forums mode the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.369
 Force mode toys like balls 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.720
 mortals will definitely come back as 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.119
 they are seeing it at this moment in 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.240
 screen you can select the severity 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.120
 of a specific area of the map or 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.250
 the shields the ammunition among others 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.410
 that is to say you can select that in 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.120
 this part of the map the options for the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.070
 player or that this part of the map 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.780
 that you already select radio and you can 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.820
 make the game invincible that the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.890
 player has an infinite silver and 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.660
 that part of the map that you injured the 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.880
 player returns to normal depends 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.370
 of the rules of the game 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.470
 there will be at least three explosives maps 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.150
 for force and not just one like the ritz 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.430
 those specified in all the maps 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.650
 they will be similar forum style and some will be 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.350
 desert among other things will wait 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.510
 and good has been all comfort subscribe 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.980
 you form information like that 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.580
 if the video was found and left in the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.740
 comments 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.750
 the question of today you 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.940
 they could add something to this forum that 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.830
 it would be good to leave in the comments and 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.820
 we'll see each other until the next subscribe 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.820
 dt like and discuss traffickers when three 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.820
 outside
