and have hair just like I do but that's

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.120 
and have hair just like I do but that's
the<00:01:45.760> reason<00:01:46.030> why<00:01:46.360> I'm<00:01:46.930> going<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.380> cut<00:01:47.680> my<00:01:47.890> hair

the reason why I'm going to cut my hair

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.390 
the reason why I'm going to cut my hair
and<00:01:48.460> I<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.920> it's<00:01:51.310> not<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.240> huge<00:01:52.570> deal<00:01:52.870> like

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
and I think it's not a huge deal like

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.219 
and I think it's not a huge deal like
actually<00:01:54.400> for<00:01:54.760> the<00:01:54.970> child<00:01:55.270> that<00:01:55.510> will<00:01:55.750> get<00:01:56.020> my

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
actually for the child that will get my

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.940 
actually for the child that will get my
hair<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.710> will<00:01:57.400> be<00:01:57.760> a<00:01:57.790> really<00:01:58.540> huge<00:01:59.140> deal<00:01:59.470> but

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
hair it will be a really huge deal but

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.540 
hair it will be a really huge deal but
for<00:02:00.280> me<00:02:01.150> it's<00:02:01.479> not<00:02:01.630> that<00:02:01.690> big<00:02:02.110> of<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.350> deal

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
for me it's not that big of a deal

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.990 
for me it's not that big of a deal
because<00:02:03.550> I<00:02:03.910> get<00:02:04.570> my<00:02:04.840> hair<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.979> grows<00:02:06.520> back

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000
