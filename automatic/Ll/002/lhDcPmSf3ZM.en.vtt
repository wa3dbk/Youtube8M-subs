00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.370 
just saw with aware a my document I
could<00:02:18.239> change<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.750> default<00:02:19.140> save<00:02:19.350> location

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
could change the default save location

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.500 
could change the default save location
to<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.130> public<00:02:20.459> Documents<00:02:20.940> folder<00:02:20.970> by

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
to the public Documents folder by

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.880 
to the public Documents folder by
right-clicking<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:24.050> choosing<00:02:25.050> set<00:02:25.739> as

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
right-clicking it and choosing set as

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.960 
right-clicking it and choosing set as
default<00:02:26.370> save<00:02:26.850> location

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.190 

well<00:02:29.970> obviously<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.540> libraries<00:02:30.959> feature

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
well obviously the libraries feature

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.720 
well obviously the libraries feature
takes<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.620> little<00:02:31.739> getting<00:02:31.860> used<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.610> would

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
takes a little getting used to and would

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.370 
takes a little getting used to and would
be<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:32.850> good<00:02:33.030> candidate<00:02:33.540> for<00:02:33.569> some<00:02:33.959> quick<00:02:34.140> user

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
be a good candidate for some quick user

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.290 
be a good candidate for some quick user
training<00:02:34.860> but<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.610> be<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.760> handy<00:02:36.150> way<00:02:36.269> of

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
training but it can be a handy way of

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.720 
training but it can be a handy way of
working<00:02:36.630> with<00:02:36.900> files<00:02:37.140> as<00:02:37.560> long<00:02:38.519> as<00:02:38.640> you

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
working with files as long as you

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.860 
working with files as long as you
remember<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.180> when<00:02:39.269> you're<00:02:39.420> working<00:02:39.540> with<00:02:39.750> a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
remember that when you're working with a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.720 
remember that when you're working with a
file<00:02:40.170> in<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.410> library<00:02:40.830> you're<00:02:41.340> actually

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
file in a library you're actually

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.729 
file in a library you're actually
modifying<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.450> file<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.840> its<00:02:42.989> real<00:02:43.170> location

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
modifying the file in its real location

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.949 
modifying the file in its real location
and<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.340> library<00:02:44.730> folder<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.299> just<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.750> way<00:02:45.930> of

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
and the library folder is just a way of

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.710 
and the library folder is just a way of
viewing<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.650> files<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.760> logical<00:02:48.269> rather

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
viewing the files in a logical rather

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.199 
viewing the files in a logical rather
than<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:48.989> physical<00:02:49.470> manner<00:02:50.060> thanks<00:02:51.060> for

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
than a physical manner thanks for

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.510
