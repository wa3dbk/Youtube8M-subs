00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
against every projectile but there's

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.490 
against every projectile but there's
like<00:01:50.220> lag<00:01:50.520> involved<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.150> it<00:01:51.300> all<00:01:51.540> right<00:01:52.020> that's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
like lag involved in it all right that's

and Bank on the fact that i kin KO with
this<00:03:55.320> later<00:03:55.560> again<00:03:56.810> feel<00:03:57.810> like<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.080> really

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
this later again feel like it really

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.530 
this later again feel like it really
depends<00:03:58.739> on<00:03:58.860> what<00:03:59.220> their<00:03:59.670> person<00:04:00.030> is<00:04:00.180> if<00:04:00.390> you

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
depends on what their person is if you

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.300 
depends on what their person is if you
get<00:04:00.720> an<00:04:00.959> offstage<00:04:01.260> early<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:01.739> would<00:04:01.980> just<00:04:02.010> take
