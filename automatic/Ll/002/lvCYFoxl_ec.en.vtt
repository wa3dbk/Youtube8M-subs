00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
if that would help and just did it I

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.100 
if that would help and just did it I
just<00:01:45.100> felt<00:01:45.790> cakey<00:01:46.180> on<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.570> face<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:46.960> maybe

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
just felt cakey on the face and maybe

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.510 
just felt cakey on the face and maybe
it's<00:01:47.290> because<00:01:47.470> I'm<00:01:47.950> a<00:01:48.070> powder<00:01:48.310> foundation

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
it's because I'm a powder foundation

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.910 
it's because I'm a powder foundation
which<00:01:49.030> is<00:01:49.180> already<00:01:49.570> super<00:01:50.500> light<00:01:50.830> but<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.560> I
