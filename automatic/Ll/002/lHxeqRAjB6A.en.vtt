will also tell you what the motor size

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.109 
will also tell you what the motor size
is<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.420> look<00:00:21.510> over<00:00:21.720> here<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.960> says<00:00:22.109> six<00:00:22.439> litre

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
is you look over here it says six litre

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.390 
is you look over here it says six litre
so<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.750> know<00:00:24.930> how<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.680> further<00:00:26.130> ado

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
so so you know how the further ado

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.920 
so so you know how the further ado
here's<00:00:26.640> how<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.210> trickiest<00:00:27.630> part

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
here's how you do it the trickiest part

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.130 
here's how you do it the trickiest part
of<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.140> job<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:29.029> the<00:00:30.029> fan<00:00:30.269> clutch<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.929> my

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
of this job is the fan clutch in my

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.200 
of this job is the fan clutch in my
opinion<00:00:31.560> because<00:00:32.219> it's<00:00:32.489> hard<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.790> get<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.059> off

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
opinion because it's hard to get it off

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.780 
opinion because it's hard to get it off
if<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.540> don't<00:00:33.630> know<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> right<00:00:34.170> track<00:00:34.790> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
if you don't know the right track the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.780 
if you don't know the right track the
first<00:00:36.030> thing<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.360> want<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> remove<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
first thing you want to remove is the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.639 
first thing you want to remove is the
hose<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.450> didn't<00:00:39.960> even<00:00:40.050> take<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.410> cover

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
hose here I didn't even take this cover

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.229 
hose here I didn't even take this cover
off<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.070> reach<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.520> from<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.850> side<00:00:41.910> with

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
off I just reach in from this side with

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.750 
off I just reach in from this side with
a<00:00:42.270> screwdriver<00:00:42.600> undo<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.680> hose<00:00:43.800> clamp<00:00:44.190> and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
a screwdriver undo the hose clamp and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.910 
a screwdriver undo the hose clamp and
then<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.329> hose<00:00:45.719> clamp<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> motor<00:00:46.559> side

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
then do the hose clamp on the motor side

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100 
then do the hose clamp on the motor side
of<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.399> mass<00:00:48.149> airflow<00:00:48.420> sensor

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
of the mass airflow sensor

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.529 
of the mass airflow sensor
once<00:00:49.770> you've<00:00:49.950> pulled<00:00:50.190> those<00:00:50.430> off<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:51.030> just

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
once you've pulled those off I just

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.209 
once you've pulled those off I just
leave<00:00:51.719> these<00:00:51.840> clamps<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> hoses<00:00:53.010> because

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
leave these clamps on the hoses because

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.490 
leave these clamps on the hoses because
they're<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> pain<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.840> unbuckle<00:00:55.199> those

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
they're a pain but I just unbuckle those

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.830 
they're a pain but I just unbuckle those
out<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.129> shroud<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.360> they<00:00:57.480> come<00:00:57.690> out

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
out of the shroud so that they come out

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.540 
out of the shroud so that they come out
and<00:00:58.469> off<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.340> holder<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.059> intake<00:01:01.020> hose

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
and off of the holder on the intake hose

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.490 
and off of the holder on the intake hose
so<00:01:02.550> intake<00:01:03.210> hose<00:01:03.390> comes<00:01:03.690> off<00:01:03.840> first

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
so intake hose comes off first

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.380 
so intake hose comes off first
next<00:01:05.100> thing<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.309> want<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> pull<00:01:05.670> off<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.150> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
next thing you want to pull off is a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.750 
next thing you want to pull off is a
shroud<00:01:06.930> there's<00:01:07.650> these<00:01:07.860> little<00:01:08.070> push<00:01:08.430> pins

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
shroud there's these little push pins

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.030 
shroud there's these little push pins
you<00:01:09.030> expand<00:01:09.510> them<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.840> look<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.500> but

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
you expand them to look like this but

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.160 
you expand them to look like this but
they're<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.460> found<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:13.049> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
they're to be found here in here and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.499 
they're to be found here in here and
then<00:01:13.770> there's<00:01:13.979> two<00:01:14.220> 10<00:01:14.549> millimeter<00:01:14.580> bolts

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
then there's two 10 millimeter bolts

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.260 
then there's two 10 millimeter bolts
that<00:01:16.500> are<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.040> back<00:01:17.790> side<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
that are on the back side of the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.469 
that are on the back side of the
radiator<00:01:18.570> support<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.710> Pablos<00:01:20.159> out<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.640> once

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
radiator support to Pablos out to once

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
radiator support to Pablos out to once
those<00:01:21.720> are<00:01:21.750> out<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.200> way<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.100> get<00:01:23.310> to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
those are out of the way you can get to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.749 
those are out of the way you can get to
the<00:01:24.240> fan<00:01:24.720> clutch<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:26.130> want<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.430> leave<00:01:26.580> the

the fan clutch you want to leave the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
the fan clutch you want to leave the
belt<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.240> you'll<00:01:27.479> notice<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.930> still<00:01:28.170> have

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the belt on but what you do this is just

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.850 
the belt on but what you do this is just
regular<00:01:32.360> like<00:01:33.360> dropping<00:01:33.630> stuff<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.680> is

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
regular like dropping stuff here this is

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.340 
regular like dropping stuff here this is
regular<00:01:35.310> right<00:01:35.549> hand<00:01:35.850> thread<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.390> don't<00:01:37.259> know

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
regular right hand thread I don't know

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.990 
regular right hand thread I don't know
if<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.680> see<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.009> there's<00:01:38.220> bite<00:01:38.520> marks
