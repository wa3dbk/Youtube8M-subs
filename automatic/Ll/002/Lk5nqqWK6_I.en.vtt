00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
kind of a lot of evidence to potentially

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
vs Superman tram 20 years ago I made

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.190 
vs Superman tram 20 years ago I made
good<00:01:05.339> guys<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.790> left<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> trailer<00:01:06.960> has<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
good guys or left so the trailer has a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.230 
good guys or left so the trailer has a
shot<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> Robin<00:01:08.340> costume<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:08.970> which

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
shot of the Robin costume but which

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.270 
shot of the Robin costume but which
Robin<00:01:09.869> doesn't<00:01:10.229> belong<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> costumes

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
Robin doesn't belong so the costumes

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.090 
Robin doesn't belong so the costumes
like<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:11.880> effed<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.110> could<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
like all effed up so this could be the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.370 
like all effed up so this could be the
Jason<00:01:14.580> Todd<00:01:15.060> version<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.659> Robin<00:01:16.049> which

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
Jason Todd version of the Robin which

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.780 
Jason Todd version of the Robin which
would<00:01:16.560> make<00:01:16.740> sense<00:01:16.890> because<00:01:17.070> Jason<00:01:17.580> was

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
would make sense because Jason was

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.090 
would make sense because Jason was
captured<00:01:18.479> by<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.659> Joker<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:19.590> tortured

captured by the Joker and then tortured

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the crowbars which just adds to the the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.499 
the crowbars which just adds to the the
