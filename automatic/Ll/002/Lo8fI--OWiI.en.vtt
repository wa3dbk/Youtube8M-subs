00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
going so it's always something that's

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.830 
going so it's always something that's
involved<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.640> it's<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.000> floating<00:01:57.659> through

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
involved and it's just floating through

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.929 
involved and it's just floating through
my<00:01:57.900> body<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.590> having<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.340> background<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
my body so having that background and

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.149 
my body so having that background and
being<00:02:00.119> raised<00:02:00.420> with<00:02:00.750> musical<00:02:01.530> backgrounds

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
being raised with musical backgrounds

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.130 
being raised with musical backgrounds
with<00:02:02.369> my<00:02:02.640> my<00:02:03.090> parents<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.930> everything<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
with my my parents and everything and

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.020 
with my my parents and everything and
going<00:02:05.260> up<00:02:05.380> with<00:02:05.620> that<00:02:05.830> it's<00:02:06.430> always<00:02:06.760> something

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
going up with that it's always something

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.340 
going up with that it's always something
that's<00:02:07.120> played<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.390> huge<00:02:07.630> part<00:02:07.750> so<00:02:08.229> it

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
that's played a huge part so it

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.169 
that's played a huge part so it
definitely<00:02:08.830> gives<00:02:09.069> me<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.369> little<00:02:09.670> bit<00:02:09.789> more<00:02:10.060> of

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
definitely gives me a little bit more of

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.600 
definitely gives me a little bit more of
a<00:02:10.270> connection<00:02:10.810> when<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.530> comes<00:02:11.740> into<00:02:12.220> my

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
a connection when it comes into my

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.309 
a connection when it comes into my
choreography<00:02:13.270> because<00:02:13.330> sometimes<00:02:13.900> I'll<00:02:14.080> take

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
choreography because sometimes I'll take

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.410 
choreography because sometimes I'll take
some<00:02:14.650> traditional<00:02:15.280> steps<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:15.880> remember
