00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
same remote now some of the buttons may

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.790 
same remote now some of the buttons may
be<00:00:30.150> different<00:00:30.570> but<00:00:30.599> inside<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.380> mechanics

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
be different but inside the mechanics

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.440 
be different but inside the mechanics
are<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> exact<00:00:32.279> same<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:33.059> problem<00:00:33.360> with

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
are the exact same the problem with

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.120 
are the exact same the problem with
these<00:00:33.540> remotes<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.590> buttons<00:00:34.860> stopped

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
these remotes is the buttons stopped

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.700 
these remotes is the buttons stopped
working<00:00:35.600> some<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.630> them<00:00:36.780> may<00:00:36.899> still<00:00:37.170> work<00:00:37.350> but

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
working some of them may still work but

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
working some of them may still work but
you'll<00:00:37.860> find<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.910> buttons<00:00:39.180> eventually

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
you'll find that the buttons eventually

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.360 
you'll find that the buttons eventually
will<00:00:39.719> stop<00:00:39.989> working<00:00:40.200> especially<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.980> unlock

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
will stop working especially the unlock

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.850 
will stop working especially the unlock
and<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> most-used<00:00:42.210> buttons<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.649> I'm<00:00:43.739> gonna

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and the most-used buttons so I'm gonna

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.080 
and the most-used buttons so I'm gonna
show<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.040> how<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.190> fix<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.489> today<00:00:44.730> now

rubber<00:01:45.960> pads<00:01:46.259> they<00:01:46.829> don't<00:01:47.040> seem<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.430> connect

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
rubber pads they don't seem to connect

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.719 
rubber pads they don't seem to connect
properly<00:01:48.030> with<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.579> connections<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
properly with the connections on the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.850 
properly with the connections on the
circuit<00:01:51.060> board<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.930> what<00:01:52.049> we've<00:01:52.200> designed<00:01:52.380> is

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
circuit board so what we've designed is

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.899 
circuit board so what we've designed is
a<00:01:53.040> small<00:01:53.689> plastic<00:01:54.689> little<00:01:55.649> thing<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.520> simply

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
a small plastic little thing that simply

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.560 
a small plastic little thing that simply
slides<00:01:57.240> right<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.659> here<00:01:59.030> right<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.060> top<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
slides right in here right on top of the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.010 
slides right in here right on top of the
rubber<00:02:00.750> pad<00:02:01.100> facing<00:02:02.100> up<00:02:02.479> once<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.899> in

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
rubber pad facing up once you get it in

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.230 
rubber pad facing up once you get it in
properly<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:05.189> simply<00:02:05.579> put<00:02:05.759> your<00:02:05.790> circuit

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
properly you simply put your circuit

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.870 
properly you simply put your circuit
board<00:02:06.360> back<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.940> close<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.119> back<00:02:09.209> up

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
board back in and close it back up

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.430 
board back in and close it back up
so<00:02:11.880> three<00:02:12.150> things<00:02:12.360> make<00:02:12.810> sure<00:02:12.840> your<00:02:13.080> battery

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
so three things make sure your battery

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.230 
so three things make sure your battery
is<00:02:13.530> charged<00:02:13.830> properly<00:02:14.370> make<00:02:14.940> sure<00:02:15.120> the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
is charged properly make sure the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.660 
is charged properly make sure the
battery<00:02:15.600> holder<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:16.290> input<00:02:16.740> soldered<00:02:17.580> in

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
battery holder is input soldered in

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.910 
battery holder is input soldered in
place<00:02:17.700> properly<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:19.260> put<00:02:19.440> your<00:02:19.560> keyless

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
place properly and to put your keyless

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.070 
place properly and to put your keyless
fix<00:02:20.190> pad<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:20.790> there<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.240> all<00:02:21.720> your<00:02:21.900> buttons
