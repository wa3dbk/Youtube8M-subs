00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
hood up and I don't know

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.630 
hood up and I don't know
they're<00:04:16.820> gonna<00:04:17.000> add<00:04:17.270> any<00:04:17.570> like<00:04:17.780> entrance

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
they're gonna add any like entrance

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.340 
they're gonna add any like entrance
differences<00:04:19.640> or<00:04:20.000> anything<00:04:20.350> different

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
differences or anything different

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.220 
differences or anything different
because<00:04:21.440> he<00:04:21.770> rides<00:04:22.130> his<00:04:22.310> bike<00:04:22.580> in<00:04:23.420> punch-out

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
because he rides his bike in punch-out

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.530 
because he rides his bike in punch-out
so<00:04:24.980> when<00:04:25.460> he's<00:04:25.580> wearing<00:04:25.820> that<00:04:25.880> outfit<00:04:26.210> so<00:04:26.510> I

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
so when he's wearing that outfit so I

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.730 
so when he's wearing that outfit so I
don't<00:04:26.780> know<00:04:26.870> if<00:04:26.960> they're<00:04:27.080> gonna<00:04:27.200> change<00:04:27.530> that

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
don't know if they're gonna change that

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.380 
don't know if they're gonna change that
out<00:04:27.920> there<00:04:28.070> or<00:04:28.130> anything<00:04:28.310> but<00:04:28.640> I<00:04:28.700> doubt<00:04:28.850> it

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
out there or anything but I doubt it

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.180 
out there or anything but I doubt it
because<00:04:29.840> it<00:04:29.990> requires<00:04:30.290> more<00:04:30.590> memory<00:04:30.980> and

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
because it requires more memory and

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.370 
because it requires more memory and
stuff<00:04:31.610> like<00:04:31.730> that<00:04:31.940> but<00:04:32.180> we<00:04:32.570> you<00:04:32.720> has<00:04:33.020> plenty<00:04:33.350> of

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
stuff like that but we you has plenty of

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.530 
stuff like that but we you has plenty of
memory<00:04:33.770> to<00:04:34.010> support<00:04:34.970> something<00:04:35.180> like<00:04:35.300> this

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
memory to support something like this

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.330 
memory to support something like this
but<00:04:35.780> I<00:04:35.840> don't<00:04:35.960> know<00:04:36.020> by<00:04:36.140> the<00:04:36.200> 30s<00:04:36.710> so<00:04:37.070> I'm

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
but I don't know by the 30s so I'm

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.930 
but I don't know by the 30s so I'm
worried<00:04:37.670> about<00:04:37.730> that<00:04:38.180> on<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.630> 3ds<00:04:38.930> but<00:04:39.940> I'm

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
worried about that on the 3ds but I'm

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.840 
worried about that on the 3ds but I'm
just<00:04:41.240> hoping<00:04:41.540> that<00:04:41.950> the<00:04:42.950> costumes<00:04:43.580> for<00:04:43.730> the

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
just hoping that the costumes for the

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.980 
just hoping that the costumes for the
other<00:04:44.030> characters<00:04:44.660> will<00:04:45.140> be<00:04:46.510> will<00:04:47.510> be<00:04:47.660> as<00:04:47.780> cool

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
other characters will be will be as cool

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.460 
other characters will be will be as cool
as<00:04:48.050> this<00:04:48.320> one<00:04:49.180> like<00:04:50.180> I<00:04:50.270> said<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.960> costume

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
as this one like I said the costume
