00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 now it was mistress of the night everyone was detained between them when they know 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.370
 runway opening 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.789
 it is not a rule attraction several strands of the same subject here trying 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.499
 the release of new music 

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:35.589
 to treat only one we can for everybody can have access to everything there 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.280
 dance floor opening 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.540
 how does it work most of the time 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.990
 the couple arrives at the party usually the columnist positioned in the center of the track 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.990
 of dance 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.680
 hoping that the couple had been doing complimentary public embolism that the first 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.170
 toast with parents and congratulations very well 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.290
 so giraffe couple playing a song 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.670
 they go pro goal 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.560
 arriving dumb 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.810
 in exchange for another repertoire in the second song is usually so the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.530
 first song of the couple the entrance in the hall of the holding ss we give you region 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.810
 increase very lively very noisy 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.940
 To get everyone's attention, it gets annoying. The couple got to that 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.030
 parana 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.330
 Are you going to have this one? 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.080
 the music generally a more romantic song more calm 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.799
 because it is a solemn moment the symbolic cut line 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.590
 toast with families 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.040
 have the photo that is the filming that will be talking a lot with the couple there 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.140
 on the cake if the music is too loud 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.960
 I did something better or ethics did not work so you have to be short 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.689
 a good song that everyone prefers if they are going to look for ways that everyone knows 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.950
 When you finish this 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.090
 the goal of bali na na on the dance floor usually takes even with casters 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.409
 then ceremonials take the world away 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.319
 all dressed will only put it somewhere else 'where it will be served at the end 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.929
 from the party 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.409
 Then there's the first dance party opening by the couple 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:17.329
 what happened 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.239
 the first dance the couple dance free 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.309
 thirty seconds alone the two 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.300
 right after the parents 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.019
 of the two who enter the dance 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.289
 to start agree with this 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.779
 plus 30 40 seconds between the godparents 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:35.279
 and the song ends 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:39.009
 and then followed by the opening song of the party and the dtm led to the 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:41.319
 Last 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.669
 there are couples who do not want it and there is so much evidence, 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:47.849
 generations 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.200
 when the goal is finished, the goal is to start the party 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.629
 independent of having the first of the zone first dance 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.629
 it will not only be ours will be in the guest sector 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.819
 usually acts with frank sinatra live the very famous song 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.949
 and the party starts off with everyone dancing without problems 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.500
 What's not cool is when the couple chooses a dance. 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.780
 and the guests ran over that moment that would be exclusive of the couple 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.950
 thinking that the party started when in fact the party has not started there yet 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.479
 is a runway aperture 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.099
 the host couple 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.819
 talmir who are present day honoring the families 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.330
 is the cup because parents and godparents dance 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.750
 they dance to bring an interactivity of the two families 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.959
 at this moment including the bride 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.589
 it is very common to go dancing with the father the groom with the mother 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:42.839
 then the bride with her father-in-law 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:47.819
 and the fiancé with his mother-in-law just to see that balancing interactivity 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:48.789
 rich families 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.180
 until the moment your character registers 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.369
 the two families together 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:56.029
 I marked this is very important 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:58.619
 after we finished the first dance dance 

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:02.339
 the day-day smart jk this hysteria you usually have 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.189
 r10 couples of godparents again more scarce and more parents 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:12.430
 patricia thomas - full teresópolis states that portugal there are about 70 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.120
 it's a good time you go with her to the end the crowded track 

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.779
 this is very important even the couple chose the song 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.050
 I give a famous song the cool romantic song that is not a song 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.909
 accelerated 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.580
 preferably calm quiet music 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.720
 one day and then that full song standing below here but more important is 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.759
 see the interactivity of families to explain this moment 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.620
 from bordeaux 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.689
 and the first dance 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.169
 This is of course the brazilian process.
