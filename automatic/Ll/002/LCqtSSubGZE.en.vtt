00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 each of us has a unique code 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.810
 their individuality 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.639
 dna code dna encrypted all 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.160
 parameters of our body through 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.280
 very complex gene combinations 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.440
 if a person damages any of the genes 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.439
 this gene is never 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.650
 being restored in every cell of ours 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.070
 There are 46 chromosomes in the body, but 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.510
 their germ cells are 23 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.960
 joining the male and female genital 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.790
 chromosome cells unite in women 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.730
 number of germ cells in the ovaries 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.890
 limited eggs are formed to 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.820
 birth and in the first three years of life 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.460
 girls 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.480
 if these cells get damaged for example 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.860
 Alcohol they have never 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.649
 being restored are not updated even 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.050
 small doses of alcohol damage the shell 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.350
 ova and penetrating inside the cell 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.989
 destroy DNA structures and you can not 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.870
 predict which egg will 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.510
 fertilized by sperm healthy 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.939
 or damaged aspect i want 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.689
 contact girls give yourself 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.439
 report that drinking alcohol in any 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.590
 forms and even the smallest doses 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:19.130
 inevitably harms your future 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.130
 to kid 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.729
 from the 60s to the 80s in our country 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.460
 number of children with physical and 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.210
 mental disabilities increased by several times 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.600
 what kind of children are revealed 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:45.119
 these are children from alcoholics I will show you 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.399
 child who is 6 years old this child 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.390
 absolutely nothing reacts no 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.179
 keeps head 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.759
 her legs they straighten handles too 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:57.360
 now baby 2 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.149
 this bucket fell and I would like to 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.539
 All viewers who saw these children 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.789
 wondered what causes alcohol on 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.890
 genetics men alcohol does not have 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.140
 less harmful effects than 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.750
 female matter is that in the testes 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.480
 men in their spermatogenesis and body and 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.420
 three to ten million 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.599
 sperm per day spermatogenesis 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.819
 hotels this is the fastest dividing fabric 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.099
 in the body and first of all on her 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.859
 acts alcohol which is 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.859
 strongest mutagen alcohol like 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.609
 most powerful mutagen has an effect 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.130
 negative 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:39.480
 for all rapidly dividing cells 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.310
 in the body spermatogenesis and body in 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.310
 testes are the fastest dividing 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.190
 tissues in our body therefore on her 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.550
 he is making the most out of his 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.040
 unfavorable 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.560
 if alcohol leaves a personâ€™s blood 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.760
 after about a day then in some 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.260
 internal organs such as the brain 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.920
 pancreas and genitals 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.470
 alcohol will hold for 25 days 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.050
 time will happen about 125 million 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.150
 sperm divisions influenced by 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.030
 alcohol almost all Share 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.810
 male sex cells will be serious 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.210
 damaged 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.010
 if regular reception occurs 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.770
 alcohol men 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.410
 then after a few years in his testes 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.130
 almost no intact floor 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.100
 mutant sperm from 25 to 27 years 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.080
 when the modern young man is already 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.260
 planning a family 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.890
 his alcohol experience is often 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.980
 10 years or more and certainly for this 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.230
 period he has already done irreparable harm 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.970
 to my 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.720
 reproductive 2 hereditary 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.750
 the apparatus 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.490
 that's what our famous said about it 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.760
 compatriot distinguished surgeon 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.550
 Academician Fedor Grigorievich angles under 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:01.220
 threat is the genetic code of nations 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.220
 un you are her main treasure
