 to see if I did not get married habit 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.090
 Spanish football is already clear 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.680
 we see the page where you lose to a 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.540

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.570
 If this saw looking looking at 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.240
 Internet 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.480

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.950
 mild they make you as a video 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.180

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.710
 I'm going to see if I can leave them 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.739
 channel the description of characters 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.570
 singer I do not have the mind to someone who 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.090
 I want to see if I divine this culero 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.620

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.400
 by in life in nothing if not not at all 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.530
 but simply shit your character if 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.640
 we can talk without interest could you 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.030
 tell 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.520
 your Argentine characters do not make you 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.280
 as he asks if he goes I think that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.440
 the forbidden ones go down and makes 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.530
 key questions that you do not realize 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.640
 a simple one could say and seven 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.640
 characters a woman 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.590
 your character will see fame video games yes 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.840
 receives in Spain not 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.039
 Spain tivo their mother tongue 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.039
 clear spanish character 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.010
 a character smokes 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.540
 probably I did not know if 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.540
 this buenos aires child 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.650
 it's mexican no 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.030
 your nap character 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:16.650
 I believe that fucking mother 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:21.019
 I do not know and if it will not be if this does not 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.019
 but it is born right neither in Chilean not 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:30.500
 his character is a professor 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.500
 I think he has a 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.270
 I think he's pleased the coach something 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.140
 well I think probably 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.140
 and put it 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.360
 he says this this his character has done 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.360
 totally or partially metal 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:58.239
 I believe that it is a nation Spain not 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.930
 the staff has some relationship with the 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.170
 sports world not to my knowledge clogged 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.230
 are 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.180
 but he is not more than 30 years old 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.030
 probably not exactly the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.220
 characters have children that I think so 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.240
 and if your airplane character is in the same 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.960
 country that you are but yes 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.450
 the character makes politics in politics 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.360
 politics the sign 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:31.640
 But I do not know 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.640
 his character is an actor not 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.680
 the characters of Uruguay good 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:46.969
 I do not know I do not know what is nation Venezuela 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.269
 virgin where it is served I think not no what 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:49.269
 I know either 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:56.150
 if that was Americans declared 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.269
 I think about what 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.269
 ah 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:07.000
 so maybe nothing good is fashionable 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.000
 the divine 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.190
 it is not 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.970
 cooking yes or no continues like this has more 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.130
 40 years old 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.640
 he is probably a religious person 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.640
 do not 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.120
 Oh no 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.030
 his television form not for nothing 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.810
 is part of the world of education not 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.820
 does not know those famous people at 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.420
 famous acquaintance is probably going to 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.460

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.260
 European I did not already tell you I do not do this 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.260
 but with you in more than 51 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.659
 I think the street with these questions 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.860
 Well magic problems can talk to 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:55.180
 people of the opposite sex 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.180
 I think so 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.510
 but it's family not good god do not 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.240
 want to say our products 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.540

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.540

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:18.250
 dude 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.250
 the character is Colombian 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:27.900
 so if the Americas side 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:30.389
 that's why architects and leads yes 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.600
 he is not in prison because he has followed 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.600

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.880
 dv 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.600
 his person added them speaking more or 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.800
 least not for nothing and I will not say in Colombia 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.590
