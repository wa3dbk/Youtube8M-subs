tucked without any errors and that's the
biggest<00:01:16.049> shock<00:01:16.859> to<00:01:17.069> all<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.189> us<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.729> I

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
biggest shock to all of us is and I

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.730 
biggest shock to all of us is and I
personally<00:01:18.569> have<00:01:18.659> never<00:01:18.869> seen<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> software

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
personally have never seen a software

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.859 
personally have never seen a software
that<00:01:19.770> was<00:01:20.039> that<00:01:20.340> accurate<00:01:20.819> and<00:01:21.450> I've<00:01:21.539> used<00:01:21.719> at

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
that was that accurate and I've used at

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:22.849 
that was that accurate and I've used at

in radiology is the turnaround time is

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.120 
in radiology is the turnaround time is
