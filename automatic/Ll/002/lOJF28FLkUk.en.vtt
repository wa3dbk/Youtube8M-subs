think<00:00:49.159> that<00:00:49.280> this<00:00:49.430> is<00:00:49.489> sort<00:00:49.790> of<00:00:49.909> the<00:00:50.000> test<00:00:50.269> to

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
think that this is sort of the test to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.109 
think that this is sort of the test to
see<00:00:50.600> if<00:00:50.629> it'll<00:00:51.170> happen<00:00:51.440> for<00:00:51.830> Packer<00:00:52.580> it's

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:53.119 
see if it'll happen for Packer it's

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.490 
see if it'll happen for Packer it's
always<00:00:53.299> been<00:00:53.540> about<00:00:53.570> getting<00:00:54.019> local<00:00:54.199> youth
