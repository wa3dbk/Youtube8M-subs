00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.040 
receive the Galaxy Note 4 out of the box
I<00:00:19.740> think<00:00:20.009> this<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.369> probably<00:00:20.700> going<00:00:21.599> to<00:00:21.720> be<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
I think this is probably going to be the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.769 
I think this is probably going to be the
number<00:00:22.439> one<00:00:22.470> tip<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.009> can<00:00:23.040> suggest<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:24.419> much

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
number one tip I can suggest and as much

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.830 
number one tip I can suggest and as much
as<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.110> like<00:00:25.500> Flipboard<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.509> don't<00:00:27.509> think<00:00:27.750> it

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
as I like Flipboard I don't think it

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.159 
as I like Flipboard I don't think it
needs<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.140> be<00:00:28.259> part<00:00:28.649> of<00:00:28.890> our<00:00:29.309> launcher<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.300> I

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
needs to be part of our launcher and I

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.260 
needs to be part of our launcher and I
had<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.559> hardest<00:00:31.890> time<00:00:32.009> trying<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.579> find<00:00:33.000> out

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
had the hardest time trying to find out

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.910 
had the hardest time trying to find out
how<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.540> get<00:00:33.719> rid<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.260> thing<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.739> it's

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
how to get rid of that thing and it's

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.220 
how to get rid of that thing and it's
actually<00:00:35.070> more<00:00:35.550> simple<00:00:35.910> than<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.120> think<00:00:36.329> so

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
actually more simple than you think so

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.410 
actually more simple than you think so
what<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.680> want<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.309> want<00:00:38.339> to<00:00:38.609> just<00:00:38.730> endlessly

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
flip through and you can do that just

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.900 
flip through and you can do that just
find<00:00:41.940> some<00:00:42.269> empty<00:00:42.750> space<00:00:43.039> long<00:00:44.039> tap<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.519> it<00:00:44.550> and

find some empty space long tap on it and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.610 
find some empty space long tap on it and
on<00:00:45.089> the<00:00:45.120> bottom<00:00:45.539> right<00:00:45.660> hand<00:00:45.719> corner<00:00:46.019> there<00:00:46.589> is

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
this is my number one tip that i can

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.670 
this is my number one tip that i can
give<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.180> guys<00:01:21.480> is<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.960> disable<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
give you guys is to disable the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.780 
give you guys is to disable the
Flipboard<00:01:23.160> because<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.850> gain<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.300> lot<00:01:24.870> more

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
Flipboard because you do gain a lot more

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
Flipboard because you do gain a lot more
functionality<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.060> by<00:01:27.180> being<00:01:27.450> able<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
functionality just by being able to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.930 
functionality just by being able to
scroll<00:01:28.140> through<00:01:28.200> freely<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.160> also<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.640> frees

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
scroll through freely and also it frees

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.050 
scroll through freely and also it frees
up<00:01:30.120> some<00:01:30.300> memory<00:01:30.690> and<00:01:31.070> it<00:01:32.070> doesn't<00:01:32.430> really<00:01:32.610> add

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
up some memory and it doesn't really add

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.320 
up some memory and it doesn't really add
in<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.630> dorkiness<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.830> your<00:01:35.010> home<00:01:35.220> screen<00:01:35.430> so

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
in your dorkiness to your home screen so

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.660
