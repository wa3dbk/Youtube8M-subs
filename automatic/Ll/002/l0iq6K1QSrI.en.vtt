skydiving<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.130> certain<00:01:23.399> activity<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.060> do

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
skydiving is a certain activity you do

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.660 
skydiving is a certain activity you do
consciously<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.470> not<00:01:25.649> just<00:01:25.890> going<00:01:26.070> from<00:01:26.369> A

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
consciously it's not just going from A

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.179 
consciously it's not just going from A
to<00:01:26.790> B<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.450> not<00:01:28.049> really<00:01:28.350> thinking<00:01:28.710> about<00:01:28.799> it

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
to B and not really thinking about it

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.170 
to B and not really thinking about it
and<00:01:29.280> definitely<00:01:30.320> for<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> BMW<00:01:31.560> driver<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.520> I'm

Jerry you're doing it you just do it

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.080 
Jerry you're doing it you just do it
conscious<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.619> want<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.039> do<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.939> way

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
conscious that you want to do it the way

as well be inducted is more from an

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.010 
as well be inducted is more from an
engineering<00:01:41.340> background<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.810> sort<00:01:42.990> of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
engineering background that sort of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.840 
engineering background that sort of
based<00:01:43.320> around<00:01:43.619> engineering<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.429> engines

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
based around engineering in the engines

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.719 
based around engineering in the engines
Cecotto<00:01:45.750> has<00:01:45.929> that<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.890> history<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.490> based

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
Cecotto has that that history is based

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.690 
Cecotto has that that history is based
on<00:01:48.229> airplane<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.470> aeronautical<00:01:50.189> engineers

on airplane on aeronautical engineers

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.730 
on airplane on aeronautical engineers
yeah<00:01:51.119> anything<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.320> see<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.530> in

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
yeah anything to see it you see it in

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.469 
yeah anything to see it you see it in
the<00:01:52.860> design<00:01:53.159> what<00:01:53.670> are<00:01:53.819> the<00:01:53.909> things<00:01:54.179> that

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the design what are the things that

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.510 
the design what are the things that
typically<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.959> I<00:01:55.110> got<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.580> spontaneously<00:01:56.580> or

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
typically is I got to spontaneously or

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.199 
typically is I got to spontaneously or
come<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.670> with<00:01:59.880> an<00:02:00.119> unusual<00:02:00.209> solution<00:02:01.020> without

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
come up with an unusual solution without

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:07.240 
come up with an unusual solution without
fear<00:02:03.209> then<00:02:03.840> somehow<00:02:04.170> turn<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.860> turn<00:02:05.789> it<00:02:05.850> into

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
fear then somehow turn it turn it into

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.289 
fear then somehow turn it turn it into
sort<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.459> aesthetic<00:02:08.759> our<00:02:09.060> body<00:02:09.299> that<00:02:09.720> probably

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
sort of aesthetic our body that probably

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.720 
sort of aesthetic our body that probably
also<00:02:12.299> as<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.569> mentioned<00:02:12.780> with<00:02:13.290> some

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
also as you mentioned with some

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.140 
also as you mentioned with some
speciality<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.880> forgotten<00:02:16.910> proportion<00:02:17.910> is

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
speciality of forgotten proportion is

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.020 
speciality of forgotten proportion is
you<00:02:19.019> know<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.140> think<00:02:19.349> what<00:02:19.739> makes<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.190> very<00:02:20.700> very

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
you know I think what makes it very very

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.289 
you know I think what makes it very very
much<00:02:21.150> BMW<00:02:22.010> because<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.519> really<00:02:24.090> short

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
much BMW because it is this really short

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.870 
much BMW because it is this really short
front<00:02:24.599> overhangs<00:02:25.260> very<00:02:25.650> long<00:02:25.950> hood

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
front overhangs very long hood

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.310 
front overhangs very long hood
shinji<00:02:27.630> energy<00:02:28.110> totally<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:28.860> over<00:02:29.040> here<00:02:29.250> yea

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
shinji energy totally and over here yea

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.920 
shinji energy totally and over here yea
orsa<00:02:31.320> big<00:02:31.650> wheels<00:02:32.010> right<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.820> know<00:02:32.940> right<00:02:33.270> on

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
orsa big wheels right you know right on

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.630 
orsa big wheels right you know right on
the<00:02:34.080> edges<00:02:34.460> it's<00:02:35.460> very<00:02:35.760> compact<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:38.220> has<00:02:38.250> light

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
the edges it's very compact it has light

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.010 
the edges it's very compact it has light
so<00:02:38.970> my<00:02:39.300> arrogance<00:02:39.750> yeah<00:02:40.410> yeah<00:02:41.100> yeah<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:42.450> we<00:02:42.690> put

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
so my arrogance yeah yeah yeah if we put

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.760 
so my arrogance yeah yeah yeah if we put
up<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.410> price<00:02:43.800> on<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.490> got<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.790> nicest<00:02:45.770> BMW

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
up a price on so I got the nicest BMW

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.880 
up a price on so I got the nicest BMW
the<00:02:47.180> that<00:02:48.180> sort<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.570> one<00:02:48.840> plus<00:02:49.140> wonders<00:02:49.620> it

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
the that sort of one plus wonders it

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.980 
the that sort of one plus wonders it
makes<00:02:50.100> more<00:02:50.310> than<00:02:50.370> two<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.240> I<00:02:51.480> think<00:02:51.510> that's

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
makes more than two and I think that's

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.350 
makes more than two and I think that's
that's<00:02:52.320> what<00:02:52.530> happened<00:02:52.860> with<00:02:53.010> us<00:02:53.130> really<00:02:53.880> you

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
that's what happened with us really you

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.810 
that's what happened with us really you
know<00:02:54.450> behind<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.110> metal<00:02:55.380> skin<00:02:55.890> if<00:02:56.130> someone

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
know behind the metal skin if someone

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.260 
know behind the metal skin if someone
can<00:02:57.000> feel<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.630> passion<00:02:58.040> that<00:02:59.040> life<00:02:59.580> that<00:03:00.090> was

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
can feel the passion that life that was

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.930 
can feel the passion that life that was
