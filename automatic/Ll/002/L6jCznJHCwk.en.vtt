up<00:00:45.210> over<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> last<00:00:45.780> few<00:00:46.079> years<00:00:46.140> some<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.680> them

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
up over the last few years some of them

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.770 
up over the last few years some of them
are<00:00:46.980> now<00:00:47.129> rivaling<00:00:48.260> major<00:00:49.520> media<00:00:50.780> internet

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
are now rivaling major media internet

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.850 
are now rivaling major media internet
sites<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> New<00:00:52.620> York<00:00:52.829> Times<00:00:52.920> so

sites like the New York Times so

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.560 
sites like the New York Times so
vlogging<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.010> also<00:00:56.160> probably<00:00:56.550> go<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.030> far

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
vlogging can also probably go that far

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.529 
vlogging can also probably go that far
over<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.079> next<00:00:58.350> few<00:00:58.530> years<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.579> in<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.210> way<00:01:00.390> it

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
over the next few years so in a way it

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.689 
over the next few years so in a way it
could<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> way<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.170> bypassing<00:01:01.620> big<00:01:02.280> media

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
could be a way of bypassing big media

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.420 
could be a way of bypassing big media
organizations<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.080> still<00:01:04.530> getting<00:01:05.189> what<00:01:05.339> you

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
organizations and still getting what you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
that's certainly my intention the the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.960 
that's certainly my intention the the
main<00:01:12.840> benefit<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.760> can

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
main benefit of it is is that you can

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.080 
main benefit of it is is that you can
cater<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.570> niche<00:01:16.520> audiences<00:01:17.520> much<00:01:17.790> more

is happening with other sites as well

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.350 
is happening with other sites as well
and<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.920> just<00:02:35.310> makes<00:02:35.490> it<00:02:35.640> easier<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.060> spread

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360
