00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 a standard elevator of a building of 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.980
 average height can withstand a 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.759
 maximum of one and a half tonnes assuming 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.980
 that an adult weighs an average of 160 pounds 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.359
 what is the maximum number of adults 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.279
 could use the lift safely 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.680
 What we have to do is have a weight 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.109
 maximum that the elevator could sustain 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.109
 in terms of pounds and talking about what 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.449
 the adults are that they gave us the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.149
 maximum weight in terms of tonnes and 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.399
 say it's a half ton 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.680
 it is always easier to deal with fractions 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.290
 than mixed numbers then 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.980
 let's write as an improper fraction 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.800
 a ton and a half is the same here 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.649
 Well a ton is two halves and you? 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.390
 adds another half that is three 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.520
 halves has three half tons or 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.940
 another way of thinking is that there are two 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.239
 times one is two plus one and three 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.119
 the maximum capacity is 36 tonnes 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.860
 Let's see how many pounds you can 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.310
 To do this, we have to know 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.659
 two thousand pounds per tonne left 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.450
 write it up here 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.720
 we know that's two thousand pounds per 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.619
 the problem does not give this 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.810
 information 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.850
 This is something I knew from experiences. 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.270
 it is generally good to know that a 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.210
 ton is two thousand pounds I'm going to write 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.299
 this here now how we convert these 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.460
 three-half tons in pounds is better 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.040
 multiply this for something and the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.470
 units we multiply want 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.350
 the tons to cancel we go 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.990
 want to have tons in the denominators 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.950
 these tons are canceled with these 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.470
 tons 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.840
 the pounds in the numerator is exactly the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.180
 we have written above there are two 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.299
 thousand pounds for each ton or can only 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.450
 talking two thousand pounds a ton gives 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.420
 to put one here but it does not change 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.820
 expression now multiply 36 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.700
 tons two thousand pounds per 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.009
 tonnes are canceled 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.950
 This is the exact point of multiplying this. 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.940
 therefore effective three means 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.420
 times 2000 and the only unit is pounds 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.560
 if you do it that way you will never be 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.150
 confused will know which are the units 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.800
 canceled and you get the right units 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.319
 but if you think about it head-on too 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.540
 should make sense if there are two thousand 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.380
 pounds per ton and has a ton 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.300
 and half should multiply 6 times 2000 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.030
 to get the number of pounds it does 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.700
 sense and we know it once in 6 times 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.970
 2000 is 3 thousand but we have to know 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.830
 this here what is three half times 2000 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.380
 I just give the answer, it's actually 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.239
 I need to simplify this here will be three 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.040
 times in 2000 about two pounds gives 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.880
 divide the numerator and a denominator by 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:07.110
 two and that becomes a thousand and that one then 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.069
 is three times a thousand pounds or equal to three thousand 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.620
 pounds 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.880
 So far we have discovered the capacity 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.579
 elevator and this supports one and 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.100
 one and 6 tons which is exactly the 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.500
 same thing as 3,000 pounds 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.109
 now we must find out if 3,000 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.579
 pounds is the average of how much 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:31.560
 adults of 160 pounds or as many as 160 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.900
 people would need for the 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.720
 weigh a total of Â£ 3,000 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.910
 we can divide by 160 if you want 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.739
 make sure units work 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.470
 remember if we want our answer 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.389
 both in terms of people and that 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.519
 pounds are canceled 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.260
 We have pounds in the numerator if 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.350
 divide by pounds 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.720
 the pounds will be canceled the work has 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.519
 than being in people or maybe a person 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:03.299
 only person people same thing 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.430
 let me make grammar person can 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.920
 leave a little confused but I think 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:12.000
 Can you get a general idea now? 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:15.239
 let's write that which tells us a 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.329
 person weighs 160 pounds 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.820
 so there is one person for every 160 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.070
 If you multiply these 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.120
 two expressions the pounds will be 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.760
 canceled 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.960
 We'll only have people here. 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.509
 multiplying 3 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.850
 thousand times one over 160 but it is 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:35.819
 really picking up three thousand and dividing 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.250
 that makes sense, we have to 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:42.300
 capacity of 3 thousand each of these 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.789
 people weigh 160 pounds divided by 160 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.710
 This tells us how many people but this 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.400
 way do you know that these units are 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.919
 will be equal to 3 thousand out of 160 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.139
 people and the maximum lift capacity 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.479
 in terms of average people now 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.580
 that this is to divide the numerator and 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.979
 a denominator by 10 if we split 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:07.080
 the numerator and a denominator by 10 if 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:10.710
 makes 300 out of 16 if you divide 300 by 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.970
 two is 150 if you divide 16 by two if 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.740
 makes 8 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.110
 Let's see what else we can do now. 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.660
 here again you can divide by two 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:23.009
 let's rewrite this is the same thing 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:26.729
 that 150 out of eight people 150 can 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.139
 divide by two gives us 75 and if we make 8 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.580
 / 2 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:34.889
 this will come 4 we have 75 divided by 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:41.639
 four people let me do it then 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:46.979
 you have 75/44 cabin 7 once 1244 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:51.659
 you subtract 7 -4 3 brings down and 654 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:54.599
 fits in 35 8 times eight times 4 32 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:57.270
 subtract 5 - 2 is 3 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:59.280
 and then you have to let the comma 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.130
 right of this place 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:07.130
 Let's go home to the tenths now we can 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:12.539
 bring 10 here four cable in 37 times 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:16.919
 seven times 4 is 28 you subtract gets 2 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:19.259
 brings down another 04 fits in 20 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.650
 exactly five times five times 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:28.770
 four is 21 and ends years 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:33.120
 this expression is exactly 3 thousand / 160 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:38.070
 or 150/8 75/4 all of this is 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:41.710
 turns 18.75 people into the 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.900
 lift capacity 18.75 people 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.490
 such as the capacity of the elevator 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.870
 now they want this bad 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.880
 what is the maximum number of adults 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.040
 could safely go to the lift if they 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.230
 adults have the mean weight 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.480
 whereas you can not have three 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:58.750
 rooms of a person the maximum number of 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:01.060
 adults in the elevator is 18 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.870
 if you have more than the average weight of a 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.880
 adult 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.970
 it gets very heavy and you can have 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.970
 problems
