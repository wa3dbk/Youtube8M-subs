I<00:01:41.939> died<00:01:42.180> some<00:01:42.840> guys<00:01:43.079> snuck<00:01:43.380> up<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.649> me<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
I died some guys snuck up on me and

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.340 
I died some guys snuck up on me and
knife<00:01:44.100> me<00:01:44.369> because<00:01:45.119> there<00:01:45.329> are<00:01:45.360> two<00:01:45.930> entrances

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
knife me because there are two entrances

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.219 
knife me because there are two entrances
to<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.280> ax<00:01:47.310> roof<00:01:48.119> there's<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> ladder<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
to that ax roof there's the ladder and

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.160 
to that ax roof there's the ladder and
there's<00:01:49.740> these<00:01:49.979> crates<00:01:50.310> right<00:01:50.610> right<00:01:51.600> through

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
there's these crates right right through

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.690 
there's these crates right right through
that<00:01:52.320> wall<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.710> was<00:01:52.860> looking<00:01:53.220> at<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> second

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that wall that I was looking at a second

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.940 
that wall that I was looking at a second
ago<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.659> both<00:01:54.960> ways<00:01:55.200> work<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.649> would<00:01:55.829> suggest

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
ago so both ways work I would suggest

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.800 
ago so both ways work I would suggest
you<00:01:56.189> use<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.340> ladder<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:57.060> because<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.509> crates

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
you use a ladder just because the crates

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.450 
you use a ladder just because the crates
are<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.960> little<00:01:58.170> more<00:01:58.350> out<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.829> open<00:01:59.130> and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
are a little more out in the open and

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.830 
are a little more out in the open and
you're<00:01:59.759> probably<00:01:59.850> gonna<00:02:00.060> get<00:02:00.210> shot<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.630> do

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
you're probably gonna get shot if you do

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.499 
you're probably gonna get shot if you do
that<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:02.369> see<00:02:02.549> now<00:02:02.790> I'm<00:02:03.000> using<00:02:03.329> a

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
that so as you see now I'm using a

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.179 
that so as you see now I'm using a
different<00:02:03.659> strategy<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.229> obtain<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.860> seven

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
different strategy to obtain the seven

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.999 
different strategy to obtain the seven
kill<00:02:05.460> streak<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:05.909> my<00:02:06.030> nuke<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:07.350> am<00:02:07.649> using

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
kill streak for my nuke and I am using

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.660 
kill streak for my nuke and I am using
the<00:02:08.399> bottom<00:02:08.819> floor<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.599> roof<00:02:09.929> area<00:02:10.289> and

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
the bottom floor of this roof area and

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.260 
the bottom floor of this roof area and
you<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> lot<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.120> cover<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.450> here<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.840> you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
you have a lot of cover in here and you

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.060 
you have a lot of cover in here and you
have<00:02:13.480> as<00:02:13.630> good<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.230> vantage<00:02:14.440> point<00:02:14.590> as<00:02:14.950> you

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
have as good of a vantage point as you

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.160 
have as good of a vantage point as you
do<00:02:15.220> with<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.520> roof<00:02:15.910> because<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.630> cannot<00:02:16.870> see

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
do with the roof because you cannot see

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
do with the roof because you cannot see
see<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.740> you<00:02:17.920> cannot<00:02:18.220> see<00:02:18.870> well<00:02:20.070> can't<00:02:21.070> see

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
see and you cannot see well can't see

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.830 
see and you cannot see well can't see
see<00:02:21.340> that's<00:02:21.490> pretty<00:02:21.580> much<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.880> but<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.480> do<00:02:22.660> see

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
see that's pretty much it but you do see

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.360 
see that's pretty much it but you do see
the<00:02:22.990> library<00:02:23.440> which<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:23.770> another<00:02:24.010> good<00:02:24.190> area

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
the library which is another good area

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.620 
the library which is another good area
and<00:02:24.760> there's<00:02:25.240> some<00:02:25.390> really<00:02:25.540> good

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
and there's some really good

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.330 
and there's some really good
headglitching<00:02:26.050> spots<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.590> do<00:02:26.710> not<00:02:26.890> see<00:02:27.100> me<00:02:27.190> to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
headglitching spots you do not see me to

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.880 
headglitching spots you do not see me to
use<00:02:27.430> them<00:02:27.670> or<00:02:27.910> do<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:28.930> don't<00:02:29.050> know<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.440> think

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
use them or do you I don't know I think

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.340 
use them or do you I don't know I think
I<00:02:29.980> might<00:02:30.160> use<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.370> once<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:30.940> while<00:02:31.120> but<00:02:31.420> the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
I might use it once in a while but the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.900 
I might use it once in a while but the
thing<00:02:32.710> I<00:02:32.800> really<00:02:33.190> like<00:02:33.340> about<00:02:33.370> this<00:02:33.670> strategy

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
thing I really like about this strategy

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.160 
thing I really like about this strategy
is<00:02:34.380> sometimes<00:02:35.380> if<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.680> enemies<00:02:35.950> have<00:02:36.100> C<00:02:36.340> or<00:02:36.580> B

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
is sometimes if the enemies have C or B

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.230 
is sometimes if the enemies have C or B
they<00:02:38.170> will<00:02:38.350> spawn<00:02:38.710> right<00:02:39.670> near<00:02:40.090> the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
they will spawn right near the

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.480 
they will spawn right near the
escalators<00:02:40.870> where<00:02:41.410> I<00:02:41.440> was<00:02:41.620> just<00:02:41.860> where<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.280> just

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
escalators where I was just where I just

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.670 
escalators where I was just where I just
got<00:02:42.610> those<00:02:42.850> two<00:02:43.120> kills<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.900> will<00:02:44.050> spawn<00:02:44.320> right

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
got those two kills it will spawn right

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.670 
got those two kills it will spawn right
there<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.190> they<00:02:45.670> never<00:02:46.470> realized<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:47.590> you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
there and they never realized that you

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.620 
there and they never realized that you
can<00:02:47.890> see<00:02:48.070> out<00:02:48.190> those<00:02:48.370> windows<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.730> there<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.240> if

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
can see out those windows to there so if

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.420 
can see out those windows to there so if
you<00:02:49.720> just<00:02:49.900> say<00:02:50.110> say<00:02:50.530> along<00:02:50.890> those<00:02:51.010> windows<00:02:51.400> and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
you just say say along those windows and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.400 
you just say say along those windows and
shoot<00:02:51.940> into<00:02:52.180> there<00:02:52.360> you're<00:02:52.960> gonna<00:02:53.050> get<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.290> lot

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
shoot into there you're gonna get a lot

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.780 
shoot into there you're gonna get a lot
of<00:02:53.440> kills<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.830> believe<00:02:54.280> I've<00:02:54.400> done<00:02:54.550> that<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.730> few

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
of kills I believe I've done that a few

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.510 
of kills I believe I've done that a few
times<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.330> some<00:02:55.570> older<00:02:55.900> videos<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.560> think<00:02:57.430> I

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
times and some older videos I think I

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.490 
times and some older videos I think I
also<00:02:57.670> did<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.030> in<00:02:58.150> my<00:02:58.180> first<00:02:58.600> ever<00:02:58.780> my<00:02:59.230> first

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
also did that in my first ever my first

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.750 
also did that in my first ever my first
and<00:02:59.710> my<00:02:59.830> last<00:03:00.240> 100<00:03:01.240> kill<00:03:01.420> game<00:03:01.600> in<00:03:01.750> mono<00:03:01.930> or<00:03:02.110> 4-2

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
and my last 100 kill game in mono or 4-2

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.570 
and my last 100 kill game in mono or 4-2
with<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:04.060> bleeding<00:03:04.600> scar-h<00:03:05.190> same<00:03:06.190> camera<00:03:06.520> I'm

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
with the bleeding scar-h same camera I'm

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.280 
with the bleeding scar-h same camera I'm
using<00:03:06.640> now<00:03:06.940> actually<00:03:07.360> pretty<00:03:07.570> cool<00:03:07.690> but

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
using now actually pretty cool but

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.170 
using now actually pretty cool but
that's<00:03:08.920> not<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.250> point<00:03:09.430> as<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:09.790> guys<00:03:09.940> can<00:03:10.120> see

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
that's not the point as you guys can see

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.850 
that's not the point as you guys can see
basically<00:03:10.780> just<00:03:10.930> playing<00:03:11.110> defensive<00:03:11.590> waiting

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
basically just playing defensive waiting

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.770 
basically just playing defensive waiting
for<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.070> chopper<00:03:12.340> gunner<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.790> come<00:03:12.970> like<00:03:13.630> you

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
for the chopper gunner to come like you

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.300 
for the chopper gunner to come like you
do<00:03:13.930> with<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.110> classic<00:03:14.530> new<00:03:14.740> guys<00:03:15.010> I

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
do with the classic new guys I

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.460 
do with the classic new guys I
understand<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:16.150> campy<00:03:16.600> I'll<00:03:17.050> say<00:03:17.230> again

probably wouldn't do this if I was going
for<00:03:27.850> like<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.390> normal<00:03:29.320> gameplay<00:03:29.560> I'm<00:03:29.920> just

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
for like a normal gameplay I'm just

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.240 
for like a normal gameplay I'm just
going<00:03:30.340> for<00:03:30.600> strategy<00:03:31.600> videos<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.200> as<00:03:32.470> you<00:03:33.070> see

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
going for strategy videos so as you see

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.710 
going for strategy videos so as you see
the<00:03:33.430> chopper<00:03:33.610> gunner<00:03:33.910> someone<00:03:34.270> brick<00:03:34.480> for

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
the chopper gunner someone brick for

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.480 
the chopper gunner someone brick for
whatever<00:03:35.230> reason<00:03:35.680> brought<00:03:35.920> being<00:03:36.160> over<00:03:36.370> there

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
whatever reason brought being over there

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.070

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
from doing this strategy because people

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.480 
from doing this strategy because people
usually<00:05:11.110> line<00:05:11.500> up<00:05:11.650> down<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:11.919> hallway<00:05:12.220> trying

to neut you or spray guns or snipe so

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.070 
to neut you or spray guns or snipe so
that's<00:05:17.590> pretty<00:05:17.830> much<00:05:18.040> that<00:05:18.250> you<00:05:18.460> know<00:05:19.080> again

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
that's pretty much that you know again

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
my friend has an ac-130 now so I'm just

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.440 
my friend has an ac-130 now so I'm just
got<00:05:22.330> a<00:05:22.360> plane<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:23.050> little<00:05:23.740> safe<00:05:23.980> you<00:05:24.250> know<00:05:24.450> don't

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
got a plane a little safe you know don't

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.060 
got a plane a little safe you know don't
you<00:05:25.690> want<00:05:25.840> to<00:05:25.930> be<00:05:25.990> careful<00:05:26.200> when<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.890> high

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
you want to be careful when the high

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.980 
you want to be careful when the high
streets<00:05:27.400> are<00:05:27.520> up<00:05:27.610> in<00:05:27.730> the<00:05:27.760> air<00:05:27.850> because<00:05:28.690> the

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
streets are up in the air because the

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.380 
streets are up in the air because the
spawns<00:05:29.320> can<00:05:29.620> change<00:05:29.919> so<00:05:30.310> you<00:05:30.880> see<00:05:31.030> me<00:05:31.180> cover

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
spawns can change so you see me cover

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:37.590 
spawns can change so you see me cover
both<00:05:31.750> sides<00:05:32.050> of<00:05:32.229> me<00:05:34.620> mm-hmm<00:05:36.150> yep<00:05:37.150> this<00:05:37.360> is<00:05:37.419> why

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
both sides of me mm-hmm yep this is why

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.600 
both sides of me mm-hmm yep this is why
I<00:05:37.660> don't<00:05:37.930> really<00:05:38.140> like<00:05:38.380> doing<00:05:38.610> gameplay

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
talk about anything else and like I

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.659 
talk about anything else and like I
can't<00:05:46.780> just<00:05:47.020> go<00:05:47.350> on<00:05:47.380> to<00:05:47.740> another<00:05:47.979> topic<00:05:48.310> right

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
now cuz that would just be like

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.800 
now cuz that would just be like
completely<00:05:50.830> off<00:05:51.100> this<00:05:51.340> whole<00:05:51.550> video<00:05:51.880> but<00:05:52.750> uh

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.070 
saying don't listen to this but the
thing<00:06:40.220> is<00:06:40.300> that<00:06:41.300> I<00:06:41.540> think<00:06:41.630> you<00:06:41.870> guys<00:06:42.020> should

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
thing is that I think you guys should

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.860 
thing is that I think you guys should
realize<00:06:42.620> is<00:06:42.860> that<00:06:43.400> the<00:06:43.610> whole<00:06:43.790> point<00:06:44.090> of<00:06:44.360> a

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
realize is that the whole point of a

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.680 
realize is that the whole point of a
growing<00:06:45.410> channel<00:06:45.980> is<00:06:46.670> that<00:06:46.940> you<00:06:47.240> have<00:06:47.540> to

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
growing channel is that you have to

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.510 
growing channel is that you have to
listen<00:06:47.960> to<00:06:47.990> those<00:06:48.200> comments<00:06:48.440> so<00:06:49.190> that<00:06:49.220> the

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
listen to those comments so that the

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.310 
listen to those comments so that the
comment<00:06:49.940> so<00:06:50.450> that<00:06:50.600> the<00:06:50.720> channel<00:06:51.050> can<00:06:51.170> get

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320 
comment so that the channel can get

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.830 
comment so that the channel can get
better<00:06:51.470> like<00:06:52.070> now<00:06:52.310> if<00:06:52.850> I<00:06:53.210> if<00:06:53.510> I'm<00:06:53.630> thinking

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
better like now if I if I'm thinking

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.330 
better like now if I if I'm thinking
about<00:06:54.170> I'll<00:06:54.290> blow<00:06:54.410> during<00:06:54.530> a<00:06:54.620> live<00:06:54.770> commentary

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
about I'll blow during a live commentary

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.580 
about I'll blow during a live commentary
or<00:06:55.580> regular<00:06:56.330> commentary<00:06:56.720> I'm<00:06:57.170> probably<00:06:57.470> just

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 
or regular commentary I'm probably just

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.080 
or regular commentary I'm probably just
gonna<00:06:57.770> go<00:06:57.890> with<00:06:58.460> the<00:06:58.550> regular<00:06:58.790> calm<00:06:58.940> tear

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090 
gonna go with the regular calm tear

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.100 
gonna go with the regular calm tear
because<00:06:59.240> I<00:06:59.300> know<00:06:59.360> that<00:06:59.570> people<00:06:59.840> like<00:06:59.960> that

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
because I know that people like that

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.960 
because I know that people like that
better<00:07:00.320> and<00:07:00.620> I<00:07:01.010> also<00:07:01.160> like<00:07:01.400> to<00:07:01.520> do<00:07:01.640> that<00:07:01.760> better

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970 
better and I also like to do that better

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.250 
better and I also like to do that better
but<00:07:02.210> it's<00:07:02.300> a<00:07:02.390> lot<00:07:02.540> easier<00:07:02.570> to<00:07:02.840> do<00:07:03.020> the<00:07:03.170> live

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.260 
but it's a lot easier to do the live

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.440 
but it's a lot easier to do the live
commentary<00:07:03.830> and<00:07:04.070> sometimes<00:07:04.730> I<00:07:04.850> just<00:07:04.910> can't<00:07:05.270> do

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450 
commentary and sometimes I just can't do

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.480 
commentary and sometimes I just can't do
the<00:07:05.720> normal<00:07:06.560> commentary<00:07:06.950> because<00:07:07.190> like<00:07:07.370> I

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
the normal commentary because like I

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.880 
the normal commentary because like I
have<00:07:07.610> people<00:07:07.970> on<00:07:08.030> my<00:07:08.180> house<00:07:08.300> and<00:07:08.570> I<00:07:09.560> don't<00:07:09.650> want

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:09.890 
have people on my house and I don't want

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.620

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630
