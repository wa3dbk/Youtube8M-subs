00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.030
 yes hello and welcome to thales 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.560
 studio together until I want you 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:21.320
 Today some models show ideas 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.009
 by the fraction of the resistance 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.650
 against it a post apocalyptic science 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:31.999
 fiction skirmish tabletop i believe 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:37.940
 France and we have this here 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:40.490
 starterset with 123456 figures and still 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.890
 a small supplement for the tabletop 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.630
 Insider painted the tabletop 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.000
 installer does not know this is a 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.190
 magazine around table top games that is 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.710
 quite normal in the magazine shop too 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.390
 It would be very recommendable to buy 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.470
 I really do not know yet 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.820
 Just put the link in the 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.580
 description of the video 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.360
 then you can look at that and 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.079
 What is a highly recommended 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.939
 purchase was such an issue of 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.250
 tabletop insider has commissioned us for 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.600
 a game report these figures here 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.659
 to finish those are all 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.630
 completely painted in hero quality and yes 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.010
 as always, yes again with one 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.479
 live a little extra on the part of the 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.500
 artist because you like the models very much 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.600
 have liked it 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.120
 Among other things, we also have this here 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.070
 limited model that I would 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.159
 Say yes as a child the 80s is looking 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.159
 like number five but i'm old that 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:40.250
 Nobody probably knows film anymore 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:41.870
 looks rather like willi very much 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.850
 nice as here the housing gets 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.630
 then has this significant color over 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.310
 these oil stains flake off small ones 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.290
 traces of use so as well as easy in 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.380
 small construction site robot or similar 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.180
 This looks very much synonymous to this 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.060
 beautiful greenish lights and this one 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.340
 little part of teddy or water around at that time 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.659
 hanging around it is a robot 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.590
 with no question 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.500
 yes otherwise he will also vips the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.810
 light effects very nicely done like 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.549
 you look at this little robot here 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:21.400
 in front of the point to these warning beacons 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:25.840
 everything freehand also very expensive 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.819
 and then here a few back 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.680
 more make this thriller 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.360
 also with a great 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.810
 Light effect as you can see here on the 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.890
 shoulder sees the boy here or something 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.410
 Whatever is and is all the tenth 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.840
 big guy really expressive 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.340
 Face of the tabletop insider wanted one 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.900
 the best possible quality we 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.060
 hopefully also delivered 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.739
 yes for the game report 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.930
 to make high-resolution photos which then 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.000
 appear in the magazine 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.370
 and I'm assuming that 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.459
 just these figures here on the photos 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.140
 will do quite well artist has too 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.349
 the orange was not that easy 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.569
 painting is done very well 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.709
 Orange is not the most thankful 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.560
 you have to have a bit of color there 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.910
 trick and yes exactly the tabletop 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.269
 insider still wanted us to follow suit 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.980
 possibility based on the template 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.840
 here on the packaging and I think 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.239
 the artist has that very well 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.500
 I could do it and partly 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.280
 say exceeded 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.639
 I like the green light effects 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.639
 significantly better 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.099
 yes man to the bumper pictures you guys 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.140
 but I could see you 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.730
 Simply procured by the 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.189
 current edition of the tabletop insider 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.629
 game report in it is that would have if 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.360
 I would watch the video later 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.010
 believe the issues will be 9 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.470
 look at you see the miniatures 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.480
 Look at the game report on them 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.280
 the really nice little script 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.349
 system with an interesting set of rules 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.870
 and it is worth it to all cases there times 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:04:01.950
 to look a little over the edge of the plate 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.950
 in this sense until then and Paul II
