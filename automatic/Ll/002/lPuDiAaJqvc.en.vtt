00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.330
 current look will happen here 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:16.320
 we and you we opened it and my crack 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:22.080
 closed means or vice versa means that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:25.529
 I want to say 351 helmet of such a protective 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:30.539
 no sunscreen means that 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.170
 I want to say about this glass glass itself 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.590
 cheap 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:46.140
 she is very soft in the first place soft and she 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:48.059
 because she doesn't think she is good 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.020
 ultraviolet holds when swine can and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.270
 pretty poison 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.030
 look I wore a helmet in the apartment not 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:02.760
 so now we see well leads 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:06.229
 this neckline is from my point 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:13.140
 view in the shadows of our heads we have a lot of experience 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:15.720
 but he made a very high understand ray 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.119
 if he would have been a plane at all somewhere 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.880
 and put your cool was visible 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:27.210
 through if here de armada if his 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.890
 do a little lower somehow or him so 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.600
 smaller radius this or 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.750
 Well, I wear a helmet and I see just like 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.930
 to the light of day for want this big 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.030
 brain hole about this further and means 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.789
 passes and beats new 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.100
 maybe it won't be like that and 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:53.890
 heavily when driving a motorcycle or something 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.890
 well, I didn't like it 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.009
 I think of course those glasses will be more 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.329
 quality but this truth is first 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.549
 impression of a helmet just today 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:12.500
 come i mean he don't look for a helmet not 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:15.880
 experienced movement but I will say so for 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.670
 our price now we constantly went on 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:24.340
 back came out with their helmet value and 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.340
 in general, I liked very, very much 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:34.760
 let's say for the next season I'm ready and 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:37.430
 Can language bold name wife all Petrovka 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.049
 we have how to become a selection from and left 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.860
 only helmets that we saved kim 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.860
 this winter 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:55.400
 Here is the conclusion : I think that all the same 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:03:00.019
 only two helmets not but worth the money 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.630
 they are not very expensive and are not spheres on the 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.739
 the amount that is not worth about 700 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:10.359
 hryvnia plus minus pretty 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.359
 qualitatively and let's say so 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:17.090
 I want to say difference with 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.420
 Chinese helmet so that by example I live in 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.359
 provinces and we have these notes stores 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.420
 where is Chinese mopeds for sale and of course 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:29.500
 chinese helmets cheap chinese helmets 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:36.139
 at the price there 200 exactly 250 hryvnias 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:37.330
 150 hryvnia so I think that of course with 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.910
 these helmets 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.220
 Cheap differences are colossal 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.090
 colossal and in quality there is already visible 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.400
 what is the helmet and 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:50.800
 how could you say so 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:54.430
 branded helmets and normal but well, 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:59.440
 worth my money I think for a start 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:05.650
 For starters, this is what you need 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:09.070
 what exactly is needed for the first trips 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.730
 first motorcycle rides first 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:16.660
 far 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:18.690
 and so on thanks for watching my 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.690
 overview 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:26.980
 as if trying to help this total video 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.200
 honestly created for everyone because 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.850
 when I was looking for a helmet I decided that you 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.600
 probably take all the same la2 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:40.120
 but he had a video on the Internet wherever 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:44.880
 Would say that reviews in Russian 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.880
 almost never was anywhere 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.620
 decided came two slam decided to create 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.870
 such a reviewer 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.260
 I originally wanted to helmet myself once more 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:05.620
 they will say such a helmet 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:08.830
 not so here it is 384 wanted 385 price 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.290
 he was dressed around 1200 1300 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.200
 hryvnia on the official website 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.600
 manufacturer has a white helmet and gloss 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.440
 exactly i wanted white gloss because u 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:24.490
 me maxiskuter suzuki skyway 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:27.400
 and n400 here and it is white and I imagine 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:32.160
 I wanted a white helmet, so I initially 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:36.630
 wanted 385 308 5th white 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:41.800
 presence I have never found so he took 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:43.960
 384 wife wife also did not want some 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.250
 female beautiful your daddies she 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.650
 I take said I want 355 355 I do not know 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.020
 of course a modification but nonetheless she 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.510
 says i like to paint the helmet we 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:59.140
 picked up in size means it all the same 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:05.250
 About in size I wanted to tell by 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:11.830
 size means the circumference of my head 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:16.900
 59 centimeters it fits the size 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:18.480
 does it fit or does it mean size 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:24.570
 El table 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.570
 59-60 centimeters means 59 60 cm 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:33.970
 I read somewhere in reviews or on forums 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:37.750
 what is advised to take these helmets on size 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:42.150
 more but here i have 10 centimeters i 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:45.640
 I took Elka 59-16 and she sits meters 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:50.010
 fits perfectly on can't say 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:51.480
 that i need to eat a helmet more here 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:56.820
 so 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:07:01.230
 all the same maybe if you 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:04.160
 if the volume of the head is 60 helmet uniquely 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:07.080
 wear out what will be at the end 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.050
 next season I can't say that 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.810
 I think that this helmet will be at all 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:20.100
 as if very, very cool to sit 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:20.910
 big heads or on my head think 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:26.250
 what if 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:29.130
 head circumference 60 then all the same can be 

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.590
 you should try the next helmet 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:35.330
 xl size 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:40.880
 that is a week wander around x el que 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:47.300
 because at heart for growth we say 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:51.330
 Well, these are two slam from the company ls2 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:58.550
 in principle, the choice is yours 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:58.550
 Well, I think that they will like
