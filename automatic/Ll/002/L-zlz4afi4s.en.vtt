00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
I use this for my glitter eyeliner like

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.490 
I use this for my glitter eyeliner like
every<00:01:49.700> time<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:49.910> use<00:01:50.180> glitter<00:01:50.660> as<00:01:50.810> eyeliner<00:01:51.140> and

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
every time I use glitter as eyeliner and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.590 
every time I use glitter as eyeliner and
it<00:01:51.830> does<00:01:52.010> not<00:01:52.400> budge<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.090> here's<00:01:53.270> all<00:01:53.330> the

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
it does not budge so here's all the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.719 
it does not budge so here's all the
colors<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.530> they're<00:01:54.740> awesome<00:01:55.040> and<00:01:55.370> wonderful

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729

sizes<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.310> glitters<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.820> think<00:01:59.000> they<00:01:59.060> have

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
sizes of the glitters I think they have

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.910 
sizes of the glitters I think they have
lived<00:01:59.300> one<00:01:59.450> through<00:01:59.630> four<00:01:59.900> with<00:02:00.500> one<00:02:00.710> being

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
lived one through four with one being

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.590 
lived one through four with one being
the<00:02:01.100> finest<00:02:01.550> glitters<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:01.850> four<00:02:02.180> being<00:02:02.360> like

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
the finest glitters and four being like

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.810 
the finest glitters and four being like

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
have a lot of eyeshadow so I wasn't

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.460 
have a lot of eyeshadow so I wasn't
really<00:02:11.930> looking<00:02:12.080> at<00:02:12.290> that

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
I'm going on my blog because it does

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.920 
I'm going on my blog because it does
have<00:06:26.099> actual<00:06:26.610> like<00:06:26.729> still<00:06:27.000> photos<00:06:27.419> and<00:06:27.780> I

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
have actual like still photos and I

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.540 
have actual like still photos and I
think<00:06:28.169> that<00:06:28.349> the<00:06:28.500> color<00:06:28.830> accuracy<00:06:29.219> is

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
think that the color accuracy is

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.740 
think that the color accuracy is
probably<00:06:29.880> a<00:06:29.940> bit<00:06:30.060> better<00:06:30.210> in<00:06:30.360> those<00:06:30.479> photos

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
probably a bit better in those photos

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.860 
probably a bit better in those photos
