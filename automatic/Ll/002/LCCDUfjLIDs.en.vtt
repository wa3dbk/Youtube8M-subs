 the installation of aluminum frames 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.890
 who knows and bragantino against marco you 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.200
 you will need the following materials and 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:18.170
 tools level bubble level 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:24.199

 aluminum screw screw mortar 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.500
 for judgment on masonry walls 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.410
 conventional and structural preparation 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.390
 with roasted pisco tea 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.059
 we recommend also apply chapÃ©u 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.879
 rolled in the concrete slab 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.700
 rolled in the concrete span the space between 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.830
 masonry and the counter frame must be 2 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.150
 centimeters on the sides and 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.619
 top and bottom 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.439
 place a template inside the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.170
 to ensure the approved square 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.030
 the plumb line should descend on the facade 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.030
 next to the alignment of the open gap 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.500
 put wooden pants next to the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.409
 vertis on them stand against frame 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.680
 wounds with the founder open 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.780
 also use shims on the sides of the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.210
 then can check alignment 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.270
 vertical relative to contramarco 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.310
 Club wire is necessary to give the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.530
 level so that the frames are in the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.680
 same alignment in all branches of 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.520
 For this, use the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.770
 German level or level make the markings 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.920
 of the masonry level next to the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.729
 to see if it is aligned with 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.460
 follow 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.409
 check with the plumb 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.270
 aluminum ruler or square 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.840
 positioning of the counter frame with 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.069
 relation to the inner lining 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.980
 for masonry 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.959
 mortar in a hole 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.020
 counter with mortar so that 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.540
 it does not leave the position after curing 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.280
 the mortar remove the wedges 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.709
 left by wedges with mortar 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.720
 to prevent infiltration 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.120
 after the completion of the 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.100
 interior and exterior walls 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.220
 clean the counter-frame to receive the 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.170
 school apply pedantic material to the board 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.019
 between the sill and against March 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.390
 thus the connection against milestones 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.459
 will be sealed apply also 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.100
 material around the perimeter 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.200
 the flap of the flap afterwards in 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.580
 history and miter from the outside in 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.380
 of the building screwed on the 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.510
 year squad against march 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.910
 in case the internal finish with 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.519
 smoothing using the same screw 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.230
 place the shim in the 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.450
 bottom rail center 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.260
 so that the rail is level and 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.220
 does not follow the inclination of the 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:19.070
 and stalin the alizares if there are doubts 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.700
 request guidance from the ESAF team
