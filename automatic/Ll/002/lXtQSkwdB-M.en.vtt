so<00:00:02.720> here's<00:00:02.990> how<00:00:03.169> it<00:00:03.290> works<00:00:03.470> out<00:00:03.740> if<00:00:04.340> you<00:00:04.519> take

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:04.790 
so here's how it works out if you take

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.629 
so here's how it works out if you take
these<00:00:05.000> two<00:00:05.059> rivets<00:00:05.779> here<00:00:06.260> and<00:00:07.099> you<00:00:07.220> split<00:00:07.460> them

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:07.639 
these two rivets here and you split them

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:09.520 
these two rivets here and you split them
in<00:00:07.760> half<00:00:07.790> it's<00:00:08.270> about<00:00:08.510> an<00:00:08.600> inch<00:00:08.750> and<00:00:08.930> 3/4<00:00:09.500> right

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
in half it's about an inch and 3/4 right

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.790 
in half it's about an inch and 3/4 right
down<00:00:09.860> in<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:10.040> middle<00:00:10.370> and<00:00:11.140> then<00:00:12.140> you<00:00:12.170> measure

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:12.800 
down in the middle and then you measure

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.970 
down in the middle and then you measure
down<00:00:13.130> from<00:00:13.190> that<00:00:13.670> rivet<00:00:14.030> down<00:00:14.960> two<00:00:15.710> and<00:00:15.920> a

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.180 
down from that rivet down two and a
quarter<00:00:16.219> inches<00:00:16.760> mark<00:00:17.690> a<00:00:17.900> spot<00:00:18.230> from<00:00:18.920> that

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.190 
quarter inches mark a spot from that

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.950 
quarter inches mark a spot from that
rivet<00:00:19.520> straight<00:00:20.000> down<00:00:20.210> two<00:00:20.600> and<00:00:20.720> a<00:00:20.750> quarter

inches<00:00:21.440> mark<00:00:21.680> a<00:00:21.890> spot<00:00:22.190> and<00:00:22.490> then<00:00:23.360> just<00:00:23.630> take

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
inches mark a spot and then just take

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.680 
inches mark a spot and then just take
the<00:00:24.080> halfway<00:00:24.320> mark<00:00:24.590> there<00:00:25.190> and<00:00:25.430> you<00:00:26.180> come<00:00:26.480> down

from it four and a quarter and mark a
spot<00:00:30.220> those<00:00:31.220> are<00:00:31.400> the<00:00:31.460> places<00:00:31.670> you're<00:00:32.029> going

to drill your holes and I just set those

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:37.180 
to drill your holes and I just set those
lines<00:00:35.989> up<00:00:36.229> by<00:00:36.379> matching<00:00:36.620> up<00:00:36.920> with<00:00:37.039> those

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
lines up by matching up with those

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.989 
lines up by matching up with those
rivets<00:00:37.579> up<00:00:37.760> top<00:00:39.100> so<00:00:40.100> those<00:00:40.280> are<00:00:40.460> about<00:00:40.579> where

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:40.999

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.790 
rivets up top so those are about where
the<00:00:41.120> holes<00:00:41.389> go<00:00:41.780> that<00:00:42.229> we're<00:00:42.379> going<00:00:42.469> to<00:00:42.530> drill

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
the holes go that we're going to drill

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.319 
the holes go that we're going to drill
into<00:00:43.010> this<00:00:43.219> so<00:00:43.460> that<00:00:43.609> we<00:00:43.729> can<00:00:43.879> get<00:00:44.089> to<00:00:44.239> the

hole<00:02:04.190> saw<00:02:04.430> that<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:04.940> know<00:02:05.180> it's<00:02:05.300> four-door

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
hole saw that so you know it's four-door

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.469 
hole saw that so you know it's four-door
hole<00:02:05.870> saw<00:02:06.110> but<00:02:06.470> it'll<00:02:06.680> work<00:02:06.800> on<00:02:06.950> this<00:02:07.070> metal

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
hole saw but it'll work on this metal

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.430 
hole saw but it'll work on this metal
you'd<00:02:08.479> be<00:02:08.569> surprised

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.010 

position<00:02:13.440> myself<00:02:13.650> here<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:15.480> I'm<00:02:15.600> gonna<00:02:15.750> go<00:02:15.930> on

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
ahead and tap some starting spots into

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.440 
ahead and tap some starting spots into
that<00:02:19.280> maybe<00:02:20.280> even<00:02:20.520> drill<00:02:20.700> some<00:02:20.880> small<00:02:21.180> holes

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
that maybe even drill some small holes

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.020 
that maybe even drill some small holes
where<00:02:21.780> those<00:02:21.900> Criss<00:02:22.200> crosses<00:02:22.680> are<00:02:22.880> be<00:02:23.880> right

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
where those Criss crosses are be right

so I've gone on ahead and done some

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.490 
so I've gone on ahead and done some
starter<00:02:30.810> holes<00:02:31.020> one<00:02:31.410> there<00:02:32.060> one<00:02:33.060> there<00:02:33.500> and

since that's all I really have get some
in<00:06:19.700> the<00:06:19.790> middle<00:06:19.940> there<00:06:23.440> you<00:06:24.440> get<00:06:24.620> some<00:06:24.860> around

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
in the middle there you get some around

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:31.030 
in the middle there you get some around
the<00:06:25.250> edges<00:06:25.700> I<00:06:29.320> don't<00:06:30.320> think<00:06:30.560> that's<00:06:30.770> a<00:06:30.860> big

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
the edges I don't think that's a big

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.450
