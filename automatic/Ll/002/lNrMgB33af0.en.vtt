exciting thing about us being here today
is<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.869> we're<00:00:19.140> rolling<00:00:19.410> out<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.650> Zurich

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
is that we're rolling out the Zurich

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.980 
is that we're rolling out the Zurich
haven't<00:00:20.279> really<00:00:20.460> been<00:00:20.580> seen<00:00:20.910> except<00:00:21.689> little

haven't really been seen except little
smatterings<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.680> videos<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.189> put

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
smatterings in the videos that we put

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.390 
smatterings in the videos that we put
out<00:00:23.430> before<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.410> you<00:00:25.410> know<00:00:25.439> what<00:00:25.859> we're<00:00:26.010> trying

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
out before so you know what we're trying

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.490 
out before so you know what we're trying
to<00:00:26.730> demonstrate<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.869> how<00:00:28.230> they've

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
to demonstrate here is how they've

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.759 
to demonstrate here is how they've
evolved<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.310> zurag<00:00:30.240> were<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.449> fast-paced<00:00:31.230> race

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
evolved and zurag were a fast-paced race

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.920 
evolved and zurag were a fast-paced race
that<00:00:32.009> could<00:00:32.130> react<00:00:32.369> quickly<00:00:32.669> they<00:00:33.090> were<00:00:33.690> based

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that could react quickly they were based

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.810 
that could react quickly they were based
on<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> idea<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.590> larvae<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.399> that's<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
on the idea of larvae and that's the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.400 
on the idea of larvae and that's the
same<00:00:36.090> here<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:36.690> now<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.140> they<00:00:37.260> can

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
same here in this now so they can

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.400 
same here in this now so they can
quickly<00:00:37.649> build<00:00:38.219> lots<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.120> reactionary<00:00:39.899> units

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
quickly build lots of reactionary units

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.560 
quickly build lots of reactionary units
to<00:00:40.649> various<00:00:41.309> tactics<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:42.059> enemies<00:00:42.360> are

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570

to various tactics that your enemies are
doing<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.829> biggest<00:00:44.100> changes<00:00:44.670> the

now Kimber oh he's got a big a wee

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.400 
now Kimber oh he's got a big a wee
effect<00:01:55.710> now<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.189> his<00:01:56.310> attack

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
effect now with his attack

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.690 
effect now with his attack
there's<00:01:58.410> a<00:01:58.470> lot<00:01:58.650> of<00:01:58.680> new<00:01:58.890> units<00:01:59.250> as<00:01:59.370> well<00:01:59.520> that

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
there's a lot of new units as well that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.500 
there's a lot of new units as well that
we've<00:01:59.820> added<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.180> corruptor<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.350> investor

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
we've added the corruptor the investor

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.700 
we've added the corruptor the investor
that<00:02:03.510> each<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:03.960> their<00:02:04.050> own<00:02:04.110> unique<00:02:04.200> tactics

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
that each have their own unique tactics

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.680 
that each have their own unique tactics
playing<00:02:05.640> very<00:02:05.880> differently<00:02:06.270> from<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.510> other

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
playing very differently from the other

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.169 
playing very differently from the other
two<00:02:06.900> races<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.470> really<00:02:08.190> build<00:02:08.460> upon<00:02:08.759> sort<00:02:09.090> of

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
two races that really build upon sort of

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.940 
two races that really build upon sort of
the<00:02:09.630> core<00:02:09.960> differences<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.590> were<00:02:10.710> there<00:02:10.860> in

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
the core differences that were there in

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.770 
the core differences that were there in
the<00:02:11.039> original<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.580> larva<00:02:11.910> building<00:02:12.300> building

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the original the larva building building

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.680 
the original the larva building building
on<00:02:12.900> creep<00:02:13.340> now<00:02:14.340> all<00:02:14.640> zerg<00:02:14.970> units<00:02:15.360> can<00:02:15.540> burrow

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
on creep now all zerg units can burrow

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.780 
on creep now all zerg units can burrow
so<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.590> turns<00:02:16.770> out<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.100> really<00:02:17.340> interesting

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
so it turns out to be really interesting

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.310 
so it turns out to be really interesting
when<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:17.970> bro<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.360> alter<00:02:18.600> list<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:18.930> pop<00:02:19.140> them

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
when you bro and alter list can pop them

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.949 
when you bro and alter list can pop them
out<00:02:19.380> or<00:02:19.620> bro<00:02:20.580> your<00:02:20.760> queen<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.390> defense<00:02:21.720> and

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
out or bro your queen and defense and

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.310 
out or bro your queen and defense and
income<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:23.150> enemy<00:02:24.150> forces<00:02:24.480> not<00:02:24.810> realizing

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
income the enemy forces not realizing

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.660 
income the enemy forces not realizing
that<00:02:25.440> you're<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:25.950> going<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.220> smash<00:02:26.459> them

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
that you're just going to smash them

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.370 
that you're just going to smash them
when<00:02:26.790> they<00:02:26.910> they<00:02:27.180> head<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.930> lot<00:02:28.350> of

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
when they they head in so a lot of

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.880 
when they they head in so a lot of
really<00:02:28.680> cool<00:02:28.860> new<00:02:29.660> new<00:02:30.660> abilities<00:02:31.350> new<00:02:31.560> units

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
really cool new new abilities new units

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.830 
really cool new new abilities new units
that<00:02:32.040> build<00:02:32.310> upon<00:02:32.640> throw<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.300> principles<00:02:33.720> in

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
that build upon throw the principles in

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.180 
that build upon throw the principles in
the<00:02:33.930> original<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.410> we<00:02:34.739> think<00:02:34.860> players<00:02:35.070> are

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the original and we think players are

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.199 
the original and we think players are
gonna<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.459> great<00:02:35.550> time<00:02:35.670> with<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.060> so

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
gonna have a great time with it so

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.220 
gonna have a great time with it so
that's<00:02:36.360> why<00:02:36.510> we're<00:02:36.660> sharing<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:36.989> all<00:02:37.080> today

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230
