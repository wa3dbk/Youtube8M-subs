00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.510 
casing off and how we want to do that
there's<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.500> little<00:00:34.710> bit<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.980> give<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.309> here

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
there's a little bit of give on here

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.100 
there's a little bit of give on here
when<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.730> move<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.030> forward<00:00:36.210> if<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.930> see

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
when you move it forward if you can see

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.810 
when you move it forward if you can see
that<00:00:38.059> so<00:00:40.129> sometimes<00:00:41.129> they're<00:00:41.309> easy<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.640> take

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
that so sometimes they're easy to take

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.030 
that so sometimes they're easy to take
off<00:00:42.000> sometimes<00:00:42.450> not<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.840> easy<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.920> can

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
move it forward and pull it right off

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:55.220 
move it forward and pull it right off
like<00:00:47.899> that<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:50.059> easy<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.270> access<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:54.079> to<00:00:55.079> get

like that it's easy to access so to get
the<00:00:55.410> light<00:00:55.829> casing<00:00:56.280> off<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> light<00:00:56.879> bulb

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the light casing off of the light bulb

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.819 
the light casing off of the light bulb
you<00:00:57.360> want<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> twist<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.210> it<00:01:00.210> should<00:01:00.359> just

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
you want to twist it and it should just

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.830 
you want to twist it and it should just
slide<00:01:01.829> off<00:01:02.899> there's<00:01:03.899> two<00:01:04.140> little<00:01:05.390> notches<00:01:06.390> in

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
slide off there's two little notches in

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.929 
slide off there's two little notches in
here<00:01:07.110> right<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.950> here<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.820> they

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
here right here in here and they

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.810 
here right here in here and they
correspond<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.920> notches<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> actual<00:01:11.490> bulb

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
correspond to notches on the actual bulb

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.460 
correspond to notches on the actual bulb
and<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> slip<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.380> in

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and you're going to have to slip it in

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.530 
and you're going to have to slip it in
and<00:01:13.680> then<00:01:13.770> turn<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.400> either<00:01:14.610> way<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> lock<00:01:15.360> it

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
and then turn it either way to lock it

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.280 
and then turn it either way to lock it
in<00:01:16.670> so<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.060> change<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.479> light<00:01:18.630> bulb<00:01:18.900> it's

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
in so to change the light bulb it's

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.760 
in so to change the light bulb it's
really<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.729> simple<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.590> pulling<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
really just as simple as pulling the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.590 
really just as simple as pulling the
light<00:01:22.979> bulb<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.670> replacing<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.330> and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
light bulb out and then replacing it and

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.859 
light bulb out and then replacing it and
I<00:01:24.720> have<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.200> white<00:01:25.950> light<00:01:26.130> bulb<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:26.750> that<00:01:27.750> I'm

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
I have a white light bulb here that I'm

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.920 
I have a white light bulb here that I'm
replacing<00:01:28.140> with<00:01:28.619> three<00:01:29.280> small<00:01:29.850> amber<00:01:30.450> LED

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
replacing with three small amber LED

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.010 
replacing with three small amber LED
bulbs<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.090> said<00:01:33.150> pull<00:01:33.600> light<00:01:33.780> bulb

bulbs so like I said pull light bulb

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.880 
bulbs so like I said pull light bulb
straight<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:35.030> empty<00:01:36.030> sockets<00:01:36.680> new<00:01:37.680> light

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
straight out empty sockets new light

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.460 
straight out empty sockets new light
bulb<00:01:38.189> should<00:01:39.119> slide<00:01:39.390> right<00:01:40.579> in<00:01:41.720> like<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.020> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
bulb should slide right in like so and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.870 
bulb should slide right in like so and
you're<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.220> want<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.430> test<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.759> it

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
you're going to want to test that it

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.170 
you're going to want to test that it
works<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.570> I'll<00:01:45.780> go<00:01:45.990> turn<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> car<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180

00:01:47.180 --> 00:02:04.730 
works so I'll go turn the car on to
auxilary<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.479> see<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> blinker<00:01:49.020> works

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.790 

and<00:02:05.600> there<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.950> with<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:10.770> can
