00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.580 
much as we can we practice probably as
as<00:02:02.060> well<00:02:02.420> as<00:02:02.569> we<00:02:02.689> could<00:02:02.810> possibly<00:02:02.869> do<00:02:03.349> it<00:02:03.470> this

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
as well as we could possibly do it this

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.889 
as well as we could possibly do it this
time<00:02:03.649> and<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:04.700> know<00:02:04.789> it's<00:02:05.060> time<00:02:05.209> to<00:02:05.330> play<00:02:05.509> we

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
time and you know it's time to play we

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.680 
time and you know it's time to play we
realistically<00:02:06.289> expect<00:02:06.679> from<00:02:07.069> fremont<00:02:07.690> can

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
realistically expect from fremont can

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.530 
realistically expect from fremont can
you<00:02:08.780> go<00:02:08.929> 30<00:02:09.259> minutes<00:02:09.560> on<00:02:09.739> that<00:02:09.950> mean<00:02:10.150> uh<00:02:11.150> you

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
you go 30 minutes on that mean uh you

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
you go 30 minutes on that mean uh you
know<00:02:11.630> I<00:02:11.690> think<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:12.140> if<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:13.190> times<00:02:13.489> and<00:02:13.880> the

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
know I think so if the times and the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.070 
know I think so if the times and the
minutes<00:02:15.560> are<00:02:15.739> yall<00:02:16.510> parsed<00:02:17.510> out<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.930> way

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
minutes are yall parsed out in a way

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.530 
minutes are yall parsed out in a way
that's<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.859> know<00:02:18.980> doesn't<00:02:19.790> put<00:02:20.030> any<00:02:20.180> real

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
that's you know doesn't put any real

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.110 
that's you know doesn't put any real
heavy<00:02:20.810> time<00:02:21.140> on<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.560> like<00:02:21.739> play<00:02:22.010> 12<00:02:22.310> 14<00:02:22.850> minutes

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
heavy time on it like play 12 14 minutes

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.259 
heavy time on it like play 12 14 minutes
in<00:02:23.239> a<00:02:23.269> row<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:25.250> Phoenix<00:02:25.489> is<00:02:25.700> running<00:02:26.000> like<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
in a row the Phoenix is running like the

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.570 
in a row the Phoenix is running like the
candle<00:02:26.690> could<00:02:26.870> at<00:02:27.560> force<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.070> not<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.370> point

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
candle could at force you not the point

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.820 
candle could at force you not the point
shall<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.420> speeds<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.930> big<00:02:31.080> part<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.500> we<00:02:31.710> have

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
shall of speeds a big part of it we have

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.100 
shall of speeds a big part of it we have
stay<00:02:32.100> up<00:02:32.160> with<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:33.480> there's<00:02:33.720> been<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.900> lot<00:02:34.080> of

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
stay up with so there's been a lot of

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.050 
stay up with so there's been a lot of
discussion<00:02:34.650> about<00:02:34.710> doing<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:35.310> energy<00:02:35.880> back

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
discussion about doing this energy back

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.210 
discussion about doing this energy back
that<00:02:36.330> was<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.690> first<00:02:36.960> two<00:02:37.170> round<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.980> it's

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
that was in the first two round and it's

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.820 
that was in the first two round and it's
completely<00:02:38.580> shut<00:02:39.030> off<00:02:39.060> or<00:02:39.480> weak<00:02:39.690> in<00:02:40.620> your

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
break that energy back for Game one yeah

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.000 
break that energy back for Game one yeah
we<00:02:48.600> would<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.960> finals<00:02:49.380> once<00:02:49.590> like<00:02:49.770> this

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
we would in the finals once like this

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.310 
we would in the finals once like this
when<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:50.670> was<00:02:50.850> in<00:02:51.000> Chicago<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.540> little<00:02:52.140> longer

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
when I was in Chicago is a little longer

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.410 
when I was in Chicago is a little longer
actually<00:02:52.590> have<00:02:52.800> things<00:02:52.920> like<00:02:53.070> 10<00:02:53.400> days<00:02:53.580> very

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
actually have things like 10 days very

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.390 
actually have things like 10 days very
long<00:02:54.600> period<00:02:54.960> of<00:02:54.990> time<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.500> we<00:02:55.860> swept<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
long period of time that we swept the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.180 
long period of time that we swept the
Western<00:02:57.210> Conference<00:02:57.390> at<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:58.320> time<00:02:58.530> when<00:02:58.770> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
Western Conference at that time when the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.060 
Western Conference at that time when the
distance<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.850> seven<00:03:00.240> games<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.860> we<00:03:01.980> were<00:03:02.040> very

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
distance of seven games and we were very

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.890 
distance of seven games and we were very
concerned<00:03:02.370> about<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:03.030> we<00:03:03.300> came<00:03:03.480> out<00:03:03.600> played

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
concerned about it we came out played

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.540 
concerned about it we came out played
ball<00:03:04.110> one<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.470> first<00:03:04.650> 20<00:03:04.830> games<00:03:05.160> at<00:03:05.400> home

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
ball one of the first 20 games at home

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.080 
ball one of the first 20 games at home
and<00:03:06.500> established<00:03:07.500> ourselves<00:03:07.790> right<00:03:08.790> away<00:03:09.030> so

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
and established ourselves right away so

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.390 
and established ourselves right away so
I<00:03:09.540> think<00:03:10.020> it<00:03:10.200> took<00:03:10.320> us<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.590> quarter<00:03:11.010> though<00:03:11.340> to

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
I think it took us a quarter though to

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.790 
I think it took us a quarter though to
get<00:03:11.580> going<00:03:11.850> but<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.570> was<00:03:12.720> being<00:03:12.990> as<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.200> Jimmy
