of fun with it you guys will see in this
gameplay<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.870> most<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.739> my<00:00:55.860> kills<00:00:56.190> are

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
gameplay that most of my kills are

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.209 
gameplay that most of my kills are
either<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.719> two<00:00:57.899> bursts<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.680> that's

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
either one to two bursts and that's

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.389 
either one to two bursts and that's
that's<00:00:59.550> almost<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.969> huge<00:01:00.270> bump<00:01:00.629> that's<00:01:01.370> also<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
that's almost a huge bump that's also a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.299 
that's almost a huge bump that's also a
great<00:01:03.000> reduction<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.799> bullets<00:01:05.189> that

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
great reduction in the bullets that

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.899 
great reduction in the bullets that
you're<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.700> using<00:01:06.000> since<00:01:07.760> it's<00:01:08.760> only

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
you're going to be using since it's only

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.490 
you're going to be using since it's only
taking<00:01:09.360> one<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> two<00:01:09.780> bursts<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
taking one to two bursts and it's a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.289 
taking one to two bursts and it's a
three<00:01:10.710> round<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> three<00:01:11.850> round<00:01:11.970> burst

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
three round it's a three round burst

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.480 
three round it's a three round burst
weapon<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.229> think<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.890> very<00:01:14.220> very

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
weapon so I think it's very very

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.300 
weapon so I think it's very very
effective<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.840> version<00:01:16.350> or<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.770> variant

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
effective the version or the variant

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.580 
effective the version or the variant
that<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.479> RX<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
that I have of the RX is the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.280 
that I have of the RX is the
professional<00:01:20.520> variant<00:01:21.150> which<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.960> hole

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
professional variant which is the hole

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.679 
professional variant which is the hole
puncher<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.460> hole<00:01:23.640> puncher<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.210> believe

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
puncher and the hole puncher I believe

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.600 
puncher and the hole puncher I believe
in<00:01:24.960> what<00:01:25.380> I've<00:01:25.619> seen<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.070> other<00:01:26.220> people's

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
in what I've seen in other people's

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.240 
in what I've seen in other people's
videos<00:01:26.689> they<00:01:27.689> also<00:01:27.990> believe<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.040> hole

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
videos they also believe that the hole

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.359 
videos they also believe that the hole
puncher<00:01:29.700> could<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.869> as<00:01:31.110> good<00:01:31.560> or<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:32.100> not

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
puncher could be as good or if not

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.819 
puncher could be as good or if not
better<00:01:32.670> than<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.390> elite<00:01:33.869> variant<00:01:34.380> which<00:01:34.590> is

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
better than the elite variant which is

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.850 
better than the elite variant which is
the<00:01:35.040> steel<00:01:35.400> bite<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:37.200> hole<00:01:37.409> puncher<00:01:37.829> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the steel bite so the hole puncher and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.969 
the steel bite so the hole puncher and
the<00:01:38.100> steel<00:01:38.340> bite<00:01:38.579> seem<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:39.869> almost<00:01:40.470> exactly

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
the steel bite seem to be almost exactly

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.749 
the steel bite seem to be almost exactly
the<00:01:41.490> same<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.090> effectiveness<00:01:42.570> or<00:01:43.549> one<00:01:44.549> is

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the same and effectiveness or one is

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.760 
the same and effectiveness or one is
greater<00:01:45.000> than<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> other<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.810> personally<00:01:46.740> I

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
greater than the other and personally I

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.130 
greater than the other and personally I
feel<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:48.149> hole<00:01:48.390> puncher<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.810> better

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
feel like the hole puncher is better

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.080 
feel like the hole puncher is better
even<00:01:49.409> though<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:49.829> only<00:01:50.009> listed<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.060> a

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
even though it's only listed as a

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
bell 27 or an ASM one because those guns

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.320

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
people just use them because they are

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.920 
people just use them because they are
the<00:03:33.040> best<00:03:33.340> guns<00:03:33.640> because<00:03:34.209> they'll<00:03:34.540> get<00:03:34.750> them

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930

fun<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.390> use<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:40.900> even<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:41.920> base<00:03:42.130> version<00:03:42.459> of

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
fun to use and even the base version of

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.090 
fun to use and even the base version of
the<00:03:42.850> weapon<00:03:43.150> is<00:03:43.269> good<00:03:43.480> now<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.690> not<00:03:44.650> just<00:03:44.920> the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
the weapon is good now to not just the

the weapon is good now to not just the
hole<00:03:45.250> puncher<00:03:45.640> not<00:03:45.910> just<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.330> steel<00:03:46.570> bite<00:03:46.810> but

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
hole puncher not just the steel bite but

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.250 
hole puncher not just the steel bite but
I<00:03:47.620> have<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:47.980> luxury<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.519> having<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.930> hole

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
I have the luxury of having the the hole

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.410 
I have the luxury of having the the hole
puncher<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:50.890> I'm<00:03:51.519> having<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.970> great<00:03:52.090> deal<00:03:52.390> of

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
puncher and I'm having a great deal of

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.240 
puncher and I'm having a great deal of
fun<00:03:52.540> with<00:03:52.810> it<00:03:53.019> I<00:03:53.200> think<00:03:53.650> it's<00:03:53.769> super<00:03:54.130> effective

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
fun with it I think it's super effective

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.850 
fun with it I think it's super effective
I<00:03:54.880> think<00:03:55.300> that<00:03:55.540> it's<00:03:55.780> awesome<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.320> you<00:03:56.680> only

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
I think that it's awesome that you only

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.850 
I think that it's awesome that you only
have<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.250> get<00:03:57.400> one<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:58.269> two<00:03:58.450> bursts<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:59.650> kill

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
have to get one to two bursts to kill

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.009 
have to get one to two bursts to kill
somebody<00:04:00.130> most<00:04:00.880> of<00:04:01.030> my<00:04:01.120> kills<00:04:01.420> were<00:04:01.600> actually

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
somebody most of my kills were actually

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.110 
somebody most of my kills were actually
in<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.320> one<00:04:02.500> verse<00:04:02.830> range<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.610> that's

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
in the one verse range and that's

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.330 
in the one verse range and that's
awesome<00:04:04.630> even<00:04:04.959> though<00:04:05.080> I<00:04:05.350> have<00:04:05.800> a<00:04:05.860> tendency<00:04:06.310> to

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
awesome even though I have a tendency to

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.920 
awesome even though I have a tendency to
shoot<00:04:06.700> probably<00:04:07.269> about<00:04:07.450> three<00:04:07.780> or<00:04:07.840> four

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
shoot probably about three or four

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.020 
shoot probably about three or four
bursts<00:04:08.620> just<00:04:09.220> because<00:04:09.430> I'm<00:04:09.549> not<00:04:09.670> used<00:04:09.850> to

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
bursts just because I'm not used to

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.640 
bursts just because I'm not used to
using<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.420> three-round<00:04:10.840> burst<00:04:11.019> weapon<00:04:11.380> in<00:04:11.500> this

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
using a three-round burst weapon in this

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.810 
using a three-round burst weapon in this
game<00:04:12.000> like<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.120> said<00:04:13.180> it<00:04:13.570> shoots<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:14.580> IMR<00:04:15.580> out

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
game like I said it shoots the IMR out

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.630 
game like I said it shoots the IMR out
of<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.030> water<00:04:16.890> considering<00:04:17.890> that<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.160> IMR

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
of the water considering that the IMR

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.880 
of the water considering that the IMR
was<00:04:18.790> pretty<00:04:19.060> much<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.390> only<00:04:19.419> usable<00:04:20.109> three

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
was pretty much the only usable three

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.699 
was pretty much the only usable three
round

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
round

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.590 
round
I<00:04:21.769> guess<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:22.490> was<00:04:22.580> a<00:04:22.610> four-round<00:04:23.030> verse<00:04:23.300> but

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
I guess it was a four-round verse but

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.120 
I guess it was a four-round verse but
first<00:04:24.050> weapon<00:04:24.350> in<00:04:24.680> this<00:04:24.800> game<00:04:25.069> beforehand<00:04:25.780> but

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
first weapon in this game beforehand but

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.499 
first weapon in this game beforehand but
like<00:04:28.130> I<00:04:28.280> said<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.520> just<00:04:28.610> wanted<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.120> make<00:04:29.330> this
