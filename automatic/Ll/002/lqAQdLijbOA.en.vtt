home<00:02:50.810> next<00:02:51.810> our<00:02:52.849> tip<00:02:53.849> I<00:02:54.090> would<00:02:54.150> say<00:02:54.269> is

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
home next our tip I would say is

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.849

highlighting the dining table and I

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.780 
highlighting the dining table and I
think<00:02:59.189> a<00:02:59.250> great<00:02:59.400> way<00:02:59.670> to<00:03:00.000> do<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.689> is<00:03:01.019> by

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
think a great way to do this is by

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.720 
think a great way to do this is by
installing<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:03.299> pendant<00:03:03.840> over<00:03:04.159> that<00:03:05.159> area<00:03:05.549> that

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
installing a pendant over that area that

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.949 
installing a pendant over that area that
really<00:03:06.950> creates<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.129> nice<00:03:08.609> focal<00:03:09.329> point<00:03:09.750> in<00:03:09.930> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
room and also highlights where that

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.759

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
can be been done in a number of ways one

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.539 
can be been done in a number of ways one
way<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.790> by<00:03:27.290> changing<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.560> paint<00:03:28.859> color<00:03:29.129> on<00:03:29.459> a

wall such as this wall it's a darker
pink<00:03:32.459> color<00:03:32.819> which<00:03:33.209> will<00:03:33.389> create<00:03:33.659> a<00:03:33.720> focal

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
pink color which will create a focal

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.119 
pink color which will create a focal
point<00:03:34.409> as<00:03:34.709> opposed<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.760> other<00:03:36.949> walls<00:03:37.949> in

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
point as opposed to the other walls in

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.189 
point as opposed to the other walls in

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.839 
the room that are a lighter shade of
grey<00:03:40.590> or<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.909> can<00:03:42.090> do<00:03:42.329> it<00:03:42.479> by<00:03:42.690> artwork<00:03:43.349> which

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
grey or you can do it by artwork which

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.759 
grey or you can do it by artwork which
we<00:03:44.849> have<00:03:45.000> some<00:03:45.209> artwork<00:03:45.479> over<00:03:45.780> here<00:03:46.199> by<00:03:46.709> the

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
so you don't want to put all furniture

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.899 
so you don't want to put all furniture
on<00:04:59.879> one<00:05:00.240> side<00:05:00.599> of<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:00.900> room<00:05:01.139> you<00:05:01.800> want<00:05:02.280> to<00:05:02.550> have

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
an equal weight on either side so in

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.529 
an equal weight on either side so in
this<00:05:06.750> space<00:05:07.050> we<00:05:07.409> have<00:05:07.639> furniture<00:05:08.639> here<00:05:09.210> but<00:05:09.419> we

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
this space we have furniture here but we

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.110 
this space we have furniture here but we
also<00:05:09.569> have<00:05:10.190> some<00:05:11.190> furniture<00:05:11.520> over<00:05:11.879> in<00:05:11.969> this

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
also have some furniture over in this

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.800 
also have some furniture over in this
area<00:05:12.479> and<00:05:12.690> then<00:05:13.349> this<00:05:13.830> wall<00:05:14.190> graphic<00:05:14.879> actually

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
area and then this wall graphic actually

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.020 
area and then this wall graphic actually
creates<00:05:16.530> weight<00:05:16.860> as<00:05:17.039> well<00:05:17.280> in<00:05:17.550> this<00:05:17.759> space

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
creates weight as well in this space

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.399 
creates weight as well in this space
visual<00:05:18.719> weight<00:05:19.520> so<00:05:20.520> this<00:05:21.389> space<00:05:21.690> really<00:05:21.990> feels

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
visual weight so this space really feels

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.450 
visual weight so this space really feels
nice<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:23.610> balanced<00:05:24.419> as<00:05:24.659> you<00:05:24.870> are<00:05:25.340> living<00:05:26.340> in

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
nice and balanced as you are living in

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.610 
nice and balanced as you are living in
it<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:27.949> of<00:05:28.949> course<00:05:29.250> one<00:05:29.669> of<00:05:29.699> the<00:05:30.539> next<00:05:30.960> tips<00:05:31.319> is

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
it and of course one of the next tips is

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.409 
it and of course one of the next tips is
creating<00:05:32.099> making<00:05:32.759> sure<00:05:32.909> that<00:05:33.090> you<00:05:33.180> keep

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
creating making sure that you keep

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.649 
creating making sure that you keep
visual<00:05:34.409> connection<00:05:35.219> I<00:05:35.460> think<00:05:36.180> that's<00:05:36.360> one<00:05:36.599> of

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
visual connection I think that's one of

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:39.709 
visual connection I think that's one of
the<00:05:36.719> biggest<00:05:36.960> advantages<00:05:37.469> of<00:05:38.389> an<00:05:39.389> open

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:39.719 
the biggest advantages of an open

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.170 
the biggest advantages of an open
concept<00:05:39.930> is<00:05:40.289> that<00:05:40.319> if<00:05:40.770> you're<00:05:40.949> cooking<00:05:41.190> in<00:05:41.699> the

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
concept is that if you're cooking in the

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.540 
concept is that if you're cooking in the
kitchen<00:05:42.210> with<00:05:42.719> friends<00:05:43.319> with<00:05:44.009> friends<00:05:44.340> over
