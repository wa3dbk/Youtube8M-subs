00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.630
 stolen so what are we packing 3 is 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.180

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.900
 because there because the then beautiful here 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.530

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.420
 Not so maybe I have that 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.850

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:18.440

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.100
 goodness my hard drive does not come 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.720
 afterwards, if everything is so stressed here 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.730
 becomes 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:42.620
 with the render and the shader and such 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:45.950
 further and with the small outlook to 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.990
 i say goodbye to palazzo 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:54.110
 even if you have the download 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:57.290

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.030

 Of course I can also push in 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:12.050
 and maybe the texture pack too 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.020

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.060
