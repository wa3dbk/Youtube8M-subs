00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello I'm augustin this case I 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.260
 am tea tasters and today 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.120
 I will show you the mistakes to no 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.330
 not commit when preparing a tea 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.460
 often when tasting the tea of 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.890
 tea preparation some mistakes 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.560
 are committed which denatures the taste of the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.119
 tea to know added from time to time a 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.710
 little milk or lemon 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.920
 often these mistakes are made 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.120
 during the tasting of black tea because 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:37.190
 tea tends to be strong in the mouth 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.379
 and that's artifices are used to 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.160
 soften the taste a little bit often on 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:49.829
 the black summer like this one very dark and 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:54.539
 often strong in the mouth it is customary 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.270
 to add a little milk to reduce 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.329
 the taste of tea and the cup clears 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.899
 right now and we add a little bit 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.899
 of sugar and a slice of lemon 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.070
 it is only necessary to mix 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:20.370
 this addition of eastern sugar or lemon 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.590
 see all three of a sudden matches in 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.350
 made to an error which aims to 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.840
 make up for an error when 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.610
 tea preparation that has often been 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.580
 brew too long and that suddenly 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.080
 becomes bitter is a little strong here is a 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.470
 German tenor is enough so she 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.210
 itself just like a wine could 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.530
 to be self-sufficient where we do not add 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.260
 no ingredient in addition to a good tea 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.420
 well prepared and sufficient though 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.900
 some presses people prefer the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.040
 a little sweet or milky tea 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.080
 it's always a matter of taste 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.900
 here are some mistakes that can be 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.550
 made during the preparation of the tea 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.210
 so you know what is it 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.210
 avoid doing
