00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:12.769
 the side welcome the picture in the last class 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:16.630
 we saw some types of flowers there and 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:20.810
 remembering the flowers can be simple 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:24.500
 complete or incomplete or may be 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.849
 grouped into inflorescences that may 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.160
 be of the defined or undefined type 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:36.410
 In this class we will see a second 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:40.280
 criterion for classifying flowers and 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:45.249
 this criterion to classify the types 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:50.059
 is based on the islands and triya 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:53.769
 there are three basic types said letria 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:57.890
 and we are not going to illustrate each one of them 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:01.519
 I'm going to draw the first flower here 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.810
 has a symmetry of the silva type 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:10.400
 shows a bilateral in this type of 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:15.020
 symmetry there is only one way of 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.030
 axis that you can cut by adding two 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.050
 equal halves 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.770
 if you look at that half of the left 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:28.400
 is equal to that half of the right 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.910
 then we say that this type is a 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:37.880
 type of cinema and track ziva the girl or 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:41.890
 also called bilateral symmetry in the 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:46.540
 second example we have a symmetry 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:50.120
 radial or the young chitin 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.500
 in this case there are many 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.220
 symmetry 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:00.590
 if you compare the flower on this axis it will 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:04.220
 have two equal halves, but if you 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:08.090
 cut the flower in this xi there will also be 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.239
 two halves equal the top and 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.769
 below the same shape if you 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:17.870
 count on this axis or this 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:22.700
 there will always be 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.810
 the same halves and for this type of 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.519
 symmetry 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:33.409
 we give the name of good radial symmetry 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:36.769
 here there are flowers and finally there are flowers 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:41.090
 which present no fills 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:44.569
 symmetry and this type of flower without any 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:50.329
 axis of symmetry is classified as 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:52.720
 flower asymmetrical we finished the 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:56.060
 with the second form of 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.660
 classification of flowers that is based 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.750
 symmetry and the next class wants to 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.450
 show you how to draw a 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:10.489
 floral diagram that is a figure 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.609
 representative of a non- loss flower until 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.609
 over there
