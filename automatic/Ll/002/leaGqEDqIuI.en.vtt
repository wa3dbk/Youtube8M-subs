CHIMINEYSWIFT11: I don't dance
at all, so I'm really nervous.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.410
And just you know, hopefully
rely on my athletic talents to

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.660
try and carry me through.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.624
There's a lot on the line and
I'm very, very competitive.

00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:19.330
I'm going to remember to make
sure to stay in character and

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.890
just give all the energy
that I have.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.230
And just feed off of her.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.850
And we make a great team so
it's going to be awesome.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.930
BRINN NICOLE: Uh huh,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.060
CHIMINEYSWIFT11: But I'm going
to try and let my, I guess,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.110
dancing do the talking.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.110
BRINN NICOLE: Ready?

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.610
CHIMINEYSWIFT11: Yeah,
let's do this.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.110
BRINN NICOLE: Okay.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.570
D-TRIX: Next up, please give
it up for ChimneySwift11

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.500
partnered with Brinn Nicole.

SAWGOOD, "BLOWIN' UP"]

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:13.916
BRINN NICOLE: We done.

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:20.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.900
D-TRIX: All right so that
felt pretty good, yeah?

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.240
CHIMINEYSWIFT11: Yeah.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.655
D-TRIX: It looked great.

00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:24.070
Let's see what the judges
have to say.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.620
Mr. Dave Days, what did you
think of the performance?

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.850
DAVE DAYS: I thougt it
was really cool.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.050
Right off the bat, I
loved your style.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.320
I got like a James Bond feel out
of it with like the whole

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.790
guns and whatnot.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.110
I was really impressed with the
flips you guys were doing.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.890
That kind of kept the
energy level up.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.710
But the character
and expression.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.880
Brinn, I thought you
out shined a bit.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.740
Because you were very
enthusiastic, and you at times

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.120
were a bit more mellow.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.930
So that was the only flaw, but
overall like I loved your

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.985
style and choreography
was good.

00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:53.960
Yeah, it was a good
performance.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.405
CHIMINEYSWIFT11: Thank you.

00:02:54.405 --> 00:02:55.980
D-TRIX: Laurieann Gibson,
what did you think?

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.370
LAURIEANN GIBSON: Wow, I was
really sincerely impressed.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.140
However, one glitch
was your face.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.510
I saw that you were
in rehearsal.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.940
I saw that you were counting.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.470
I saw that you were like--

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.100
and the problem was, you were
killing it, but your face was

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.830
telling me something else.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.850
That was it.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.930
But if you ever do it again,
remember how good you are, and

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.740
just bring the performance
into your face.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.090
Because you slayed it.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.210
D-TRIX: Mr. Fatone, what
did you think?

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.800
JOEY FATONE: A lot of fun
things I liked about it.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.090
The first, actually it was
really cool, is I noticed that

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.340
when you dropped your hat, it
was kind of close to you.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.125
But you didn't skip a beat and
you just kicked that thing out

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:29.600
of the way.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.560
Which was great, I thought
it was really slick.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.100
And not many people know
how to do that.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.390
The boob thing, the little
pasty thing--

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.420
CHIMINEYSWIFT11: I.
Heard you giggling

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.325
JOEY FATONE: I thought
it was hysterical.

00:03:37.325 --> 00:03:38.120
I thought it was really funny.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.990
But I have to agree, as far
as the facial expressions.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.540
I mean, If you want to take it
this way, spy on spy, where

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.360
you're more the comedic,
you're the serious.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.520
Because you were doing all the
dance moves, you were doing

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.020
everything, you were hitting
all the marks.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.750
But yeah, your face was
just kind of like, am

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.970
I happy to be here?

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.910
Or am I excited?

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.260
Or am I showing any facial of
urgency in the performance?

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.590
That's kind of where it lacked
a little bit, so.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.010
LAURIEANN GIBSON: Which is
really interesting, because I

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.140
felt like you were dancing like
you were playing a game.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.570
And like you were the game.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.410
Which is kind of amazingly
genius.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.090
And I was impressed with
that, but again it was

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.620
just that your face.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.120
CHIMINEYSWIFT11: I know when I
see is again I'm going to just

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.630
be like, wow.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.709
And I'm going to be proud of
myself that I actually, you

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.290
know, achieved this and learned
this in such a short

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.460
amount of time.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.620
And once again, it's
all right here.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.410
D-TRIX: Well, good luck, and
we hope to see you in the

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.130
finals man.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.420
CHIMINEYSWIFT11: Thank you.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.520
D-TRIX: Take care.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.420
Good luck to you guys.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.920
BRINN NICOLE: Thank you.
