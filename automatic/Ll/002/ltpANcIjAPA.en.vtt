 birou hi guys his fangs matt 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.819
 Damon this video I hope you have 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.069
 Well, I'm going quietly in the face of 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.150
 quietly there I'm a little hungry 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.160
 it's not even a touch of the throat 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.849
 super dry gala a little bit to 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.429
 Express myself 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.199
 sorry for advanced so here's the these 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.670
 small videos a little video patel 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.050
 did four again I'm waiting 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.789
 crazy titanium as I told you a 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.410
 explained then on black ops you have 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.590
 a fair before I will come back on my 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.609
 previous video obviously so killed 40 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.849
 he even is to 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.199
 the moment it is it is my biggest 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.059
 number of kills finally I'm starting some 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.700
 little ones and girls like that on 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.469
 battlefield for fun 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.430
 knowing that it ends in 100 points 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.180
 so are there only 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.379
 and it lasts forever from cold until 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.090
 time they have the right number of 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.910
 kills where I was solo it 's record 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.050
 we say on thooris at one eye and so 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.180
 for those who want to be so I'm going 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.469
 explain a little bit why I 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.760
 chose the shotgun it's all 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.110
 first shotgun I just put the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.420
 laser finder because I find that the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.469
 duckbill guns and where finally that 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.670
 it's a small step nothing what they have 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.100
 put on pump guns 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.989
 unfortunately and so if started to 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.280
 nice tourism pumps alain is a very 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.710
 very good map so the building 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.939
 central this is where all the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.860
 enemies are going so there are a lot 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.640
 of entries to different places 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.180
 I put myself at the pumps for klose van 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.200
 bommel his drawings to rugby but for this 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.939
 price the bridge that's for the little ones 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.590
 golden cyprins the little cole clauses I 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.080
 do not know how to say finally you short 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.450
 will understand me and on the end 2 caps 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.920
 light trimmers so on a rifle did 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.360
 that at 5.5 a very good rifle 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.310
 you tell me why you think you 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.500
 do a massacre we can finally I 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.970
 put in your place why be 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.259
 why I had switch and so they are 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.299
 a rifle simply because 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.540
 my team was rather domineering 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.560
 did they dominate and the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.820
 enemies could no longer enter the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.530
 building so here I am not going to me 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.000
 to walk the card externally with my 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.470
 little pump rifle that's for sure 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.899
 am going to do a lot less useful I'm going 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.860
 have a lot less chance of kylie 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.600
 so that's why I took by 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.340
 cable 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.630
 so here is my little video just to see 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.000
 at my first mac do that it was a 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.170
 video 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.680
 here is a little bit of a rude 6 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.210
 passes and on youtube where the dregs to June 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.539
 calls on skype I have ears on 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.800
 so understand excuses me it was rather 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.130
 what happened on youtube sees the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.690
 cream 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.250
 I think the majority of us 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.940
 including who I am referring to etc 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.319
 and here I think I'm right in this 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.690
 that I say huh because I 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.300
 stories without tail nor head I have no 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.670
 no need to go out of saint cyr for 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.230
 understand that maybe that's 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.830
 a real story but frankly he 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.989
 in addition it is forced more delirium 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.569
 twitter asked dre tweeted thing of 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.010
 stuff they are there for the 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.140
 abs and it's not been a year since 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.330
 I started my channel I always 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.310
 makes videos quiet me I'm 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.769
 someone simple I did not even 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.600
 of a trust in May video that annoying them 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.670
 suspects but video about the game because 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.350
 I like video games I started 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.580
 because I liked making skin tones 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.500
 video games simply has a 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.209
 name is because it is they do 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.799
 manage carnage of a team of 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.510
 performance then after they do it more 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.950
 because they see it going over there 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.280
 happens more it takes something else to 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.590
 buzzer 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.000
 finally you 'll understand me I 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.090
 will not come back on the subject maybe 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.549
 that there will be retaliation but that it 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.829
 would not surprise me about the mental age of these 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.840
 people so that's it I wanted you 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.890
 to talk about a little trick also at the end of 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.630
 video for those who stayed at the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.519
 family i think you will look at my 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.200
 carla until the end so I do not have his 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.310
 partners with xbox paradise a 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.959
 option for those who do not know 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.230
 it's a site that offers points 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.370
 microsoft and sony so a system of 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.190
 points you can buy from 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.410
 game extensions the games any short 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.390
 same and etc 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.950
 subscriptions and where is the 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.989
 particularity so it's that you can 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.030
 pay with your phone plan 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.690
 so if you have rab at each end of 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.750
 months you can take some 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.130
 points to buy stuff on the psn 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.150
 or on the xbox live 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.420
 so it's always going to be forever 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.799
 the description of may but video for 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.049
 those who want to go take a look 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.189
 so here I think I pretty much 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.930
 everything says and here I would like to say before 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.159
 they live on my little video 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.590
 because I'm going to continue my thing 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.049
 but loses bm I'm not over 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.430
 kind to make videos first mcdo he 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.859
 it made them laugh because they 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.280
 are saying that at the bottom that will compensate for 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.020
 tell these stories where we do 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.259
 can get out beach effect four years 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.490
 internat I can tell you that if 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.870
 I had ten stories to tell 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.510
 would be deadly but I think it's 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.729
 rather personal for not the interest of 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.060
 say that on youtube 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.680
 my first kebab the first day I 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.729
 am born will one day release to me 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.789
 recalls as if it was yesterday 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.470
 not finally you'll understand me it 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.850
 are the majority of people will have 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.160
 understood and we can not refer too much to 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.870
 the bar the dislike ex as the ten 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.370
 lakes and dudes do not argue in 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.860
 done in the comments what is 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.699
 shame 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.030
 and maybe they have no argument 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.099
 in fact that's why it's legal 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.250
 I also wanted to say a big thank you to 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:06.610
 whoever passed me no xbox code 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.349
 a week but was I a 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.760
 little bit in the shit and to all those 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:14.949
 who offered me their codes 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.270
 because it's a little stuck 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.849
 ask the base just two days to 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.270
 end the creator and there is none 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.340
 badly who offered me haircut of a 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.510
 month up to a month and where so a big 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.860
 thanks to you frankly that made me 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.889
 great pleasure to see so many 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.810
 comments for a good son to a code 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.669
 quite simply 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.960
 it's true it made me warm to the heart 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.880
 so here's the guys I get you a little 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.320
 slate sequence to add that because 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.190
 that I had forgotten to specify in my 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.770
 videos and I found that it was 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.710
 important so that's the one who 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.870
 did me school I add etc 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.349
 I said thank you as it was necessary and then 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.270

 the times that is affected that she has a 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:12.240
 little names and then here we go 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.629
