00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
use the music and my interest so now

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.789 
use the music and my interest so now
until<00:00:03.840> I<00:00:03.870> found<00:00:04.110> another<00:00:04.350> one<00:00:04.500> you're<00:00:04.650> stuck

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
until I found another one you're stuck

until I found another one you're stuck
with<00:00:04.920> my<00:00:05.009> voice<00:00:05.160> what<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.089> it<00:00:06.210> dies<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.810> a

that<00:00:11.250> have<00:00:11.340> come<00:00:11.460> out<00:00:11.580> going<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.969> be

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
that have come out going to be

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.039 
that have come out going to be
introduced<00:00:12.540> into<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.969> formats<00:00:14.969> next<00:00:15.630> month

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
introduced into the formats next month

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.200 
introduced into the formats next month
this<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.770> for<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.949> ocg<00:00:17.430> has<00:00:17.670> not<00:00:17.880> for<00:00:18.029> us

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
this is just for the ocg has not for us

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.260 
this is just for the ocg has not for us
as<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.840> yet<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:20.520> us<00:00:20.550> at<00:00:20.760> all<00:00:20.939> but<00:00:21.210> I'm

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
as of yet it is for us at all but I'm

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.400 
as of yet it is for us at all but I'm
pretty<00:00:21.420> sure<00:00:21.539> some<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.930> mechanics<00:00:22.050> are

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
pretty sure some of the mechanics are

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.410 
pretty sure some of the mechanics are
going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.619> probably<00:00:22.800> come<00:00:23.039> over<00:00:23.340> into<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.789> TCG

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
going to probably come over into the TCG

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.849 
going to probably come over into the TCG
eventually<00:00:25.019> I'm<00:00:25.230> not<00:00:25.380> going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.619> talk<00:00:25.710> about

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
eventually I'm not going to talk about

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.950 
eventually I'm not going to talk about
pendulum<00:00:26.369> summons<00:00:26.730> because<00:00:27.150> there<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.660> still

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
pendulum summons because there is still

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.720 
pendulum summons because there is still
some<00:00:28.230> speculation<00:00:28.859> over<00:00:28.980> there<00:00:29.369> kind<00:00:29.670> of

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
some speculation over there kind of

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.490 
some speculation over there kind of
fundamentals<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.539> how<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.779> work<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
fundamentals on how it work the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.440 
fundamentals on how it work the
description<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.340> given<00:00:32.399> out<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.969> kind

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
description that was given out is kind

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.299 
description that was given out is kind
of<00:00:33.570> quite<00:00:33.719> vague<00:00:33.960> but<00:00:34.320> people<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:34.860> made<00:00:35.070> up

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
of quite vague but people have made up

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.190 
of quite vague but people have made up
their<00:00:35.340> own<00:00:35.579> kind<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.390> judgements<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
their own kind of judgements and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.319 
their own kind of judgements and
opinions<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:38.010> how<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.309> works<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.000> want<00:00:39.210> to

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
opinions on how it works if you want to

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.380 
opinions on how it works if you want to
see<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.510> then<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.050> go<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.850> billion

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
see that then you can go to the billion

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.760 
see that then you can go to the billion
other<00:00:42.540> people<00:00:42.629> who<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.140> also<00:00:43.440> done<00:00:43.590> those

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
other people who have also done those

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.410 
other people who have also done those
videos<00:00:44.070> kinda<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> popular<00:00:44.850> people<00:00:45.059> and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
videos kinda like the popular people and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.360 
videos kinda like the popular people and
also<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> smaller<00:00:45.960> people<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.190> want

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
also the smaller people you if you want

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.740 
also the smaller people you if you want
to<00:00:47.430> know<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> does<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.210> go<00:00:48.329> see<00:00:48.539> them

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
to know what it does you can go see them

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.330 
to know what it does you can go see them
I'm<00:00:49.410> not<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.890> talk<00:00:50.070> about<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
I'm not really going to talk about the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.709 
I'm not really going to talk about the
mental<00:00:50.610> stuff<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.910> confirmed<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.570> how<00:00:51.690> I

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
mental stuff is confirmed and how I

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.119 
mental stuff is confirmed and how I
think<00:00:51.930> it'll<00:00:52.079> impact<00:00:52.350> does<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.100> so

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
think it'll impact does and so on so

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.220 
think it'll impact does and so on so
forth<00:00:53.329> just<00:00:54.329> because<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.750> don't<00:00:54.899> have

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
forth just because we I don't have

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.380 
forth just because we I don't have
enough<00:00:55.440> information<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.039> really<00:00:56.399> cast<00:00:56.910> my<00:00:57.210> own

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
enough information to really cast my own

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.479 
enough information to really cast my own
you<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:57.960> make<00:00:58.379> my<00:00:58.500> own<00:00:58.530> opinion<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.280> for

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
you know make my own opinion on it for

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.830 
you know make my own opinion on it for
the<00:00:59.520> only<00:00:59.760> thing<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.969> will<00:01:00.120> say<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.750> do

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the only thing I will say is that I do

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.950 
the only thing I will say is that I do
want<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.079> get<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> chance<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.489> is

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
want to get a chance to see like is

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.910 
want to get a chance to see like is
there's<00:01:03.960> always<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> be<00:01:04.500> new<00:01:04.710> game

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
there's always going to be new game

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.090 
there's always going to be new game
mechanics<00:01:05.430> when<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.180> new<00:01:06.420> season<00:01:06.659> starts<00:01:07.650> so

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
mechanics when the new season starts so

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.210 
mechanics when the new season starts so
whatever<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.510> rules<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.260> ocg<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
whatever but the rules for the ocg the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.870 
whatever but the rules for the ocg the
two<00:01:11.400> are<00:01:11.729> quite<00:01:12.630> simply<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.460> first

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
two are quite simply that the first

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.990 
two are quite simply that the first
person<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:16.170> person<00:01:16.290> who<00:01:16.500> goes<00:01:16.680> first<00:01:17.000> doesn't

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
person the person who goes first doesn't

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.640 
person the person who goes first doesn't
get<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.509> extra<00:01:18.720> roll<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.200> they<00:01:19.320> will<00:01:19.409> stay

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
get that extra roll so they will stay

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.289 
get that extra roll so they will stay
with<00:01:19.799> five<00:01:20.009> cards<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.430> their<00:01:20.610> hand<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.090> that's

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
with five cards in their hand and that's

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.450 
with five cards in their hand and that's
it<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.689> then<00:01:21.960> going<00:01:22.439> into<00:01:22.590> next<00:01:22.830> person<00:01:23.280> then

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
it and then going into next person then

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.310 
it and then going into next person then
a<00:01:23.700> gamer<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.479> person<00:01:24.720> who's<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:24.960> second

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
a gamer the person who's going second

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.990 
a gamer the person who's going second
will<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:25.590> draw<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.890> card<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.729> person

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
will then draw the card so the person

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.760 
will then draw the card so the person
who<00:01:27.180> goes<00:01:27.270> first<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.720> down<00:01:27.990> one<00:01:28.259> card<00:01:28.439> straight

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
who goes first is down one card straight

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.260 
who goes first is down one card straight

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
unbalanced pneus is still there but not

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.160 
unbalanced pneus is still there but not
as<00:03:08.140> much<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.609> fact<00:03:09.820> that<00:03:09.940> one<00:03:10.209> card<00:03:10.510> the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
as much the the fact that one card the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.280 
as much the the fact that one card the
down<00:03:11.440> one<00:03:11.709> car<00:03:12.090> shouldn't<00:03:13.090> really<00:03:13.660> change

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
down one car shouldn't really change

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.240 
down one car shouldn't really change
that<00:03:14.799> much<00:03:15.390> but<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.570> does<00:03:16.959> mean<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.440> your

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
that much but it does mean that your

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.759 
that much but it does mean that your
opponent<00:03:18.489> can<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.540> know<00:03:19.660> attempt<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.680> at

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
opponent can you know attempt to at

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.860 
opponent can you know attempt to at
least<00:03:20.890> get<00:03:21.100> over<00:03:21.489> that<00:03:21.880> barrier<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:22.750> the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
least get over that barrier that the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.110 
least get over that barrier that the
opponent<00:03:23.230> my<00:03:23.320> setup<00:03:23.769> first<00:03:24.070> turn<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.609> I<00:03:25.060> do

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
opponent my setup first turn and I do

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.729 
opponent my setup first turn and I do
think<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.600> an<00:03:25.720> interesting<00:03:26.019> thing<00:03:26.410> it's

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
think it is an interesting thing it's

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.949 
think it is an interesting thing it's
definitely<00:03:26.890> something<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.430> should<00:03:27.760> be

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
definitely something that should be

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.380 
definitely something that should be
given<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.019> chance<00:03:29.049> like<00:03:29.769> if<00:03:30.069> if<00:03:30.700> Konami<00:03:31.090> want<00:03:31.329> to

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
given a chance like if if Konami want to

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.880 
given a chance like if if Konami want to
try<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:31.720> prove<00:03:31.959> something<00:03:32.470> in<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.680> game<00:03:32.859> that

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
try and prove something in the game that

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
it has been for a very long time if they

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.640 
it has been for a very long time if they
want<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.120> try<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.569> fix<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.260> I'm<00:03:38.410> always

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
of an important part of the game that

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.510 
of an important part of the game that
came<00:04:43.720> with<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.320> risk<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.830> Brennan<00:04:45.280> field

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
came with the risk of Brennan field

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.450 
came with the risk of Brennan field
spells<00:04:45.880> so<00:04:46.570> it's<00:04:46.720> been<00:04:47.020> interesting<00:04:47.500> like<00:04:48.070> I'm

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
spells so it's been interesting like I'm

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.700 
spells so it's been interesting like I'm
not<00:04:48.790> entirely<00:04:49.180> sure<00:04:49.450> how<00:04:49.750> I<00:04:49.780> feel<00:04:50.050> on<00:04:50.110> that<00:04:50.320> I'm

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
not entirely sure how I feel on that I'm

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.550 
not entirely sure how I feel on that I'm
gonna<00:04:50.950> I'm<00:04:51.520> gonna<00:04:51.610> have<00:04:51.850> to<00:04:52.000> see<00:04:52.270> in<00:04:52.560> testing

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
gonna I'm gonna have to see in testing

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.800 
gonna I'm gonna have to see in testing
and<00:04:53.889> in<00:04:54.070> you<00:04:54.520> know<00:04:54.639> in<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.940> future<00:04:55.090> to<00:04:55.360> come<00:04:55.389> of

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
and in you know in the future to come of

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.810 
and in you know in the future to come of
the<00:04:55.930> ocg<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.650> if<00:04:56.740> it<00:04:56.860> comes<00:04:57.040> into<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.460> CGG

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
the ocg and if it comes into the CGG

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.659 
the ocg and if it comes into the CGG
which<00:04:58.330> I<00:04:58.479> think<00:04:58.690> it<00:04:58.810> will<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.169> but<00:04:59.979> I<00:05:00.010> think

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
which I think it will and but I think

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.820 
which I think it will and but I think
it's<00:05:00.820> something<00:05:01.090> that<00:05:01.450> is<00:05:01.690> I<00:05:01.960> don't<00:05:02.710> know<00:05:02.800> i

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
it's something that is I don't know i

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.409 
it's something that is I don't know i
don't<00:05:02.979> think<00:05:03.460> it's<00:05:03.610> gonna<00:05:03.760> be<00:05:03.850> as<00:05:04.060> effective

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
don't think it's gonna be as effective

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.080 
don't think it's gonna be as effective
as<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.320> as<00:05:05.650> some<00:05:05.950> people<00:05:06.190> might<00:05:06.310> think<00:05:06.370> and<00:05:06.880> I

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
as I as some people might think and I

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.219 
as I as some people might think and I
think<00:05:07.120> it's<00:05:07.419> going<00:05:07.539> to<00:05:07.630> be<00:05:07.690> more<00:05:07.900> of<00:05:07.960> an<00:05:08.139> a

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
think it's going to be more of an a

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.080 
think it's going to be more of an a
nuisance<00:05:08.620> than<00:05:08.830> anything<00:05:09.070> yeah<00:05:09.760> that's

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
nuisance than anything yeah that's

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.700 
nuisance than anything yeah that's
