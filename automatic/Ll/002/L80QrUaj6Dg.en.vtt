00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
the game is most definitely set in the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.990 
the game is most definitely set in the
future<00:00:32.780> futuristic<00:00:33.780> technology<00:00:34.670> this<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
future futuristic technology this is the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.610 
future futuristic technology this is the
exoskeleton<00:00:36.660> suit<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.350> see

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
exoskeleton suit that you can see

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.280 
exoskeleton suit that you can see
basically<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.670> suit<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.390> human<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.930> put<00:00:40.140> on

basically a suit that a human can put on
and<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.950> gives<00:00:41.160> him<00:00:41.309> extra<00:00:41.520> strength<00:00:42.059> extra

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and it gives him extra strength extra

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.810 
and it gives him extra strength extra
qualities<00:00:42.930> most<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.770> which<00:00:43.890> demonstrated<00:00:44.520> in

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
qualities most of which demonstrated in

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.119 
qualities most of which demonstrated in
this<00:00:44.910> trailer<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.300> jumping<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.739> extra

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
this trailer is jumping and the extra

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.889 
this trailer is jumping and the extra
resistance<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.850> bullets<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.329> little<00:00:48.570> bit<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
resistance the bullets a little bit and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.130 
resistance the bullets a little bit and
but<00:00:49.710> yet<00:00:49.950> basically<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.730> suit<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.539> massive

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
but yet basically this suit is a massive

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.319 
but yet basically this suit is a massive
part<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.469> storyline<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.190> goes<00:00:53.430> pretty

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
part of the storyline it goes pretty

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.270 
part of the storyline it goes pretty
much<00:00:54.570> plays<00:00:54.930> its<00:00:55.199> part<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.620> every<00:00:55.949> part<00:00:56.219> of

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
much plays its part in every part of

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.580 
much plays its part in every part of
this<00:00:56.399> trailer<00:00:56.730> they<00:00:57.210> go<00:00:57.449> at<00:00:57.660> them<00:00:57.899> basically

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
this trailer they go at them basically

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.349 
this trailer they go at them basically
demonstrating<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> jumping<00:00:59.760> capabilities

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
demonstrating the jumping capabilities

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.689 
demonstrating the jumping capabilities
this<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.140> think<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.859> variations<00:01:02.550> of

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
this I think is one of the variations of

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.179 
this I think is one of the variations of
it<00:01:02.789> because<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.149> looks<00:01:03.300> freaking<00:01:03.690> insane

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
it because it looks freaking insane

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.859 
it because it looks freaking insane
jumping<00:01:05.189> again<00:01:05.309> easily<00:01:06.150> scale<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.720> those

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
jumping again easily scale with those

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.469 
jumping again easily scale with those

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
torch pad which was similar to what they

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.140 
torch pad which was similar to what they
had<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.560> black<00:01:13.830> ops<00:01:14.010> 2<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.400> looks<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
had in black ops 2 it looks like and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.679 
had in black ops 2 it looks like and
feels<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.920> control<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.670> sport<00:01:18.479> maybe

feels like you can control a sport maybe

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.080 
feels like you can control a sport maybe
and<00:01:19.020> things<00:01:19.439> like<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.520> needed<00:01:20.850> any

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
reassurance of this is an exoskeleton

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.580 
reassurance of this is an exoskeleton

is<00:01:31.240> is<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.350> cloaking<00:01:32.740> technology<00:01:32.920> that<00:01:33.370> we

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
is is the cloaking technology that we

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.880 
is is the cloaking technology that we
saw<00:01:33.640> in<00:01:33.670> black<00:01:34.060> ops<00:01:34.210> 2<00:01:34.360> basically<00:01:35.080> we're<00:01:35.650> in

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
saw in black ops 2 basically we're in

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.830 
saw in black ops 2 basically we're in
the<00:01:35.980> single-player<00:01:36.400> you<00:01:36.820> could<00:01:37.120> turn<00:01:37.570> on<00:01:37.750> this

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
the single-player you could turn on this

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.180 
the single-player you could turn on this
cloaking<00:01:38.080> technology<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.680> make<00:01:38.890> you<00:01:39.040> look

invisible to blend in with a background
a<00:01:41.320> little<00:01:41.350> bit<00:01:41.650> more<00:01:41.830> this<00:01:42.400> was<00:01:42.640> something

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
a little bit more this was something

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.910 
a little bit more this was something
really<00:01:43.270> really<00:01:43.420> interested<00:01:44.080> because<00:01:44.350> um<00:01:44.590> I

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
really really interested because um I

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.830 
really really interested because um I
think<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.700> grenade<00:01:46.000> that<00:01:46.300> he<00:01:46.390> threw<00:01:46.660> was

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
think the grenade that he threw was

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.930 
think the grenade that he threw was
actually<00:01:47.200> being<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.680> bit<00:01:48.010> of<00:01:48.040> a<00:01:48.430> distraction

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
actually being a bit of a distraction

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.910 
actually being a bit of a distraction
but<00:01:49.900> I<00:01:49.930> think<00:01:49.990> what<00:01:50.200> happened<00:01:50.590> there<00:01:50.740> is<00:01:50.890> that

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
but I think what happened there is that

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.410 
but I think what happened there is that
he's<00:01:51.160> put<00:01:51.310> down<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:51.640> visor<00:01:51.910> that<00:01:52.180> you<00:01:52.270> can

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
he's put down this visor that you can

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.940 
he's put down this visor that you can
see<00:01:52.600> on<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.840> screen<00:01:52.930> and<00:01:53.230> it's<00:01:53.740> basically

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
see on the screen and it's basically

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.100 
see on the screen and it's basically
made<00:01:54.340> this<00:01:54.520> vision<00:01:54.940> with<00:01:55.060> like<00:01:55.210> x-ray<00:01:55.810> so<00:01:56.050> you

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
made this vision with like x-ray so you

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.780 
made this vision with like x-ray so you
can<00:01:56.260> see<00:01:56.470> through<00:01:56.860> walls<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.370> see<00:01:57.580> people

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
can see through walls and see people

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.480 
can see through walls and see people
x-ray<00:01:58.480> thermal<00:01:58.900> kind<00:01:59.110> of<00:01:59.290> this<00:02:00.100> is<00:02:00.310> just

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
x-ray thermal kind of this is just

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.550 
x-ray thermal kind of this is just
demonstrating<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.180> crazy<00:02:01.540> jumping<00:02:02.110> again<00:02:02.230> as

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
demonstrating the crazy jumping again as

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.560 
demonstrating the crazy jumping again as
I<00:02:02.980> said<00:02:03.010> I<00:02:03.220> think<00:02:03.520> this<00:02:03.640> call<00:02:03.880> of<00:02:03.910> duty's<00:02:04.270> going

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
I said I think this call of duty's going

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.920 
I said I think this call of duty's going
tell<00:02:04.750> a<00:02:04.780> big<00:02:05.140> emphasis<00:02:05.560> on<00:02:05.770> on<00:02:06.190> jumping<00:02:06.790> if<00:02:07.000> if

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
tell a big emphasis on on jumping if if

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.230 
tell a big emphasis on on jumping if if

walls what's down a little fence there
there's<00:02:50.590> absolute<00:02:51.280> bullet<00:02:51.520> proof<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:53.020> this

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
there's absolute bullet proof and this

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.310 
there's absolute bullet proof and this
is<00:02:53.920> kevin<00:02:54.280> spacey<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:55.030> bad<00:02:55.180> guy<00:02:55.420> i'm<00:02:55.720> guessing

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
is kevin spacey the bad guy i'm guessing

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.260 
is kevin spacey the bad guy i'm guessing
hook<00:02:56.800> it<00:02:56.950> up<00:02:57.070> is<00:02:57.280> definitely<00:02:57.850> bad

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
hook it up is definitely bad

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.330 
hook it up is definitely bad

I think he is going to be the leader of

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.760 
I think he is going to be the leader of
one<00:03:00.550> of<00:03:00.580> these<00:03:00.760> pmcs<00:03:01.420> we're<00:03:01.750> basically<00:03:02.170> he's

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
one of these pmcs we're basically he's

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
actually so it doesn't want to help him

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.740 
actually so it doesn't want to help him
out<00:03:06.430> he<00:03:06.580> wants<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:06.910> try<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.150> take<00:03:07.390> them<00:03:07.630> over

or something like that and so this plot

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.720 
or something like that and so this plot
is<00:03:10.630> absolutely<00:03:11.260> insane<00:03:11.610> basically<00:03:12.610> they've
