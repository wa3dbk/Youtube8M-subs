can't live stream anymore go watch that

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.940 
can't live stream anymore go watch that
because<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:40.230> explained<00:03:40.530> I'm<00:03:40.680> not<00:03:40.800> gonna

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
because I explained I'm not gonna

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.229 
because I explained I'm not gonna
explain<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.310> in<00:03:41.489> this<00:03:41.580> one<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:42.120> I'm

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
explain it in this one and I'm

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.370 
explain it in this one and I'm
definitely<00:03:42.360> not<00:03:42.660> gonna<00:03:42.780> explain<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.140> in<00:03:43.290> the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
definitely not gonna explain it in the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.690 
definitely not gonna explain it in the
next<00:03:43.410> showcase<00:03:43.920> video<00:03:44.250> because<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.430> takes

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
next showcase video because that takes

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.729 
next showcase video because that takes
way<00:03:44.850> too<00:03:44.880> much<00:03:45.000> time<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:45.930> there<00:03:46.440> goes<00:03:46.680> the

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
way too much time so there goes the

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.890 
way too much time so there goes the
little<00:03:46.980> sneak<00:03:47.310> peak<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:48.090> I'm<00:03:48.330> going<00:03:48.630> out<00:03:48.780> to

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
little sneak peak that I'm going out to

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.979 
little sneak peak that I'm going out to
finish<00:03:49.560> off<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:50.130> stream<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.390> I've<00:03:51.780> also

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
finish off the stream so and I've also

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.740 
finish off the stream so and I've also
noticed<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.709> since<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.610> record<00:03:54.209> in<00:03:54.450> a

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
noticed that since I record in a

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.550 
noticed that since I record in a
specific<00:03:55.350> quality<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:57.110> it's<00:03:58.110> just<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:58.470> get

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
specific quality the it's just you get

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.650 
specific quality the it's just you get
these<00:03:58.709> little<00:03:59.310> black<00:03:59.550> lines<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.330> kind<00:04:00.480> of

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
these little black lines that kind of

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.140 
these little black lines that kind of
distort<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.500> pixel<00:04:01.890> art<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:02.310> it's<00:04:02.790> not<00:04:02.940> like

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
distort the pixel art so it's not like

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.330 
distort the pixel art so it's not like
that<00:04:03.360> it's<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.019> recording<00:04:04.470> it's<00:04:04.800> just<00:04:05.010> it's

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
that it's the recording it's just it's

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.520 
that it's the recording it's just it's
weird<00:04:05.580> messed<00:04:05.970> up<00:04:06.120> if<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.600> go<00:04:06.780> in<00:04:06.930> close<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.410> can

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
weird messed up if I go in close you can

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.150 
weird messed up if I go in close you can
see<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.890> it's<00:04:08.040> fine<00:04:08.450> let's<00:04:09.450> see<00:04:10.010> okay<00:04:11.010> it's

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
see that it's fine let's see okay it's

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.920 
see that it's fine let's see okay it's
not<00:04:11.340> fine<00:04:11.610> nevermind<00:04:12.060> I<00:04:12.120> take<00:04:12.360> it<00:04:12.480> back<00:04:12.600> I

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
not fine nevermind I take it back I

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
sure you can tell by the color of the

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.730 
sure you can tell by the color of the
whole<00:04:32.520> character<00:04:33.300> at<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.870> ears<00:04:34.140> maybe<00:04:34.530> more

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
whole character at the ears maybe more

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.370 
whole character at the ears maybe more
points<00:04:35.130> but<00:04:35.790> yeah<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.480> want<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.750> see<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:37.050> and

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
points but yeah you want to see that and

yes that will also like I said before
would<00:04:39.360> be<00:04:39.390> a<00:04:39.510> pixel<00:04:39.840> art<00:04:39.960> tutorial<00:04:40.380> in<00:04:40.560> the

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
would be a pixel art tutorial in the

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.400 
would be a pixel art tutorial in the
future
