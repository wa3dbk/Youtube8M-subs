00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.920
 Last Christmas ing direct and unicef 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.490
 they wanted to help all the children without 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.490
 schooling 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.530
 for that we created an interactive short 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.800
 that you saw on a web the monster point 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.800
 org 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.840
 and in which the users had a role 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.840
 important to end the bad 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.430
 He says 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.370
 the short told the story of a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.750
 monster that was going around the world preventing 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.750
 that the children went to school 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.430
 there was only one way to kill him 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.430
 the mobile phone 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.890
 It's me 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.900
 for this the user had to send a 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.280
 sms choosing how he wanted to be 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.780
 pounds of the monster 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.780
 there were four different ways 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.350
 his message reached the protagonists 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.350
 of history and then it happened 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.230
 to each sms meant also a 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.180
 donation of one euro twenty to UNICEF 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.860

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.370

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.790
 people and we raised 197 thousand euros to 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.790
