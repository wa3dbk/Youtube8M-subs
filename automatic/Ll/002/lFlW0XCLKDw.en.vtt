link I actually didn't even build this a
friend<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:14.970> mine<00:01:15.119> built<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.750> he<00:01:15.900> was<00:01:16.049> nice

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
friend of mine built it and he was nice

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.039 
friend of mine built it and he was nice
enough<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> let<00:01:16.860> me<00:01:16.890> review<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.630> did<00:01:18.869> ask

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
enough to let me review it and I did ask

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.140 
enough to let me review it and I did ask
him<00:01:19.380> right<00:01:19.500> before<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.860> started<00:01:19.920> filming<00:01:20.340> what

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
him right before I started filming what

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.320 
him right before I started filming what
was<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.689> most<00:01:21.930> expensive<00:01:22.439> thing<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.330> order

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
was the most expensive thing to order

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.060 
was the most expensive thing to order
for<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.200> were<00:01:25.350> ever<00:01:25.500> thinking<00:01:25.890> about

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
for this if you were ever thinking about

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.580 
for this if you were ever thinking about
building<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.610> because<00:01:27.080> like<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.229> said<00:01:28.290> it's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
building this because like I said it's

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.399 
building this because like I said it's
pretty<00:01:28.829> basic<00:01:29.159> pieces<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.750> can't<00:01:31.110> get<00:01:31.259> all

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
pretty basic pieces you can't get all

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.609 
pretty basic pieces you can't get all
the<00:01:31.530> pieces<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.040> he<00:01:32.130> said<00:01:32.340> these<00:01:32.549> red<00:01:32.880> wheels

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
the pieces but he said these red wheels

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.170 
the pieces but he said these red wheels
we're<00:01:34.619> actually<00:01:34.829> one<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> hardest<00:01:35.970> things

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
we're actually one of the hardest things

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.850 
we're actually one of the hardest things
to<00:01:36.299> find<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:36.930> he<00:01:37.200> said<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
to find I think he said this was the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.980 
to find I think he said this was the
only<00:01:37.979> set<00:01:38.310> they<00:01:38.460> were<00:01:38.520> ever<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.000> maybe<00:01:39.180> he

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
only set they were ever and maybe he

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.859 
only set they were ever and maybe he
ordered<00:01:40.320> him<00:01:40.470> from<00:01:40.680> Germany<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.460> these<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
ordered him from Germany and these to

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.139 
ordered him from Germany and these to
get<00:01:43.049> eight<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.439> them<00:01:43.590> from<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.369> buyer<00:01:44.640> he

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
get eight of them from one buyer he

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.030 
get eight of them from one buyer he
ordered<00:01:45.479> from<00:01:45.630> Germany<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.680> cost<00:01:46.860> like

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
ordered from Germany and it cost like

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.060 
ordered from Germany and it cost like
sixty<00:01:47.490> dollars<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.680> those<00:01:49.680> are<00:01:49.920> some

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
sixty dollars so those are some

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.030 
sixty dollars so those are some
expensive<00:01:50.759> wheels<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.290> never<00:01:52.530> really

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
expensive wheels and I never really

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.580 
expensive wheels and I never really
ain't<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:54.180> guess<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.960> haven't<00:01:55.229> ever<00:01:55.470> seen

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
ain't that I guess I haven't ever seen

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.950 
ain't that I guess I haven't ever seen
them<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:55.979> red<00:01:56.159> before<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.509> that's<00:01:57.780> this

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
them in red before but so that's this

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.940 
them in red before but so that's this
kind<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.380> heads<00:01:58.590> up<00:01:58.799> that's<00:02:00.380> expensive<00:02:01.380> for

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
kind of a heads up that's expensive for

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.600 
kind of a heads up that's expensive for
some<00:02:02.189> wheels<00:02:03.090> right<00:02:03.390> there<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.860> think<00:02:05.159> some

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
some wheels right there and I think some

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.080 
some wheels right there and I think some
of<00:02:05.670> these<00:02:05.759> other<00:02:05.969> pieces<00:02:06.299> aren't<00:02:06.840> real

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
of these other pieces aren't real

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
of these other pieces aren't real

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.619

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.059 
in the description he's got the same

and it can kind of throw you off but
either<00:03:39.720> way<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.290> think<00:03:40.530> they<00:03:40.829> look<00:03:41.040> cool<00:03:41.299> well

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
either way I think they look cool well

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.789 
either way I think they look cool well
let's<00:03:42.419> go<00:03:42.510> ahead<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.810> take<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.959> closer<00:03:43.379> look<00:03:43.530> at

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
let's go ahead and take a closer look at

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.339 
let's go ahead and take a closer look at
the<00:03:43.919> truck<00:03:44.159> here<00:03:44.400> now<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.150> truck<00:03:45.599> is<00:03:45.629> based

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
the truck here now the truck is based

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.099 
the truck here now the truck is based
off<00:03:46.739> of<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:47.069> truck<00:03:47.370> from<00:03:47.549> like<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.940> 1950s<00:03:48.540> and

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
off of a truck from like the 1950s and

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.409 
off of a truck from like the 1950s and
that's<00:03:50.040> really<00:03:50.250> when<00:03:50.489> Lego<00:03:50.729> was<00:03:51.000> starting<00:03:51.329> to

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
that's really when Lego was starting to

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.110 
that's really when Lego was starting to
kind<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.750> pick<00:03:51.989> up<00:03:52.019> production<00:03:52.829> and<00:03:53.120> they

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
kind of pick up production and they

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.110 
kind of pick up production and they
needed<00:03:54.389> a<00:03:54.659> way<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.900> really<00:03:55.530> move<00:03:56.220> their

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
needed a way to really move their

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.479 
needed a way to really move their
product<00:03:57.629> around<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.199> they<00:03:58.349> bought<00:03:58.919> this<00:03:59.159> truck

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
product around so they bought this truck

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.390 
product around so they bought this truck
and<00:03:59.760> I'm<00:04:00.510> correct<00:04:00.900> from<00:04:01.739> listen<00:04:02.069> what<00:04:02.159> bricks

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
and I'm correct from listen what bricks

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.800 
and I'm correct from listen what bricks
are<00:04:02.549> said<00:04:02.760> like<00:04:02.939> I<00:04:02.970> said<00:04:03.209> I'll<00:04:03.299> put<00:04:03.479> a<00:04:03.510> link<00:04:03.689> to

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
are said like I said I'll put a link to

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.599 
are said like I said I'll put a link to
his<00:04:04.019> review<00:04:04.439> he's<00:04:04.680> more<00:04:05.010> knowledgeable<00:04:05.489> on

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
his review he's more knowledgeable on

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.059 
his review he's more knowledgeable on
this<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.000> me<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.329> think<00:04:07.199> this<00:04:07.500> might<00:04:07.680> be<00:04:07.709> the

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
this and me I think this might be the

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.710 
this and me I think this might be the
colors<00:04:08.459> of<00:04:08.669> the<00:04:08.760> original<00:04:09.090> truck<00:04:09.209> maybe<00:04:09.449> not

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
colors of the original truck maybe not

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.259 
colors of the original truck maybe not
but<00:04:10.049> I<00:04:10.229> think<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:10.590> is<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:10.949> colors<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.549> the

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
but I think this is the colors that the

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.649 
but I think this is the colors that the
owner<00:04:12.540> of<00:04:12.799> the<00:04:13.799> Lego<00:04:14.009> company<00:04:14.430> now<00:04:14.669> they<00:04:15.090> got

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
owner of the Lego company now they got

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.719 
owner of the Lego company now they got
to<00:04:15.750> pick<00:04:15.870> these<00:04:16.019> colors<00:04:16.079> out<00:04:16.560> but<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.340> do<00:04:17.400> like

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
to pick these colors out but I do like

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.379 
to pick these colors out but I do like
the<00:04:18.060> it's<00:04:18.840> kind<00:04:18.989> of<00:04:19.079> like<00:04:19.849> the<00:04:20.849> front<00:04:21.180> build

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
the it's kind of like the front build

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.089 
the it's kind of like the front build
here<00:04:21.719> you<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:21.989> kind<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.289> put<00:04:22.529> that<00:04:22.680> on<00:04:22.860> there

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
here you just kind of put that on there

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.060 
here you just kind of put that on there
slide<00:04:24.029> it<00:04:24.270> in<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.810> looks<00:04:25.320> pretty<00:04:25.529> good

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
and you can get into the side here and

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.200 
and you can get into the side here and

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.780 
you can also pop the top off which its
kind<00:04:45.600> of<00:04:45.950> difficult<00:04:46.950> a<00:04:47.220> little<00:04:47.430> bit<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:47.640> give

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
kind of difficult a little bit to give

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.480 
kind of difficult a little bit to give
it<00:04:47.820> back<00:04:48.600> on<00:04:48.870> once<00:04:49.140> you<00:04:49.230> get<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:49.440> off<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:49.980> then

it back on once you get it off and then

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.130 
it back on once you get it off and then
this<00:04:50.640> always<00:04:51.450> this<00:04:51.720> kind<00:04:51.960> of<00:04:52.050> pulls<00:04:52.350> apart<00:04:54.140> so

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
this always this kind of pulls apart so

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.650 
this always this kind of pulls apart so
this<00:04:55.260> one<00:04:55.470> will<00:04:56.070> roll<00:04:56.550> without<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.180> being

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
this one will roll without the being

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.690 
this one will roll without the being
hooked<00:04:57.780> up<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.260> there's<00:04:59.130> where<00:04:59.310> you<00:04:59.400> can<00:04:59.520> put

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
hooked up and there's where you can put

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.930 
hooked up and there's where you can put
all<00:04:59.910> the<00:04:59.940> boxes<00:05:00.660> inside<00:05:01.260> there<00:05:01.770> but<00:05:02.640> like<00:05:02.820> I

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
all the boxes inside there but like I

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.260 
all the boxes inside there but like I
said<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.240> way<00:05:03.330> this<00:05:03.510> is<00:05:03.720> done<00:05:04.460> it's<00:05:05.460> kind<00:05:06.090> of

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
said the way this is done it's kind of

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.260 
said the way this is done it's kind of
that's<00:05:06.810> a<00:05:06.990> little<00:05:07.290> difficult<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:07.800> get<00:05:07.980> it<00:05:08.100> to

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
that's a little difficult to get it to

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.970 
that's a little difficult to get it to
pop<00:05:09.270> on<00:05:09.510> there<00:05:09.660> real<00:05:10.760> that<00:05:11.760> one's<00:05:12.060> real<00:05:12.270> smooth

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
pop on there real that one's real smooth

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.250 
pop on there real that one's real smooth
