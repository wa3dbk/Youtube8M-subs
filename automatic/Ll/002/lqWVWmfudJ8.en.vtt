00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.750
 Hello in my video today I show 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.019
 you how I make my iphone clean 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.840
 so and all you need is 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:16.949
 a microfiber cloth which of course clean 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.800
 should also be one more 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.449
 bowl of water and that was it 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.859
 beautiful 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.810
 and you take a corner of the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.660
 microfiber cloth and dunk in the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 water and squeeze the afterwards 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.570
 little out there this corner just wet and 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.070
 should not be wet 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.200
 then we just go with the wet 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.640
 corner or with the damp corner over the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:46.590
 wet the display everywhere 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:52.949
 so everything will be nice and clean 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:56.010
 carefully when we did that 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.180
 there you see if the display is wet 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.820
 we take another dry corner and 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:08.540
 go over this again with this one 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.020
 display make it nice and dry 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.729
 one can even with 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.680
 However, screen protectors should do 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.710
 be careful that you are not too fast 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.830
 Rubs the screen protectors with it 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.530
 It will not be necessary if we do everything then 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.790
 should have dried well 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.070
 actually no more spots on the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.220
 Otherwise you have to be display 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:34.619
 especially at any points yet 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.220
 there is vision so here you see that 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.220
 Result 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.390
 Now we have the display ready and 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.930
 exactly the same thing I do with the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.430
 strings 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.950
 that is beside me back my 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.910
 Asse corner and go with it on the sides 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:02:00.260
 along each side just once 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:03.060
 over it so that is taken directly 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.590
 and now we take the dry one again 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:12.420
 corner and go around that once again 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.380
 to get everything clean if everything is 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.380
 nice and dry 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.510
 Let's take a look here 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.170
 the back side does just that 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.660
 same 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.890
 that means again with the wet with the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.330
 wet blanket over it 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.670
 even with the camera a little so you 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.370
 stays nice and then we take 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.280
 again a dry corner and go 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.760
 about it so if you did that 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.959
 you are allowed your iphone be clean 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.850
 Except you have a few small ones 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.670
 are not quite clean 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.880
 then he just goes over there single yes 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.370
 that was my video and i hope it has 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.380

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.890
