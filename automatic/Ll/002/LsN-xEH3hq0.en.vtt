with this video is kind of point out the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.509 
with this video is kind of point out the
fact<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.320> sometimes<00:00:10.679> people<00:00:11.130> think<00:00:11.309> they're

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
fact that sometimes people think they're

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.789 
fact that sometimes people think they're
working<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.910> particular<00:00:12.179> error<00:00:12.540> their<00:00:12.809> abs<00:00:13.110> now

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
working a particular error their abs now

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.470 
working a particular error their abs now
when<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:14.009> say<00:00:14.190> ABS<00:00:14.400> was<00:00:14.610> actually<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.059> my

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
when we say ABS was actually in my

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.029 
when we say ABS was actually in my
opinion<00:00:15.509> quite<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.139> lot<00:00:16.350> more<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.740> makes<00:00:16.890> up

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
opinion quite a lot more that makes up

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.470 
opinion quite a lot more that makes up
for<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.340> when<00:00:17.699> most<00:00:17.789> people<00:00:17.910> think<00:00:18.090> their<00:00:18.330> abs

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
for it when most people think their abs

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.060 
for it when most people think their abs
they<00:00:18.630> think<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.289> actual<00:00:19.590> six-pack

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
they think of the actual six-pack

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.560 
they think of the actual six-pack
muscles<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.730> what<00:00:20.820> we<00:00:20.910> call<00:00:21.060> our<00:00:21.180> rectus

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
muscles this is what we call our rectus

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.359 
muscles this is what we call our rectus
abdominis<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:22.650> there's<00:00:22.800> different<00:00:23.130> parts

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
abdominis but there's different parts

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.910 
abdominis but there's different parts
there's<00:00:23.880> different<00:00:24.330> layers<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:25.380> what<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.800> want

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
there's different layers but what I want

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.620 
there's different layers but what I want
to<00:00:26.039> point<00:00:26.160> out<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.369> how<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.939> lot<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.300> people

to point out is how a lot of people

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.029 
to point out is how a lot of people
think<00:00:27.810> they're<00:00:28.019> actually<00:00:28.320> working<00:00:28.529> their<00:00:28.859> abs

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
think they're actually working their abs

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.890 
think they're actually working their abs
the<00:00:29.400> outer<00:00:29.640> part<00:00:29.910> directors<00:00:30.330> abdominis<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
the outer part directors abdominis the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.089 
the outer part directors abdominis the
part<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.260> really<00:00:31.529> see<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.830> all<00:00:31.920> you

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
part that you really see and all you

part that you really see and all you
want<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.340> focus<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.759> but<00:00:33.239> you're<00:00:33.360> actually<00:00:33.480> not

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
want to focus on but you're actually not

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.270 
want to focus on but you're actually not
working<00:00:34.050> them<00:00:34.170> at<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.890> know<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.190> example

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
working them at all you know for example

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.740 
working them at all you know for example
a<00:00:35.610> lot<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.820> people<00:00:36.059> like<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.270> use<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.540> machine

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
a lot of people like to use this machine

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.530 
a lot of people like to use this machine
right<00:00:37.020> here<00:00:37.079> they'll<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.160> an<00:00:38.280> exercise<00:00:38.730> where

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
right here they'll do an exercise where

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.680 
right here they'll do an exercise where
they<00:00:39.660> hop<00:00:39.809> up<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:41.270> they're<00:00:42.270> doing<00:00:42.480> things

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
they hop up and they're doing things

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.160 
they hop up and they're doing things
like<00:00:42.930> leg<00:00:43.890> raises<00:00:44.460> knee<00:00:45.300> raises<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.989> stuff

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
like leg raises knee raises and stuff

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.139 
like leg raises knee raises and stuff
like<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.280> actually<00:00:47.430> break<00:00:47.820> down<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
like that if we actually break down the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.090 
like that if we actually break down the
movement<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.350> think<00:00:49.530> about<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> actions

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
movement and we think about the actions

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.250 
movement and we think about the actions
being<00:00:50.370> done<00:00:50.640> we're<00:00:51.600> not<00:00:51.719> actually<00:00:51.960> working

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
being done we're not actually working

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.200 
being done we're not actually working
the<00:00:52.469> rectus<00:00:52.800> abdominis<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.460> mean<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.090> going

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the rectus abdominis I mean it's going

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.569 
the rectus abdominis I mean it's going
to<00:00:54.300> isometrically<00:00:54.870> contract<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.430> main

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
to isometrically contract but the main

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.979 
to isometrically contract but the main
action<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.059> your<00:00:57.149> rectus<00:00:57.420> abdominis<00:00:57.870> is

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
action of your rectus abdominis is

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.319 
action of your rectus abdominis is
actually<00:00:58.260> flexion<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.609> spine<00:01:00.000> we're<00:01:00.239> not

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
actually flexion of the spine we're not

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.150 
actually flexion of the spine we're not
actually<00:01:00.539> flexing<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.440> spine<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.920> actually

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
actually flexing the spine it's actually

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.860 
actually flexing the spine it's actually
staying<00:01:02.340> neutral<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.940> while<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.690> will

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
staying neutral and while it will

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.170 
staying neutral and while it will
isometrically<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.280> know<00:01:05.400> tense<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.880> because

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
isometrically you know tense up because

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.340 
isometrically you know tense up because
it's<00:01:06.360> supporting<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> weight<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.140> legs

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
it's supporting the weight of your legs

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
it's supporting the weight of your legs
you're<00:01:07.860> actually<00:01:07.979> mainly<00:01:08.340> working<00:01:08.610> things

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you're actually mainly working things

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.600 
you're actually mainly working things
like<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.600> example<00:01:09.630> your<00:01:09.990> hip<00:01:10.140> flexors<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.310> if

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
like for example your hip flexors so if

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.700 
like for example your hip flexors so if
you<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.060> want<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> focus<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.260> those

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
you really want to focus on that those

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.640 
you really want to focus on that those
six-pack<00:01:14.159> style<00:01:14.729> muscles<00:01:15.240> right<00:01:15.689> things<00:01:16.439> like

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
six-pack style muscles right things like

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.270 
six-pack style muscles right things like
hanging<00:01:17.040> leg<00:01:17.220> raises<00:01:17.250> decline<00:01:18.119> leg<00:01:18.330> raises<00:01:18.780> or

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
hanging leg raises decline leg raises or

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.679 
hanging leg raises decline leg raises or
exercise<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> seated<00:01:20.909> leg<00:01:21.060> raise<00:01:21.450> or

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
exercise like a seated leg raise or

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.670 
exercise like a seated leg raise or
roman<00:01:21.930> chair<00:01:22.080> whatever<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> call

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
roman chair whatever you want to call

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.320 
roman chair whatever you want to call
actually<00:01:22.979> aren't<00:01:23.430> your<00:01:23.610> best<00:01:23.790> option<00:01:24.180> because

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
actually aren't your best option because

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.999 
actually aren't your best option because
if<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.900> really<00:01:25.140> want<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> contract<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.890> work

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
if you really want to contract and work

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.590 
if you really want to contract and work
that<00:01:26.130> muscle<00:01:26.369> you're<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.180> want<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.420> do

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that muscle you're going to want to do

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.870 
that muscle you're going to want to do
flexion<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.470> spine<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> crunch<00:01:29.520> or

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
flexion of the spine like a crunch or

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.429 
flexion of the spine like a crunch or
resistant<00:01:30.659> crunch<00:01:30.900> because<00:01:31.049> if<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.290> think

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
resistant crunch because if you think

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.080 
resistant crunch because if you think
about<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:32.130> almost<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> same<00:01:32.640> theory

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
about it it's almost the same theory

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.120 
about it it's almost the same theory
like<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.360> was<00:01:33.540> telling<00:01:34.170> my<00:01:34.229> cameraman<00:01:34.740> earlier

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
like I was telling my cameraman earlier

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.920 
like I was telling my cameraman earlier
is<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.790> were<00:01:35.880> doing<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.090> bicep<00:01:36.450> curl<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
is if you were doing a bicep curl and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.660 
is if you were doing a bicep curl and
you<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.439> hold<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> weight<00:01:37.920> all<00:01:38.520> right

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
you just hold the weight all right

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.039 
you just hold the weight all right
because<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.939> muscles<00:01:39.060> going<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.420> be<00:01:39.780> tense

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
because the muscles going to be tense

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.690 
because the muscles going to be tense
because<00:01:40.259> you're<00:01:40.530> holding<00:01:40.890> wait<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.579> you're

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
because you're holding wait but you're

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.920 
because you're holding wait but you're
not<00:01:41.790> actually<00:01:41.970> contracting<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.720> through<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
not actually contracting it through a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.179 
not actually contracting it through a
range<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.229> motion<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.040> want<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
range of motion so if you really want to

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.399 
range of motion so if you really want to
contract<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.850> work<00:01:45.270> your<00:01:45.390> abs<00:01:45.659> do<00:01:46.290> an

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
contract and work your abs do an

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.139 
contract and work your abs do an
exercise<00:01:46.770> my<00:01:47.130> favorite<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.820> just

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
exercise my favorite one is just

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.429 
exercise my favorite one is just
grabbing<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.509> cable<00:01:48.840> putting<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.140> behind<00:01:49.229> my

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
grabbing a cable putting it behind my

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.610 
grabbing a cable putting it behind my
head<00:01:49.619> standing<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.369> or<00:01:50.729> kneeling<00:01:50.880> down

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
head standing like this or kneeling down

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.980 
head standing like this or kneeling down
and<00:01:51.740> crunching<00:01:52.460> with<00:01:53.030> resistance<00:01:53.540> because

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
and crunching with resistance because

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.200 
and crunching with resistance because
now<00:01:54.140> I'm<00:01:54.290> flexing<00:01:54.800> that<00:01:55.400> spine<00:01:55.730> so<00:01:55.970> throw<00:01:56.120> them

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
now I'm flexing that spine so throw them

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.730 
now I'm flexing that spine so throw them
in<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.330> back<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.600> your<00:01:56.660> head<00:01:56.840> things<00:01:57.350> like<00:01:57.530> leg

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
in the back of your head things like leg

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.130 
in the back of your head things like leg
raises<00:01:58.250> hanging<00:01:59.240> leg<00:01:59.360> raises<00:01:59.390> decline<00:01:59.990> leg

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
raises hanging leg raises decline leg

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.360 
raises hanging leg raises decline leg
rates<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.470> all<00:02:00.560> those<00:02:00.620> variations<00:02:00.890> are<00:02:01.160> still

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
rates and all those variations are still

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.790 
rates and all those variations are still
great<00:02:01.550> exercises<00:02:02.090> but<00:02:02.930> put<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.440> in<00:02:03.530> your<00:02:03.650> head

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
great exercises but put it in your head

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.990 
great exercises but put it in your head
that<00:02:03.830> if<00:02:04.040> you're<00:02:04.160> really<00:02:04.280> trying<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.580> focus<00:02:04.730> on

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
that if you're really trying to focus on

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.090 
that if you're really trying to focus on
the<00:02:05.060> rectus<00:02:05.390> abdominis<00:02:05.900> you<00:02:06.680> want<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:06.920> flex

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
the rectus abdominis you want to flex

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.490 
the rectus abdominis you want to flex
the<00:02:07.610> spine<00:02:07.640> flex<00:02:08.479> away<00:02:08.690> with<00:02:08.840> resistance<00:02:09.260> and

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
the spine flex away with resistance and

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.450 
the spine flex away with resistance and
that's<00:02:09.800> we're<00:02:09.950> going<00:02:10.070> to<00:02:10.130> get<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.310> best
