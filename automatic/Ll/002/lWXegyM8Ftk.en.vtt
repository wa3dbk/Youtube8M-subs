favorite is the as the mutant zombie

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.719 
favorite is the as the mutant zombie
because<00:01:36.110> he<00:01:36.560> can<00:01:36.739> jump<00:01:37.039> up<00:01:37.220> in<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.399> air<00:01:37.550> and

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
because he can jump up in the air and

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.600 
because he can jump up in the air and
hit<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.209> hit<00:01:38.840> down<00:01:39.099> so<00:01:40.099> that<00:01:40.130> mean<00:01:40.489> they're

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
hit and hit down so that mean they're

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.100

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.670 
see this little egg I think I think it's
like<00:02:35.430> 10<00:02:35.760> days<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.480> Minecraft<00:02:37.020> or<00:02:37.200> 10<00:02:37.440> minutes

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
like 10 days in Minecraft or 10 minutes

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.160 
like 10 days in Minecraft or 10 minutes
