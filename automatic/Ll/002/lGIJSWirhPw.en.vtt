okay<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.720> time<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.590> an<00:00:43.680> update<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.250> SGR

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
okay so time for an update on the SGR

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.670 
okay so time for an update on the SGR
looper<00:00:45.240> circuit<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.230> circuits

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
looper circuit and this circuits

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.380 
looper circuit and this circuits
essentially<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.310> same<00:00:47.520> circuit<00:00:47.970> that<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.180> have

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
essentially the same circuit that I have

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.180 
essentially the same circuit that I have
in<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> Tesla<00:00:49.020> torch<00:00:49.230> flashlights<00:00:49.860> I've<00:00:50.070> done

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
in the Tesla torch flashlights I've done

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.650 
in the Tesla torch flashlights I've done
a<00:00:50.220> lot<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.580> experimenting<00:00:51.150> with<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.360> circuit

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
a lot of experimenting with this circuit

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.180 
a lot of experimenting with this circuit
in<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.780> past<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.380> I<00:00:52.410> always<00:00:52.710> felt<00:00:52.950> that<00:00:53.070> I

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
in the past and I always felt that I

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.680 
in the past and I always felt that I
could<00:00:53.370> eke<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.640> little<00:00:53.910> more<00:00:54.060> performance<00:00:54.390> out

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
could eke a little more performance out

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.930 
could eke a little more performance out
of<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.980> today<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.280> had<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.580> bit<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.790> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
of it and today I had a bit of a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.510 
of it and today I had a bit of a
breakthrough<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.050> I've<00:00:58.710> been<00:00:59.160> able<00:00:59.370> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
breakthrough with it I've been able to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.040 
breakthrough with it I've been able to
get<00:00:59.730> some<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.059> prolonged<00:01:00.570> run<00:01:00.809> times

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
get some really prolonged run times

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.710 
get some really prolonged run times
using<00:01:01.850> little<00:01:02.850> tiny<00:01:03.120> electrolytic

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720

microfarad electrolytic capacitor and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.900 
microfarad electrolytic capacitor and
you<00:01:16.229> know<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.590> changed<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.190> winding<00:01:17.520> ratio<00:01:17.820> in

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
you know I changed the winding ratio in

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.120 
you know I changed the winding ratio in
the<00:01:18.000> coil<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.600> added<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.110> germanium<00:01:19.619> diode

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the coil I added this germanium diode

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.430 
the coil I added this germanium diode
here<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.970> try<00:01:21.149> to<00:01:21.180> capture<00:01:21.600> some<00:01:21.810> returned

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
here to try to capture some returned

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.980 
here to try to capture some returned
current<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.190> apart<00:01:23.640> from<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.880> those<00:01:24.840> are

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
current but apart from that those are

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.680 
current but apart from that those are
the<00:01:25.080> only<00:01:25.170> upgrades<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:27.090> had<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.509> mounted

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
the only upgrades and I had it mounted

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.150 
the only upgrades and I had it mounted
on<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.110> breadboard<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.009> was

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
on this breadboard here and it was

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.190 
on this breadboard here and it was
running<00:01:29.399> really<00:01:29.880> really<00:01:30.210> well<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.810> was<00:01:30.930> able<00:01:31.050> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
running really really well I was able to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.230 
running really really well I was able to
do<00:01:31.410> some<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.040> know<00:01:32.070> run<00:01:32.430> times<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
do some you know run times with the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480 
do some you know run times with the
battery<00:01:33.720> or<00:01:34.020> power<00:01:34.290> supply<00:01:34.530> remove<00:01:35.009> even<00:01:35.369> on

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
battery or power supply remove even on

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.160 
battery or power supply remove even on
mylar<00:01:35.880> film<00:01:36.060> caps<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.810> would<00:01:36.899> just<00:01:37.050> keep

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
mylar film caps and it would just keep

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.109 
mylar film caps and it would just keep
blinking<00:01:37.440> along<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.160> going<00:01:38.430> along<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.000> was

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
blinking along and going along so I was

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.480 
blinking along and going along so I was
very<00:01:39.180> excited<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.960> took<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.800> off<00:01:40.890> there<00:01:41.160> brought

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
very excited I took it off there brought

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.490 
very excited I took it off there brought
it<00:01:41.610> all<00:01:41.729> down<00:01:41.940> under<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.330> board<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
it all down under this board and the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.840 
it all down under this board and the
performance<00:01:43.950> level<00:01:44.220> when<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.399> brought<00:01:44.580> down<00:01:44.759> to

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
performance level when I brought down to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.490 
performance level when I brought down to
this<00:01:44.940> board<00:01:45.210> was<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.450> these<00:01:45.720> three<00:01:46.170> LEDs

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
this board was that these three LEDs

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.070 
this board was that these three LEDs
were<00:01:46.830> lit<00:01:47.039> you<00:01:47.459> know<00:01:47.490> very<00:01:47.819> visibly<00:01:48.240> drawing

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
were lit you know very visibly drawing

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.290 
were lit you know very visibly drawing
30<00:01:49.470> micro<00:01:49.830> amps<00:01:50.190> which<00:01:50.550> you<00:01:50.910> know<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.179> was

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
30 micro amps which you know that was

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.300 
30 micro amps which you know that was
just<00:01:51.330> an<00:01:51.660> excellent<00:01:52.229> breakthrough<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.039> far<00:01:53.220> as

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
just an excellent breakthrough as far as

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.550 
just an excellent breakthrough as far as
I<00:01:53.459> was<00:01:53.580> concerned<00:01:54.170> unfortunately<00:01:55.170> now<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.380> I

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
I was concerned unfortunately now that I

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.940 
I was concerned unfortunately now that I
brought<00:01:55.800> this<00:01:56.009> down<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.619> small<00:01:58.619> board

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
brought this down on to the small board

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.010 
brought this down on to the small board
here<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.060> know<00:02:00.179> cleaned<00:02:00.479> everything<00:02:00.720> up

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
here and you know cleaned everything up

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.449 
here and you know cleaned everything up
shortened<00:02:01.470> all<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.679> leads<00:02:01.860> got<00:02:02.100> rid<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.280> all

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
shortened all the leads got rid of all

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.430 
shortened all the leads got rid of all
these<00:02:02.700> clipped<00:02:03.060> leads<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.450> all<00:02:03.539> of<00:02:03.660> that<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
these clipped leads and all of that the

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.050 
these clipped leads and all of that the
circuit<00:02:04.740> doesn't<00:02:04.890> perform<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.459> same<00:02:05.670> you

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
circuit doesn't perform the same you

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.550 
circuit doesn't perform the same you
know<00:02:06.179> initially<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.840> actually<00:02:07.020> thought<00:02:07.289> it<00:02:07.350> was

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
know initially I actually thought it was

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.859 
know initially I actually thought it was
broke<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:08.009> took<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.369> 9-volt<00:02:08.640> battery<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.720> know

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
broke I took the 9-volt battery you know

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.699 
broke I took the 9-volt battery you know
power<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.709> nothing<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:12.150> at<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.020> point<00:02:13.260> you

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
power it nothing and at that point you

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.870 
power it nothing and at that point you
know<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.860> decided<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.310> start<00:02:14.490> fishing<00:02:14.790> around

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
know I decided to start fishing around

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.839 
know I decided to start fishing around
it<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.450> see<00:02:15.959> if<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.170> could<00:02:16.410> bring<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.640> life

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
it and see if I could bring it to life

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.210 
it and see if I could bring it to life
and<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.900> decided<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.440> connect<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.950> ground

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
and I decided to connect a ground

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.030 
and I decided to connect a ground

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
unique to this particular spot I can go

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.979 
unique to this particular spot I can go
all<00:02:37.349> over<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.650> yard<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:38.040> do<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.660> just

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
all over the yard and do this so I just

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.690 
all over the yard and do this so I just
want<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.319> show<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.590> what<00:02:41.190> I'm<00:02:41.280> gonna<00:02:41.400> do<00:02:41.550> here

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
want to show you what I'm gonna do here

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.750 
want to show you what I'm gonna do here
at<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.880> circuit<00:02:42.239> now<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.730> know

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
at the circuit now this is a you know

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.130 
at the circuit now this is a you know
electrolytic<00:02:45.709> 470<00:02:46.709> micro<00:02:47.069> farad<00:02:47.340> capacitor

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
electrolytic 470 micro farad capacitor

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.290 
electrolytic 470 micro farad capacitor
there<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.710> I'm<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.370> going<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.670> charge<00:02:51.030> that

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
there and I'm just going to charge that

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.630 
there and I'm just going to charge that
capacitor<00:02:51.930> up<00:02:52.080> with<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:52.800> 9<00:02:53.040> volt<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:53.460> is<00:02:53.520> a

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
capacitor up with this 9 volt this is a

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.930 
capacitor up with this 9 volt this is a
really<00:02:54.030> old<00:02:54.060> 9<00:02:54.390> volt<00:02:54.630> it's

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
really old 9 volt it's

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.790 
really old 9 volt it's
probably<00:02:55.300> dead<00:02:55.870> but<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.230> doesn't<00:02:56.500> take<00:02:56.650> much

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
probably dead but it doesn't take much

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.290 
probably dead but it doesn't take much
to<00:02:57.040> charge<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.930> little<00:02:58.930> capacitor<00:02:59.380> like<00:02:59.530> that

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
to charge a little capacitor like that

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.160 
to charge a little capacitor like that
and<00:03:01.300> now<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.450> just<00:03:01.510> want<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:01.840> show<00:03:01.960> you<00:03:02.050> what

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
and now I just want to show you what

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.590 
and now I just want to show you what
happens<00:03:02.590> when<00:03:02.710> I<00:03:02.860> touch<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.400> negative<00:03:03.970> lead

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
happens when I touch the negative lead

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.860 
happens when I touch the negative lead
from<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:04.900> capacitor<00:03:05.710> to<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.460> ground<00:03:06.850> so<00:03:07.780> you

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
from that capacitor to the ground so you

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.270 
from that capacitor to the ground so you
see<00:03:08.020> that<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.350> minute<00:03:08.710> I<00:03:08.830> touch<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.250> the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
see that the minute I touch it to the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.650 
see that the minute I touch it to the
ground<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:09.760> circuit<00:03:10.090> comes<00:03:10.270> on<00:03:10.560> lights<00:03:11.560> up<00:03:12.660> so

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
ground the circuit comes on lights up so

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.080 
ground the circuit comes on lights up so
as<00:03:14.350> soon<00:03:14.590> as<00:03:14.710> I<00:03:14.830> saw<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.520> thought<00:03:15.610> that<00:03:15.940> was

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
as soon as I saw that I thought that was

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.980 
as soon as I saw that I thought that was
so<00:03:16.390> cool

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
so cool

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.990 
so cool
and<00:03:17.470> if<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:17.800> make<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.190> contact<00:03:18.670> with<00:03:18.850> the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
and if I make the contact with the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.220 
and if I make the contact with the
ground<00:03:19.210> just<00:03:19.450> right<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:21.690> hold<00:03:22.690> still<00:03:23.020> we

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
ground just right and hold still we

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.720 
ground just right and hold still we
should<00:03:23.410> be<00:03:23.500> able<00:03:23.560> get<00:03:23.710> a<00:03:23.770> pretty<00:03:24.010> long<00:03:24.280> run<00:03:24.550> out

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
should be able get a pretty long run out

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:51.540 
should be able get a pretty long run out
of<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:24.970> so<00:03:25.860> we'll<00:03:26.860> just<00:03:27.070> let<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.340> run<00:03:27.550> here

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.960 

not<00:03:52.550> bad<00:03:52.849> for<00:03:53.239> a<00:03:53.269> 470<00:03:54.140> microfarad

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
not bad for a 470 microfarad

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.190 
not bad for a 470 microfarad
electrolytic<00:03:55.970> capacitor<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:58.989> again<00:03:59.989> I'm

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200

that<00:04:38.510> new<00:04:38.690> ratio<00:04:38.960> it<00:04:39.380> seems<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.830> really<00:04:40.250> make<00:04:40.580> a

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
that new ratio it seems to really make a

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.690 
that new ratio it seems to really make a
difference<00:04:41.060> so<00:04:41.210> you<00:04:42.190> cannot<00:04:43.190> you<00:04:43.370> can<00:04:43.520> tell

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
difference so you cannot you can tell

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.950 
difference so you cannot you can tell
here<00:04:43.910> if<00:04:44.000> you've<00:04:44.150> done<00:04:44.300> experimenting<00:04:44.870> with

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
here if you've done experimenting with

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.260 
here if you've done experimenting with
this<00:04:45.139> guy's<00:04:45.320> stuff<00:04:45.620> before<00:04:45.979> this<00:04:46.700> is<00:04:46.880> a<00:04:46.910> really

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
this guy's stuff before this is a really

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.000 
this guy's stuff before this is a really
long<00:04:47.510> runtime<00:04:48.050> for<00:04:48.350> a<00:04:48.430> 470<00:04:49.430> microfarad

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
long runtime for a 470 microfarad

long runtime for a 470 microfarad
electrolytic<00:04:52.010> like<00:04:52.580> this<00:04:52.900> trying<00:04:53.900> to<00:04:53.960> eat<00:04:54.229> you

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
electrolytic like this trying to eat you

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.820 
electrolytic like this trying to eat you
know<00:04:54.710> see<00:04:55.130> how<00:04:55.160> much<00:04:55.340> I<00:04:55.490> can<00:04:55.639> get<00:04:55.789> out<00:04:56.000> of<00:04:56.030> the

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
know see how much I can get out of the

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.610 
know see how much I can get out of the
system<00:04:57.830> when<00:04:57.950> it<00:04:58.039> comes<00:04:58.220> to<00:04:58.340> runtime<00:04:58.700> but

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
system when it comes to runtime but

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.850 
system when it comes to runtime but
there<00:05:00.620> we<00:05:00.710> go

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.040 

okay<00:05:05.610> so<00:05:05.910> it's<00:05:06.180> getting<00:05:06.360> really<00:05:06.540> late<00:05:06.660> I've

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
okay so it's getting really late I've

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.960 
okay so it's getting really late I've
got<00:05:07.200> to<00:05:07.290> go<00:05:07.380> home<00:05:07.590> but<00:05:07.890> I<00:05:08.400> just<00:05:08.580> want<00:05:08.760> to<00:05:08.850> talk

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
got to go home but I just want to talk

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.400 
got to go home but I just want to talk
to<00:05:09.000> you<00:05:09.150> about<00:05:09.210> a<00:05:09.480> few<00:05:09.780> more<00:05:09.930> things<00:05:09.990> about

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
to you about a few more things about

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.740 
to you about a few more things about
this<00:05:10.680> strange<00:05:11.220> a<00:05:11.520> circuit<00:05:11.940> so<00:05:12.150> in<00:05:12.210> this<00:05:12.330> case<00:05:12.540> I

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
this strange a circuit so in this case I

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.660 
this strange a circuit so in this case I
took<00:05:13.080> both<00:05:13.410> ends<00:05:13.740> of<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.890> clip<00:05:14.010> leads<00:05:14.340> and

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
took both ends of the clip leads and

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.280 
took both ends of the clip leads and
connected<00:05:15.060> them<00:05:15.180> to<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.420> negative<00:05:15.960> on<00:05:16.230> the

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
connected them to the negative on the

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.190 
connected them to the negative on the
capacitor<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:18.300> what<00:05:18.510> I<00:05:18.540> noticed<00:05:18.990> is<00:05:19.170> that

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
capacitor and what I noticed is that

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.000 
capacitor and what I noticed is that
when<00:05:19.500> I<00:05:19.770> bring<00:05:20.610> these<00:05:21.240> wires<00:05:21.840> into<00:05:22.050> proximity

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
when I bring these wires into proximity

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.920 
when I bring these wires into proximity
with<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.160> ground<00:05:23.520> like<00:05:23.760> this<00:05:23.790> the<00:05:24.600> circuit

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
with the ground like this the circuit

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.710 
with the ground like this the circuit
turns<00:05:25.050> on<00:05:25.350> I<00:05:25.590> thought<00:05:26.430> that<00:05:26.700> was<00:05:26.880> so<00:05:27.180> strange

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
turns on I thought that was so strange

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.110 
turns on I thought that was so strange
you<00:05:28.110> know<00:05:28.980> there's<00:05:29.130> obviously<00:05:29.490> some<00:05:29.790> sort<00:05:30.000> of

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
you know there's obviously some sort of

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.170 
you know there's obviously some sort of
an<00:05:30.240> effect<00:05:30.330> going<00:05:30.900> on<00:05:31.080> between<00:05:31.320> the<00:05:31.680> ground

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
an effect going on between the ground

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.780 
an effect going on between the ground
and<00:05:33.180> my<00:05:33.990> body<00:05:34.320> over<00:05:35.280> here<00:05:35.310> where<00:05:35.550> I'm<00:05:35.610> touching

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
and my body over here where I'm touching

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.520 
and my body over here where I'm touching
the<00:05:36.090> LEDs<00:05:36.420> on<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.660> left<00:05:36.900> side<00:05:37.080> it<00:05:37.290> must<00:05:37.440> be

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
the LEDs on the left side it must be

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.700 
the LEDs on the left side it must be
acting<00:05:37.890> like<00:05:37.980> an<00:05:38.130> aerial<00:05:38.550> of<00:05:38.790> some<00:05:39.780> sort<00:05:40.050> but

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
acting like an aerial of some sort but

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.660 
acting like an aerial of some sort but
you<00:05:40.800> know<00:05:40.890> I've<00:05:40.980> tried<00:05:41.130> this<00:05:41.280> in<00:05:41.430> different

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.670 
you know I've tried this in different

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.040 
you know I've tried this in different
places<00:05:41.880> in<00:05:42.150> the<00:05:42.240> yard<00:05:42.450> I<00:05:42.600> don't<00:05:42.750> have<00:05:42.900> any

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
places in the yard I don't have any

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.200 
places in the yard I don't have any
exciters<00:05:43.560> turned<00:05:43.860> on<00:05:44.010> or<00:05:44.190> anywhere<00:05:44.460> you<00:05:45.090> know

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
exciters turned on or anywhere you know

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.690 
exciters turned on or anywhere you know
and<00:05:45.740> I'm<00:05:46.740> getting<00:05:46.980> this<00:05:47.100> really<00:05:47.310> interesting

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
and I'm getting this really interesting

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.600 
and I'm getting this really interesting
behavior<00:05:48.360> so<00:05:48.630> I<00:05:48.840> will<00:05:49.680> continue<00:05:50.070> to<00:05:50.190> explore

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
behavior so I will continue to explore

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.040 
behavior so I will continue to explore
this<00:05:50.970> you<00:05:51.750> know<00:05:52.140> I'm<00:05:52.530> not<00:05:52.830> going<00:05:53.160> to<00:05:53.310> stop

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
this you know I'm not going to stop

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.150 
this you know I'm not going to stop
experimenting<00:05:55.050> on<00:05:55.140> this<00:05:55.290> particular<00:05:55.590> circuit

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
experimenting on this particular circuit

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.350 
experimenting on this particular circuit
I<00:05:56.250> would<00:05:56.430> really<00:05:56.610> like<00:05:56.790> to<00:05:56.940> get<00:05:57.030> this<00:05:57.240> to

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
I would really like to get this to

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.060 
I would really like to get this to
operate<00:05:57.780> like<00:05:57.930> this<00:05:57.990> without<00:05:58.410> a<00:05:58.680> ground

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
operate like this without a ground

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.340 
operate like this without a ground
connection<00:05:59.510> you<00:06:00.510> know<00:06:00.600> I<00:06:00.630> need<00:06:00.930> to<00:06:00.960> come<00:06:01.200> up

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
connection you know I need to come up

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.140 
connection you know I need to come up
with<00:06:01.500> some<00:06:01.650> component<00:06:02.190> arrangement<00:06:03.000> that

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
with some component arrangement that

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.840 
with some component arrangement that
will<00:06:03.270> allow<00:06:03.540> this<00:06:03.720> behavior<00:06:04.350> so<00:06:04.590> that<00:06:05.370> it<00:06:05.730> can

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
will allow this behavior so that it can

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.390 
will allow this behavior so that it can
be<00:06:05.940> encapsulated<00:06:06.240> down<00:06:06.960> into<00:06:07.260> a<00:06:07.290> Tesla<00:06:08.160> torque

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
be encapsulated down into a Tesla torque

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.200 
be encapsulated down into a Tesla torque
flashlight<00:06:08.930> but<00:06:09.930> anyway<00:06:11.060> you<00:06:12.060> see<00:06:12.270> the<00:06:12.420> effect

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
flashlight but anyway you see the effect

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.880 
flashlight but anyway you see the effect
okay<00:06:15.210> so<00:06:15.270> I'm<00:06:15.990> gonna<00:06:16.140> put<00:06:16.290> all<00:06:16.380> this<00:06:16.500> away<00:06:16.620> for

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
okay so I'm gonna put all this away for

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.170 
okay so I'm gonna put all this away for
the<00:06:16.980> night<00:06:17.100> I<00:06:17.160> just<00:06:17.280> want<00:06:17.580> to<00:06:17.640> show<00:06:17.700> you<00:06:17.820> one<00:06:18.030> of

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
the night I just want to show you one of

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.510 
the night I just want to show you one of
their<00:06:18.270> crazy<00:06:18.570> effects<00:06:18.990> so<00:06:19.620> check<00:06:19.890> this<00:06:20.040> out<00:06:20.250> I

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
their crazy effects so check this out I

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.910 
their crazy effects so check this out I
connect<00:06:21.150> the<00:06:21.630> battery<00:06:21.960> to<00:06:22.050> the<00:06:22.440> electrolytic

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:22.920 
connect the battery to the electrolytic

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.560 
connect the battery to the electrolytic
capacitor<00:06:23.310> charge<00:06:23.580> this<00:06:23.760> up<00:06:24.030> just<00:06:24.060> like<00:06:24.360> you'd

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
capacitor charge this up just like you'd

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.380 
capacitor charge this up just like you'd
expect<00:06:25.010> until<00:06:26.010> I<00:06:26.370> remove<00:06:26.610> the<00:06:26.760> battery<00:06:27.120> and

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390 
expect until I remove the battery and

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.810 
expect until I remove the battery and
then<00:06:27.750> notice<00:06:28.260> that<00:06:28.530> when<00:06:28.890> I<00:06:28.920> connect<00:06:29.460> it<00:06:29.640> to

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
then notice that when I connect it to

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.490

all right folks want to let this run

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.870 
all right folks want to let this run
because<00:07:29.930> it's<00:07:30.170> fairly<00:07:31.010> bright<00:07:31.280> it<00:07:31.520> should<00:07:31.730> run

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:31.880 
because it's fairly bright it should run

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.330 
because it's fairly bright it should run
down<00:07:32.060> pretty<00:07:32.300> quick<00:07:32.660> on<00:07:32.840> a<00:07:32.960> 470<00:07:33.950> microfarad
