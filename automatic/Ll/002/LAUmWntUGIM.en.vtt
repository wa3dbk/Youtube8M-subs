it's somewhat static compared to the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.470 
it's somewhat static compared to the
next<00:02:20.040> photograph<00:02:20.220> where<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.760> raise<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.270> camera

up bring the horizon line down to the
bottom<00:02:23.970> third<00:02:24.180> utilize<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.050> bleeding<00:02:25.350> line

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
bottom third utilize this bleeding line

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.070 
bottom third utilize this bleeding line
and<00:02:26.070> take<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> look<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.090> now<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.390> forest<00:02:27.870> is

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
and take a look and now the forest is

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.560 
and take a look and now the forest is
much<00:02:28.320> taller<00:02:28.620> greater<00:02:29.400> grandeur<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.210> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
forest as we say and now I think you'll

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.100 
forest as we say and now I think you'll
agree<00:02:32.880> it's<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.240> much<00:02:33.390> better<00:02:33.570> image<00:02:33.930> we've

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
agree it's a much better image we've

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.350
