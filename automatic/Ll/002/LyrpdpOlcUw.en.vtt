00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.260
 hi to all friends of the world gamers me 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.780
 are clear welcome in this new one 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.910
 Minecraft tutorial today I will explain 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.360
 a bit like creating this simple 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.690
 lift then we go immediately to see 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.720
 let's create the hole the size of 4x2 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.110
 and deep 2 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:58.449
 in this way we then place blocks 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:02.329
 so with two director torches on it 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.979
 I return here and I here 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.340
 I recommend this right 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.190
 put it late to two is an institution 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:15.289
 with the repsol 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:18.850
 now let's put another one like peter to which e 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:21.560
 let's start building our elevator 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.960
 this will be less bad the size 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.830
 the elevator can do it a while ago 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.979
 how much you want 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.780
 for reasons of time we will do a little more 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:37.850
 small but you can do it too 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:42.500
 very long then after that to this 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.930
 point put a block here and start a 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.299
 make a block until block it un 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.689
 block lock up a lock hangs 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.570
 up to the top 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.159
 of this same thing only must be 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.689
 in reverse 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:02.630
 that is, with a block you see ours 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.319
 block here here and here 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.440
 here we can safely close 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:13.750
 then we put our ours of 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.790
 peter here you can if you speak as you like 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.620
 the important thing is that everyone is accepted 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.040
 with the same delay 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:28.790
 otherwise it will not work what time 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:35.209
 let's build a wall behind that will serve us 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:37.329
 to place flashlights here in here 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.329
 forward 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:47.620
 consider that our elevator will be 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:51.550
 turned on this side then that 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:55.330
 we have to do cover these these 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.270
 repeaters you can see that you have to 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.030
 always only and exclusively to work 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.650
 alternately as in the whole 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.560
 tutorial you will see that the cubes will come 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.040
 set nightmare symbol here we place others 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.630
 doubts 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:19.090
 always in the same as the comfortable at 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:23.200
 end you can close we place the 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:26.440
 top said the torches on the outside 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.120
 I always recommend first or put in 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.120
 the bottom of the cube and not over in this way 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.820
 I have here on the side 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.290
 always put them at the bottom 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.290
 same thing from this other side 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:50.090
 let's cover let's put that income 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:59.269
 ok at this point we only have to 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:04.840
 fix the alternation we always cover 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:08.900
 alternately in this way 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.150
 Here we can close we place on 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.879
 the heir to the reds torches always in 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.430
 bottom I recommend this enough 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:21.370
 important otherwise it will not work 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:27.290
 the facility ok at this point we have to 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:34.520
 only put the circuit to open the 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:37.400
 we will place here we place blocks a 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.740
 right and left and the ladders boys 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.289
 an important thing is that when you activate 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.560
 of the circuit you must immediately 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.660
 soaring over this block is one thing 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.630
 very important because they remained 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:58.039
 I don't know if it fits 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:05:02.770
 however now we place all the pistons 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:06.750
 pisticci so to the top 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:13.150
 also from this other side 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:15.760
 so and then obviously our stairs in 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.840
 do like me is the first time I put it 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.100
 the stairs upside down 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.840
 in this way they obviously died 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.090
 as right as it is 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.140
 I recommend you put the stairs like 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.420
 they usually stop at this point 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.300
 we are almost done with the only thing 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.980
 we have to settle and make sure that 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.430
 once you get to the top 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:42.850
 we are pushed out of the system because 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.720
 otherwise we fall happy if I am 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:49.170
 high enough 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:54.060
 obviously dying then we place 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:06:01.419
 of the cubes in this way 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:08.370
 here some stairs and we put two pistons 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:10.840
 at the bottom with two pole tubes per 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.840
 ignition we place a torch 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:18.660
 direct i am here i recommend is the 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.660
 second cube starting from the left 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:27.630
 let's do some kind of scale 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.910
 in this way 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:33.580
 we put two of peter set to maximum 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.480
 you can also set yourself in this case a 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.780
 as you like 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.690
 I said 3 because of the timing 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:43.770
 it's quite perfect though 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:47.380
 you can even do it differently 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:50.190
 it's ok at this point the circuit is 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.190
 completed 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:59.260
 as you can see it works the only one 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:03.940
 the only thing about this system and 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:09.280
 get off to get off the board that 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.880
 vi do is to create a small waterfall 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.040
 of water 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:17.860
 in this way you can go down 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:21.760
 quite quietly ok guys 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:25.450
 with this video we are done 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.190
 if you liked it put me like me 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.740
 I recommend boys sign up e 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.550
 comment us let us know a little about yours 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.790
 opinions 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.300
 we are here we listen to all that 

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.820
 what you tell us 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.820
 and with that is all this
