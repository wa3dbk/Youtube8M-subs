cell<00:00:01.850> nucleus<00:00:04.640> the<00:00:05.640> nucleus<00:00:06.120> holds<00:00:06.960> on<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.500> the

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
cell nucleus the nucleus holds on to the

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.890 
cell nucleus the nucleus holds on to the
information<00:00:08.309> it's<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.510> big<00:00:09.840> red<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.710> middle

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
information it's a big red in the middle

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.560 
information it's a big red in the middle
the<00:00:12.900> nucleolus<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:14.340> sitting<00:00:15.089> in<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> middle

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
the nucleolus is sitting in the middle

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.220 
the nucleolus is sitting in the middle
inside<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.340> nucleus<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.630> big<00:00:18.900> blob

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
inside of the nucleus it's a big blob

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.620 
inside of the nucleus it's a big blob
dark<00:00:19.980> patch<00:00:21.980> now<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.039> nucleolus<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.510> were

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
dark patch now the nucleolus if we were

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.679 
dark patch now the nucleolus if we were
to<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.960> our<00:00:25.140> city<00:00:25.500> let's<00:00:26.220> say<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.670> nucleus<00:00:27.180> was

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
to be our city let's say the nucleus was

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.640 
to be our city let's say the nucleus was
a<00:00:27.720> castle<00:00:28.349> then<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.990> nucleolus<00:00:30.990> would<00:00:31.529> be

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
a castle then the nucleolus would be

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.420 
a castle then the nucleolus would be
like<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.130> King's<00:00:32.430> Chamber<00:00:33.530> so<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:35.070> cell

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
like the King's Chamber so the cell

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.299 
like the King's Chamber so the cell
would<00:00:36.120> be<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> city<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.350> then<00:00:37.890> we<00:00:38.070> have

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
would be like the city and then we have

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.940 
would be like the city and then we have
the<00:00:38.969> castle<00:00:39.600> which<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> middle<00:00:40.680> that's

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the castle which is in the middle that's

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.420 
the castle which is in the middle that's
the<00:00:41.040> nucleus<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:42.329> where<00:00:42.600> all<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
the nucleus and then where all the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.080 
the nucleus and then where all the
permissions<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.920> requirements<00:00:46.920> needed<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
permissions and requirements needed the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
permissions and requirements needed the
guy<00:00:48.239> who's<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> main<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.289> boss<00:00:49.500> kind<00:00:49.950> of

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
guy who's in the main the boss kind of

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.520 
guy who's in the main the boss kind of
that<00:00:50.730> would<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:51.090> equivalent<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
that would be equivalent to the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.330 
that would be equivalent to the
nucleolus

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
nucleolus

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
nucleolus
and<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.170> modern-day<00:00:55.829> city<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
and if it was a modern-day city then the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.910 
and if it was a modern-day city then the
nucleus<00:00:57.809> would<00:00:58.079> be<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> government

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
nucleus would be like a government

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.560 
nucleus would be like a government
building<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.710> nucleolus<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
building and the nucleolus is the

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.000 
building and the nucleolus is the
equivalent<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.140> main<00:01:04.409> office<00:01:07.010> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
equivalent of the main office the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.340 
equivalent of the main office the
nucleus<00:01:08.520> holds<00:01:08.939> information<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.810> know<00:01:10.020> that

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
nucleus holds information we know that

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.010 
nucleus holds information we know that
what<00:01:11.100> are<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.939> information<00:01:12.180> inside<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
what are the information inside the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.789 
what are the information inside the
nucleus<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:14.100> called<00:01:14.630> chromatin<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.960> it's

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
nucleus it's called chromatin and it's

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.120 
nucleus it's called chromatin and it's
kind<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.220> squiggly<00:01:17.850> spaghetti<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:19.130> its

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
kind of like squiggly spaghetti like its

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.450 
kind of like squiggly spaghetti like its
holds<00:01:21.090> DNA<00:01:21.689> inside<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.979> those<00:01:23.250> are

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
holds DNA inside of it so those are

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.289 
holds DNA inside of it so those are
chromatin<00:01:24.380> inside<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> chromatin<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:27.320> DNA<00:01:29.299> so

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
chromatin inside the chromatin is DNA so

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.319 
chromatin inside the chromatin is DNA so
if<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.960> were<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.200> think<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.460> nucleus<00:01:33.090> is

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
if you were to think that the nucleus is

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.530 
if you were to think that the nucleus is
like<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> computer<00:01:34.170> then<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.430> chromatin<00:01:36.060> are

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
like a computer then the chromatin are

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.179 
like a computer then the chromatin are
the<00:01:37.200> hard<00:01:37.560> drives<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:40.079> DNA<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
the hard drives and the DNA is

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.139 
the hard drives and the DNA is
equivalent<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.420> files<00:01:43.399> inside<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.790> hard

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
equivalent to the files inside the hard

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.330 
equivalent to the files inside the hard
drive<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:48.090> nucleus<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.259> nothing<00:01:49.890> more<00:01:50.130> than

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
drive the nucleus is nothing more than

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.630 
drive the nucleus is nothing more than
it's<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.119> big<00:01:51.360> membrane<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.950> holds<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
it's just a big membrane that holds the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.580 
it's just a big membrane that holds the
chromatin<00:01:54.149> that's<00:01:54.720> all<00:01:54.869> that's<00:01:55.259> all<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
chromatin that's all that's all the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.800 
chromatin that's all that's all the
nucleus<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.340> nothing<00:01:56.729> else<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.600> a

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
nucleus is nothing else it's just a

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.370 
nucleus is nothing else it's just a
place<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.860> stores<00:01:59.219> information<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:01.200> word

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
place that stores information the word

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.380 
place that stores information the word
nucleus<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.310> means<00:02:02.689> central<00:02:03.689> part<00:02:04.969> now<00:02:05.969> next

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
nucleus it means central part now next

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.290 
nucleus it means central part now next
we're<00:02:06.630> going<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.810> talk<00:02:06.930> about<00:02:07.079> ribosome

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
we're going to talk about ribosome

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.850 
we're going to talk about ribosome
remember<00:02:09.300> ribosomes<00:02:09.959> are<00:02:10.200> equivalent<00:02:10.530> to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
remember ribosomes are equivalent to

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.670 
remember ribosomes are equivalent to
stores<00:02:11.459> we<00:02:11.940> have<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.090> bunch<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.450> free-floating

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
stores we have a bunch of free-floating

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.190 
stores we have a bunch of free-floating
and<00:02:13.950> there<00:02:14.159> are<00:02:14.340> those<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.700> are<00:02:15.030> attached<00:02:15.480> so

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and there are those that are attached so

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.470 
and there are those that are attached so
the<00:02:16.319> ribosomes<00:02:16.950> are<00:02:17.370> equivalent<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.060> store

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
the ribosomes are equivalent to store

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.210 
the ribosomes are equivalent to store
that<00:02:18.659> produce<00:02:18.870> food<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.379> clothes<00:02:19.829> as<00:02:20.010> such

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
that produce food and clothes as such

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.420 
that produce food and clothes as such
but<00:02:20.879> in<00:02:21.060> order<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.540> set<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:21.900> stores<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:23.280> need

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
but in order to set up stores you need

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.350 
but in order to set up stores you need
permission<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.760> will<00:02:26.909> need<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.060> get<00:02:27.299> your

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
permission so you will need to get your

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.360 
permission so you will need to get your
permission<00:02:27.599> from<00:02:28.290> either<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.769> government<00:02:29.069> or

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
permission from either the government or

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.699 
permission from either the government or
the<00:02:29.549> king<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.150> remember<00:02:30.870> that's<00:02:31.230> equivalent

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
the king and remember that's equivalent

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.390 
the king and remember that's equivalent
to<00:02:32.099> our<00:02:32.129> nucleolus<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.079> other<00:02:34.200> word<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
to our nucleolus so in other word the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.890 
to our nucleolus so in other word the
nucleolus<00:02:36.060> produce<00:02:36.950> ribosomes<00:02:41.569> so<00:02:42.569> in<00:02:42.720> order

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
nucleolus produce ribosomes so in order

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.440 
nucleolus produce ribosomes so in order
to<00:02:43.170> set<00:02:43.470> up<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.769> store<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.730> order<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.090> set<00:02:45.329> up

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
to set up a store in order to set up

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.280 
to set up a store in order to set up
stores<00:02:46.519> you<00:02:47.519> need<00:02:47.819> permission<00:02:48.510> from<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:49.019> king

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
stores you need permission from the king

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.319 
stores you need permission from the king
and<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> government<00:02:50.040> therefore<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:51.180> need

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
and the government therefore you need

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.949 
and the government therefore you need
the<00:02:51.540> nucleolus<00:02:52.049> so<00:02:52.889> the<00:02:53.010> nucleolus<00:02:53.700> is

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
the nucleolus so the nucleolus is

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.559 
the nucleolus so the nucleolus is
responsible<00:02:54.959> for<00:02:55.590> creating<00:02:56.579> ribosomes<00:02:57.329> and

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
responsible for creating ribosomes and

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.360 
responsible for creating ribosomes and
the<00:02:58.290> nucleus<00:02:58.889> the<00:02:59.430> stores<00:02:59.819> information<00:03:00.920> so<00:03:01.920> if

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
the nucleus the stores information so if

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.550 
the nucleus the stores information so if
you<00:03:02.609> were<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.879> do<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.150> math<00:03:03.389> here<00:03:03.930> the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
you were to do the math here the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.920 
you were to do the math here the
nucleolus<00:03:05.310> produced<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.000> ribosome<00:03:06.480> the

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
nucleolus produced the ribosome the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.899 
nucleolus produced the ribosome the
Kings<00:03:07.230> or<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.620> government<00:03:07.980> give<00:03:08.220> permission

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
Kings or the government give permission

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.589 
Kings or the government give permission
in<00:03:09.120> order<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.510> create<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.560> store<00:03:11.329> in<00:03:12.329> order<00:03:12.420> to

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
in order to create the store in order to

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.030 
in order to create the store in order to
lease<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.049> store<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.439> order<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.799> where

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
lease the store in order to you where

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.679 
lease the store in order to you where
you<00:03:14.099> want<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.340> sell<00:03:14.549> something<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.540> need

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
you want to sell something you need

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.470 
you want to sell something you need
permission<00:03:15.930> from<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:17.280> top<00:03:17.760> guy<00:03:18.000> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
permission from the top guy the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.930 
permission from the top guy the
government<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.829> create<00:03:20.160> your<00:03:20.250> stores<00:03:20.609> that's

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
government you create your stores that's

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.059 
government you create your stores that's
the<00:03:21.030> ribosome<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.750> then<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.260> ribosome<00:03:22.709> make

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
the ribosome and then the ribosome make

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.819 
the ribosome and then the ribosome make
stuff<00:03:23.400> like<00:03:23.639> proteins<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.989> stores<00:03:25.349> sell

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
stuff like proteins so the stores sell

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.039 
stuff like proteins so the stores sell
stuff<00:03:26.190> like<00:03:26.549> food<00:03:26.819> clothes<00:03:27.180> whatever<00:03:27.540> for<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
stuff like food clothes whatever for the

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.250 
stuff like food clothes whatever for the
city<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:28.980> ribosome<00:03:29.489> provides<00:03:29.940> stuff<00:03:30.269> for

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
city so the ribosome provides stuff for

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.530 
city so the ribosome provides stuff for
the<00:03:31.379> city<00:03:31.650> but<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.370> order<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:32.669> provide<00:03:33.030> stuff

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
the city but in order to provide stuff

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.339 
the city but in order to provide stuff
for<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.959> city<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.949> need<00:03:35.159> permission<00:03:35.459> to

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
for the city you need permission to

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.110 
for the city you need permission to
provide<00:03:37.349> them<00:03:37.500> stuff<00:03:37.769> so<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:38.519> other<00:03:38.609> words<00:03:38.879> the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
provide them stuff so in other words the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.659 
provide them stuff so in other words the
ribosome<00:03:39.540> provide<00:03:39.889> proteins<00:03:40.889> for<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.340> cell

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
ribosome provide proteins for the cell

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.089 
ribosome provide proteins for the cell
but<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:42.659> order<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:42.989> do<00:03:43.319> that<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.949> ribosome

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
but in order to do that the ribosome

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.460 
but in order to do that the ribosome
needs<00:03:44.609> to<00:03:44.760> be<00:03:44.849> created<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.599> it<00:03:45.930> comes<00:03:46.199> from

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
needs to be created and it comes from

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.729 
needs to be created and it comes from
the<00:03:46.799> nucleolus<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:48.540> nucleus<00:03:49.139> stores

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
the nucleolus the nucleus stores

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.280 
the nucleolus the nucleus stores
information<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.729> those<00:03:51.449> informations<00:03:52.109> are

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
information and those informations are

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.680 
information and those informations are
called<00:03:52.560> chromatin<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.609> that's<00:03:54.359> pretty<00:03:54.569> much

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
called chromatin and that's pretty much

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:02.469 
called chromatin and that's pretty much
it<00:03:54.900> about<00:03:55.109> the<00:03:55.229> nucleus<00:03:55.620> for<00:03:55.829> now<00:03:57.919> at<00:03:58.919> least<00:03:58.979> I

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:02.479 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:07.219 

give<00:04:03.479> me<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.720> bad<00:04:03.930> news<00:04:03.959> first<00:04:05.750> you<00:04:06.750> have<00:04:06.930> AIDS

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
give me the bad news first you have AIDS

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:11.180 
give me the bad news first you have AIDS
oh<00:04:08.599> no<00:04:09.599> what<00:04:09.989> could<00:04:10.139> possibly<00:04:10.650> be<00:04:10.739> worse<00:04:10.859> than

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
oh no what could possibly be worse than

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.189 
oh no what could possibly be worse than
that

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
that

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:17.029 
that
you<00:04:13.199> also<00:04:13.379> have<00:04:13.709> Alzheimer<00:04:14.310> disease<00:04:14.459> oh<00:04:16.039> well

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
you also have Alzheimer disease oh well

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.800 
you also have Alzheimer disease oh well
that's<00:04:17.220> okay<00:04:17.519> that's<00:04:17.909> not<00:04:18.120> so<00:04:18.180> bad<00:04:18.299> at<00:04:18.599> least<00:04:18.690> I

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
that's okay that's not so bad at least I

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.360 
that's okay that's not so bad at least I
don't<00:04:18.870> have<00:04:19.079> AIDS<00:04:21.320> so<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.349> doctor<00:04:22.590> was<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.219> bad

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
don't have AIDS so a doctor was the bad

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.090 
don't have AIDS so a doctor was the bad
news<00:04:23.400> for<00:04:23.789> today
