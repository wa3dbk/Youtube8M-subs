00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
tutorial videos I was showing off from

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.970 
tutorial videos I was showing off from
the<00:00:18.000> features<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.600> called<00:00:18.960> slip<00:00:19.380> mode<00:00:19.619> and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
the features on it called slip mode and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.470 
the features on it called slip mode and
absolutely<00:00:20.490> love<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.880> feature<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.270> was<00:00:21.390> one

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
absolutely love that feature I was one

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.090 
absolutely love that feature I was one
of<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> main<00:00:21.750> activists<00:00:22.470> fighting<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.980> get

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
of the main activists fighting to get

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.400 
of the main activists fighting to get
that<00:00:23.280> put<00:00:23.460> onto<00:00:23.610> the<00:00:23.790> CDJ<00:00:24.240> mm<00:00:24.930> as<00:00:25.020> well

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
that put onto the CDJ mm as well

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.710 
that put onto the CDJ mm as well
slightly<00:00:26.040> been<00:00:26.280> put<00:00:26.490> into<00:00:26.700> the<00:00:26.820> nexus<00:00:27.330> but<00:00:27.600> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
slightly been put into the nexus but the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.900 
slightly been put into the nexus but the
problem<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.170> not<00:00:28.680> many<00:00:28.860> DJ's<00:00:29.220> are<00:00:29.370> using<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.789> I

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
problem is not many DJ's are using it I

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.490 
problem is not many DJ's are using it I
think<00:00:30.120> there's<00:00:30.390> only<00:00:30.480> myself<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.110> partly

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
think there's only myself and partly

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.869 
think there's only myself and partly
raised<00:00:31.680> I've<00:00:31.890> actually<00:00:32.039> seen<00:00:32.279> use<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.610> out<00:00:32.730> in

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
raised I've actually seen use it out in

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.520 
raised I've actually seen use it out in
the<00:00:32.940> club<00:00:33.149> despite<00:00:33.510> most<00:00:33.690> clubs<00:00:34.050> now<00:00:34.230> I've<00:00:34.410> in

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the club despite most clubs now I've in

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.619 
the club despite most clubs now I've in
the<00:00:34.620> Nexus<00:00:35.039> so<00:00:35.730> far<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.000> make<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> little<00:00:36.300> bit<00:00:36.539> of

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
the Nexus so far it make a little bit of

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:37.850 
the Nexus so far it make a little bit of
a<00:00:36.690> video<00:00:36.960> because<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.170> think<00:00:37.200> what<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.560> is<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
a video because I think what it is is a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.650 
a video because I think what it is is a
lot<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.160> people<00:00:38.460> don't<00:00:38.730> actually<00:00:38.970> know<00:00:39.420> what

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
lot of people don't actually know what

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.200 
lot of people don't actually know what
slip<00:00:39.960> mode<00:00:40.170> does<00:00:40.470> or<00:00:41.130> how<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.550> use<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.180> I

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
slip mode does or how to use it so I

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.520 
slip mode does or how to use it so I
thought<00:00:42.360> make<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.600> lot<00:00:42.720> of<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.870> video<00:00:43.140> kind<00:00:43.470> of

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
thought make a lot of it video kind of

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.020 
thought make a lot of it video kind of
explaining<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> features<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:44.700> showing

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
explaining the features and then showing

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.310 
explaining the features and then showing
you<00:00:45.120> how<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.480> use<00:00:45.720> it<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.020> hopefully

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you how you can use it and hopefully

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.590 
you how you can use it and hopefully
maybe<00:00:46.890> bring<00:00:47.130> a<00:00:47.190> few<00:00:47.340> more<00:00:47.370> people<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.790> on<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
maybe bring a few more people to on the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.210 
maybe bring a few more people to on the
finger<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:48.960> using<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:51.829> so<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:52.950> kind<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.130> a

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
finger on using it so it's kind of a

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.680 
finger on using it so it's kind of a
difficult<00:00:53.370> feature<00:00:53.790> to<00:00:53.970> explain<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.450> slip

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
difficult feature to explain to slip

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.060 
difficult feature to explain to slip
mode<00:00:54.899> which<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.320> kind<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.620> what<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> problem

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
mode which is kind of what the problem

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.440 
mode which is kind of what the problem
is<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.550> lot<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.700> DJ's<00:00:56.969> don't<00:00:57.180> fully

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
is I think a lot of DJ's don't fully

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.360 
is I think a lot of DJ's don't fully
understand<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.649> how<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.770> use<00:00:59.160> it

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
understand what it is and how to use it

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.799 
understand what it is and how to use it
so<00:00:59.790> I'm<00:00:59.850> gonna<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.090> my<00:01:00.210> best<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.600> try<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
so I'm gonna do my best to try and

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.000 
so I'm gonna do my best to try and
explain<00:01:01.140> you're<00:01:01.350> gonna<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> bear<00:01:01.829> with

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
explain you're gonna have to bear with

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.979 
explain you're gonna have to bear with
me<00:01:02.219> what<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> does<00:01:02.790> is<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.149> allows<00:01:03.360> you<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.750> use

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
me what it does is it allows you to use

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.950 
me what it does is it allows you to use
the<00:01:04.259> features<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:05.009> a<00:01:05.219> sea<00:01:05.489> DJ<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.719> won't

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the features of a sea DJ but it won't

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.539 
the features of a sea DJ but it won't
affect<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> timing<00:01:07.829> of<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> track<00:01:08.369> that's

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
affect the timing of the track that's

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.669 
affect the timing of the track that's
playing<00:01:08.850> underneath<00:01:09.329> so<00:01:09.929> for<00:01:10.139> example<00:01:10.590> you

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:10.679 
playing underneath so for example you

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:12.620 
playing underneath so for example you
know<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:10.889> you<00:01:10.979> hit<00:01:11.189> reverse<00:01:11.399> on<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.999> for<00:01:12.270> two

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
know if you hit reverse on it for two

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.169 
know if you hit reverse on it for two
beats<00:01:12.959> and<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:13.439> let<00:01:13.649> it<00:01:13.740> go<00:01:13.979> into<00:01:14.700> forward

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
beats and then let it go into forward

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:16.459 
beats and then let it go into forward
mode<00:01:15.420> you're<00:01:15.719> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.899> be<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> bar<00:01:16.259> behind

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469 
mode you're going to be a bar behind

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:18.050 
mode you're going to be a bar behind
because<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.130> gone<00:01:17.249> backwards<00:01:17.670> two<00:01:17.850> weeks

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
because it's gone backwards two weeks

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.489 
because it's gone backwards two weeks
then<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.329> played<00:01:18.539> them<00:01:18.749> two<00:01:18.899> beats<00:01:19.139> forward

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.499 
then it's played them two beats forward

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:21.440 
then it's played them two beats forward
again<00:01:19.709> but<00:01:20.310> if<00:01:20.399> you<00:01:20.490> are<00:01:20.579> slip<00:01:20.909> mode<00:01:21.060> switched

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
again but if you are slip mode switched

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.050 
again but if you are slip mode switched
on<00:01:21.719> what<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.469> does<00:01:22.709> is<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.310> tracks<00:01:23.579> always

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
on what it does is the tracks always

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.029 
on what it does is the tracks always
play<00:01:24.389> in<00:01:24.539> underneath<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.709> soon<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:25.889> you

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
play in underneath so as soon as you

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.249 
play in underneath so as soon as you
release<00:01:26.219> the<00:01:26.850> reverse<00:01:27.209> it<00:01:27.659> will<00:01:27.810> go<00:01:27.899> back<00:01:28.109> to

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
release the reverse it will go back to

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.230 
release the reverse it will go back to
where<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.499> track<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:29.039> as<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.850> you'd<00:01:29.999> never

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
where the track was as if you'd never

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.269 
where the track was as if you'd never
even<00:01:30.600> touched<00:01:31.139> it<00:01:31.350> which<00:01:31.709> is<00:01:31.829> really<00:01:31.950> cool<00:01:32.069> so

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:32.279 
even touched it which is really cool so

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:34.010 
even touched it which is really cool so
you<00:01:32.429> could<00:01:32.549> use<00:01:32.759> things<00:01:33.179> like<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> reverse<00:01:33.719> in

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
you could use things like the reverse in

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.239 
you could use things like the reverse in
a<00:01:34.170> mix<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.560> it's<00:01:34.679> not<00:01:34.829> going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> throw<00:01:35.130> your

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
a mix and it's not going to throw your

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:38.740 
a mix and it's not going to throw your
timing<00:01:35.609> up

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.030 

and<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:39.870> like<00:01:39.960> step<00:01:40.170> slip<00:01:40.440> pose<00:01:40.590> not<00:01:40.800> just

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
and it's like step slip pose not just

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.500 
and it's like step slip pose not just
limited<00:01:41.370> to<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.550> reverse<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.060> use<00:01:42.300> it<00:01:42.420> on

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
limited to the reverse you can use it on

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.420 
limited to the reverse you can use it on
a<00:01:42.540> bunch<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.930> features<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.500> CDJ<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.280> mean

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
a bunch of features on the CDJ I mean

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.340 
a bunch of features on the CDJ I mean
you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.610> use<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.940> on<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.120> vinyl<00:01:45.780> platter<00:01:46.170> for

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
you can use it on the vinyl platter for

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.370 
you can use it on the vinyl platter for
scratching

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:05.950 

the<00:01:54.250> reverse<00:01:54.580> as<00:01:54.909> I<00:01:54.939> mentioned

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:14.340 

you<00:02:06.830> can<00:02:06.979> use<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.340> vinyl<00:02:07.670> break

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.990 

you<00:02:15.350> can<00:02:15.500> use<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.830> loop<00:02:16.040> feature<00:02:16.340> now<00:02:16.670> as<00:02:16.880> if

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
you can use the loop feature now as if

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:28.120 
you can use the loop feature now as if
it's<00:02:17.150> almost<00:02:17.300> like<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.630> role<00:02:17.840> on<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.170> djm<00:02:18.590> 900

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.940 

and<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:29.510> can<00:02:29.630> even<00:02:29.780> use<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.080> hot<00:02:30.290> cues<00:02:30.590> for<00:02:30.860> it

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
and you can even use the hot cues for it

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.320 
and you can even use the hot cues for it
as<00:02:31.070> well<00:02:31.220> which<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.520> know<00:02:31.610> if<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:31.820> how<00:02:32.000> cute

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
as well which you know if you how cute

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.660 
as well which you know if you how cute
some<00:02:33.140> samples<00:02:33.590> up<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:34.010> can<00:02:34.130> almost<00:02:34.250> use<00:02:34.520> them

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
some samples up you can almost use them

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.980 
some samples up you can almost use them
like<00:02:34.820> a<00:02:34.850> sampler<00:02:35.330> then<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.810> obviously

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
like a sampler then and it obviously

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.300 
like a sampler then and it obviously
just<00:02:36.380> jump<00:02:36.620> straight<00:02:36.650> back<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.130> track

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
just jump straight back to the track

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.410 
just jump straight back to the track
where<00:02:37.490> it<00:02:37.640> was<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.880> if<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.060> haven't<00:02:38.300> touched

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
where it was is if you haven't touched

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.450 
where it was is if you haven't touched
it<00:02:38.630> which<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:38.870> like<00:02:39.050> really<00:02:39.320> cool<00:02:39.590> for<00:02:39.740> effects

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:51.330 

raise<00:02:43.460> your<00:02:44.470> dong<00:02:45.470> dong<00:02:45.890> get<00:02:46.280> off

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.560 

so<00:02:52.340> on<00:02:52.460> the<00:02:52.520> room<00:02:52.670> they're<00:02:52.880> all<00:02:53.000> quite<00:02:53.270> cool

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
so on the room they're all quite cool

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.300 
so on the room they're all quite cool
but<00:02:53.750> if<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:53.990> group<00:02:54.230> them<00:02:54.380> together<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:55.070> use

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
but if you group them together and use

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.800 
but if you group them together and use
them<00:02:55.490> all<00:02:55.610> together<00:02:55.820> on<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.210> right<00:02:56.330> track<00:02:56.660> in

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
them all together on the right track in

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.060 
them all together on the right track in
the<00:02:56.900> right<00:02:57.050> way<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.320> can<00:02:57.470> get<00:02:57.680> some<00:02:57.830> really

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
the right way you can get some really

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.590 
the right way you can get some really
cool<00:02:58.280> effects<00:02:58.760> out<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.180> it's<00:02:59.330> almost<00:02:59.450> like

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
cool effects out of it it's almost like

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.350 
cool effects out of it it's almost like
running<00:02:59.840> effect<00:03:00.380> ryx<00:03:00.650> or<00:03:00.980> glitch<00:03:01.310> plugin<00:03:02.210> you

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
running effect ryx or glitch plugin you

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.150 
running effect ryx or glitch plugin you
can<00:03:02.390> almost<00:03:02.600> do<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:02.930> live<00:03:03.170> on<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.500> CDJ<00:03:04.010> and

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
can almost do that live on the CDJ and

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.710 
can almost do that live on the CDJ and
like<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.400> said<00:03:04.460> it<00:03:04.820> doesn't<00:03:05.000> really<00:03:05.150> matter<00:03:05.390> if

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
like I said it doesn't really matter if

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.880 
like I said it doesn't really matter if
you<00:03:05.840> hit<00:03:06.020> something<00:03:06.230> wrong<00:03:06.530> with<00:03:06.710> the<00:03:06.770> wrong

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
you hit something wrong with the wrong

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.110 
you hit something wrong with the wrong
but<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.190> wrong<00:03:07.340> tanks<00:03:07.670> whenever<00:03:07.940> you<00:03:08.000> let

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
but the wrong tanks whenever you let

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.830 
but the wrong tanks whenever you let
anything<00:03:08.300> go

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
anything go

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.510 
anything go
the<00:03:09.020> track's<00:03:09.290> going<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.530> go<00:03:09.620> where<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:09.980> was<00:03:10.190> in

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
the track's going to go where it was in

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.950 
the track's going to go where it was in
the<00:03:10.790> first<00:03:10.940> places<00:03:11.360> if<00:03:11.480> you've<00:03:11.570> never<00:03:11.720> touched

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
the first places if you've never touched

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.660 
the first places if you've never touched
it<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:12.440> it's<00:03:12.650> never<00:03:12.860> going<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.040> sound<00:03:13.220> too<00:03:13.400> bad

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
it so it's never going to sound too bad

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.800 
it so it's never going to sound too bad
so<00:03:14.270> there's<00:03:14.390> going<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.540> be<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.660> little

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
so there's going to be a little

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.750 
so there's going to be a little
demonstration<00:03:15.080> now<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.950> little<00:03:16.130> bit<00:03:16.280> overkill

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
demonstration now a little bit overkill

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.700 
demonstration now a little bit overkill
admittedly<00:03:17.330> but<00:03:17.570> just<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:17.870> show<00:03:18.080> how<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.590> can

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
admittedly but just to show how you can

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.320 
admittedly but just to show how you can
use<00:03:18.980> slip<00:03:19.220> mode<00:03:19.430> with<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.700> different<00:03:20.000> effects

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
use slip mode with the different effects

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.670 
use slip mode with the different effects
and<00:03:20.600> some<00:03:21.080> of<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.200> effects<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:21.590> can

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
and some of the effects that you can

00:03:21.680 --> 00:04:07.449 
and some of the effects that you can
achieve<00:03:21.770> from<00:03:22.190> doing<00:03:22.460> it

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.050 

brace<00:04:08.459> off<00:04:09.080> brace<00:04:10.080> or<00:04:10.650> II<00:04:10.739> don't<00:04:11.640> give

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
brace off brace or II don't give

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.260 
brace off brace or II don't give
off<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:12.450> appraisal

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
off the appraisal

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.960 
off the appraisal
don't<00:04:14.900> be<00:04:15.200> phrasal<00:04:16.250> hands<00:04:16.520> if<00:04:16.850> you

with the reverse and the hub cues and a
little<00:05:04.389> bit<00:05:04.509> of<00:05:04.569> scratching<00:05:04.960> you<00:05:05.050> don't<00:05:05.229> need

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
little bit of scratching you don't need

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.350 
little bit of scratching you don't need
to<00:05:05.470> worry<00:05:05.710> so<00:05:05.800> much<00:05:06.009> about<00:05:06.220> being<00:05:06.819> clinically

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
to worry so much about being clinically

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.909 
to worry so much about being clinically
tight<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:07.840> accurate<00:05:08.169> with<00:05:08.319> it<00:05:08.349> when<00:05:08.680> you<00:05:08.770> let

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
tight and accurate with it when you let

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:10.140 
tight and accurate with it when you let
go<00:05:08.949> the<00:05:09.130> tracks<00:05:09.460> going<00:05:09.580> to<00:05:09.669> jump<00:05:09.880> back<00:05:09.910> to

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
go the tracks going to jump back to

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.909 
go the tracks going to jump back to
where<00:05:10.300> it<00:05:10.419> was<00:05:10.449> before<00:05:10.780> so<00:05:11.169> it's<00:05:11.770> actually

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
where it was before so it's actually

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.740 
where it was before so it's actually
kind<00:05:12.250> of<00:05:12.370> an<00:05:12.550> easy<00:05:12.729> way<00:05:12.970> to<00:05:13.030> do<00:05:13.210> it<00:05:13.240> if<00:05:13.419> anything

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
kind of an easy way to do it if anything

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.120 
kind of an easy way to do it if anything
so<00:05:13.930> I'm<00:05:14.020> surprised<00:05:14.289> more<00:05:14.470> people<00:05:14.530> don't<00:05:14.770> use

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
so I'm surprised more people don't use

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.800 
so I'm surprised more people don't use
it<00:05:15.280> I<00:05:15.370> hope<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.669> see<00:05:15.849> you<00:05:16.120> know<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:16.630> more
