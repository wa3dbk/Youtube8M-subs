00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.069
 very good to all and welcome to what 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.289
 that perhaps is the most expected of me 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.139
 channel the how to bust guide 

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:11.360
 advance warfare good in this chapter 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.759
 ok because this game has like to 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.320
 do at least 30 episodes put 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.960
 that touching a lot of things the minimap has 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.660
 changed the subject of the gusts the subject 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.880
 of weapons the theme of the jumps the 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.340
 issue of how to go to people the subject of 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.199
 where to move there are so many things 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.060
 in this new call of duty so many things 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.410
 in plan how to recharge because there is a 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.920
 way to load faster but 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.960
 you lose more bullets as you see many 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.480
 things that I want to explain and is that 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.210
 it has a lot 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.290
 edith to say it somehow but 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.000
 the first chapter is going to be a little bit is 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.949
 general so it's not going to have a 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.960
 edition will not have anything the first 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.420
 chapter and you know is going to be the basics 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.370
 and it's going to be where I checked if it's going to be 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.769
 supported is here to say is that I think 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.390
 touch how to reload faster how 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.280
 do not miss so many bullets how 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.320
 move how to jump how to dodge the 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.570
 people like about where the 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.850
 better weapons the worst the best 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.190
 gusts combination be attentive not 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.170
 get nervous and a thousand things to kill 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.000
 to the people is a guide that can 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.130
 help you at the end then to be able 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.170
 burst well said but in this game 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.850
 the connection was very influential, so 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.800
 here to the only thing that will be is a step to 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.060
 that you are something better and already after the 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.490
 knowledge cases maybe you can 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.070
 give yourself so you can improve good 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.810
 guys the basics let's start already with 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.850
 this first of all I would like a good 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.560
 Like you know what I just said 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.240
 now it is very important this is what 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.100
 is going to be based on what for me 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.200
 motivate to upload the guide tell you what will be 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.460
 a chapter every Saturday at four and 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.470
 average 5 in the afternoon 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.570
 I will always publish it on twitter before 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.860
 to see about what more or less 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.630
 you want though I'm going to have more or 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.150
 less a guide a margin of how it's going to 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.220
 start uploading episodes and other 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.100
 tell you 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.480
 the basics or to begin with could be 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.950
 say more than the basics in this chapter 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.990
 is going to be to begin with is not going to be what 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.490
 basic to start in this new call 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.620
 of duty the first thing that will open the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.380
 his escape game is going to leave or not 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.479
 cunts is to get into a game 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.060
 customized against the bots 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.740
 and go looking gradually Weapons 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.920
 accessories the advantages and learning in 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.690
 what this game is based on how it works and 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.790
 how to do things for example the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.170
 INADI cocks back another dolphin lite 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.090
 time to throw something on the floor 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.590
 quite important the issue of 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.020
 jumps go looking at things above 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.209
 of weapons playing against bots the 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.300
 snipers and other things so that 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.100
 good you can go tracing the weapons for 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.740
 then get into multiplayer and power 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.500
 play a fairly comfortable situation 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.630
 for you I also have to tell you that 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.910
 the theme of sex suits 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.920
 skills and others to run and those 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.470
 things are also many things 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.970
 what are we going to play 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.770
 but basically what you have to do 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.470
 to start is to look at your 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.420
 sensitivity and deactivated the vibration 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.130
 it is very important since a 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.600
 the time to shoot when they shoot is 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.290
 better that we vibrate the command so that the 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.040
 time so that this does not move you so much 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.190
 we have to look at your sensitivity 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.570
 look at our maps look at the minimum 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.540
 to see everything that has changed for 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.550
 try to learn a little bit again a little 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.890
 more of this new call of duty by 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.150
 example we could go here put 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.220
 effects of the country for a new thing 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.230
 worth the basics to start is something 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.850
 new that you have to learn does not work 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.380
 for nothing but according to what I have been told 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.900
 some damage to the weapon I do not know is one hundred 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.100
 for a hundred you decide that this chapter is already going 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.750
 to finish is worth just wanted 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.220
 teach you the basics to start 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.900
 call of duty is to enter the game and 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.750
 looking little by little the weapons everything 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.270
 new and others and then in the next 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.270
 chapter and we're going to give you how to start what 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.760
 basic 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.730
 supposedly it will be the weapons or how 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.140
 move or how to reload or first thing 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.610
 that comes to mind you leave me 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.660
 the ideas but more or less I think that 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.340
 I already know how I'm going to do it in the 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.900
 next chapter so nothing 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.550
 simply this is to sign this 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.200
 guide for you already explained everything that 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.870
 I want to go up and other things that I have not 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.460
 said and as you can see there is a way to 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.220
 emphasize faster as you see there but 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:09.000
 I lose bullets because we won second 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.200
 which weapons remove more damage etc etc so 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.320
 that nothing guys I hope that I have 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.670
 liked remember that we expect about 400 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.920
 I like the truth I would like very much 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.180
 and nothing we see in the next video 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.780
 how to burst the next week 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.780
 goodbye
