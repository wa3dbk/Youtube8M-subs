00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.859
 today what we are going to do is with you 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:10.880
 how smart watch 8 is configured with 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:15.610
 a samsung with android 4 points 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.610
 in this opportunity what we are going to do 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.689
 is to synchronize the smart watch with the 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:26.980
 cellular the malware always comes with the 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:29.890
 blood on if we do not enter the menu and 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.439
 we see bluetooth if there already directly 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.890
 gives us the option of looking for a new 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.890
 device 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.600
 on the cell phone what we have to have 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.900
 in account is that we have to have the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.740
 bluetooth power so that both are 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.840
 see and synchronize before and before the 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.370
 synchronization via bluetooth 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.810
 we have to download the application 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.210
 what's called vete notification 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.150
 the application vet notification 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.710
 we can find in the play store 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.049
 of Google 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:10.220
 with clay depending on this is the version 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.220
 that you have in the search engine we put 20 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.270
 and it's the first 1520 notification 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.230
 and there we can 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.230
 Look 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.390
 and install 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.370
 to accept 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.910
 and there it starts on the loom 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.800
 the application does not weigh much are 2 with 31 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.440
 megas 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.790
 there I am installing only when it ends 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.260
 install since they have installed let's go to 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.080
 Program 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:03.010
 and do 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:05.950
 we have it to 20 notify us if we open 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.020
 for the first time he asks us to create ourselves 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.500
 an account but in this case the only 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:15.200
 what we are going to do is shown in the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.200
 configuration we put true name 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.340
 and here we give you give because it returns us to 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.410
 ask later we give to because 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.720
 automatically send us now so that 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.340
 this 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.769
 let's configure the program 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.140
 we have a stack of options but we just 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.629
 already directly to which we have to 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.099
 activate we have to come here to better 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:44.140
 notification click and turn it on 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.270
 to ask if we are going to use them we put them 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.770
 to accept and that has already been activated 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.920
 and it was already activated so that 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.620
 cell phone notifications appear in 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.700
 the watch 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.920
 ok let's do the first test 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.800
 what we have now is turn on the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.989
 cell phone bluetooth automatically 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.030
 will find us and will find 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.480
 8 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.250
 then we make link and there what 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.140
 is already connecting and 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.290
 automatically it connects with the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.080
 mobile 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.970
 we can do it the other way too, which is 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.310
 come to the cell phone we go to bluetooth 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.380
 we can find devices connect and 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.930
 automatically to the car to ask if 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.290
 we really want to say yes and now 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:39.120
 both devices are synchronized 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:44.840
 one of the ways to see if it looked good 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:47.560
 If it's already working, it 's the menu today 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.730
 I'm going to message for example 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.590
 I'm going to contacts loading and there and 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.709
 contacts appear if I do not fit 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.230
 synchronized or if it does not fit 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.959
 configured in the better notification 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:05.430
 directly nothing will appear if in 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.430
 the contact list 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.689
 and there was already configured a 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.359
 another place where you have to configure that 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:18.329
 applications we want to be notified 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.949
 in the notice go on the notice vet is 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.650
 where all of us will appear 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:26.070
 facebook whatsapp notifications 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:30.599
 and what we want to configure that is 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.520
 do in pool set if we go back to 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.599
 I qualified with what is here below to the 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.419
 right 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:39.870
 we click here and here in notification 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:43.259
 app we click there and we will have 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.199
 the option to see us notify us of 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:48.300
 our people our applications 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.300
 personal or that we have 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.389
 installed and those of the system itself 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.570
 system we recommend that you select 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.479
 all and only leave those that we 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.449
 we really use in this case file 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.330
 messenger 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.300
 we can whatsapp 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.610
 and yahoo mail for example then every 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.460
 Once we received an email, a message 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.600
 let it be here in the notice vet is going to 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.900

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.830

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.760
