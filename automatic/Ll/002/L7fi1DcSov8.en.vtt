a Google Portugal and the google youtube
and<00:00:35.070> things<00:00:35.250> like<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.460> i<00:00:35.640> didn't<00:00:36.000> understand

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
and things like that i didn't understand

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.940 
and things like that i didn't understand
that<00:00:36.750> i<00:00:36.809> might<00:00:37.079> be<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.350> last<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.680> hear<00:00:37.800> this

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that i might be the last to hear this

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.860 
that i might be the last to hear this
for<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.879> they<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> different<00:00:39.360> internet

for other countries but apparently they

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.360 
for other countries but apparently they
do<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.480> that's<00:00:43.020> why<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.320> haven't<00:00:43.530> uploaded<00:00:43.890> in

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
