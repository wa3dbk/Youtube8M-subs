 section that goes from the area of ​​the face 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.870
 up to the top of the crown and 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.420
 then we are going to make another one that goes 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.030
 ear to ear every section we have 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.239
 we're going to separate it into two 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.320
