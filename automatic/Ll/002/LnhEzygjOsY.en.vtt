00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.200 
ended up there but I think when you look

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.469 
ended up there but I think when you look
around<00:06:50.320> there<00:06:50.680> both<00:06:51.310> teams<00:06:51.580> you<00:06:51.760> watch<00:06:52.330> the

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950 
sprinkler in the players some very very

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.290 
sprinkler in the players some very very
good<00:06:54.070> experienced<00:06:54.669> players<00:06:54.880> people<00:06:55.180> are

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300

good experienced players people are
recognized<00:06:55.630> them<00:06:55.840> and<00:06:55.990> you<00:06:56.380> know<00:06:56.500> I<00:06:56.530> think

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
recognized them and you know I think

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.320 
recognized them and you know I think
everybody<00:06:57.250> say<00:06:57.520> to<00:06:57.580> be<00:06:57.729> happy<00:06:58.000> seem<00:06:58.180> to<00:06:58.270> be

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330 
everybody say to be happy seem to be

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.330 
everybody say to be happy seem to be
decent<00:06:58.660> game<00:06:58.780> and<00:06:59.020> a<00:06:59.169> fantastic<00:06:59.590> crowd<00:06:59.950> three

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
decent game and a fantastic crowd three

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.529 
decent game and a fantastic crowd three
and<00:07:00.430> a<00:07:00.460> half<00:07:00.610> towers<00:07:00.910> not<00:07:01.060> a<00:07:01.120> game<00:07:01.330> so

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:01.539 
and a half towers not a game so

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:04.980 
and a half towers not a game so
hopefully<00:07:02.110> an<00:07:03.240> intox<00:07:04.240> case<00:07:04.479> that<00:07:04.690> he<00:07:04.810> can<00:07:04.900> get

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
hopefully an intox case that he can get

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.930 
hopefully an intox case that he can get
going<00:07:05.169> again<00:07:05.380> and<00:07:05.560> you<00:07:06.310> know<00:07:06.430> it's<00:07:06.610> under<00:07:06.760> new

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
going again and you know it's under new

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.520 
going again and you know it's under new
management<00:07:07.270> and<00:07:07.539> the<00:07:07.720> support<00:07:08.110> is<00:07:08.229> seen<00:07:08.410> but

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
management and the support is seen but

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:09.779 
management and the support is seen but
you<00:07:08.560> have<00:07:08.740> a<00:07:08.770> good<00:07:08.919> time<00:07:09.070> they<00:07:09.280> own<00:07:09.430> the<00:07:09.580> club

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:09.789

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:11.219 
you have a good time they own the club
and<00:07:09.940> I<00:07:09.970> think<00:07:10.180> their<00:07:10.660> scenes<00:07:10.840> be<00:07:10.930> a<00:07:10.960> little<00:07:11.140> bit

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:11.229 
and I think their scenes be a little bit

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:12.960 
and I think their scenes be a little bit
more<00:07:11.470> of<00:07:12.039> that<00:07:12.070> happening<00:07:12.550> you<00:07:12.610> have<00:07:12.669> a<00:07:12.820> rat

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:12.970 
more of that happening you have a rat

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.300 
more of that happening you have a rat
