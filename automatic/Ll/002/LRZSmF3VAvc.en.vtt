00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 let's make one of the most desserts 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.950
 easy to do and very very German is a 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.019
 apple strudel and is made with 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.610
 puff pastry also many people what 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.580
 can do with pasta and what the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.830
 truth the pasta to you the original is not 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.779
 a little bit more complicated to get 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.830
 you have to get in Arab stores 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:27.180
 why do water flour is very 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.310
 complicated to do it is what I want 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.929
 is actually simplify the puff pastry 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.660
 local was one of the big mistakes 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.090
 of safe confectionery provided 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.010
 when the baker realizes that 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.350
 he did not put butter when he was 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.920
 killing turns out that he started adding the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.110
 butter talking about it and he started to play 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.809
 and double the one so that according to him 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.300
 will integrate the butter that when 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.610
 it happened that the baking was baked 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.320
 it turns out that it started to open in sheets 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.320
 that's why it's called a flaky pastry 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.059
 it's a little the history of the palm 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.549
 rectangle we stretch the pasta in a 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.110
 rectangle we already have the apples and if 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.310
 tablespoons of cinnamon 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.860
 there is also more putting it very well what 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.569
 good is for the bakery more calls to 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.569
 see how they prick me 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.190
 be aware that it has already started 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.190

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.540
 handsome doll my life misses me because 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.139
 many times we have done it because it is the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.139
 Butter

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.220
 30-40 pesos 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.320
 so collect and each slice destroys the 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.920
 can you sell approximately 15 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.810

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.520
 pancho francisco good is also 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.210

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.650
 forum the continent fell to someone 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.319
 they bring her by the rage 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.030
 let's see this important part is 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.650
 starting to spread butter is a 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.349
 dessert that you can not do the 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.299
 true by a day before and not by 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.400
 need because there's nothing better than 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.620
 the puff pastry is again replicating 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.689
 an egg is riding a mixture of 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.730
 egg and egg nothing more lightly 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.480
 beaten and ours that see the way in 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.709
 that comes back because it 's important 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.709
 let's wrap 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.879
 once I had to touch 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:47.959
 here ok we fold this the edges here 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:50.720
 we rotate ok when this one alone in the 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.909
 kitchen many times we do not have to 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.730
 help 2011 be in what they have to 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.189
 do put your forearm to see the 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.460
 look and what is important is the 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:03.819
 goal of the veil 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.780
 there is no order right now it is not going to the arm 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.330
 okay 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.970
 imprisonment 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.550
 and I have it ready this is a way 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.150
 simple now'll give you a tip on 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:20.560
 I study the studio a lot of pleasure before 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.150
 be dressed we can refrigerate truth not 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.310
 of course it's preferable I'll tell you 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.650
 because the more chilled is the 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.990
 puff pastry the parts you have 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.600
 of butter know what it does to 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.630
 moment of entering the heat it hits 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.550
 of heat and this expands that's why it's 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.360
 that grows all that is the puff pastry 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.470
