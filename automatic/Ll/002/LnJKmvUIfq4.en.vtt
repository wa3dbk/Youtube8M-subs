00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.820

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:43.030

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.659

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.679

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:59.299
 here as that here two and here 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.429
 someone behind this is my third 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.600
 yes and I hope you have the whole 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.429
 table fell here 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.399
 and if you have an exit to look at 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.319
 the bn writes and yes I would 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.610
 happy if a thumb dallas down 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.140
 or I do not care about rom if you 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.849
 giving a customer a reason 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.230
 I'll go to Rome because it's nice if 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.610
 you also write a reasoning and 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.349
 if not I do not care 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.120
 although I would prefer it 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.340
 Of course if you hold my thumb 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.019
 justified in any case the thumbs up 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.190
 does not necessarily need reasons now 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.989
 and there was no enemy here 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.430
 but well that does not matter to me 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.900
 would say until the next time skin 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.610

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.610
