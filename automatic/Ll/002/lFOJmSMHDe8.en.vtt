00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.080 
going up we have m3 m3 actually has two
channels<00:02:22.530> with<00:02:22.799> 3-band<00:02:23.010> EQ<00:02:23.549> but<00:02:23.849> you<00:02:23.969> also

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
channels with 3-band EQ but you also

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.720 
channels with 3-band EQ but you also
have<00:02:24.359> a<00:02:24.390> kill<00:02:24.629> switch<00:02:24.739> each<00:02:25.739> for<00:02:26.310> each<00:02:26.459> band

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
have a kill switch each for each band

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
have a kill switch each for each band
yeah

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
yeah

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.929 
yeah
a<00:02:27.780> momentary<00:02:28.500> kill<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.459> have<00:02:29.609> a<00:02:29.640> latitude

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
a momentary kill and you have a latitude

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.390 
a momentary kill and you have a latitude
kill<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:31.560> see<00:02:31.739> right<00:02:31.980> here<00:02:32.069> we<00:02:32.219> have<00:02:32.250> the

kill you see right here we have the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.949 
kill you see right here we have the
transport<00:02:32.760> button<00:02:33.180> actually<00:02:33.299> mutes<00:02:33.810> the

transport button actually mutes the

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.420 
transport button actually mutes the
channels<00:02:34.379> that<00:02:34.469> eventually<00:02:34.769> stutter<00:02:35.219> your

remember two M series is going to be

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.520 
remember two M series is going to be
your<00:02:42.340> analog<00:02:42.700> mixer<00:02:43.180> egg<00:02:43.870> series<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.350> going<00:02:44.470> to

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
your analog mixer egg series is going to

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.680 
your analog mixer egg series is going to
be<00:02:44.590> your<00:02:45.130> digital<00:02:45.520> mixer<00:02:45.850> now<00:02:45.880> we<00:02:46.450> have<00:02:46.600> two

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
be your digital mixer now we have two

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.130 
be your digital mixer now we have two
eggs<00:02:46.720> one<00:02:47.140> USB<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.820> works<00:02:49.060> really<00:02:49.300> similar<00:02:49.840> to

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
back you have USB and you just saw saw

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.339 
back you have USB and you just saw saw
on<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.600> gentle<00:02:58.870> mix<00:02:58.990> instead<00:02:59.350> of<00:02:59.500> man

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.429 

now<00:03:02.829> we<00:03:02.890> also<00:03:03.280> have<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.549> x6<00:03:03.999> we<00:03:04.900> added<00:03:05.260> an

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
now we also have the x6 we added an

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.110 
now we also have the x6 we added an
effect<00:03:06.069> engine<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:06.519> that<00:03:06.549> one<00:03:06.790> other<00:03:06.969> than

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
effect engine so that one other than

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.459 
effect engine so that one other than
that<00:03:07.239> it<00:03:07.359> has<00:03:07.480> really<00:03:07.780> similar<00:03:08.139> features<00:03:08.439> to

it to the x1 USB you have your effect
channels<00:03:11.920> right<00:03:12.069> here<00:03:12.310> but<00:03:12.459> we<00:03:12.549> also<00:03:12.579> have

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
channels right here but we also have

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.979 
channels right here but we also have
your<00:03:13.959> kill<00:03:14.260> switch<00:03:14.290> for<00:03:15.219> your<00:03:15.370> for<00:03:16.060> your<00:03:16.090> EQ<00:03:16.540> or

and last big big big release mana is

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.260 
and last big big big release mana is
going<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.560> be<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.710> numerator<00:03:23.890> 9<00:03:24.490> you<00:03:25.150> have

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
going to be the numerator 9 you have

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.300 
going to be the numerator 9 you have
it's<00:03:25.450> actually<00:03:25.780> three<00:03:26.080> channels<00:03:26.530> that<00:03:27.160> you
