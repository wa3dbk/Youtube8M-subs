tinted moisturizer she just wants one so

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.640 
tinted moisturizer she just wants one so

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
that amount stays the same over here and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.980 
that amount stays the same over here and
then<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.490> add<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.689> get<00:01:09.869> your

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
then you add that up and you get your

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.260 
then you add that up and you get your
subtotal<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.710> then<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.400> multiply<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:12.210> by

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
subtotal and then you multiply that by

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.510 
subtotal and then you multiply that by
whatever<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> tax<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.710> your<00:01:13.830> state<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.400> in

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
whatever the tax is in your state so in

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.359 
whatever the tax is in your state so in
Nebraska<00:01:15.119> ours<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:16.020> 0.07<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.250> would

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
Nebraska ours is 0.07 so you would

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.719 
Nebraska ours is 0.07 so you would
multiply<00:01:17.720> 142<00:01:18.720> by<00:01:18.930> 0.07<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.369> gives<00:01:20.610> you

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
multiply 142 by 0.07 and that gives you

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.390 
multiply 142 by 0.07 and that gives you
994<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.500> add<00:01:22.650> those<00:01:22.860> together<00:01:23.070> in

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
994 so then you add those together in

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.660 
994 so then you add those together in
their<00:01:23.520> total<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.970> 150<00:01:24.860> 194<00:01:25.860> now<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.520> you're

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
their total is 150 194 now if you're

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.210 
their total is 150 194 now if you're
going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> give<00:01:27.060> them<00:01:27.240> anything<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.930> free<00:01:28.259> or
