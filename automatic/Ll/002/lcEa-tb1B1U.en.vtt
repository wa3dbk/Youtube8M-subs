00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
going to move the center console up so I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.060 
going to move the center console up so I
remove<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.750> ones<00:01:00.989> from<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.410> center<00:01:02.280> console

ok<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.280> did<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.750> fairly<00:01:07.380> easy

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
ok so I did that and this is fairly easy

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.000 
ok so I did that and this is fairly easy
to<00:01:08.729> remove<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.900> whole<00:01:10.110> unit<00:01:10.740> comes

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
to remove because the whole unit comes

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.740 
to remove because the whole unit comes
out<00:01:11.840> with<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.049> AC<00:01:13.820> you<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.119> remember<00:01:15.360> to

out with the AC you have to remember to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:24.620 
out with the AC you have to remember to
have<00:01:15.930> your<00:01:16.070> battery<00:01:17.070> disconnected<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:23.630> yeah

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
have your battery disconnected and yeah

have your battery disconnected and yeah
that's<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.080> battery<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:27.020> then<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:29.420> take

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
that's it battery and then you can take

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.319 
that's it battery and then you can take
the<00:01:30.570> whole<00:01:30.750> unit<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.610> you<00:01:32.610> also<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the whole unit out and you also have to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.760 
the whole unit out and you also have to
move<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.780> shifter<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:37.229> way<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.979> is
