00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
first of all some level it's it's pretty

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.750 
first of all some level it's it's pretty
dull<00:00:53.129> looking<00:00:53.550> there's<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.600> lot<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.020> passages

carry<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.680> can<00:01:58.799> probably<00:01:58.950> car<00:01:59.189> around<00:01:59.340> a

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
carry you can probably car around a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.149 
carry you can probably car around a
corner<00:01:59.729> or<00:01:59.909> two<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.899> yeah<00:02:01.560> there's<00:02:01.829> not<00:02:02.009> many

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
corner or two but yeah there's not many

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.670 
corner or two but yeah there's not many
places<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.969> can<00:02:03.030> actually<00:02:03.869> hide<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.320> white

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
places you can actually hide the white

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.660 
places you can actually hide the white
bc<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.820> 2v2<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.049> going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.550> so<00:02:08.550> much

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
bc and a 2v2 this is going to be so much

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.520 
bc and a 2v2 this is going to be so much
more<00:02:08.729> easier<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.330> find<00:02:09.509> people<00:02:09.929> that's<00:02:10.289> why

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
more easier to find people that's why

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.710 
more easier to find people that's why
this<00:02:11.220> gets<00:02:11.489> funds<00:02:11.790> up<00:02:11.940> from<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.239> dis<00:02:12.420> level

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
this gets funds up from the dis level

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.210 
this gets funds up from the dis level
because

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
because

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.160 
because
people<00:02:13.640> can<00:02:13.820> be<00:02:13.850> able<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.150> camp<00:02:14.390> it's<00:02:15.020> just

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
people can be able to camp it's just

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.900 
people can be able to camp it's just
going<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.350> be<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.470> fun<00:02:16.300> atmosphere<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:18.070> I<00:02:19.070> tried

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
going to be a fun atmosphere and I tried

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.940 
going to be a fun atmosphere and I tried
getting<00:02:20.210> this<00:02:20.330> map<00:02:20.600> on<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.020> face<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.590> game

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
getting this map on the face of game

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.070 
getting this map on the face of game
mode<00:02:22.130> but<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.120> wasn't<00:02:23.270> covered<00:02:23.720> up<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:23.840> I

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
mode but it just wasn't covered up so I

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.330 
mode but it just wasn't covered up so I
figured<00:02:24.350> that<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.500> just<00:02:24.680> get<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.860> nice<00:02:24.950> view<00:02:25.010> of

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
figured that I just get a nice view of

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.460 
figured that I just get a nice view of

oasis<00:02:48.110> this<00:02:48.890> is<00:02:49.100> like<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.340> hotel<00:02:50.330> place<00:02:50.900> and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
oasis this is like a hotel place and

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.010 
oasis this is like a hotel place and
it's<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.100> pretty<00:02:52.340> bright<00:02:52.700> place<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.480> be<00:02:53.720> fair

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
it's a pretty bright place to be fair

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.820 
it's a pretty bright place to be fair
because<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.430> architecture<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.480> the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
because of the architecture and the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.560 
because of the architecture and the
buildings<00:02:57.830> they're<00:02:58.130> quite<00:02:58.340> bright<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:59.300> it

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
buildings they're quite bright so it

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.770 
buildings they're quite bright so it
gets<00:02:59.660> off<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.870> nice<00:03:00.140> nice<00:03:01.100> feel<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:02.360> level

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
gets off a nice nice feel to the level

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.770 
gets off a nice nice feel to the level
and<00:03:03.680> it's<00:03:03.860> not<00:03:04.040> dull<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.670> brow<00:03:04.970> like<00:03:05.330> suddenly

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
and it's not dull and brow like suddenly

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.560 
and it's not dull and brow like suddenly
other<00:03:06.020> maps<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:06.560> we<00:03:06.709> see<00:03:06.980> like<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.459> rose<00:03:08.270> your

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
other maps that we see like a rose your

movie<00:03:10.209> dunno<00:03:11.209> I<00:03:11.360> just<00:03:11.600> ran<00:03:11.959> out<00:03:12.170> there<00:03:12.470> but<00:03:12.950> I

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
movie dunno I just ran out there but I

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.650 
movie dunno I just ran out there but I
think<00:03:13.280> this<00:03:13.370> would<00:03:13.550> be<00:03:13.580> quite<00:03:13.940> a<00:03:13.970> good<00:03:14.150> game<00:03:14.450> to

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
think this would be quite a good game to

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.400 
think this would be quite a good game to
play<00:03:14.810> on<00:03:15.440> Team<00:03:15.950> Deathmatch<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.989> maybe<00:03:17.989> some

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
play on Team Deathmatch and maybe some

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.350 
play on Team Deathmatch and maybe some
objective<00:03:18.920> game<00:03:19.130> modes<00:03:19.160> I'll<00:03:19.760> probably<00:03:20.030> see<00:03:20.330> a

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
objective game modes I'll probably see a

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.710 
objective game modes I'll probably see a
few<00:03:20.420> points<00:03:21.080> where<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.830> flags<00:03:22.640> or<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.360> points

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
few points where the flags or the points

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.830 
few points where the flags or the points
would<00:03:23.930> be<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:26.000> know<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.300> might<00:03:26.480> be<00:03:26.510> quite

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
would be and you know it might be quite

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.560 
would be and you know it might be quite
a<00:03:26.900> bit<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.290> there's<00:03:27.860> quite<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.160> few<00:03:28.570> places

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
a bit and there's quite a few places

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.280 
a bit and there's quite a few places
that<00:03:30.050> you<00:03:30.410> can<00:03:30.459> catch<00:03:31.459> up<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.060> pick<00:03:33.050> a<00:03:33.080> few

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
that you can catch up and pick a few

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.890 
that you can catch up and pick a few
people<00:03:33.769> off<00:03:33.860> and<00:03:34.130> is<00:03:34.850> even<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.420> little<00:03:35.630> edge

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
people off and is even a little edge

waiting if you really want so you can go
for<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.510> swim<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:39.650> might<00:03:39.830> drown<00:03:40.160> because<00:03:40.400> you

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
for a swim you might drown because you

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.720 
for a swim you might drown because you
can't<00:03:40.790> get<00:03:40.940> back<00:03:41.120> out<00:03:41.360> but<00:03:41.810> yeah<00:03:42.739> yeah<00:03:43.340> far

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
can't get back out but yeah yeah far

the<00:03:47.209> surveyor's<00:03:47.660> map<00:03:47.780> release<00:03:48.380> is<00:03:49.160> quite<00:03:49.489> well

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
the surveyor's map release is quite well

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
the surveyor's map release is quite well
designed<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:52.310> would<00:03:52.970> have<00:03:53.090> been<00:03:53.209> better<00:03:53.269> if<00:03:53.540> I

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
designed it would have been better if I

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.860 
designed it would have been better if I
could<00:03:53.780> have<00:03:54.019> got<00:03:54.140> some<00:03:54.350> gameplay<00:03:54.739> for<00:03:55.070> you<00:03:55.250> but

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
could have got some gameplay for you but

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.590 
could have got some gameplay for you but
