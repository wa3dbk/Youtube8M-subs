00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.500 
made me now what about for people who
are<00:02:24.079> willing<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.709> sacrifice<00:02:25.099> everything<00:02:25.940> they

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
are willing to sacrifice everything they

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.900 
are willing to sacrifice everything they
that<00:02:26.959> they<00:02:27.170> have<00:02:27.380> achieved<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:28.370> far<00:02:28.400> and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
that they have achieved so far and

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.759 
that they have achieved so far and
willing<00:02:29.329> to<00:02:29.360> gamble<00:02:29.599> everything<00:02:30.319> they<00:02:30.470> have

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
willing to gamble everything they have

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.250 
willing to gamble everything they have
and<00:02:31.040> still<00:02:31.310> give<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:32.030> shot<00:02:32.269> at<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.569> new<00:02:32.959> goal

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
and still give it a shot at a new goal

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.740 
and still give it a shot at a new goal
or<00:02:33.560> maybe<00:02:33.799> a<00:02:34.130> new<00:02:34.400> career<00:02:34.970> would<00:02:35.299> you<00:02:35.450> still

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
or maybe a new career would you still

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.759 
or maybe a new career would you still
say<00:02:36.049> go<00:02:36.709> for<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.569> well<00:02:38.569> if<00:02:38.959> there's<00:02:39.380> something

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
say go for it well if there's something

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.740 
say go for it well if there's something
in<00:02:39.860> their<00:02:40.069> mind<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.880> they<00:02:41.120> cannot<00:02:41.450> sleep

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
in their mind and they cannot sleep

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.259 
in their mind and they cannot sleep
because<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.319> that<00:02:42.530> then<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.190> think<00:02:43.700> they<00:02:43.910> should

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
because of that then I think they should

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.390 
because of that then I think they should
try<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.690> but<00:02:45.849> what<00:02:46.849> I<00:02:46.880> suggest<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.650> not<00:02:49.040> put

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
try it but what I suggest is to not put

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.759 
try it but what I suggest is to not put
everything<00:02:49.819> in<00:02:50.090> one<00:02:50.239> pocket<00:02:50.480> do<00:02:51.200> not<00:02:51.470> bet

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
everything in one pocket do not bet

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.400 
everything in one pocket do not bet
everything<00:02:52.730> over<00:02:52.940> yours<00:02:53.180> in<00:02:53.690> that<00:02:53.720> dream

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
everything over yours in that dream

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.370 
everything over yours in that dream
because<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.850> will<00:02:56.000> never<00:02:56.150> know<00:02:56.480> before<00:02:57.019> you

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
because you will never know before you

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.740 
because you will never know before you
try<00:02:57.650> whether<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.190> will<00:02:58.400> really<00:02:58.790> like<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.209> or

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
try whether you will really like it or

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.490 
try whether you will really like it or
you<00:02:59.870> can<00:03:00.049> really<00:03:00.230> do<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:00.739> so<00:03:02.079> do<00:03:03.079> something

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
you can really do that so do something

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.129 
you can really do that so do something
do<00:03:04.430> whatever<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:04.970> you<00:03:05.180> haven't<00:03:05.569> done<00:03:05.720> doing

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
do whatever that you haven't done doing

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.930 
do whatever that you haven't done doing
