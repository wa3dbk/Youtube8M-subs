00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.839 
they'll be more as a full analysis for
sure<00:04:59.680> to<00:04:59.740> review<00:04:59.949> of<00:05:00.159> it<00:05:00.280> it's<00:05:00.400> a<00:05:00.490> long<00:05:00.669> video

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
sure to review of it it's a long video

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.640 
sure to review of it it's a long video
but<00:05:01.000> there<00:05:01.210> was<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.360> lot<00:05:01.599> of<00:05:01.630> information<00:05:02.319> on<00:05:02.440> it

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
but there was a lot of information on it

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.649 
but there was a lot of information on it
so<00:05:03.340> I<00:05:03.370> try<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:03.669> recap<00:05:04.060> that<00:05:04.090> as<00:05:04.330> best<00:05:04.479> as

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
so I try and recap that as best as

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.300 
so I try and recap that as best as
possible<00:05:04.690> there's<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.530> lot<00:05:05.710> more<00:05:05.740> sort<00:05:06.280> of

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
possible there's a lot more sort of

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.159 
possible there's a lot more sort of
clarified<00:05:06.909> information<00:05:07.539> and<00:05:07.720> I'm<00:05:07.810> not<00:05:07.990> sure

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
clarified information and I'm not sure

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.320 
clarified information and I'm not sure
if<00:05:08.229> you<00:05:08.319> guys<00:05:08.409> want<00:05:08.770> this<00:05:08.919> or<00:05:09.099> not<00:05:09.130> but<00:05:09.460> I<00:05:10.180> was

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
if you guys want this or not but I was

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.540 
if you guys want this or not but I was
thinking<00:05:10.659> of<00:05:10.780> doing<00:05:10.810> a<00:05:11.169> video<00:05:11.349> where<00:05:12.190> I<00:05:12.220> would

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
thinking of doing a video where I would

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.399 
thinking of doing a video where I would
recap<00:05:13.030> everything<00:05:13.419> but<00:05:13.960> there's<00:05:14.139> still<00:05:14.229> one

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:14.409 
recap everything but there's still one

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:16.439 
recap everything but there's still one
component<00:05:15.159> I<00:05:15.400> want<00:05:15.639> to<00:05:15.729> find<00:05:15.909> out<00:05:16.120> for<00:05:16.419> sure

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
component I want to find out for sure

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.230 
component I want to find out for sure
and<00:05:16.930> I'm<00:05:17.020> waiting<00:05:17.440> for<00:05:17.469> that<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:18.250> co-op<00:05:18.909> modes

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
and I'm waiting for that the co-op modes

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.120 
and I'm waiting for that the co-op modes
which<00:05:19.449> is<00:05:19.630> going<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.050> be<00:05:20.110> released<00:05:20.500> later<00:05:20.590> and

which is going to be released later and

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.640 
which is going to be released later and
hopefully<00:05:22.060> that's<00:05:22.539> going<00:05:22.870> to<00:05:22.960> be<00:05:23.289> when<00:05:23.469> they

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
hopefully that's going to be when they

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.550 
hopefully that's going to be when they
talk<00:05:23.860> about<00:05:23.889> zombies<00:05:24.849> and<00:05:25.719> when<00:05:25.900> they<00:05:25.990> do<00:05:26.050> once
