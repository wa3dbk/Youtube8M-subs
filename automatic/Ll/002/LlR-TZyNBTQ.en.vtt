cleanup<00:01:29.420> for<00:01:30.420> example<00:01:30.990> let's<00:01:31.470> use<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.979> set

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
cleanup for example let's use this set

cleanup for example let's use this set
of<00:01:32.340> pancakes<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.479> first<00:01:33.750> thing<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.049> would<00:01:34.110> do

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
of pancakes the first thing I would do

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.770 
of pancakes the first thing I would do
is<00:01:34.680> place<00:01:35.040> my<00:01:35.070> container<00:01:35.640> onto<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> kitchen

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
is place my container onto the kitchen

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.960 
is place my container onto the kitchen
scale<00:01:37.110> you'll<00:01:37.979> see<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> container

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
scale you'll see that the container

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.289 
scale you'll see that the container
weighs<00:01:39.240> 36<00:01:40.170> grams<00:01:40.530> with<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.579> kitchen<00:01:42.000> scale

weighs 36 grams with this kitchen scale
you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.840> tear<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.350> weight<00:01:43.530> which<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.430> means

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
you can tear the weight which just means

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.090 
you can tear the weight which just means
to<00:01:45.000> bring<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.420> back<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.810> zero<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.890> if<00:01:46.979> you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
to bring it back to zero but if you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.039 
to bring it back to zero but if you
don't<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.670> option<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.240> yours<00:01:48.509> then

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
don't have that option on yours then

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.450 
don't have that option on yours then
you'll<00:01:49.200> want<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.560> write<00:01:49.799> down<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.040> total

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
you'll want to write down the total

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.219 
you'll want to write down the total
weight<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.970> container<00:01:51.180> which<00:01:52.020> you'll

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
weight of the container which you'll

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.700 
weight of the container which you'll
subtract<00:01:52.799> off<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.130> total<00:01:54.020> now<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.049> place<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.039 
subtract off the total now I place the
pancakes<00:01:56.219> into<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.880> container<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.840> you'll

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
pancakes into the container and you'll

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.800 
pancakes into the container and you'll
see<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.710> my<00:01:58.860> total<00:01:59.219> weight<00:01:59.399> you<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.329> grams

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
see I get my total weight you have grams

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.980 
see I get my total weight you have grams
and<00:02:01.200> ounces<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:02.159> like<00:02:02.729> using<00:02:02.969> grams<00:02:03.450> since<00:02:03.869> it

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
and ounces I like using grams since it

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.679 
and ounces I like using grams since it
makes<00:02:04.170> dividing<00:02:04.829> into<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.430> bit<00:02:05.460> easier<00:02:06.180> but

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
makes dividing into it a bit easier but

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.650 
makes dividing into it a bit easier but
you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.049> use<00:02:07.200> ounces<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:08.209> hear<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.479> whole

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
you can use ounces to hear the whole

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.270 
you can use ounces to hear the whole
recipe<00:02:09.929> waste<00:02:10.610> 229<00:02:11.610> grams

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
recipe waste 229 grams

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.250 
recipe waste 229 grams
and<00:02:12.400> today<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.000> want<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.630> make<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:13.990> recipe

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
and today I want to make this recipe

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.760 
and today I want to make this recipe
into<00:02:14.860> two<00:02:15.130> servings<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.420> would<00:02:16.660> divide<00:02:16.960> 2<00:02:17.380> 29

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
into two servings so I would divide 2 29

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.580 
into two servings so I would divide 2 29
by<00:02:17.950> 2<00:02:18.360> getting<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.450> total<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.140> hundred<00:02:20.170> and

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
by 2 getting a total of a hundred and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.480 
by 2 getting a total of a hundred and
fourteen<00:02:21.010> point<00:02:21.400> five<00:02:21.700> grams<00:02:22.770> last<00:02:23.770> DeCoteau

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490

plate tear it and put your serving size
weight<00:02:27.400> onto<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.270> plate<00:02:28.630> it's<00:02:29.200> as<00:02:29.440> simple<00:02:29.740> as

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
weight onto that plate it's as simple as

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:39.690 
weight onto that plate it's as simple as
that<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:38.200> here<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.560> would<00:02:38.920> have<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.100> little<00:02:39.400> over

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
that so here I would have a little over

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.699 
that so here I would have a little over
two<00:02:40.030> pancakes<00:02:40.330> for<00:02:41.290> one<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.560> my<00:02:41.590> servings<00:02:43.709> now

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
two pancakes for one of my servings now

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.370 
two pancakes for one of my servings now
let's<00:02:44.950> jump<00:02:45.190> into<00:02:45.370> number<00:02:45.730> two<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.630> I<00:02:46.660> method

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
let's jump into number two the I method

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.590 
let's jump into number two the I method
using<00:02:48.160> your<00:02:48.280> eyes<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.910> portion<00:02:49.300> out<00:02:49.420> your

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
using your eyes to portion out your

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.870 
using your eyes to portion out your
recipe<00:02:50.020> is<00:02:50.350> obviously<00:02:51.010> not<00:02:51.370> going<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.670> be<00:02:51.760> as

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
recipe is obviously not going to be as

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.970 
recipe is obviously not going to be as
accurate<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:52.959> if<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.200> don't<00:02:53.530> have<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.709> kitchen

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
accurate but if you don't have a kitchen

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.400 
accurate but if you don't have a kitchen
scale<00:02:54.280> it's<00:02:55.030> more<00:02:55.360> than<00:02:55.510> likely<00:02:55.780> gonna<00:02:56.260> be

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
scale it's more than likely gonna be

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.160 
scale it's more than likely gonna be
your<00:02:56.560> next<00:02:56.770> best<00:02:57.130> option<00:02:57.480> all<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.720> do<00:02:58.900> here

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
your next best option all you do here

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.590 
your next best option all you do here
for<00:02:59.530> example<00:03:00.070> if<00:03:00.340> your<00:03:00.700> portioning<00:03:01.240> out<00:03:01.390> a

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
for example if your portioning out a

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.170 
for example if your portioning out a
chili<00:03:01.930> let's<00:03:02.590> pretend<00:03:02.980> this<00:03:03.190> orange<00:03:03.700> juice<00:03:03.970> is

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
chili let's pretend this orange juice is

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.449 
chili let's pretend this orange juice is
chili<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:05.110> would<00:03:05.230> line<00:03:05.500> up<00:03:05.680> whatever<00:03:06.010> you're

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
chili you would line up whatever you're

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.220 
chili you would line up whatever you're
going<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.850> store<00:03:07.120> your<00:03:07.300> servings<00:03:07.750> in<00:03:07.990> and

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
going to store your servings in and

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.060 
going to store your servings in and
portion<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.100> out<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.580> eye<00:03:09.610> level<00:03:10.830> start<00:03:11.830> by

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
portion it out to eye level start by

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.580 
portion it out to eye level start by
pouring<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.610> small<00:03:12.970> amount<00:03:13.240> into<00:03:13.630> each<00:03:13.900> one<00:03:14.230> and

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
pouring a small amount into each one and

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.160 
pouring a small amount into each one and
then<00:03:14.950> slowly<00:03:15.400> distribute<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.420> rest<00:03:16.600> until

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
then slowly distribute the rest until

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.759 
then slowly distribute the rest until
nothing<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.769> left<00:03:17.830> if<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:19.690> recipe<00:03:19.930> isn't<00:03:20.410> one

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
nothing is left if the recipe isn't one

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.550 
nothing is left if the recipe isn't one
you<00:03:20.920> can<00:03:21.100> pour<00:03:21.370> like<00:03:21.970> these<00:03:22.150> pancakes<00:03:22.480> all<00:03:23.320> you

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
you can pour like these pancakes all you

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.770 
you can pour like these pancakes all you
would<00:03:23.709> do<00:03:23.920> is<00:03:24.250> just<00:03:24.280> take<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:25.000> three<00:03:25.330> pancakes

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
would do is just take the three pancakes

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.650 
would do is just take the three pancakes
you<00:03:26.050> have<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.620> compare<00:03:27.190> them<00:03:27.670> if<00:03:28.300> you<00:03:28.480> want

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
you have and compare them if you want

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.020 
you have and compare them if you want
two<00:03:28.930> servings<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.070> pancakes<00:03:30.550> aren't<00:03:30.910> all

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
two servings and the pancakes aren't all

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.390 
two servings and the pancakes aren't all
the<00:03:31.330> same<00:03:31.540> size<00:03:31.810> then<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.709> would<00:03:32.860> cut<00:03:33.100> one

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
the same size then you would cut one

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.509 
the same size then you would cut one
pancake<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:34.420> compensate<00:03:35.050> for<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.519> to

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
pancake to compensate for that to

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.250 
pancake to compensate for that to
portion<00:03:36.910> out<00:03:37.060> something<00:03:37.510> you<00:03:37.630> cut<00:03:37.900> like<00:03:38.230> a

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260

cheesecake bars pie and so on all you
have<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.280> do<00:03:42.489> is<00:03:42.730> attempt<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.239> cut<00:03:43.570> each<00:03:43.840> piece

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
the wait guessing method when I don't

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.070 
the wait guessing method when I don't
have<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.250> kitchen<00:04:00.640> scale<00:04:00.760> available<00:04:01.540> I<00:04:01.750> will
