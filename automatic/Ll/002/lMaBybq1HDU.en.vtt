tilting<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> capo<00:00:21.119> just<00:00:21.539> slightly<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.410> this

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
tilting the capo just slightly so this

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.540 
tilting the capo just slightly so this
is<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:23.220> purpose<00:00:23.880> just<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.930> know<00:00:25.340> but<00:00:26.340> if

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
is on purpose just so you know but if

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.160 
is on purpose just so you know but if
your<00:00:26.760> intonation<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.480> really<00:00:27.750> good<00:00:27.900> then<00:00:28.080> it

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
your intonation is really good then it

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.650 
your intonation is really good then it
should<00:00:28.349> just<00:00:28.439> be<00:00:28.560> straight<00:00:28.980> up<00:00:29.010> but<00:00:29.789> that's<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
should just be straight up but that's a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.690 
should just be straight up but that's a
little<00:00:30.750> bit<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.050> background<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.619> me<00:00:31.890> let's<00:00:32.520> get

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
little bit of background on me let's get

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
within an F now you can do this little F

within an F now you can do this little F
for<00:00:37.200> two<00:00:37.380> bars<00:00:37.579> really<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> piano

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
for two bars really it's just the piano

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.080 
for two bars really it's just the piano
that's<00:00:39.690> doing<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.700> when<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:41.910> play<00:00:42.059> it

that's doing this when you can play it
if<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.360> want<00:00:42.540> then<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:42.780> get<00:00:42.930> into<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.350> intro

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
if you want then we get into the intro

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:52.939 
if you want then we get into the intro
which<00:00:44.640> goes<00:00:44.879> d<00:00:45.539> minor<00:00:46.280> C<00:00:48.200> G<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:50.940> D<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.829> then<00:00:52.829> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
which goes d minor C G to D and then you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.930 
which goes d minor C G to D and then you
repeat<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.340> d<00:00:53.760> minor<00:00:54.890> C<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.610> would<00:00:56.789> just

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
repeat that d minor C and I would just

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.639 
repeat that d minor C and I would just
do<00:00:57.440> whole<00:00:58.440> notes<00:00:58.710> at<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.039> point<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.879> D<00:01:00.649> now

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
do whole notes at this point to D now

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.590 
do whole notes at this point to D now
we're<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> go<00:01:02.039> into<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.579> verse<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
we're going to go into the verse now the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.090 
we're going to go into the verse now the
only<00:01:03.870> thing<00:01:04.019> that's<00:01:04.320> different<00:01:04.409> about<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
only thing that's different about the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100 
only thing that's different about the
verse<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.580> instead<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:05.970> ending<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> d-major

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
verse is instead of ending on a d-major

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.920 
verse is instead of ending on a d-major
we<00:01:07.560> end<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> d<00:01:08.189> minor<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.510> t<00:01:09.689> minor

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
we end on a d minor so we have t minor

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.620 
we end on a d minor so we have t minor
the<00:01:10.200> truth<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> matter<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.220> I'm<00:01:11.640> calm<00:01:11.880> okay

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the truth of the matter is I'm calm okay

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.260 
the truth of the matter is I'm calm okay
see

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.639 

that's<00:01:17.270> your<00:01:17.509> D<00:01:17.719> minor<00:01:17.990> then<00:01:18.259> you<00:01:18.350> repeat<00:01:18.590> that

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
that's your D minor then you repeat that

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.130 
that's your D minor then you repeat that
D<00:01:19.100> minor<00:01:19.399> did<00:01:19.820> them<00:01:20.090> see<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:23.180> then<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:23.810> go<00:01:24.079> to

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
D minor did them see and then you go to

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.520 
D minor did them see and then you go to
the<00:01:24.799> gene<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:25.640> then<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.149> D<00:01:26.299> minor<00:01:26.570> that<00:01:27.320> make

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
the gene and then the D minor that make

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.330 
the gene and then the D minor that make
sense<00:01:28.390> now<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.450> go<00:01:29.750> into<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.079> pre-course<00:01:30.619> and

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
sense now you go into the pre-course and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.850 
sense now you go into the pre-course and
we're<00:01:31.460> going<00:01:31.579> to<00:01:31.610> do<00:01:31.850> B<00:01:32.270> flat<00:01:32.720> B<00:01:33.259> flat<00:01:33.289> bar

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
we're going to do B flat B flat bar

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.219 
we're going to do B flat B flat bar
chord<00:01:34.280> or<00:01:34.429> you<00:01:34.520> can<00:01:34.640> do<00:01:34.789> this<00:01:34.970> feet<00:01:35.299> flat<00:01:35.479> and

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
chord or you can do this feet flat and

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.469 
chord or you can do this feet flat and
you're<00:01:36.590> going<00:01:36.679> to<00:01:36.740> hold<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:36.979> for<00:01:37.039> two<00:01:37.369> bars<00:01:37.579> two

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
you're going to hold it for two bars two

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.999 
you're going to hold it for two bars two
three<00:01:39.079> four<00:01:39.530> one<00:01:40.069> two<00:01:40.100> three<00:01:40.549> four<00:01:41.179> a<00:01:41.869> seven<00:01:42.560> to

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
three four one two three four a seven to

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.139 
three four one two three four a seven to
three<00:01:43.429> four<00:01:43.819> 1234<00:01:45.069> and<00:01:46.069> right<00:01:46.579> now<00:01:46.759> coming<00:01:47.090> up

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
three four 1234 and right now coming up

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.760 
three four 1234 and right now coming up
is<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.420> most<00:01:47.659> complicated<00:01:48.080> part<00:01:48.380> of<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.590> song

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
is the most complicated part of the song

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.350 
is the most complicated part of the song
and<00:01:48.950> if<00:01:49.039> you<00:01:49.130> can<00:01:49.280> get<00:01:49.429> this<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:50.030> can<00:01:50.209> get

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
and if you can get this you can get

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.999 
and if you can get this you can get
anything<00:01:50.750> we're<00:01:51.439> gonna<00:01:51.560> go<00:01:51.770> D<00:01:52.189> minor<00:01:52.539> C<00:01:53.619> B<00:01:54.619> flat

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
anything we're gonna go D minor C B flat

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.690 
anything we're gonna go D minor C B flat
a<00:01:55.630> G<00:01:56.770> 2<00:01:57.770> 3<00:01:58.459> 4<00:01:59.409> so<00:02:00.409> it's<00:02:00.560> like<00:02:00.619> two<00:02:01.009> beats<00:02:01.429> each

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
a G 2 3 4 so it's like two beats each

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:15.130 
a G 2 3 4 so it's like two beats each
let's<00:02:02.179> do<00:02:02.330> that<00:02:02.479> again<00:02:05.110> 1234<00:02:06.700> 1234<00:02:10.209> 1234<00:02:12.610> jigen

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
let's do that again 1234 1234 1234 jigen

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.470 
let's do that again 1234 1234 1234 jigen
34<00:02:16.140> now<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.650> played<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.250> two<00:02:17.340> different<00:02:18.300> ways

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
34 now I played a two different ways

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.229 
34 now I played a two different ways
there<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:19.190> actually<00:02:20.190> did<00:02:20.489> three<00:02:20.760> fingers<00:02:21.120> at

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
there I actually did three fingers at

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.729 
there I actually did three fingers at
one<00:02:21.269> point<00:02:21.599> I<00:02:21.810> can't<00:02:21.989> remember<00:02:22.230> if<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.379> did<00:02:22.410> this

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
one point I can't remember if I did this

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.059 
one point I can't remember if I did this
or<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.030> then<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.780> borrowed<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
or this and then I borrowed it the

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.740 
or this and then I borrowed it the
second<00:02:26.430> time<00:02:26.459> around<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:27.000> do<00:02:27.150> whatever<00:02:27.450> you

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
second time around you do whatever you

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.800 
second time around you do whatever you
feel<00:02:27.780> like<00:02:28.019> it's<00:02:28.379> comfortable<00:02:28.739> for<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:30.450> and

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
feel like it's comfortable for you and

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.589 
feel like it's comfortable for you and
for<00:02:30.989> your<00:02:31.080> hands<00:02:31.519> so<00:02:32.519> that's<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.910> end<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
for your hands so that's the end of the

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.110 
for your hands so that's the end of the
pre-course<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:34.230> again<00:02:34.410> if<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.620> can<00:02:34.800> get<00:02:35.040> that

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
pre-course and again if you can get that

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.460 
pre-course and again if you can get that
you're<00:02:36.120> solid<00:02:36.599> for<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.840> rest<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.230> song

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
you're solid for the rest of the song

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.620 
you're solid for the rest of the song
because<00:02:37.860> it's<00:02:38.040> just<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.489> it's<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.450> same

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
because it's just a it's just the same

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.390 
because it's just a it's just the same
thing<00:02:39.690> over<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.410> over<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.769> over<00:02:40.830> again<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
thing over and over and over again the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.990 
thing over and over and over again the
chorus<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.569> same<00:02:42.900> thing<00:02:42.930> as<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.650> verse

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
chorus is the same thing as the verse

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.270 
chorus is the same thing as the verse

that<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.840> same<00:03:25.079> strum<00:03:25.530> for<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.340> black

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549

tighten<00:03:29.430> up<00:03:29.670> yes<00:03:30.180> that's<00:03:30.420> right<00:03:30.690> we<00:03:30.870> did<00:03:31.019> a

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
tighten up yes that's right we did a

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.410 
tighten up yes that's right we did a
video<00:03:31.260> for<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:32.340> if<00:03:32.519> you<00:03:32.670> know<00:03:32.819> that<00:03:33.090> strum

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
video for that so if you know that strum

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.550 
video for that so if you know that strum
if<00:03:33.569> you've<00:03:33.690> already<00:03:33.810> learned<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.200> song<00:03:34.380> then

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
if you've already learned that song then

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.039 
if you've already learned that song then
you<00:03:34.739> already<00:03:34.920> know<00:03:35.069> this<00:03:35.459> drum<00:03:35.790> or<00:03:36.120> if<00:03:36.750> you're

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
you already know this drum or if you're

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.900 
you already know this drum or if you're
learning<00:03:37.410> this<00:03:37.530> strum<00:03:37.859> you<00:03:38.220> can<00:03:38.400> go<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:38.850> you

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
learning this strum you can go and you

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.410 
learning this strum you can go and you
can<00:03:38.970> play<00:03:39.299> tighten<00:03:40.019> up<00:03:40.910> just<00:03:41.910> I<00:03:42.090> think<00:03:42.329> it's

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
can play tighten up just I think it's

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.140 
can play tighten up just I think it's
pretty<00:03:42.540> cool<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:43.530> only<00:03:43.829> thing<00:03:44.280> left<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:44.970> the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
pretty cool the only thing left is the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.270 
pretty cool the only thing left is the
outro<00:03:45.630> which<00:03:45.900> goes<00:03:46.139> on<00:03:46.290> for<00:03:46.530> quite<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:47.010> while

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.629 
outro which goes on for quite a while
and<00:03:47.579> it's<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.209> same<00:03:48.480> as<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:49.109> intro<00:03:49.590> again<00:03:50.130> d

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
and it's the same as the intro again d

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
major and again there's not really a

major and again there's not really a
guitar<00:04:04.720> part<00:04:05.050> except<00:04:05.590> for<00:04:05.800> in<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.160> chorus<00:04:06.700> and

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
guitar part except for in the chorus and

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.290 
guitar part except for in the chorus and
you<00:04:07.150> do<00:04:07.330> those<00:04:07.510> hits<00:04:08.220> so<00:04:09.220> with<00:04:09.610> this<00:04:09.640> I<00:04:10.030> like<00:04:10.180> to

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
you do those hits so with this I like to

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.420 
you do those hits so with this I like to
keep<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:10.569> nice<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:10.870> open<00:04:11.590> with<00:04:12.340> whole<00:04:13.000> notes

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
keep it nice and open with whole notes

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.810 
keep it nice and open with whole notes
maybe<00:04:15.430> in<00:04:15.819> the<00:04:16.650> second<00:04:17.650> verse<00:04:17.889> you<00:04:18.459> can<00:04:18.609> go<00:04:18.760> to

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
maybe in the second verse you can go to

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.210 
maybe in the second verse you can go to
those<00:04:19.000> all<00:04:19.359> down<00:04:19.750> strokes<00:04:23.010> something<00:04:24.010> like

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
those all down strokes something like

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.670 
those all down strokes something like
that

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.060 

but<00:04:28.680> there's<00:04:28.860> not<00:04:29.040> a<00:04:29.100> lot<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:30.770> really<00:04:31.770> do<00:04:31.919> in

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070
