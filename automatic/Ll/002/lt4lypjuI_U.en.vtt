which<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.210> my<00:00:27.330> first<00:00:27.599> triple

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
which is this was my first triple

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.560 
which is this was my first triple
nuclear<00:00:28.349> but<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:29.310> wasn't<00:00:29.550> exactly<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:30.119> legit

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
nuclear but it wasn't exactly a legit

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.939 
nuclear but it wasn't exactly a legit
triple<00:00:30.869> nuclear<00:00:31.170> since<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.529> was<00:00:31.650> spawn

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
triple nuclear since it was spawn

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.260 
triple nuclear since it was spawn
trapping<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.610> really<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.180> is

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
trapping and all I really have to do is

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.790 
trapping and all I really have to do is
hold<00:00:33.450> down<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.660> trigger<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.500> wasn't<00:00:34.770> that

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
hold down the trigger so it wasn't that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.440 
hold down the trigger so it wasn't that
impressive<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.399> i<00:00:35.790> think<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.149> was<00:00:36.210> still<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
impressive but i think it was still a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.810 
impressive but i think it was still a
pretty<00:00:36.690> great<00:00:36.870> gameplay<00:00:37.550> even<00:00:38.550> though<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.730> is

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
pretty great gameplay even though it is

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.979 
pretty great gameplay even though it is

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
gameplay there's really not much to it

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.190 
gameplay there's really not much to it
besides<00:02:17.700> me<00:02:18.090> just<00:02:18.389> holding<00:02:18.749> down<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.959> trigger

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
besides me just holding down the trigger

besides<00:02:19.799> you<00:02:20.340> know<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.639> the<00:02:20.879> numbers<00:02:21.689> like

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
besides you know that the numbers like

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.289 
besides you know that the numbers like
side<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.409> spawns<00:02:22.769> or<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.340> blitz<00:02:23.999> round

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
side of the spawns or the blitz round

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.550 
side of the spawns or the blitz round
switch<00:02:24.659> or<00:02:24.840> whatever<00:02:25.049> so<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.290> am<00:02:25.409> on<00:02:25.530> a

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
switch or whatever so I am on a

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.410 
switch or whatever so I am on a
different<00:02:25.859> side<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.159> map<00:02:26.280> but<00:02:26.549> it<00:02:27.269> pretty

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
different side of the map but it pretty

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.440 
different side of the map but it pretty
much<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.659> relatively<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.319> same<00:02:28.439> thing<00:02:28.920> but

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
much is relatively the same thing but

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.910 
much is relatively the same thing but
like<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.599> said<00:02:30.659> the<00:02:30.930> first<00:02:30.959> side<00:02:31.379> of<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:31.590> blood

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
like I said the first side of this blood

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.679 
like I said the first side of this blood
scheme<00:02:32.159> we<00:02:32.370> screwed<00:02:32.670> up<00:02:32.790> big<00:02:33.090> time<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.359> was<00:02:33.599> only

scheme we screwed up big time I was only
able<00:02:34.139> to<00:02:34.319> get<00:02:34.530> one<00:02:34.590> chemistry<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.879> this<00:02:36.209> could

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
able to get one chemistry so this could

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.809 
able to get one chemistry so this could
have<00:02:36.629> been<00:02:36.659> a<00:02:36.780> extremely<00:02:37.680> beast<00:02:38.099> gameplay<00:02:38.639> I

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
spawn trapping definitely something fun

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.649 
spawn trapping definitely something fun
to<00:02:44.639> do<00:02:44.760> when<00:02:44.879> you're<00:02:44.969> just<00:02:45.150> playing<00:02:45.359> with<00:02:45.510> some

to do when you're just playing with some
friends<00:02:46.049> just<00:02:46.079> having<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.560> good<00:02:46.680> time<00:02:46.889> but<00:02:47.639> you

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
friends just having a good time but you

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.179 
friends just having a good time but you
know<00:02:48.419> it<00:02:48.540> does<00:02:48.689> get<00:02:48.840> old<00:02:48.989> extremely<00:02:49.590> fast<00:02:49.859> and

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.610 
know it does get old extremely fast and
it<00:02:50.730> gets<00:02:51.120> stale<00:02:51.510> extremely<00:02:52.109> quick<00:02:52.319> so<00:02:52.469> it's

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
it gets stale extremely quick so it's

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.379 
it gets stale extremely quick so it's
not<00:02:52.739> like<00:02:52.949> that's<00:02:53.549> kind<00:02:53.819> of<00:02:53.909> why<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.060> don't

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
not like that's kind of why I don't

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.240 
not like that's kind of why I don't
spawn<00:02:54.689> trap<00:02:55.019> more<00:02:55.230> than<00:02:55.379> I<00:02:55.439> do<00:02:55.500> spawn<00:02:56.010> trap

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250
