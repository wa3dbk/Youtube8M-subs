00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
creative example which also stands out

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.020 
creative example which also stands out
from<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.200> crowd<00:03:57.380> this<00:03:58.040> may<00:03:58.250> look<00:03:58.460> totally

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
from the crowd this may look totally

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
different from the last two shots but it

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.950 
different from the last two shots but it
still<00:04:01.220> has<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.550> crucial<00:04:02.000> elements<00:04:02.480> presence
