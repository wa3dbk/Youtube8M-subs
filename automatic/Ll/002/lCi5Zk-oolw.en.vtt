00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.529
 Hi I greet you today did you go 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.540
 it's crisp video in those days 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.590
 Two tips I want to give the order 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.919
 the evening hunger attacks 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.419
 get rid of them and get around 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.610
 simply satisfied in the evening as saturated 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.030
 to go to bed without that 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.059
 Feeling somehow in the evening again 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.239
 to have sinned so the first of all 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.280
 The most important tip of mine is that I know 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.910
 tell it every time with green is 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.310
 really the essence for a healthy 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.690
 raw food and it is also in principle the 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.730
 source of vitamins and vitamins 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.100
 get minerals if we 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.450
 enough vitamins and minerals too 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.970
 we need a lot less 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.079
 eat and eat saturated much earlier 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.799
 we do not have enough vitamin and too little 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.570
 we can eat mineral rich 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.189
 we do not want to be a bit 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.829
 really tired and here is the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.509
 key if you until midday 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.180
 eat it for breakfast and for 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.550
 lunch a large part 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.070
 wild herbs have taken to you speak 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.340
 about the model over juices over simple 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.750
 So you will chew this evening 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.640
 hunger attacks do not have easy 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.790
 because of your vitamin depots case 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.500
 are makes sense or 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.450
 So that's one of those tips so much wild 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.220
 early as possible until noon at the latest 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.260
 to take you 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.940
 the second tip is change yours 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.909
 official customs if you like 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.200
 so far , in the evening, they are white too 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.610
 never ever look like most of them 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.049
 get ahead of the tv sets 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.909
 the couch then your body of 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.680
 brain with that suggest now I get 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.439
 What to feed was usually somehow 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.700
 chips whatever be eaten 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.740
 Most people consume year 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.450
 during the tv-cook after work 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.270
 her dinner bread and that suggests 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.340
 Of course you are connected to that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.659
 Of course, there is a connection to a body 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.330
 their old habits that is to change 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.530
 your habits begin so you 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.899

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.979
 what you make it eat yes if you do 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.739
