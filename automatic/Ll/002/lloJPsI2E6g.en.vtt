00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.500
 welcome to a new block back 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.540
 Today we are going to present our new 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.430
 four and a half angle grinder 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.369
 inches of w 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.560
 41 20 the grinders were designed 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.900
 to make different types of cuts 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.150
 and wear on metals and given their 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.360
 versatility today we can make cuts 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.310
 in concrete and masonry this goes from the 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.039
 hand to the correct selection of 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.860
 accessory as for its design is 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.750
 ergonomic compact size giving the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.409
 user greater comfort in the stage of 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.440
 work has an auxiliary handle 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:45.839
 Two positions of palette trigger adjustment 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.390
 of security that before any 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.329
 unexpectedly the machine to be released from 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.420
 switch separates the motor and guards from 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.190
 self-adjustable safety in terms of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.069
 gear box as we can appreciate 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.350
 It is compact, giving the user greater 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.179
 accessibility in work with spaces 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.339
 reduced in terms of maintenance 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.470
 we can appreciate that we have easy 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.690
 access to the gearbox and has 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.240
 a shampoo style design that removing 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.570
 only one screw can access 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.570
 clean 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.730
 Now we are going to place the flap for 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.540
 perform the wear and finally we go 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.540
 to polish 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.280
 remember that for the use of this 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.650
 electric tool is indispensable 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.440
 the use of security elements 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.090
 such as gloves and eye protector 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.520
 remember that a resident should never 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.920
 to be used without holding handle and 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.990
 protective guard this one has to be 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.600
 positioned in such a way that it covers the 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.910
 physical integrity of the user 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.520
 moladora has a maximum capacity of 4 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.500
 inches and a half and it is very common to take 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.319
 save it to place a 7 disc 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.600
 inch this is not good because 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.000
 the discs of 7 were designed to 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.170
 spin under other revolutions per minute 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.970
 and the machine 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.910
 exceeds disk speeds of 7 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.560
 inches like any grinder does not 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.390
 they can make shorts in low wood 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.380
 no concept and it is recommended 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.540
 use it in wide spaces 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.220
 this new resident is already 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.020
 available in the market and can 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.360
 Acquire in any home center or 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.280
 closer to home hardware 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.890
 It has the same three - year warranty and 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.540
 the broadest service network in the country
