00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.640
 spring is the DIY season 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.320
 it doesn't matter if it's home cleaning or gardening 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.920
 people shop in do-it-yourself centers 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.440
 But how are bulky gardening tools placed in vehicles? 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.360
 ADAC has studied the thing and shows us how we can be wrong in loading the tools in the car 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.000
 the first crash test is carried out with a well positioned load 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.120
 as it should be 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.560
 Smaller and more pointed objects 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.240
 they must be stored in bags, baskets or cartons 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.640
 larger and heavier objects 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.040
 as low as possible or attached to the back of the seats or to the rear seat 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.320
 so as not to give him the chance to project forward 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.120
 particularly heavy objects or, as in our case, a can of paint 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.200
 they must stand on the footrest so that they lock against the front seats and do not fly away 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.000
 To demonstrate the potential threat of our load the ADAC simulated a frontal impact at 50 km / h 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.560
 even with a correct load positioning 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.240
 you can see how much energy there is in the objects 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.400
 the rear bench is noticeably bent 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.200
 but the most important thing is that there are no blunt instruments 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.640
 to hurt passengers 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.840
 the results are seen 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.040
 but who loads their own tools like ADAC experts? 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.120
 the second attempt perhaps reflects a little more 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.840
 habits of an ordinary person 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.760
 we simulated a head-on collision at 50 km / h 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.360
 we have misplaced our load 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.840
 and made the mistake of many of breaking down the rear seats 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.520
 to load bulky items quickly without thinking too much 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.360
 which can have fatal consequences 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.960
 most place objects in this unsafe way 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.120
 and in this sense the result of the second crash test is alarming 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.680
 the unfixed load is projected forward with all its weight 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.920
 the seats are hugely damaged and crushed 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.880
 the driver, together with the passenger, would surely suffer cuts to the arms 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.000
 to the head and to the nape and also traumas to the spine through the damaged seats 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.840
 shocking images that no one would like to see in reality 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.840
 so make sure you buy your DIY tools 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.640
 with safety belts and eyelets 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.960
 with the example of a small vehicle you can see how immense it is 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.160
 the load volume that can be carried in the passenger compartment 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.120
 unfortunately the safety eyelets for loading are only found in station wagons 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.320
 and ADAC requests that they be introduced for all vehicles
