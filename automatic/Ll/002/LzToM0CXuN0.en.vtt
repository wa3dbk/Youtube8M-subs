00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello everyone today I bring you a new more updated comparison of the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.810
 today's portable consoles talked about the characteristics of the 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.370
 playstation vita and the nintendo 3ds 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.650
 this Christmas will be crucial for nintendo and sony in all aspects 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.510
 but if there is a decisive fight it will be the one that star their two new consoles 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.419
 playstation vita and nintendo 3ds 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.069
 leaving aside desktop consoles portable platforms 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.380
 live a new stage of glory 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.119
 the output of nintendo 3ds and the imminent arrival of playstation vita return to 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.500
 touch avoid the attention of crimes on portable platforms 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.470
 without belittling all those who still make a great profit 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.820
 nintendo ds and psp it is obvious that the scene called for a shouting change and finally 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.210
 has produced 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.540
 both consoles have a lot to offer and apparently 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.440
 they play in different leagues 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.660
 nevertheless they are both competing with the mark funds 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.470
 hook up the adult audience and convince him to pull out his console to 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.440
 the street is going to be complicated and it is still one of the pending tasks 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.940
 part of nintendo 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.810
 said what both laptops have been able to incorporate successfully 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.390
 characteristics that exceed the use of key paper boy with much success 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.860
 redefining the playable aspect and turning the experience into something 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.390
 much more accessible and intuitive 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.990
 Nintendo 3DS 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.200
 the console managed to surprise fascinate us and wish to experiment in 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.750
 first hand that of the 3d without glasses 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.330
 the impact was powerful in the scene but the first catalog of titles although 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.820
 oriented to convince the public arcor has not managed to capture the attention of 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.130
 those who play the most 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.610
 now remember that the first steps of every platform serve as 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.090
 experiments on the direction that the second wave games will take 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.130
 to subsequently consolidate a third full of jits 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.480
 in this super-strict sense there are three or four previews has enchanted and 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.909
 We are already waiting for the arrival of games like Super Mario 3ds Mario Kart 3ds 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.420
 mario paper 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.810
 the legend of zelda ocarina of time 3d or of course 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.690
 metal gear solid 3 snake eater 3d 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.039
 play Station Vita 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.039
 Much has been talked about this console in recent months 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:15.169
 with a competitive initial price 249 euros 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.470
 the console starts up offering power and incorporating a series of 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.079
 characteristics that allow to offer a perfect jugabilidad 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.579
 In this sense the sony laptop starts strong and already has titles 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.129
 First class 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.439
 resistance killzone uncharted golden abyss 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.619
 this disk hayter x tekken 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:35.340
 gravity 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.080
 wipeout 2048 a list as broad as promising 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:43.099
 I sincerely believe that there is room for both 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.749
 both pose different styles and offer characteristics of 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:50.219
 connectivity that will help consolidate both systems among the 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:51.139
 crimes 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.589
 in the case of nintendo there is still a long way to go and it is obvious that sony has 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:58.409
 taken his time to start big 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.849
 Maybe the key starts to spin around the prices and maybe a possible 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.699
 download of games influence the decision of those who play more
