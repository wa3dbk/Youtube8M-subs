00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.620 
million dollars LeBron's going to earn
49<00:01:46.580> million<00:01:46.789> dollars<00:01:47.119> but<00:01:47.239> what's<00:01:47.479> really

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
49 million dollars but what's really

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.320 
49 million dollars but what's really
interesting<00:01:47.750> Bob<00:01:48.349> is<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.770> mix<00:01:49.149> Kobe<00:01:50.149> gets

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
interesting Bob is the mix Kobe gets

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.900 
interesting Bob is the mix Kobe gets
almost<00:01:50.720> all<00:01:51.080> of<00:01:51.259> his<00:01:51.380> money<00:01:51.560> from<00:01:51.950> salary<00:01:52.429> not

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
almost all of his money from salary not

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.790 
almost all of his money from salary not
much<00:01:53.179> on<00:01:53.390> sponsorships<00:01:54.110> when<00:01:54.289> you<00:01:54.380> compare

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
much on sponsorships when you compare

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.339 
much on sponsorships when you compare
with<00:01:55.310> LeBron<00:01:55.729> most<00:01:56.330> of<00:01:56.509> his<00:01:56.690> money<00:01:56.899> comes<00:01:57.289> from

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
with LeBron most of his money comes from

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.169 
with LeBron most of his money comes from
sponsorships<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:58.369> think<00:01:58.520> part<00:01:58.789> of<00:01:58.879> that<00:01:58.940> is<00:01:59.030> the

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
sponsorships I think part of that is the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.059 
sponsorships I think part of that is the
fact<00:01:59.420> that<00:01:59.509> LeBron<00:01:59.959> he's<00:02:00.470> only<00:02:00.679> been<00:02:00.890> in<00:02:01.039> the

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
fact that LeBron he's only been in the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.130 
fact that LeBron he's only been in the
league<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.340> few<00:02:01.670> years<00:02:01.970> so<00:02:02.209> he's<00:02:02.390> been<00:02:02.629> impacted

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
league a few years so he's been impacted

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.080 
league a few years so he's been impacted
by<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:03.349> league<00:02:03.619> salary<00:02:03.890> structure<00:02:04.459> but<00:02:04.940> what

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
by the league salary structure but what

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.669 
by the league salary structure but what
it<00:02:05.179> tells<00:02:05.360> me<00:02:05.509> too<00:02:05.750> is<00:02:05.899> that<00:02:05.989> you<00:02:06.140> know<00:02:06.229> Kobe
