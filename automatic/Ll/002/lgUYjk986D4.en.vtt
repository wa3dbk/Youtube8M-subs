hi hey guys see i came up with this idea
a<00:01:15.780> long<00:01:16.020> time<00:01:16.320> ago<00:01:16.470> if<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.880> want<00:01:18.119> an<00:01:18.570> axial

a long time ago if you want an axial

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.530 
a long time ago if you want an axial
force<00:01:19.650> you're<00:01:20.250> gonna<00:01:20.460> need<00:01:20.700> either<00:01:21.090> color

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
force you're gonna need either color

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.520 
force you're gonna need either color
paper<00:01:21.930> or<00:01:22.500> printer<00:01:22.950> paper<00:01:24.020> regular<00:01:25.020> pay<00:01:25.200> for

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
paper or printer paper regular pay for

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.010 
paper or printer paper regular pay for
it<00:01:26.040> doesn't<00:01:26.430> really<00:01:26.520> work<00:01:26.850> well<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
it doesn't really work well like the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.649 
it doesn't really work well like the
type<00:01:28.200> i<00:01:28.350> used<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.860> write<00:01:29.040> stories<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:31.159> ya<00:01:32.159> see

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
type i used to write stories so ya see

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.039 
type i used to write stories so ya see
how<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.720> doing<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.490> once<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.640> make<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.150> you

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
how you doing is once you make one you

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.800 
how you doing is once you make one you
just<00:01:37.079> repeat<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.040> process<00:01:38.759> except<00:01:39.570> either

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
just repeat the process except either

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.859 
just repeat the process except either
make<00:01:40.079> them<00:01:40.229> bigger<00:01:40.530> or<00:01:41.030> smaller<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.630> can

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
make them bigger or smaller so you can

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.469 
make them bigger or smaller so you can
fit<00:01:43.049> them<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.320> together<00:01:43.790> um<00:01:44.790> right<00:01:45.119> now<00:01:45.329> I'm

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
fit them in together um right now I'm

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.230 
fit them in together um right now I'm
going<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.049> show<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.320> how<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.740> make<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.970> first

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
going to show you how to make the first

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.690 
going to show you how to make the first
one<00:01:49.399> okay<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.960> get<00:01:52.229> whatever<00:01:52.829> corner<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
one okay so you get whatever corner and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.399 
one okay so you get whatever corner and
then<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.540> fold<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.020> across<00:01:56.509> after<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.689> you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
then you fold it across after that you

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.970 
then you fold it across after that you
flip<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.829> over

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
flip it over

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.580 
flip it over
and<00:02:00.220> then<00:02:01.680> fold<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.830> crease<00:02:03.160> really<00:02:03.850> hard<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
and then fold the crease really hard and

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.480 
and then fold the crease really hard and
then<00:02:05.800> after<00:02:06.160> that<00:02:06.190> just<00:02:07.120> keep<00:02:07.450> on<00:02:07.660> holding

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
then after that just keep on holding

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
then after that just keep on holding
keep<00:02:09.490> on<00:02:09.730> holding<00:02:10.119> until<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:12.280> get<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:13.330> this

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
keep on holding until you get to this

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.860 
keep on holding until you get to this
triangle<00:02:14.490> once<00:02:15.490> you're<00:02:15.700> there<00:02:15.940> pull<00:02:16.660> out<00:02:16.690> your

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
triangle once you're there pull out your

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.360 
triangle once you're there pull out your
glue<00:02:17.610> open<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.880> up<00:02:19.680> or<00:02:20.680> tape<00:02:21.450> put<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.600> there

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
glue open it up or tape put it there

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:31.020 
glue open it up or tape put it there
then<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:28.420> there<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.580> really<00:02:30.580> that's<00:02:30.760> how<00:02:30.940> you

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
then and there and really that's how you

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.020 
then and there and really that's how you
do<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.330> now<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.980> second<00:02:33.490> one<00:02:33.670> that's<00:02:33.910> if

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
do it now the second one that's if

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.670 
do it now the second one that's if
you're<00:02:34.210> going<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.360> make<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.570> sword<00:02:34.900> might<00:02:35.470> have

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
you're going to make a sword might have

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.130 
you're going to make a sword might have
to<00:02:35.800> be<00:02:35.950> bigger<00:02:36.280> or<00:02:36.430> smaller<00:02:36.730> if<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.630> want<00:02:37.930> it

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
to be bigger or smaller if you want it

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.840 
to be bigger or smaller if you want it
to<00:02:38.440> start<00:02:38.650> connecting<00:02:38.920> from<00:02:39.220> up<00:02:39.430> here<00:02:39.640> you're

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
to start connecting from up here you're

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.090 
to start connecting from up here you're
going<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.030> have<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.330> make<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.600> smaller<00:02:40.900> but<00:02:41.830> if

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
going to have to make it smaller but if

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.250 
going to have to make it smaller but if
you<00:02:42.280> make<00:02:42.460> even<00:02:43.090> bigger<00:02:43.300> one<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.780> can<00:02:43.930> connect

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
you make even bigger one you can connect

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.960 
you make even bigger one you can connect
it<00:02:44.350> down<00:02:44.530> here<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:44.950> start<00:02:45.250> making<00:02:45.460> a<00:02:45.760> longer

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
it down here and start making a longer

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.410 
it down here and start making a longer
one<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.920> turns<00:02:48.130> out<00:02:48.280> like<00:02:48.460> this<00:02:48.670> yep<00:02:49.150> it's

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
one and it turns out like this yep it's

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.170 
one and it turns out like this yep it's
