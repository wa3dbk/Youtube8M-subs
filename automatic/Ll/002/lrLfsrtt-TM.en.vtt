spindles that you find you can see this

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.910 
spindles that you find you can see this
isn't<00:00:41.100> too<00:00:41.250> straight<00:00:42.380> but<00:00:43.380> this<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.650> a<00:00:43.680> piece

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
isn't too straight but this is a piece

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.710 
isn't too straight but this is a piece
of<00:00:43.950> bear<00:00:44.250> grass<00:00:44.520> stock<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.150> is<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.630> the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
of bear grass stock this is one of the

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.230 
of bear grass stock this is one of the
best<00:00:46.050> materials<00:00:46.740> that<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.040> can<00:00:47.220> use<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:47.940> the

best materials that you can use for the
hand<00:00:48.480> drill<00:00:48.780> now<00:00:49.020> finding<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.590> straight<00:00:49.950> one<00:00:50.160> is

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
hand drill now finding a straight one is

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.170 
hand drill now finding a straight one is
not<00:00:51.240> the<00:00:51.420> easiest<00:00:51.840> task<00:00:52.850> basically<00:00:53.850> what<00:00:54.060> we

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
not the easiest task basically what we

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.630 
not the easiest task basically what we
can<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.780> use<00:00:54.960> straight<00:00:55.350> sections<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
can do is use straight sections of the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.080 
can do is use straight sections of the
bear<00:00:56.820> grass<00:00:57.120> stock<00:00:58.490> to<00:00:59.490> be<00:00:59.610> able<00:00:59.700> to<00:00:59.970> achieve

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
bear grass stock to be able to achieve

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.180 
bear grass stock to be able to achieve
an<00:01:00.480> ember<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.080> i'll<00:01:01.560> show<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.800> how<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.040> get

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
an ember and i'll show you how to get

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.100 
an ember and i'll show you how to get
that<00:01:02.430> done<00:01:08.300> and<00:01:09.300> i'm<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.780> cut

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that done and i'm just going to cut

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.030 
that done and i'm just going to cut
going<00:01:10.440> around<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.980> way<00:01:12.800> so<00:01:13.800> that<00:01:13.830> i<00:01:14.010> don't

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
going around this way so that i don't

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.240 
going around this way so that i don't
split<00:01:14.940> all<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.330> way<00:01:15.900> up<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.290> spindle<00:01:16.680> when<00:01:17.190> i

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
split all the way up the spindle when i

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.880 
split all the way up the spindle when i
go<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.430> snap<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.060> once<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:18.840> there<00:01:19.080> it'll<00:01:19.440> snap

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
go to snap it once it's there it'll snap

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.320 
go to snap it once it's there it'll snap
cleanly<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:24.030> next<00:01:24.479> thing<00:01:24.659> we're<00:01:24.870> going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.050> do

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
cleanly the next thing we're going to do

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.030 
cleanly the next thing we're going to do
is<00:01:27.330> we're<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.690> to<00:01:27.750> take<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.590> we're

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
is we're going to take this and we're

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.180 
is we're going to take this and we're
going<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.250> cut<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:30.890> about<00:01:31.890> halfway

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
going to cut it here about halfway

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.820 
going to cut it here about halfway
through<00:01:35.299> then<00:01:36.299> directly<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.320> other<00:01:37.440> side

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
through then directly on the other side

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.250 
through then directly on the other side
will<00:01:38.490> come<00:01:38.729> down<00:01:38.909> about<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.570> far<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:42.260> we'll

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
will come down about this far and we'll

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.649 
will come down about this far and we'll
do<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.680> same<00:01:43.950> thing

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:57.340 

from<00:01:50.659> there<00:01:52.689> just<00:01:53.689> snap<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.020> off<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:57.229> you'll

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
from there just snap it off and you'll

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.560 
from there just snap it off and you'll
have<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.500> piece<00:01:57.770> that<00:01:57.799> looks<00:01:58.130> like<00:01:58.369> this<00:02:01.570> this

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
have a piece that looks like this this

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.180 
have a piece that looks like this this
will<00:02:02.720> require<00:02:02.869> some<00:02:03.320> cleaning<00:02:03.710> up<00:02:08.860> just<00:02:09.860> clean

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
will require some cleaning up just clean

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.510 
will require some cleaning up just clean
up<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.489> little<00:02:10.610> notch<00:02:11.739> shave<00:02:12.739> this<00:02:13.040> out<00:02:13.280> just

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520

this will give you a good mating surface

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.750 
this will give you a good mating surface
for<00:02:29.000> your<00:02:29.090> full-size<00:02:29.540> spindle<00:02:33.580> next<00:02:34.580> what
