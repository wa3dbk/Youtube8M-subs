my<00:00:12.480> project<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.049> about<00:00:13.820> about<00:00:14.820> studying

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
my project is about about studying

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.230 
my project is about about studying
regeneration<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:16.049> zebrafish<00:00:16.789> and<00:00:17.789> zebrafish

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
regeneration in zebrafish and zebrafish

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.480 
regeneration in zebrafish and zebrafish
are<00:00:18.750> these<00:00:19.230> very<00:00:19.529> small<00:00:19.650> fish<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.250> are<00:00:20.279> found

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
are these very small fish that are found

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.210 
are these very small fish that are found
in<00:00:20.670> aquariums<00:00:21.320> they're<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.410> common<00:00:22.949> and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
in aquariums they're really common and

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.950 
in aquariums they're really common and
they're<00:00:23.730> very<00:00:23.760> unique<00:00:24.150> because<00:00:24.359> they're<00:00:24.779> able

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
they're very unique because they're able

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.240 
they're very unique because they're able
to<00:00:25.230> regenerate<00:00:25.470> tissue<00:00:25.680> that's<00:00:26.130> been

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
to regenerate tissue that's been

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.490 
to regenerate tissue that's been
amputated<00:00:26.609> it's<00:00:27.449> really<00:00:27.689> exciting<00:00:28.140> project

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
amputated it's really exciting project

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.650 
amputated it's really exciting project
because<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.580> will<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.210> eventually<00:00:30.330> lead

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
because it will it can eventually lead

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.200 
because it will it can eventually lead
to<00:00:31.309> therapies<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.340> will<00:00:32.700> help<00:00:32.820> people<00:00:33.149> who

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
to therapies that will help people who

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.290 
to therapies that will help people who
have<00:00:33.590> lost<00:00:34.590> tissue<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:35.340> people<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.149> had<00:00:36.270> a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
have lost tissue like people have had a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.180 
have lost tissue like people have had a
heart<00:00:36.510> attack<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.780> can't<00:00:37.320> regrow<00:00:37.710> back<00:00:37.920> heart
