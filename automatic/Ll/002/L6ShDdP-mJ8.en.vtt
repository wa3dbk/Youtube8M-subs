update this channel with any new videos
lately<00:00:08.790> as<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.480> may<00:00:09.570> have<00:00:09.599> noticed<00:00:10.429> but<00:00:11.429> there

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
lately as you may have noticed but there

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.599 
lately as you may have noticed but there
is<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.820> reason<00:00:12.179> for<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.889> here<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:13.980> is

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.269 

I've<00:00:18.240> been

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
I've been

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.769 
I've been
making<00:00:19.580> better<00:00:19.820> videos<00:00:19.910> for<00:00:20.330> this<00:00:20.390> channel<00:00:20.449> as

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
making better videos for this channel as

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.260 
making better videos for this channel as
promised<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:21.949> only<00:00:22.160> thing<00:00:22.369> that<00:00:22.910> goes<00:00:23.119> along

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
promised the only thing that goes along

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.080 
promised the only thing that goes along
with<00:00:23.449> that<00:00:23.599> is<00:00:24.009> better<00:00:25.009> videos<00:00:25.369> means<00:00:25.759> more

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
with that is better videos means more

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.839 
with that is better videos means more
time<00:00:26.240> which<00:00:27.199> also<00:00:27.380> means<00:00:27.710> longer<00:00:28.310> gaps<00:00:28.609> of

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
time which also means longer gaps of

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.170 
time which also means longer gaps of
silence<00:00:29.239> in<00:00:29.449> between<00:00:29.509> each<00:00:29.989> video<00:00:30.259> and<00:00:31.180> that

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
silence in between each video and that

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.380 
silence in between each video and that
is<00:00:32.540> not<00:00:32.930> ideal<00:00:33.370> so<00:00:34.370> while<00:00:34.850> working<00:00:35.120> on

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
is not ideal so while working on

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.640 
is not ideal so while working on
everything<00:00:35.600> I've<00:00:35.900> been<00:00:36.080> going<00:00:36.290> over<00:00:36.530> in<00:00:36.620> my

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
everything I've been going over in my

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.970 
everything I've been going over in my
head<00:00:37.540> something<00:00:38.540> else<00:00:39.050> I<00:00:39.379> could<00:00:39.559> do<00:00:39.739> in

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
head something else I could do in

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.500 
head something else I could do in
between<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.339> big<00:00:40.519> stuff<00:00:40.730> on<00:00:40.879> this<00:00:41.030> channel<00:00:41.239> I

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
between the big stuff on this channel I

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.210 
between the big stuff on this channel I
mean<00:00:41.659> something<00:00:42.199> quicker<00:00:42.409> that<00:00:42.860> I<00:00:42.980> can<00:00:43.129> do

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
mean something quicker that I can do

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.689 
mean something quicker that I can do
more<00:00:43.339> regularly<00:00:44.110> but<00:00:45.110> is<00:00:45.890> also<00:00:46.220> entertaining

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
more regularly but is also entertaining

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.790 
more regularly but is also entertaining
and<00:00:46.909> hopefully<00:00:47.360> worth<00:00:47.510> watching

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
and hopefully worth watching

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.180 
and hopefully worth watching
I<00:00:48.829> was<00:00:49.220> thinking<00:00:49.489> either<00:00:49.780> maybe<00:00:50.780> gameplays<00:00:51.739> or

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
I was thinking either maybe gameplays or

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.670 
I was thinking either maybe gameplays or
something<00:00:53.090> else<00:00:53.329> or<00:00:53.690> both<00:00:54.440> I<00:00:55.570> am<00:00:56.570> not<00:00:56.840> sure<00:00:57.170> yet

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
something else or both I am not sure yet

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.319 
something else or both I am not sure yet
now<00:00:58.160> just<00:00:58.399> because<00:00:58.640> I'm<00:00:58.789> considering

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
now just because I'm considering

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.930 
now just because I'm considering
starting<00:00:59.600> to<00:01:00.500> record<00:01:00.739> gaming<00:01:01.340> videos<00:01:01.609> does

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
starting to record gaming videos does

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.270 
starting to record gaming videos does
not<00:01:02.059> mean<00:01:02.239> this<00:01:02.390> is<00:01:02.539> going<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:02.840> become<00:01:03.019> another

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
not mean this is going to become another

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.660 
not mean this is going to become another
gaming<00:01:04.280> channel<00:01:04.550> per<00:01:04.699> se<00:01:06.160> it's<00:01:07.160> going<00:01:07.429> to<00:01:07.550> be

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
gaming channel per se it's going to be

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.650 
gaming channel per se it's going to be
more<00:01:07.850> like<00:01:09.340> animation<00:01:10.340> channel<00:01:10.820> where<00:01:11.630> I

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
more like animation channel where I

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.800 
more like animation channel where I
possibly<00:01:12.170> play<00:01:12.560> games<00:01:13.070> sometimes<00:01:14.060> maybe<00:01:16.810> hope

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
possibly play games sometimes maybe hope

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.960 
possibly play games sometimes maybe hope
that<00:01:17.990> make<00:01:18.110> some<00:01:18.259> sense<00:01:18.460> but<00:01:19.460> yeah<00:01:19.940> I

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
that make some sense but yeah I

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.140 
that make some sense but yeah I
currently<00:01:20.570> planned<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.410> am<00:01:21.679> doing<00:01:22.030> at<00:01:23.030> the
