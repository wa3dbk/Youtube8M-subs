 spent the night on the open sea in the morning 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.620
 understand that they came to the island of Reinek 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.770
 only thanks could be saved 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.240
 calm weather this case is banal 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.960
 negligence in one voice speak 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.820
 rescuers 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.070
 in the bathing season of the fearless and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.470
 irresponsible vacationers whole sea

 friday saturday and sunday days 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:16.380
 special duty Ministry of Emergency and not afraid cost 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:19.140
 drops will move or something else commendable 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.659
 hitting a boat or aquabike per person 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.850
 not a rare case at sea supposedly 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.450
 it is from this killed the diver in the bay 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.820
 bell 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.690
 body searched for more than a week by chance on 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.620
 he came across 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.600
 yourself aqua bikers even flooded 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.020
 we repeat see man 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.100
 thought to tell him to swim 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.020
 details of the incident to be 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.210
 find out the consequence is now pushing 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.430
 only assumptions so for example one 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.740
 of the causes of the tragedy called non-compliance 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.430
 security measures at the same time in schools 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.979
 diving 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.250
 study them in the first lectures he 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.369
 pumped under water attached to the corr 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.409
 one coil under water quality and 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.909
 thrown over the surface that is above 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.360
 the surface of the water arm is about on 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.759
 one and a half 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.950
 in different queens up to 2 meters that is very 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:11.230
 clearly seen the court that pass leading 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.019
 the battle should not approach him somewhere 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.610
 35 25 meters water surface is also 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.890
 road say lifeguards 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.110
 there are also traffic rules for 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.360
 the diver does not set up a fight anyway what 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.610
 the driver can not show the turn signal 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.720
 get along and can lead to sad 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.430
 the consequences 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:36.160
 just yesterday in the bay novik man 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:38.950
 dived in a state of easy drinking without 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.829
 all sorts of identification marks emerged 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.480
 literally 3 meters from passing 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:49.090
 boats that the driver is good 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:54.430
 responded turned away well and thats had enough 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:57.069
 crazy to raise your hand just a second and would 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.069
 11 more up to nowadays if you like 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.290
 diving and 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.299
 do it alone how many on foot 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.099
 or warn you that in this 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.500
 write some know or be called 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.210
 legs and arm and here's stand 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.730
 it seems to me that it’s just not so easy 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.780
 let us water it and let it know that it’s flat 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.780
 roller and boats 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.180
 clever skin is very thin here less 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.370
 millimeter fluffy layer 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.470
 Senior Officer D'Ivoire on Vladimir 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.870
 crayfish shows a jellyfish area 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.930
 seaside region inhabited by 5 species of these 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.060
 reptiles aurelio the most harmless real 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.070
 the danger is a jellyfish 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.110
 she will appear off the coast of Vladivostok in 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.750
 when August is finally established 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.270
 hot weather kupala and not more than 40 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.520
 millimeters in diameter beyond that of the cross 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.890
 century burns and can cause strong 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.650
 seizures he swims quite actively 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.780
 if a person is swimming slowly well here 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.590
 a child on wines for example he is bad 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.130
 swims 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.340
 then in principle, such a miduh catching on 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.410
 grass can catch up with him and bite then 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.650
 eat she thinks this fish swims 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.540
 and here such effect can appear 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.940
 caution in the sea need to be not only 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.860
 divers and boat drivers assure 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.380
 biologists but those who just came 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.420
 swim and jellyfish is not the only enemy 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.880
 special attention today 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.340
 scientists are devoting toxic algae to 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.710
 world science they know about 60 species 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.880
 and more than half of them are found in 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.820
 Far Eastern Seas 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.720
 most popular diarrhea toxin is the most 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.810
 unpleasant contact 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.930
 this is through seafood if people 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.720
 collect mollusks of different emissions either 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.150
 dive collect and 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.310
 cook them there on the fire know how it is 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.190
 very popular then yes then they 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.490
 get acquainted with these dangerous inhabitants 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.860
 already directly through your body 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.470
 dangerous marine reptiles are introduced mainly 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.600
 dirty water and often on such beaches 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.290
 ban signs are not even installed 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.870
 bathing 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.390
 so for example in luchegorsk water analyzes 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.310
 from this reservoir was taken repeatedly 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.650
 each time results confirm 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.440
 entering the water is strictly prohibited 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.990
 you can catch E. coli but not 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.600
 bulletin boards no other measures 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.020
 there is no security in two hours 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.450
 my arrival while my son was swimming 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.560
 one lifeguard or guard on this 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.950
 territories 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.810
 I did not see nearby in the current urban 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.660
 storm sewer that legally 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.300
 banned local authorities assure with 1 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.370
 June, the beach officially became just a zone 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.650
 recreation information signs with 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.790
 rules of conduct here will appear in 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.610
 soon 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.220
 but she the rest of the money has no connection with 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.440
 insufficient funds we are not 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.419
 can provide as it should be 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.890
 to the beach that is it and changing rooms and 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:52.860
 showers and cold water supply it all 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.600
 costly at the moment and we have passed 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.450
 it is unreal for bathing 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.950
 do not punish the rays the highlanders water come on 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.890
 your own risk 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.710
 first swimming season in the seaside already 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:07.740
 11 people died in total for the summer 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.169
 period in the waters of the edge are dying up to 150 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.060
 holidaymakers and most often tragedies 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.610
 occur due to negligence or 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.100
 intoxication and most 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.250
 accidents in the second half 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.250
 of the summer
