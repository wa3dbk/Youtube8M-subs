charger<00:02:05.070> here<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.579> course<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.600> one<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.840> we

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
charger here of course the one that we

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.600 
charger here of course the one that we
have<00:02:07.079> here<00:02:07.320> doesn't<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.770> u.s.<00:02:08.099> adapter

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
have here doesn't have the u.s. adapter

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.400 
have here doesn't have the u.s. adapter
but<00:02:08.759> if<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.660> could<00:02:09.780> always<00:02:09.929> get<00:02:10.229> that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
but if you but you could always get that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.440 
but if you but you could always get that
set<00:02:10.739> up<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:10.950> get<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> separate<00:02:11.610> one<00:02:11.760> here<00:02:11.970> of

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
set up and get in a separate one here of

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.790 
set up and get in a separate one here of
course<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.870> could<00:02:12.959> also<00:02:13.080> charge<00:02:13.470> it

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
course you could also charge it

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.950 
course you could also charge it
any<00:02:14.070> USB<00:02:14.460> port<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.000> that's<00:02:15.300> not<00:02:15.420> too<00:02:15.630> much<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.900> a

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
any USB port so that's not too much of a

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.260 
any USB port so that's not too much of a
problem<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:17.070> let's<00:02:17.250> just<00:02:17.430> turn<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.790> device

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
problem so let's just turn on the device

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.600 
problem so let's just turn on the device
here<00:02:18.870> let's<00:02:19.560> get<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:19.800> out<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.130> way<00:02:20.250> and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
here let's get this out of the way and

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.030 
here let's get this out of the way and
let's<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:21.600> check<00:02:21.840> out<00:02:22.050> these<00:02:22.290> two<00:02:22.740> quick

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
let's just check out these two quick

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.370 
let's just check out these two quick
hardware<00:02:23.520> tour<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.270> device<00:02:24.780> here<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.200> see

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
hardware tour of the device here and see

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.730 
hardware tour of the device here and see
what's<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:26.400> there<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.870> got<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
what's on on there so you got that the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.990 
what's on on there so you got that the
interesting<00:02:29.100> thing<00:02:29.340> about<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.880> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
interesting thing about is just the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.030 
interesting thing about is just the
capacitive<00:02:30.540> touch<00:02:30.780> buttons<00:02:30.810> they<00:02:31.620> actually

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
capacitive touch buttons they actually

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.890 
capacitive touch buttons they actually
will<00:02:32.190> rotate<00:02:32.460> according<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.390> orientation

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
will rotate according to the orientation

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.780 
will rotate according to the orientation
that<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.290> move<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.400> we'll<00:02:35.550> check<00:02:35.730> that

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
that you move it to so we'll check that

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.250 
that you move it to so we'll check that
out<00:02:35.970> here<00:02:36.240> in<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.390> moment

it's<00:03:06.090> solid<00:03:06.600> right<00:03:07.140> up<00:03:07.290> right<00:03:07.380> on<00:03:07.650> there<00:03:07.860> on

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
it's solid right up right on there on

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.640 
it's solid right up right on there on
the<00:03:08.700> back<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:09.600> have<00:03:09.630> an<00:03:10.050> 8<00:03:10.260> megapixel

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650

so<00:03:16.950> pretty<00:03:17.250> much<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.850> course<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.180> could

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
so pretty much and of course you could

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.960 
so pretty much and of course you could
see<00:03:18.420> in<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.570> back<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.990> that's<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:19.290> similar

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
see in the back and that's that similar

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.580 
see in the back and that's that similar
similar<00:03:20.970> pattern<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.690> with<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.020> rear<00:03:22.230> cover

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
similar pattern and with the rear cover

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.070 
similar pattern and with the rear cover
kind<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.340> plasticky<00:03:24.000> but<00:03:24.240> has<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:24.630> soft

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
kind of plasticky but has that soft

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.660 
kind of plasticky but has that soft
touch<00:03:25.260> feel<00:03:25.470> makes<00:03:26.070> it<00:03:26.190> pretty<00:03:26.400> good<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:26.580> the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
touch feel makes it pretty good in the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.840 
touch feel makes it pretty good in the
hand<00:03:26.910> so<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.050> display<00:03:28.440> it's<00:03:28.980> four<00:03:29.640> inch

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
hand so with the display it's four inch

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.360 
hand so with the display it's four inch
capacitive<00:03:30.540> actually<00:03:31.230> it's<00:03:31.410> four<00:03:31.770> inch<00:03:31.950> Super

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
capacitive actually it's four inch Super

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.140 
capacitive actually it's four inch Super
LCD<00:03:32.550> display<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.750> has<00:03:34.170> WVGA<00:03:34.920> resolution<00:03:35.150> so

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
LCD display and has WVGA resolution so

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.000 
LCD display and has WVGA resolution so
it<00:03:36.240> should<00:03:36.450> be<00:03:36.480> pretty<00:03:36.750> good<00:03:36.900> for<00:03:37.350> most<00:03:37.650> stuff

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
it should be pretty good for most stuff

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.920 
it should be pretty good for most stuff
yet<00:03:38.250> let's<00:03:38.790> quickly<00:03:39.030> show<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.390> what<00:03:39.570> we<00:03:39.780> mean

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
yet let's quickly show you what we mean

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.530 
yet let's quickly show you what we mean
about<00:03:39.990> the<00:03:40.730> capacitor<00:03:41.730> buttons<00:03:42.000> moving<00:03:42.420> so

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
about the capacitor buttons moving so

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.360 
about the capacitor buttons moving so
you<00:03:42.600> open<00:03:42.840> up<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.020> web<00:03:43.170> browser<00:03:43.200> again<00:03:43.740> you

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
you open up the web browser again you

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.340 
you open up the web browser again you
could<00:03:44.550> see<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.970> capacitance<00:03:45.690> your<00:03:45.840> usual<00:03:46.140> set

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
could see the capacitance your usual set

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.990 
could see the capacitance your usual set
if<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.500> tilt<00:03:46.770> it<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:47.010> landscape<00:03:47.370> it

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
if you tilt it to landscape it

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.490 
if you tilt it to landscape it
automatically<00:03:48.510> will<00:03:48.780> rotate<00:03:49.020> which<00:03:49.410> is

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
automatically will rotate which is

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.770 
automatically will rotate which is
pretty<00:03:49.709> neat<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.370> well<00:03:51.180> that's<00:03:51.300> pretty<00:03:51.660> much

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
pretty neat so well that's pretty much
