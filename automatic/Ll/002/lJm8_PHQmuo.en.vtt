00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
good lighting is paramount many of these

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.820 
good lighting is paramount many of these
new<00:00:13.820> digital<00:00:14.000> cameras<00:00:14.570> are<00:00:14.600> doing<00:00:15.350> incredible

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
new digital cameras are doing incredible

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.550 
new digital cameras are doing incredible
things<00:00:15.889> in<00:00:16.369> low<00:00:16.910> light<00:00:17.119> situations<00:00:17.780> but<00:00:18.440> the

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
things in low light situations but the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.109 
things in low light situations but the
equipment<00:00:18.770> can't<00:00:19.100> do<00:00:19.220> all<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:19.490> work<00:00:19.700> you

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
equipment can't do all the work you

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.519 
equipment can't do all the work you
still<00:00:20.420> have<00:00:20.570> to<00:00:20.689> know<00:00:20.840> what<00:00:21.260> some<00:00:21.410> of<00:00:21.439> the

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
still have to know what some of the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.050 
still have to know what some of the
basic<00:00:21.830> principles<00:00:22.220> are<00:00:22.430> for<00:00:22.730> good<00:00:22.820> lighting

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
basic principles are for good lighting

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.660 
basic principles are for good lighting
so<00:00:23.360> let's<00:00:23.869> talk<00:00:24.050> about<00:00:24.200> the<00:00:24.890> most<00:00:25.099> basic

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
so let's talk about the most basic

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.600 
so let's talk about the most basic
lighting<00:00:26.480> technique<00:00:26.900> for<00:00:27.520> lighting<00:00:28.520> an

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
lighting technique for lighting an

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.370 
lighting technique for lighting an
interview<00:00:29.029> which<00:00:29.630> is<00:00:29.750> what<00:00:29.900> we're<00:00:30.050> interested

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
interview which is what we're interested

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.140 
interview which is what we're interested
in<00:00:30.770> in<00:00:30.950> oral<00:00:31.189> history<00:00:31.520> and<00:00:31.790> that's<00:00:31.970> going<00:00:32.090> to

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
in in oral history and that's going to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.140 
in in oral history and that's going to
be<00:00:32.270> three-point<00:00:32.780> lighting<00:00:33.020> so<00:00:33.950> we<00:00:34.790> have<00:00:34.910> three

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
be three-point lighting so we have three

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.650 
be three-point lighting so we have three
sources<00:00:35.390> of<00:00:35.690> light<00:00:35.870> we<00:00:36.110> have<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:37.040> key<00:00:37.220> light

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
sources of light we have the key light

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.210 
sources of light we have the key light
we<00:00:38.660> have<00:00:38.810> the<00:00:38.930> backlight<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:39.590> we<00:00:39.680> have<00:00:39.829> a<00:00:39.860> fill

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
we have the backlight and we have a fill

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.860 
we have the backlight and we have a fill
now<00:00:41.060> let's<00:00:41.899> take<00:00:42.079> a<00:00:42.110> look<00:00:42.290> at<00:00:42.530> what<00:00:43.870> these

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
now let's take a look at what these

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.509 
now let's take a look at what these
lights<00:00:45.109> all<00:00:45.379> do<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:45.769> what<00:00:45.859> their<00:00:46.010> function<00:00:46.370> is

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
lights all do and what their function is

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.150 
lights all do and what their function is
right<00:00:47.449> now<00:00:47.570> we're<00:00:47.899> primarily<00:00:48.140> lit<00:00:48.559> by<00:00:48.769> room

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
right now we're primarily lit by room

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.610 
right now we're primarily lit by room
lighting<00:00:49.519> and<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:50.989> what<00:00:51.260> we're<00:00:51.410> going<00:00:51.590> to

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
lighting and so so what we're going to

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.220 
lighting and so so what we're going to
do<00:00:51.829> is<00:00:52.160> bring<00:00:52.789> up<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.510> controlled<00:00:54.019> lighting

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
do is bring up the controlled lighting

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.729 
do is bring up the controlled lighting
so<00:00:54.710> let's<00:00:54.920> start<00:00:55.129> off<00:00:55.219> with<00:00:55.429> the<00:00:55.609> key<00:00:55.820> light

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.989 

your<00:01:00.739> key<00:01:00.920> light<00:01:01.100> is<00:01:01.129> really<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:01.730> primary

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
your key light is really the primary

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:03.459 
your key light is really the primary
light<00:01:02.390> in<00:01:02.690> your<00:01:02.899> three<00:01:03.109> point<00:01:03.320> lighting

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
light in your three point lighting

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.830 
light in your three point lighting
system<00:01:03.980> so<00:01:04.790> it's<00:01:05.059> at<00:01:05.180> about<00:01:05.360> a<00:01:05.390> 45<00:01:05.810> degree

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
system so it's at about a 45 degree

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.160 
system so it's at about a 45 degree
angle<00:01:06.730> it's<00:01:07.730> about<00:01:08.030> six<00:01:08.630> seven<00:01:08.810> feet<00:01:09.050> away

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
angle it's about six seven feet away

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.860 
angle it's about six seven feet away
from<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:10.190> subject<00:01:10.430> it's<00:01:11.240> usually<00:01:11.420> your<00:01:11.659> most

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
from the subject it's usually your most

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.800 
from the subject it's usually your most
powerful<00:01:12.110> light<00:01:12.560> in<00:01:12.800> in<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.670> three<00:01:13.909> of<00:01:14.120> the

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
powerful light in in the three of the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.060 
powerful light in in the three of the
three<00:01:14.930> sources<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:16.760> next<00:01:17.060> light<00:01:17.240> is<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.830> fill

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
three sources the next light is the fill

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.490 
three sources the next light is the fill
light<00:01:19.250> which<00:01:19.520> helps<00:01:20.330> balance<00:01:20.600> out<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.320> key

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
light which helps balance out the key

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.560 
light which helps balance out the key
light<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.720> your<00:01:23.720> shadow<00:01:24.250> is<00:01:25.250> minimized<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.180> it

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
light so your shadow is minimized and it

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.420 
light so your shadow is minimized and it
helps<00:01:26.840> illuminate<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.830> other<00:01:27.980> side<00:01:28.220> of<00:01:28.370> the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
helps illuminate the other side of the

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.670 
helps illuminate the other side of the
face<00:01:28.610> that<00:01:28.670> is<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:30.170> is<00:01:30.320> not<00:01:30.500> necessarily<00:01:31.600> being

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
face that is it is not necessarily being

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.140 
face that is it is not necessarily being
controlled<00:01:33.680> by<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.890> key<00:01:34.130> light<00:01:34.310> the

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
controlled by the key light the

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.260 
controlled by the key light the
backlight<00:01:35.630> is<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.560> third<00:01:36.980> light<00:01:37.160> and<00:01:37.460> this<00:01:38.120> is

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
backlight is the third light and this is

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.760 
backlight is the third light and this is
the<00:01:38.390> one<00:01:38.540> that's<00:01:39.050> actually<00:01:39.230> going<00:01:39.380> to<00:01:39.500> provide

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
the one that's actually going to provide

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.410 
the one that's actually going to provide
some<00:01:39.980> dimension<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:40.910> you<00:01:41.000> notice<00:01:41.270> I'm

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
some dimension and you notice I'm

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.050 
some dimension and you notice I'm
wearing<00:01:41.720> a<00:01:42.020> black<00:01:42.560> jacket<00:01:42.700> I've<00:01:43.700> got<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:43.850> black

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
wearing a black jacket I've got a black

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.320 
wearing a black jacket I've got a black
background<00:01:44.300> I<00:01:44.780> have<00:01:45.610> some<00:01:46.610> black<00:01:46.760> hair<00:01:47.090> left

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
background I have some black hair left

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.890 
background I have some black hair left
and<00:01:48.260> so<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:49.220> is<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:51.650> backlight<00:01:52.040> really<00:01:52.400> does

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
and so it is the backlight really does

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.920 
and so it is the backlight really does
light<00:01:53.900> up<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:55.040> know<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.480> edge<00:01:56.660> of<00:01:56.900> my

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
light up you know the the edge of my

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.680 
light up you know the the edge of my
head<00:01:57.620> the<00:01:58.460> shoulders<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.710> and<00:02:01.420> separates<00:02:02.420> me

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
head the shoulders and and separates me

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.310 
head the shoulders and and separates me
from<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:03.380> background<00:02:03.560> which<00:02:04.370> is<00:02:04.400> which<00:02:05.320> which

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
from the background which is which which

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.229 
from the background which is which which
is<00:02:06.440> important<00:02:06.800> again<00:02:07.010> providing<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.760> balanced

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
is important again providing a balanced

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.050 
is important again providing a balanced
approach<00:02:08.539> it<00:02:09.019> also<00:02:09.170> is<00:02:09.619> great<00:02:10.099> for<00:02:10.550> once<00:02:10.910> again

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
approach it also is great for once again

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.240 
approach it also is great for once again
minimizing<00:02:11.900> shadows<00:02:12.349> that<00:02:12.560> are<00:02:12.620> created<00:02:13.099> by

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
minimizing shadows that are created by

minimizing shadows that are created by
the<00:02:13.310> other<00:02:13.610> two<00:02:14.120> lights<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:16.519> key<00:02:16.790> light<00:02:17.030> is

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
the other two lights the key light is

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.670 
the other two lights the key light is
usually<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.550> more<00:02:19.700> powerful<00:02:20.180> light<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.500> the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
usually the more powerful light in the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.910 
usually the more powerful light in the
mix

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.550 
mix
and<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.510> primary<00:02:24.720> light<00:02:25.050> source<00:02:25.320> but

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and and is the primary light source but

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.400 
and and is the primary light source but
it<00:02:25.680> creates<00:02:25.980> shadows<00:02:26.660> being<00:02:27.660> just<00:02:27.930> one<00:02:28.080> light

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
it creates shadows being just one light

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.740 
it creates shadows being just one light
source<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.950> needs<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.190> be<00:02:29.310> balanced<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:29.940> so

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
source so it needs to be balanced and so

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.300 
source so it needs to be balanced and so
the<00:02:30.930> best<00:02:31.080> way<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.200> balance<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.740> key<00:02:31.920> light<00:02:32.100> is

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
the best way to balance a key light is

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.310 
the best way to balance a key light is
then<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.820> have<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.030> fill<00:02:33.420> light<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.870> comes<00:02:34.110> in

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
then to have a fill light that comes in

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.680 
then to have a fill light that comes in
at<00:02:34.970> another<00:02:35.970> angle<00:02:36.800> too<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:38.610> help<00:02:39.240> sort<00:02:39.570> of

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
at another angle too to help sort of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.610 
at another angle too to help sort of
fill<00:02:40.380> out<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.680> lighting<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.280> particular

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
fill out the lighting of that particular

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.220 
fill out the lighting of that particular
multi-dimensional<00:02:44.060> object<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.990> both

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
multi-dimensional object and and both

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.410 
multi-dimensional object and and both
lights<00:02:46.560> are<00:02:46.740> usually<00:02:47.070> set<00:02:47.280> at<00:02:47.459> around<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.970> 45

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
lights are usually set at around a 45

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.800 
lights are usually set at around a 45
degree<00:02:48.810> angle<00:02:49.490> 25<00:02:50.490> to<00:02:50.640> 45<00:02:51.180> degree<00:02:51.420> angle<00:02:51.690> and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
degree angle 25 to 45 degree angle and

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.710 
degree angle 25 to 45 degree angle and
as<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.740> were<00:02:52.860> saying<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.640> like<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.540> height

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
as you were saying you like the height

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.600 
as you were saying you like the height
to<00:02:55.050> come<00:02:55.230> down<00:02:55.470> from<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.860> key<00:02:56.040> light<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.520> the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
to come down from the key light and the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.790 
to come down from the key light and the
fill<00:02:57.330> light<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.870> usually<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.320> little<00:02:58.410> bit<00:02:58.530> lower

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
fill light is usually a little bit lower

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.970 
fill light is usually a little bit lower
it's<00:02:59.190> also<00:02:59.400> about<00:02:59.790> half<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.660> wattage<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.020> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
it's also about half the wattage of the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.160 
it's also about half the wattage of the
key<00:03:02.250> light<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.630> really<00:03:04.020> is<00:03:04.140> just

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
key light and so it really is just

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.890 
key light and so it really is just
balancing<00:03:04.920> out<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.280> not<00:03:05.459> blasting<00:03:06.060> another

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
balancing out it's not blasting another

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.810 
balancing out it's not blasting another
light<00:03:07.110> source<00:03:07.320> at<00:03:07.650> pachu<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.430> let's<00:03:08.610> take<00:03:08.790> a

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
light source at pachu so let's take a

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.520 
light source at pachu so let's take a
look<00:03:09.030> at<00:03:09.150> what<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.870> looks<00:03:10.080> like<00:03:10.200> without<00:03:10.320> a

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
look at what it looks like without a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.430 
look at what it looks like without a
fill<00:03:10.800> light<00:03:10.980> again<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:14.540> this<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.690> just<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.230> key

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
fill light again so this is just the key

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.860 
fill light again so this is just the key
light<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.010> backlight<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.630> see

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
light and the backlight and you see

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.470 
light and the backlight and you see
you've<00:03:19.200> got<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.380> significant<00:03:20.040> dark<00:03:20.489> darkening

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
you've got a significant dark darkening

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.510 
you've got a significant dark darkening
over<00:03:21.750> on<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.080> side<00:03:22.320> now<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:22.860> can<00:03:23.100> do<00:03:23.250> some

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
over on this side now you can do some

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.060 
over on this side now you can do some
some<00:03:24.120> kind<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.660> cool<00:03:24.870> things<00:03:25.140> with<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.980> know

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
some kind of cool things with you know

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.550 
some kind of cool things with you know
in<00:03:26.400> terms<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.700> creative<00:03:27.150> lighting<00:03:27.360> if<00:03:28.350> you're

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
in terms of creative lighting if you're

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.949 
in terms of creative lighting if you're
looking<00:03:28.830> for<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.040> sort<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.310> an<00:03:29.430> arty<00:03:29.790> look<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.750> in

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
looking for a sort of an arty look so in

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.600 
looking for a sort of an arty look so in
some<00:03:31.140> ways<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.470> shadowing<00:03:31.920> creates<00:03:32.250> kind<00:03:32.459> of

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
some ways the shadowing creates kind of

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.690 
some ways the shadowing creates kind of
a<00:03:33.470> creative<00:03:34.470> arty<00:03:35.220> look<00:03:36.410> but<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:38.280> might<00:03:38.549> get

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
a creative arty look but that might get

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.390 
a creative arty look but that might get
really<00:03:38.880> old<00:03:39.090> in<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.420> 3-hour<00:03:39.720> interview<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:41.040> so

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
really old in a 3-hour interview and so

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.850 
really old in a 3-hour interview and so
so<00:03:42.090> let's<00:03:42.570> take<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.750> look<00:03:42.959> at<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.380> balancing

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
so let's take a look at the balancing

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.840 
so let's take a look at the balancing
that's<00:03:44.010> created<00:03:44.340> by<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.459> fill<00:03:44.700> light<00:03:46.730> so<00:03:47.730> the

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
that's created by the fill light so the

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.009 
that's created by the fill light so the
fill<00:03:48.150> light<00:03:48.390> switches<00:03:49.290> on<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:50.060> just<00:03:51.060> like

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
fill light switches on and just like

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.440 
fill light switches on and just like
does<00:03:52.320> exactly<00:03:52.650> what<00:03:52.829> it<00:03:53.010> says<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.400> fills<00:03:53.760> in<00:03:54.060> I

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
does exactly what it says it fills in I

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.979 
does exactly what it says it fills in I
think<00:03:54.630> what<00:03:55.140> is<00:03:55.320> what<00:03:56.130> is<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:57.269> gaps<00:03:57.510> created

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
think what is what is the gaps created

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.080 
think what is what is the gaps created
by<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.200> key<00:03:58.470> light<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:58.860> terms<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.250> overall

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
by the key light in terms of overall

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.080 
by the key light in terms of overall
lighting<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.600> so<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.810> see<00:04:01.049> kind<00:04:01.260> of<00:04:01.350> a

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
lighting and so you see kind of a

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.420 
lighting and so you see kind of a
balancing<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:03.780> right<00:04:04.170> now<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.829> backlight<00:04:05.220> is

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
balancing so right now the backlight is

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.390 
balancing so right now the backlight is
currently<00:04:05.790> on<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.600> what<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.380> get<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:08.130> sort

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
currently on and what you get is a sort

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.199 
currently on and what you get is a sort
of<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:09.390> sort<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.519> separation<00:04:11.519> from<00:04:12.030> the

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
of a sort of separation from the

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.900 
of a sort of separation from the
background<00:04:12.360> of<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.650> know<00:04:13.739> around<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.340> head

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
background of you know around the head

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.319 
background of you know around the head
and<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.959> hair<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:17.250> shoulders<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.000> what

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
and the hair and the shoulders and what

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.050 
and the hair and the shoulders and what
that<00:04:18.510> does<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:19.049> see<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.440> light<00:04:19.650> there

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
that does is you see the light there

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.190 
that does is you see the light there
that<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.419> separates<00:04:21.840> me<00:04:21.900> from<00:04:21.989> the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
that that separates me from the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.960 
that that separates me from the
background<00:04:22.380> even<00:04:23.280> more<00:04:23.430> critical<00:04:23.550> because

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
background even more critical because

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.150 
background even more critical because
I'm<00:04:24.240> wearing<00:04:24.419> a<00:04:24.810> black<00:04:25.080> jacket<00:04:25.110> on<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:25.860> black

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
I'm wearing a black jacket on a black

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.060 
I'm wearing a black jacket on a black
background<00:04:26.729> and<00:04:27.630> so<00:04:28.290> you<00:04:28.350> will<00:04:28.650> start<00:04:28.919> to<00:04:28.979> see

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
background and so you will start to see

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.790 
background and so you will start to see
a<00:04:29.430> sort<00:04:29.700> of<00:04:29.760> blending<00:04:30.330> so<00:04:31.050> let's<00:04:31.289> try<00:04:31.470> to<00:04:31.530> take

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
a sort of blending so let's try to take

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.670 
a sort of blending so let's try to take
out<00:04:32.039> the<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:33.180> backlight<00:04:33.630> now<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:34.140> see<00:04:34.620> what

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
out the the backlight now and see what

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:42.570 
out the the backlight now and see what
that<00:04:34.860> looks<00:04:35.039> like

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.850 

you<00:04:43.580> see<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:43.849> difference<00:04:44.210> now<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.500> backlight

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
you see the difference now the backlight

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.429 
you see the difference now the backlight
is<00:04:46.009> is<00:04:46.310> is<00:04:46.610> we<00:04:47.569> don't<00:04:47.750> have<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.050> backlight<00:04:48.409> on

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:48.439 
is is is we don't have the backlight on

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:50.770 
is is is we don't have the backlight on
and<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:49.400> see<00:04:49.610> me<00:04:49.819> kind<00:04:50.030> of<00:04:50.150> blend<00:04:50.419> into<00:04:50.599> the

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
and you see me kind of blend into the

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.260 
and you see me kind of blend into the
background<00:04:50.810> I<00:04:51.319> also<00:04:51.500> it<00:04:52.310> I<00:04:52.550> kind<00:04:52.789> of<00:04:52.819> flatten

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
background I also it I kind of flatten

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.320 
background I also it I kind of flatten
in<00:04:53.509> terms<00:04:54.349> of<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:55.159> picture<00:04:55.490> so<00:04:55.849> we<00:04:56.060> lose

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
in terms of the picture so we lose

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.809 
in terms of the picture so we lose
dimension<00:04:57.020> when<00:04:57.680> we<00:04:58.280> don't<00:04:58.550> have<00:04:58.639> the

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819 
dimension when we don't have the

00:04:58.819 --> 00:04:59.830 
dimension when we don't have the
backlight<00:04:59.210> so<00:04:59.240> let's<00:04:59.509> turn<00:04:59.629> the<00:04:59.689> backlight

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
backlight so let's turn the backlight

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.309 
backlight so let's turn the backlight
back<00:05:00.469> on<00:05:00.710> and<00:05:01.039> and<00:05:02.030> see<00:05:02.330> how<00:05:02.479> it<00:05:02.659> it<00:05:02.900> kind<00:05:03.289> of

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
back on and and see how it it kind of

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:08.260 
back on and and see how it it kind of
pops<00:05:03.590> me<00:05:03.830> out<00:05:04.719> yeah<00:05:05.719> so<00:05:06.080> so<00:05:06.860> you<00:05:06.919> see<00:05:07.159> it's<00:05:08.090> kind

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
pops me out yeah so so you see it's kind

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.360 
pops me out yeah so so you see it's kind
of<00:05:08.300> like<00:05:08.360> a<00:05:08.479> highlight<00:05:08.740> in<00:05:09.740> terms<00:05:10.069> of<00:05:10.219> what

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
of like a highlight in terms of what

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.490 
of like a highlight in terms of what
it's<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.849> effect<00:05:11.150> that<00:05:11.210> it<00:05:11.389> creates<00:05:11.690> really

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
it's the effect that it creates really

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.920 
it's the effect that it creates really
important<00:05:13.009> I<00:05:13.280> think<00:05:13.669> in<00:05:14.150> the<00:05:14.629> lighting

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
important I think in the lighting

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.629 
important I think in the lighting
strategy<00:05:15.379> that<00:05:15.560> you<00:05:15.710> take<00:05:15.919> because<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.340> lot<00:05:16.550> of

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
strategy that you take because a lot of

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.520 
strategy that you take because a lot of
people<00:05:16.849> forget<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.180> or<00:05:17.930> just<00:05:18.169> don't<00:05:18.349> use<00:05:18.500> a

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
people forget to or just don't use a

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.680 
people forget to or just don't use a
backlight<00:05:18.979> and<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.789> video<00:05:20.090> picture<00:05:20.449> just

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
backlight and the video picture just

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.920 
backlight and the video picture just
flattens<00:05:21.020> out<00:05:21.169> significantly<00:05:22.780> so<00:05:23.780> we're

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
flattens out significantly so we're

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.270 
flattens out significantly so we're
trying<00:05:24.199> to<00:05:24.319> add<00:05:24.469> dimension<00:05:24.800> to<00:05:25.430> a<00:05:25.819> flat

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
trying to add dimension to a flat

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.029 
trying to add dimension to a flat
picture<00:05:28.280> and<00:05:28.719> through<00:05:29.719> lighting<00:05:29.960> to<00:05:30.620> creative

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
picture and through lighting to creative

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.209 
picture and through lighting to creative
lighting<00:05:32.560> you<00:05:33.560> know<00:05:33.650> in<00:05:33.710> a<00:05:33.770> good<00:05:33.889> example

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
lighting you know in a good example

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:35.950 
lighting you know in a good example
would<00:05:34.430> be<00:05:34.490> to<00:05:34.879> now<00:05:35.360> have<00:05:35.629> you<00:05:35.719> take<00:05:35.930> your

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960

longer<00:06:01.759> interview<00:06:02.180> to<00:06:02.569> watch<00:06:02.750> it's<00:06:03.589> difficult

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
longer interview to watch it's difficult

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:05.260 
longer interview to watch it's difficult

set up we still have a backlight so we

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.279 
set up we still have a backlight so we
see<00:06:11.960> the<00:06:12.919> the<00:06:12.949> dimension<00:06:13.940> of<00:06:14.120> his<00:06:14.389> his<00:06:14.990> right

of the keys to lighting is always going
to<00:06:31.490> be<00:06:31.580> flexibility<00:06:32.389> and<00:06:32.569> understanding<00:06:33.169> what

there's only one way to do that and
that's<00:06:50.810> through<00:06:51.139> practice

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070 
that's through practice

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.940 
that's through practice
you<00:06:52.190> know<00:06:52.280> set<00:06:52.730> up<00:06:52.760> your<00:06:53.000> light<00:06:53.180> system<00:06:53.950> and

you know set up your light system and

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.700 
you know set up your light system and
put<00:06:55.550> somebody<00:06:55.850> in<00:06:55.940> the<00:06:56.060> seat<00:06:56.300> and<00:06:56.600> move<00:06:57.500> those

put somebody in the seat and move those
lights<00:06:57.920> around<00:06:58.280> and<00:06:58.630> get<00:06:59.630> a<00:06:59.660> sense<00:06:59.960> for<00:07:00.200> how

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
lights around and get a sense for how

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.520 
lights around and get a sense for how
does<00:07:00.560> your<00:07:00.860> camera<00:07:01.780> react<00:07:02.780> to<00:07:03.080> changes<00:07:03.500> in

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
does your camera react to changes in

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.490 
does your camera react to changes in
lighting<00:07:03.890> how<00:07:04.550> does<00:07:04.760> your<00:07:05.380> moving<00:07:06.380> your

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 
lighting how does your moving your

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.980 
lighting how does your moving your
lights<00:07:06.710> change<00:07:07.250> the<00:07:08.210> way<00:07:08.360> that<00:07:08.510> your<00:07:08.630> picture

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
lights change the way that your picture

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.210
