00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.520 

something<00:02:03.549> like<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:04.210> if<00:02:05.049> your

something like that and if your
lightning<00:02:05.829> bolts<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.670> yours<00:02:06.850> apps<00:02:07.119> are<00:02:07.329> about

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
lightning bolts and yours apps are about

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.009 
lightning bolts and yours apps are about
such<00:02:08.069> my<00:02:09.069> one<00:02:09.280> move<00:02:09.489> yours<00:02:09.729> apps<00:02:09.970> or<00:02:10.360> your

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
such my one move yours apps or your

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.890 
such my one move yours apps or your
lighting<00:02:11.319> bolts<00:02:11.590> everyone<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.849> can<00:02:13.060> move

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.800 

alright<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:20.910> looks<00:02:21.910> pretty<00:02:22.030> good<00:02:22.540> I

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
alright so that looks pretty good I

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.180 
alright so that looks pretty good I
guess<00:02:23.530> maybe<00:02:23.860> move<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.340> move<00:02:25.769> move<00:02:26.769> into<00:02:27.099> the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
guess maybe move it move move into the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.660 
guess maybe move it move move into the
cavity<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.670> little<00:02:27.940> more<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.390> guess<00:02:29.430> make<00:02:30.430> these

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
cavity a little more I guess make these

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.900 
cavity a little more I guess make these
naps<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.239> little<00:02:31.450> smaller<00:02:35.519> all<00:02:36.519> right<00:02:36.610> so

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
naps a little smaller all right so

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.570 
naps a little smaller all right so
