00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.140
 Kristalix server heavenly warriors well and 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.480
 so far we have some shit here 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.730
 but maybe in the second chest you will 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.250
 anything really good but to 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.420
 Unfortunately, no, we are not always lucky as in 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.989
 previous series 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.210
 if you remember one thing is also quite good 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.280
 salt oven wood still have a little bit 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.439
 iron hour we will have to craft 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.420
 himself apparently iron sword so that he 

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:56.600
 on the sides of the wind is not built will show and 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.129
 this, too, all nishtyak climb and ember 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.729
 called for ow one go back a little 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.809
 later on 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:05.860
 now here so here is iron coal from below and 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.860
 Naturally everything in the apple stove 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:17.900
 so a little bit of food well and subin this 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.270
 here is a tree now pop brackets personally 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.040
 there is a little stuck but it's not scary 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.470
 Now we take the metal and the roads are wood 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.790
 here from 1 to now can be identified 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.400
 by other people 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.350
 we have a lot of blocks you know this here 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.950
 instead I probably close the bruise is clearly not 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.960
 quite embarrassing so here's 2 iron here and 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.670
 the iron sword with which we now have 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.580
 problems in principle will not be because 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.970
 players friend and iron sword crumbles 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.070
 pretty good and you need a shuttle 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.890
 better you know that not everything is fine 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.780
 I think it's worth explaining there that he 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.229
 worth y makes up less sound you don't 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.940
 They went did not fly 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.390
 that study also shoot strange that's all 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.500
 strange, too, do something like that there 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:07.210
 shot I heard from him understand how 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.210
 I can not understand well, to hell with everything 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:23.310
 August is not visible but here 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:27.000
 1337 saw great swinger 228 seen 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.269
 and he will kill and the guy is sitting sharp and I killed 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.370
 him and here I am a young man of course a guy 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.840
 He obviously did not expect this, he thought now I 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:40.680
 soak it soak it rats do not write 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.879
 the sky wars dude there are no rats and even 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.340
 tim and play and you say that what rats 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.379
 Nubas will soon understand anything too 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.750
 I thought the rat commission then realized that there was not 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.549
 Rats do not just die die die nothing 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.799
 scary man lucky next 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:01.859
 if you are lucky you will be inferior to the arrows 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:05.099
 he was tonsured of blocks to go crazy 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:08.129
 simple and he does not have the resources not zhestyak 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:11.250
 in vain we killed this dude knowingly 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:17.370
 not here is this muddy filed that I 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:19.949
 just shocked to be honest palm for it 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.949
 this is clearly a man from clan 404 by this 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.090
 why I called it a rat 404 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.340
 many times 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.750
 fences and but I will not call him because 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.220
 what would watch my videos say here 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.840
 come on bad man called me 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.879
 the heat will go just in case of water 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.159
 the master is insulted and the loss is all nonsense 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.930
 fucking really that's fine 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.489
 great great about him not much to climb 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.250
 we will sit somewhere our opponents 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.530
 it would be nice to spill the water should be given 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.120
 and you need to give about it being built with such 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.769
 well there just to lose now grie though 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.500
 This is Sky Wars here you can play 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.549
 easy one arrow while you build sites 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.139
 skywars killer skywars check out 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.639
 heavenly warriors they are so not hungry 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.290
 games on the hunger games you can games for 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.769
 account skill there by steaming 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.500
 some 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.000
 and here even if the enemy lags you 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.099
 you can still lose look 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.669
 my play with sir it seems to be 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.139
 to the series in a row was she was called she 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.500
 called the unexpected turn of the water there 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.180
 This is really so unexpected 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.400
 equipment at the end was I was kind of pulling 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.140
 tercera dragged and tank for me what 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.030

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.410
 okay let's do it 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.360

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.770
