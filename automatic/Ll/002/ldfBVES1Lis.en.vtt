taking<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.520> look<00:00:02.639> today<00:00:02.939> at<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.149> variety<00:00:03.689> of

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:04.069 
taking a look today at a variety of

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.340 
taking a look today at a variety of
baffles<00:00:05.069> that<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.370> made<00:00:05.670> for<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.200> three<00:00:07.200> inch

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
baffles that I made for a three inch

diameter side pipe I've got as you can
see<00:00:11.219> here<00:00:11.700> roughly<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.420> 32<00:00:13.110> inch<00:00:13.139> long<00:00:13.679> straight

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
see here roughly a 32 inch long straight

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.859 
see here roughly a 32 inch long straight
section<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:15.260> side<00:00:16.260> pipe<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:18.260> for<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.289> muffler

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
section of side pipe and for a muffler

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.870 
section of side pipe and for a muffler
originally<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.769> found<00:00:23.070> those<00:00:23.279> white<00:00:23.580> to

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
originally and I found those white to

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.960 
originally and I found those white to
show<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.240> detail<00:00:24.920> originally<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.980> took<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> two

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
show the detail originally I took a two

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.210 
show the detail originally I took a two
inch<00:00:27.210> should<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.599> am<00:00:27.990> there<00:00:28.170> piece<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.590> exhaust

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
inch should I am there piece of exhaust

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.880 
inch should I am there piece of exhaust
pipe<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.990> attach<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.830> piece<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.520> a

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
pipe and attach to it this piece of a

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.780 
pipe and attach to it this piece of a
header<00:00:35.480> collector<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.890> funnels<00:00:38.190> into<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
header collector so it funnels into the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.600 
header collector so it funnels into the
two-inch<00:00:39.510> diameter<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.379> then<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.190> series

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
two-inch diameter and then it's a series

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.510 
two-inch diameter and then it's a series
of<00:00:41.930> what<00:00:42.930> I'll<00:00:43.050> call<00:00:43.230> half<00:00:43.559> scoops<00:00:44.070> they<00:00:44.309> don't

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
of what I'll call half scoops they don't

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.540 
of what I'll call half scoops they don't
scoop<00:00:45.360> all<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> exhaust<00:00:46.469> into<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.219> space

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
scoop all of the exhaust into this space

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.080 
scoop all of the exhaust into this space
they<00:00:48.239> scoop<00:00:48.629> about<00:00:48.809> half<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.090> then

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
they scoop about half of it and then

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.610 
they scoop about half of it and then
followed<00:00:51.690> by<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:52.670> reverse<00:00:53.670> scoop<00:00:54.199> my<00:00:55.199> thinking

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
followed by a reverse scoop my thinking

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.619 
followed by a reverse scoop my thinking
was<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.100> exhaust<00:00:56.579> some<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> would<00:00:57.510> be

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
was that the exhaust some of it would be

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.610 
was that the exhaust some of it would be
forced<00:00:57.930> into<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.440> space<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.190> then<00:01:00.059> get

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
forced into the space and then get

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.750 
forced into the space and then get
sucked<00:01:01.620> back<00:01:01.859> into<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.399> main<00:01:02.640> flow<00:01:03.110> by<00:01:04.110> these

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
sucked back into the main flow by these

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.300 
sucked back into the main flow by these
reverse<00:01:05.760> scoops<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> whole<00:01:07.710> length<00:01:08.040> is

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
reverse scoops so the whole length is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.020 
reverse scoops so the whole length is
like<00:01:08.640> scoop<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.630> then<00:01:09.900> reverse<00:01:10.830> scoop<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
like scoop and then reverse scoop and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.539 
like scoop and then reverse scoop and
used<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:12.750> piece<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.290> pipe<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
used to be just one piece of pipe and

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.030 
used to be just one piece of pipe and
when<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.119> finished<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> was<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.200> loud<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.009> I

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
when I finished it was very loud and I

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.460 
when I finished it was very loud and I
figured<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.270> exhaust<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.689> sound<00:01:21.990> was<00:01:22.259> just

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
figured that exhaust and sound was just

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.490 
figured that exhaust and sound was just
getting<00:01:22.770> between<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> pipes<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.909> traveling

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
getting between the pipes and traveling

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.039 
getting between the pipes and traveling
to<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> end<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.850> divided<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.540> into<00:01:27.659> three

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
to the end so I divided it into three

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.030 
to the end so I divided it into three
sections<00:01:28.430> with<00:01:29.430> these<00:01:29.610> washers<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.390> between

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
sections with these washers in between

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.520 
sections with these washers in between
so<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> exhaust<00:01:32.490> at<00:01:32.880> every<00:01:33.540> washer<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.140> forced

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
so the exhaust at every washer is forced

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.830 
so the exhaust at every washer is forced
to<00:01:34.560> get<00:01:34.740> back<00:01:34.950> inside<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.490> pipe<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.210> also

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to get back inside the pipe I also

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.010 
to get back inside the pipe I also
change<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.470> orientation<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.549> these<00:01:39.020> scoops

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
change the orientation so these scoops

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.560 
change the orientation so these scoops
aren't<00:01:40.950> lined<00:01:41.159> up<00:01:41.369> with<00:01:41.549> these<00:01:41.790> scoops<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
aren't lined up with these scoops and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.810 
aren't lined up with these scoops and
then<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.259> goes<00:01:43.409> back<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> original<00:01:44.610> and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
then it goes back to the original and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.359 
then it goes back to the original and
this<00:01:45.180> prevented<00:01:45.659> me<00:01:45.810> from<00:01:45.890> simply<00:01:46.890> looking<00:01:47.189> in

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
this prevented me from simply looking in

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.069 
this prevented me from simply looking in
one<00:01:47.579> end<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> seeing<00:01:48.360> all<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> way<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
one end and seeing all the way to the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.830 
one end and seeing all the way to the
other<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.369> quieted<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.060> down<00:01:51.299> quite<00:01:51.810> a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
other so that quieted it down quite a

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.639 
other so that quieted it down quite a
bit<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.880> these<00:01:53.880> had<00:01:54.119> an<00:01:54.299> annoying<00:01:54.600> rap<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
bit but these had an annoying rap if the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.160 
bit but these had an annoying rap if the
engine<00:01:55.920> Rev<00:01:56.130> way<00:01:56.399> up<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.909> after<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> hot<00:01:57.750> start

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
engine Rev way up like after a hot start

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.310 
engine Rev way up like after a hot start
as<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:59.460> slowed<00:01:59.729> back<00:01:59.969> down<00:02:00.299> these<00:02:00.600> had<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> an

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
as it slowed back down these had a an

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.260 
as it slowed back down these had a an
annoying<00:02:01.950> rap<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.880> saw<00:02:03.780> two<00:02:03.840> different

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
annoying rap and I saw two different

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.670 
annoying rap and I saw two different

the<00:02:08.550> first<00:02:08.790> thing<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.090> tried<00:02:09.210> was<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:10.700> where

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
the first thing I tried was this where

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.170 
the first thing I tried was this where
with<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:12.600> one<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:13.140> half<00:02:13.170> inch<00:02:13.820> I'm<00:02:14.820> sorry<00:02:15.120> a

diameter tube and made a full scoop that

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.110 
diameter tube and made a full scoop that
100%<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.890> exhaust<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.370> forced<00:02:23.730> into<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
space and then to get out it has to flow

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.960 
space and then to get out it has to flow
through<00:02:27.060> these<00:02:27.210> holes<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:28.310> it's<00:02:29.310> on<00:02:29.490> its<00:02:29.520> way

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
through these holes and it's on its way

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.990 
through these holes and it's on its way
and<00:02:30.620> as<00:02:31.620> an<00:02:31.800> aside<00:02:32.100> many<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.640> these<00:02:32.790> when<00:02:32.970> I

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
and as an aside many of these when I

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.260 
and as an aside many of these when I
install<00:02:33.480> them<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.840> include<00:02:34.230> some<00:02:34.940> steel<00:02:35.940> wool

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
install them I include some steel wool

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.970 
install them I include some steel wool
figuring<00:02:36.810> they're<00:02:36.960> sound<00:02:37.290> bouncing<00:02:37.860> around

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.230 
figuring they're sound bouncing around
in<00:02:38.310> here<00:02:38.520> that<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.880> can<00:02:39.150> attenuate<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.520> was

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
in here that I can attenuate so this was

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.270 
in here that I can attenuate so this was
louder<00:02:42.480> than<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.840> expected<00:02:43.380> maybe<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.770> included

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
louder than I expected maybe I included

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.540 
louder than I expected maybe I included
too<00:02:44.430> many<00:02:44.610> holes<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:46.110> also<00:02:46.290> had<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.740> odd

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
too many holes and it also had a odd

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.810 
too many holes and it also had a odd
metallic<00:02:48.540> clicking<00:02:48.990> sound<00:02:49.530> on<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.130> the

metallic clicking sound on the the

metallic clicking sound on the the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
overrun so if the engine was revved up

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.460 
overrun so if the engine was revved up
as<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.430> slowed<00:02:53.730> down<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.360> don't<00:02:55.170> know<00:02:55.260> if<00:02:55.320> this

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
as it slowed down I don't know if this

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.620 
as it slowed down I don't know if this
was<00:02:55.650> making<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.280> ticking<00:02:56.670> sound<00:02:56.700> or<00:02:57.360> failing

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
was making the ticking sound or failing

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.440 
was making the ticking sound or failing
to<00:02:57.860> quiet<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.160> ticking<00:02:59.550> sound<00:02:59.580> but<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.390> was

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
to quiet the ticking sound but it was

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.390 
to quiet the ticking sound but it was
very<00:03:00.690> noticeable<00:03:01.940> which<00:03:02.940> led<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:04.790> this<00:03:05.790> design

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
very noticeable which led to this design

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.980 
very noticeable which led to this design
where<00:03:08.400> again<00:03:08.850> it's<00:03:09.000> one<00:03:09.209> in<00:03:09.360> three-quarter

travels<00:03:13.950> between<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.489> pipes<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.090> then<00:03:15.209> to

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
travels between the pipes and then to

scoop<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.769> little<00:03:20.040> steel<00:03:20.340> wool<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:21.660> this

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
scoop and a little steel wool so this

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.449 
scoop and a little steel wool so this
had<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.050> good<00:03:22.290> sound<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.680> was<00:03:22.739> pretty<00:03:22.980> happy<00:03:23.190> with

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
had a good sound I was pretty happy with

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.759 
had a good sound I was pretty happy with
this<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.590> continue<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.739> be<00:03:27.050> but<00:03:28.050> I<00:03:28.230> wanted<00:03:28.650> to

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
this and continue to be but I wanted to

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.460 
this and continue to be but I wanted to
try<00:03:29.360> something<00:03:30.360> with<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:31.250> reverse<00:03:32.250> flow<00:03:32.730> I

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
try something with a reverse flow I

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.900 
try something with a reverse flow I
found<00:03:34.470> this<00:03:35.120> one<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.300> a<00:03:36.390> half<00:03:36.600> inch<00:03:36.840> diameter

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
found this one and a half inch diameter

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.000 
found this one and a half inch diameter
antenna<00:03:38.910> mast<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:39.780> hope<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:40.080> don't<00:03:40.140> regret

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
antenna mast and I hope I don't regret

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.590 
antenna mast and I hope I don't regret
someday<00:03:42.800> sacrificing<00:03:43.800> it<00:03:43.950> for<00:03:44.160> this<00:03:44.280> project

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
someday sacrificing it for this project

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.050 
someday sacrificing it for this project
but<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.750> exhaust<00:03:46.200> is<00:03:46.500> forced<00:03:46.890> inside<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.730> one

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.330 
but the exhaust is forced inside the one
and<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.300> half<00:03:48.450> inch<00:03:48.690> diameter<00:03:49.200> pipe<00:03:49.440> then<00:03:50.190> it

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
and a half inch diameter pipe then it

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.840 
and a half inch diameter pipe then it
has<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.700> turn<00:03:50.850> around<00:03:51.650> get<00:03:52.650> into<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.130> pipe<00:03:53.489> to

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
has to turn around get into this pipe to

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.690 
has to turn around get into this pipe to
get<00:03:54.810> out<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.440> this<00:03:56.420> was<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:58.430> pleasant<00:03:59.430> sound

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
get out and this was a pleasant sound

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.580 
get out and this was a pleasant sound
and<00:04:00.440> the<00:04:01.440> most<00:04:01.830> quiet<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.610> all<00:04:02.820> these<00:04:03.060> designs

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
and the most quiet of all these designs

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.370 
and the most quiet of all these designs
it<00:04:04.590> was<00:04:04.920> pretty<00:04:05.880> difficult<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.660> build<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.230> has

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
it was pretty difficult to build it has

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.280 
it was pretty difficult to build it has
to<00:04:07.530> be<00:04:07.680> well<00:04:08.519> aligned<00:04:09.120> for<00:04:09.630> all<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.080> to

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
to be well aligned for all of this to

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
slide inside the pipe these had to be

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.620 
slide inside the pipe these had to be
squeezed<00:04:15.090> down<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.290> weld<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:16.980> together<00:04:17.630> to

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
has to get into this space and then go

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.350 
has to get into this space and then go
back<00:04:50.600> but<00:04:51.600> put<00:04:52.139> them<00:04:52.290> close<00:04:52.680> together<00:04:53.180> this<00:04:54.180> is

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
back but put them close together this is

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.450 
back but put them close together this is
18<00:04:54.780> inches<00:04:55.169> overall<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:57.260> I<00:04:58.260> really<00:04:58.980> like<00:04:59.190> this

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
18 inches overall and I really like this

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.490 
18 inches overall and I really like this
sound<00:04:59.820> I<00:05:00.150> think<00:05:00.510> it's<00:05:00.630> got<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.870> little<00:05:01.169> more

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
sound I think it's got a little more

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.530 
sound I think it's got a little more
bark<00:05:01.950> than<00:05:03.410> this<00:05:04.410> one<00:05:04.740> and<00:05:04.950> by<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.639> way<00:05:06.590> I

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
bark than this one and by the way I

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.360 
bark than this one and by the way I
failed<00:05:09.540> to<00:05:09.720> point<00:05:09.900> out<00:05:10.139> this<00:05:10.650> whole<00:05:10.889> length<00:05:11.190> of

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
failed to point out this whole length of

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.340 
failed to point out this whole length of
tube<00:05:11.639> is<00:05:11.880> not<00:05:12.030> doing<00:05:12.450> anything<00:05:12.690> the<00:05:13.050> exhaust

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
tube is not doing anything the exhaust

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.530 
tube is not doing anything the exhaust
can't<00:05:13.620> get<00:05:13.860> inside<00:05:14.040> here<00:05:14.820> and<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.270> thoughts

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
can't get inside here and the thoughts

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.340 
can't get inside here and the thoughts
crossed<00:05:15.840> my<00:05:16.080> mind<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:17.250> put<00:05:17.460> holes<00:05:17.700> in<00:05:18.030> it<00:05:18.350> it

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
crossed my mind to put holes in it it

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.790 
crossed my mind to put holes in it it
would<00:05:19.470> act<00:05:19.680> as<00:05:19.889> like<00:05:20.070> a<00:05:20.130> reverse<00:05:20.610> glass<00:05:21.060> pack

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
would act as like a reverse glass pack

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.570 
would act as like a reverse glass pack
so<00:05:22.800> I<00:05:22.830> might<00:05:23.130> try<00:05:23.310> that<00:05:23.400> someday<00:05:25.340> getting<00:05:26.340> back

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
so I might try that someday getting back

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.680 
so I might try that someday getting back
to<00:05:26.850> the<00:05:28.070> whatever<00:05:29.070> I<00:05:29.160> was<00:05:29.370> talking<00:05:29.760> about<00:05:29.850> so

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
to the whatever I was talking about so

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.159 
to the whatever I was talking about so
this<00:05:30.900> one<00:05:31.520> 18<00:05:32.520> inches<00:05:32.850> long<00:05:32.910> if<00:05:33.750> I<00:05:33.990> made

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
this one 18 inches long if I made

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.800 
this one 18 inches long if I made
another<00:05:34.500> one<00:05:34.620> 12<00:05:35.610> inches<00:05:35.940> long<00:05:36.000> I<00:05:36.360> could<00:05:36.540> put

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
another one 12 inches long I could put

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.220 
another one 12 inches long I could put
two<00:05:36.990> in<00:05:37.169> a<00:05:37.260> row<00:05:37.470> inside<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.850> side<00:05:39.660> pipe<00:05:39.960> and

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
two in a row inside the side pipe and

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.439 
two in a row inside the side pipe and
see<00:05:40.380> what<00:05:40.560> that<00:05:40.710> sounds<00:05:41.070> like

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
see what that sounds like

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.750 
see what that sounds like
before<00:05:43.169> I<00:05:43.199> close<00:05:43.560> here<00:05:43.980> I'll<00:05:44.130> show<00:05:44.370> how<00:05:44.550> these

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
before I close here I'll show how these

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.150 
before I close here I'll show how these
fit<00:05:46.910> and<00:05:47.910> I<00:05:48.000> almost<00:05:48.210> hesitate<00:05:48.570> to<00:05:49.080> give<00:05:49.949> this

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
fit and I almost hesitate to give this

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.450 
fit and I almost hesitate to give this
idea<00:05:50.639> away<00:05:50.970> for<00:05:51.240> free<00:05:51.540> but<00:05:52.220> every<00:05:53.220> one<00:05:53.430> of

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
idea away for free but every one of

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.240 
idea away for free but every one of
these<00:05:53.669> has<00:05:53.940> a<00:05:53.970> small<00:05:54.480> washer<00:05:55.230> and<00:05:55.560> a<00:05:55.710> big

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
these has a small washer and a big

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.129 
these has a small washer and a big
washer<00:05:56.990> so<00:05:57.990> the<00:05:58.199> small<00:05:58.530> washer<00:05:59.810> the<00:06:00.810> slide

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
washer so the small washer the slide

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.200 
washer so the small washer the slide
inside<00:06:01.590> the<00:06:01.830> pipe<00:06:04.100> the<00:06:05.100> big<00:06:05.310> washer<00:06:05.820> cannot

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
inside the pipe the big washer cannot

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:15.950 
inside the pipe the big washer cannot
and<00:06:07.199> then<00:06:07.620> when<00:06:07.740> I<00:06:07.770> put<00:06:08.010> the<00:06:08.160> outlet<00:06:08.310> on

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.370 

it's<00:06:16.960> trapped<00:06:17.580> it<00:06:18.580> doesn't<00:06:19.000> travel<00:06:19.350> down<00:06:20.350> to

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
it's trapped it doesn't travel down to

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.880 
it's trapped it doesn't travel down to
here<00:06:21.480> because<00:06:22.480> the<00:06:22.660> big<00:06:22.840> washer<00:06:23.350> is<00:06:23.530> stopped

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.890 
here because the big washer is stopped

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.180 
here because the big washer is stopped
for<00:06:24.190> this<00:06:24.370> diameter<00:06:24.730> change<00:06:25.680> so<00:06:26.680> I<00:06:26.740> can<00:06:26.950> pretty

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
for this diameter change so I can pretty

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.890 
for this diameter change so I can pretty
rapidly<00:06:27.730> take<00:06:28.060> that<00:06:28.300> off<00:06:29.220> and<00:06:30.220> try<00:06:30.490> different

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
rapidly take that off and try different

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.810 
rapidly take that off and try different
configurations<00:06:31.900> I<00:06:32.220> don't<00:06:33.220> know<00:06:33.280> if<00:06:33.370> I<00:06:33.460> pointed

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
configurations I don't know if I pointed

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.820 
configurations I don't know if I pointed
out<00:06:33.940> I<00:06:34.000> painted<00:06:34.510> some<00:06:34.780> of<00:06:34.930> these<00:06:35.020> white<00:06:35.410> to

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
out I painted some of these white to

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.920 
out I painted some of these white to
show<00:06:36.700> a<00:06:36.730> greater<00:06:38.310> detail<00:06:39.510> it's<00:06:40.510> kind<00:06:40.720> of<00:06:40.810> an

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.850 
overcast day and especially this one
with<00:06:46.030> the<00:06:46.180> blackness<00:06:46.480> of<00:06:46.930> having<00:06:47.350> run<00:06:47.560> for<00:06:47.830> a

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
with the blackness of having run for a

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.450 
with the blackness of having run for a
thousand<00:06:48.430> miles<00:06:48.930> no<00:06:49.930> detail<00:06:50.500> was<00:06:50.770> was<00:06:51.070> showing

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
thousand miles no detail was was showing

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.000 
thousand miles no detail was was showing
in<00:06:51.580> the<00:06:51.670> video<00:06:52.000> at<00:06:52.180> all<00:06:52.350> so<00:06:53.350> I<00:06:53.380> painted<00:06:53.710> this

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
in the video at all so I painted this

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.910 
in the video at all so I painted this
one<00:06:54.310> in<00:06:54.490> its<00:06:54.700> entirety<00:06:55.180> and<00:06:55.720> just<00:06:56.380> a<00:06:56.500> moment

one in its entirety and just a moment
ago<00:06:58.260> painted<00:06:59.260> the<00:06:59.380> scoop<00:06:59.710> aspects<00:07:00.430> of<00:07:00.700> these

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
ago painted the scoop aspects of these

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.320 
ago painted the scoop aspects of these
only<00:07:02.440> so<00:07:02.890> it<00:07:02.980> would<00:07:03.130> show<00:07:03.400> in<00:07:03.910> the<00:07:04.150> video<00:07:06.330> so
