00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.040
 hi everyone with you i mihail site review 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:07.660
 sergeyua 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.879
 I remind you that this lesson comes out at 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.299
 support of scientific and production 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:15.940
 combining the harmony of the leader in vacuum 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.880
 on plasma technology them separate 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.730
 thank you and we are in today's lesson 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.460
 consider creating some clothes for 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.490
 character in a static state 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.830
 use tissue system and deformer 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.950
 Amy for simulating tissue movement 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.989
 let's create a new document 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:42.190
 keyboard shortcut n add to 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:45.309
 our character scene combine data 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.530
 firing polygons connect firing plus share 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:52.420
 immediately lengthen the time of our track to 500 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.640
 de activate until harper nurbs 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.019
 let's switch to the polygons mode and 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.949
 our task is to 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.350
 to produce 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.619
 selection of polygons we need in the form 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.360
 T-shirts 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.509
 you can do this by holding the key 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.509
 shift 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.570
 in such a way, so as not to waste 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.080
 the time of the lesson is now in Russia and I will show 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.970
 ready selected result that's what 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.470
 it came out to me like this 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.229
 I made the selection necessary 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.479
 T-shirt segments are ready now 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:39.390
 mouse from scratch let's do 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:41.640
 here so we choose the split command now 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.409
 as you can see we have added 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.369
 another selected area 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.789
 we can see it as follows 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.789
 let's rename 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.100
 Now create a new material to 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.190
 our shirt was more noticeably let 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.979
 it will be such a color apply it and 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.429
 now with the shirts highlighted while holding 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.340
 shift key add surprise deform them 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:11.620
 in the deformer and point to our character 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.910
 working surprise deformer am need not 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.980
 forget to press the key and lower yutsa 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.519
 now one more moment holding our 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:26.650
 shirt key alto 7 lite class 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:30.540
 Claude judge vision set to 0 from 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.310
 thickness at 1 that's what we got 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.760
 so we got static 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.860
 an object 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.500
 which when the character moves will 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.930
 follow them now let's 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.030
 turn our t-shirt into a dress 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.640
 and try to make the bottom 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.459
 part was moving for this 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.160
 we deactivate while claude lick we will allocate 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.360
 the shirt go from the shemtie combination 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.269
 keys yl. 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:02.040
 club selection let's highlight this club 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.040
 gave our object 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.850
 and pull out 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.850
 for example somewhere like that 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.170
 our pay is ready 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.620
 Now with a combination of shirts 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.960
 mt keys 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.960
 let's take it like this 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.580
 and make some cuts 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.620
 since for any simulation always 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.940
 need to have a good grid now 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:52.920
 We go to the properties of a surprise floor and infinite 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:56.670
 change to box reduce its example where 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:04.070
 here so here we put shelves to zero 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:09.600
 and let's move the plot reduce where 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:14.520
 somewhere so move it up and of course 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:18.049
 do not forget to press and do not chew now 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.640
 let's add our dress claude so 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.550
 if you click play the dress now 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.340
 just drop such a moment us not 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.800
 satisfied so let's add 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.800
 our dress is also build so 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:37.520
 and in it we will point to our character 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.099
 now you need to set points 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.620
 which will be controlled by belt these 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.419
 dots must be inside our yellow 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.729
 boxing 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:50.870
 with the shirts highlighted , press 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:58.819
 keyboard shortcut you will look selection 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:05:02.870
 and choose this one, here we go now 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:04.210
 select fil selection and point to 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.279
 top part 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.569
 holding the shift key converts it 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:14.500
 in point selection 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:17.090
 and in the settings of our build, press z 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.550
 after these actions our dedicated 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.189
 dots on shine forth we turn 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:27.250
 surprise again do not forget to press the key 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:33.039
 and lost change a little gravity in 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.039
 claude so set it around -02 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.110
 and now if we press play the 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.370
 the effect of the fabric will only be affected 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.710
 our lower dress area 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:49.000
 And in this case, if we move 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:51.460
 our object is that fabric in the same way 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.030
 follows him 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.970
 the way 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.250
 I hope all actions are clear and everyone 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.940
 can subsequently apply them himself for 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.160
 own needs 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:07.450
 let's stop this lesson i will 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.700
 finish and remind you that he comes out with 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:13.120
 support of scientific and production 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.580
 combining the harmony of the leader in vacuum 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.100
 on plasma technology them separate 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.470
 thank you and good luck to you all 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.780
 own projects follow our 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.990
 updates and stay with network overview 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.990
 and
