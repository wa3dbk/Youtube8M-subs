00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.440
 today before inviting you to surf I want to show you the place where we are 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.739
 we find this is the end on the eastern shore of Lake Garda 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.070
 perhaps someone there was not a certain similarity between these houses and villas in 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.210
 construction of Venice that this is due to the fact in the town remained 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.569
 for almost four centuries under the rule of the Serenissima 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:32.689
 the Venetian influences are very strong even in the nautical theme this degree 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.079
 boat on fire built on the lake of como is called venice 34 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.900
 is carried out by construction site tasks founded in 1956 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.690
 RTL currently produces 10 different models in four-leg casings 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.809
 the venice elegance and the venice sport that then lavinia tends to covering along the 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.710
 shores of Lake Garda you have the feeling that the beauty of the landscape 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.329
 add influenced the taste of knowing how to live 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.000
 all the people who live in these men can also stay 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.620
 choose a model like this reveals the taste of the flagship of the whole 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:09.560
 production 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.880
 34 feet in different versions of the board with a wooden garden 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.620
 spider like water I also lose this beautiful songs 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.360
 all of us share our life I sell hull while the deck finishes are 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.850
 of free interpretation that is can be defined by the shipowner with the 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.490
 construction course without departing too far from the original project 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.230
 here there is very slow indeed cured to keep it shining over time I hate you 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.010
 is a boat from the sea makes the owner sentences of songs the attentions that 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.440
 deserves it will be celebrated by an eternal charm and has a value that only the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.270
 more precious objects see this grow over the years 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.490
 fork is a very high quality mahogany solid wood and help to slide 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.310
 outboard 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.240
 sure if he went on a little aft he would help to come and try 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.059
 all the dates of faith venice sport and elegance agos bad fiberglass for 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:19.959
 obvious reasons of duration maintenance cost of construction if you are looking for something 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.309
 special then you have to take a look at the sportpontino models 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.519
 we will extract the line. 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.719
 crash the wooden hull if you want to buy it you have to put yourself on the list 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.719
 because they only produce one TV 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.409
 the cockpit is very luxurious but above all safe because I am tall 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:39.460
 yes to the bulwarks 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.460
 side and back of the sofa the aft sundeck can be used 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.280
 also navigation because it is surrounded by a border that offers some shelter 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.070
 unlike many other more modern style motorboats 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:05.569
 the cup is very comfortable with these file gatherings but that little face uses a 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:06.279
 flavor 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:07.200
 a correct one 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.200
 with these the master is open to you here at the gardens 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:16.450
 sottoperta.it area where to have lunch and repair is furnished with and 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:20.999
 sofas all around and central table that lowering allows you to form 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:27.099
 a large double berth the bathroom separator also shows all the 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.499
 care of the ballista in working the modem 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:35.340
 this boat equipped with two 265 horsepower diesel engines from the 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:37.100
 madness of spain moggi 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.200
 spot the gem seems to me that one needs the second a recent agreement 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.200
 between the two great things 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:49.389
 starting the push and immediately effective because in addition to having a 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.970
 available 500 30 horses 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.060
 we also have two feet stern with the double helix counter-rotating in short, not 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.060
 we know how it starts immediately 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:06.289
 this technical equipment this motorization must have been chosen 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.570
 from an accountant I have from a mathematician from a physicist 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:16.469
 because it is really relational 500 30 horses but at 3000 rpm at the speed of 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:18.850
 29 and praise we just consume 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.980
 48 liters per hour in total this means that we are doing around zero, 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.980
 6 miles with units 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.880
 what cruising speed is very comfortable but how safe it is 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.879
 comes to Rome - let's try 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.590
 you very precise the corrections that 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.410
 you can rotate with fear and this makes your hands feel so 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.880
 I want to accelerate and take it even at maximum speed 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.120
 49 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.580
 four red-stomach evenings at this speed to the test and immersed 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.740
 in the water 1001 things to laugh about 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.210
 the boat is a guide for many blackberries with stern feet and therefore there is a rule 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.849
 fundamental when accelerating and the head of environmental issues gives you a bit of 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.270
 cream 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.349
 the result is immediate the boat will lift the boss much less resistance 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.839
 it goes faster than consuming less fuel 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.520
 4400 rpm 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.020
 44 anonymous this is an excellent result for a boat so heavy and contrary 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.789
 a diesel engine of two for 265 horsepower 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:54.389
 this speed the fantastic feeling because the serigraphy forms 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:58.879
 bin abdullah mohammed, very gently I seem to be driving 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:03.119
 a car in sight therefore it is necessary to hold the helm at the tip of the fingers 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:06.819
 the corrections must always be of the native to understand what the answer is 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.819
 boat 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.020
 during crossing the lake of garda in this that the fact that wide between lazise 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.849
 padenghe with me this boat to the atrocity cruise como of 36 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:27.280
 praises 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.230
 just 15 minutes will surely be enough 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.150
 a boat the best way 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.509
 to move between the various locations 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:38.650
 of this lake but the comitti venezia 34 can do 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.180
 much more populated than 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.180
 far further from 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:03.619
 photo 

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:10.829
 d ', tank the capacity of 500 liters so you have an astronomy of the' 300 

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:13.810
 miles' and if you do not have enough, you can the Lake Garda 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.150
 you can go across the Tyrrhenian Sea 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.720
 in corsica in Sardinia even from Sicily starting from the Lazio coast 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.360
 the important thing is that to navigate always use the utmost caution and therefore 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.669
 before printing ear to the bulletins
