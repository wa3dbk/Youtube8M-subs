which<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.170> at<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> base<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.650> them<00:00:29.010> what<00:00:29.910> this

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
which is at the base of them what this

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.910 
which is at the base of them what this
does<00:00:30.300> when<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.630> cast<00:00:30.840> into<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> swim<00:00:31.470> this

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
place is a porter it stops the float

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.990

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
by the second one is when it hits the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.529 
by the second one is when it hits the
water<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:44.219> rather<00:00:44.640> than<00:00:44.850> making<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> splash

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
water it rather than making the splash

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.479 
water it rather than making the splash
which<00:00:45.840> normal<00:00:46.200> palette<00:00:46.469> regulars<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:47.039> with

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
which normal palette regulars do with

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.619 
which normal palette regulars do with
all<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.700> shot<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.059> everything<00:00:48.390> around<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
all this shot and everything around the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.630 
all this shot and everything around the
base<00:00:48.809> book<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.649> creates<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.129> plot<00:00:50.399> which

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
base book it just creates a plot which

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.979 
base book it just creates a plot which
is<00:00:50.730> very<00:00:50.940> similar<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.390> pelican<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
is very similar to a pelican in the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.959 
is very similar to a pelican in the
water<00:00:52.170> okay<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.860> if<00:00:53.309> you're<00:00:53.520> fishing<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
water okay so if you're fishing to the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.459 
water okay so if you're fishing to the
clip<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.239> example<00:00:54.660> your<00:00:54.780> flights<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.260> in

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
clip for example your flights going in

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.229 
clip for example your flights going in
he's<00:00:55.949> actually<00:00:56.129> landing<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> water<00:00:56.879> like

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
he's actually landing on the water like

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.299 
he's actually landing on the water like
that<00:00:57.270> creating<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.109> break<00:00:58.320> stopping<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.920> diving

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that creating a break stopping it diving

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.189 
that creating a break stopping it diving
and<00:00:59.489> also<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> neat<00:01:00.059> little<00:01:00.210> plot<00:01:00.570> that's<00:01:00.930> right

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and also a neat little plot that's right

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.139 
and also a neat little plot that's right
followed<00:01:01.770> by<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.980> tour<00:01:02.250> little<00:01:02.579> yeah<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the car and the discs on the base here

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.770 
the car and the discs on the base here
they're<00:01:20.250> removable<00:01:20.610> they<00:01:21.000> are<00:01:21.150> yes<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:21.540> people

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
they're removable they are yes if people

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.749 
they're removable they are yes if people
don't<00:01:21.869> want<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.140> use<00:01:22.259> them<00:01:22.560> oh<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.400> prefer

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
don't want to use them oh and the prefer

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.120 
don't want to use them oh and the prefer
just<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.540> standard<00:01:24.930> pallet<00:01:25.110> Bakula<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
just a standard pallet Bakula and you

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.859 
just a standard pallet Bakula and you
can<00:01:26.250> use<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.520> without<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.880> disc<00:01:27.090> okay<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.630> you

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
can use it without the disc okay so you

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.870 
can use it without the disc okay so you
could<00:01:27.990> literally<00:01:28.229> take<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> disc<00:01:28.740> off<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
could literally take the disc off and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.969 
could literally take the disc off and
they're<00:01:30.030> loaded<00:01:30.180> are<00:01:30.450> they<00:01:30.570> they<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.229> okay<00:01:31.920> so

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
they're loaded are they they is okay so

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.109 
they're loaded are they they is okay so
they're<00:01:32.189> ready<00:01:32.310> loaded<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.759> might<00:01:32.939> want

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
they're ready loaded so you might want

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.280 
they're ready loaded so you might want
to<00:01:33.150> fix<00:01:33.299> them<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.780> couple<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.020> floats

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
to fix them just with a couple of floats

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.380 
to fix them just with a couple of floats
top<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.979> float<00:01:35.189> stop<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> side<00:01:35.909> there

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
top of a float stop to the side there
