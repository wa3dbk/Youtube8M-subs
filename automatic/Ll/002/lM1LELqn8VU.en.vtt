we<00:00:21.000> definitely<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:22.699> bit<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:24.740> sort<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.890> died

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
we definitely have a bit of sort of died

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.420 
we definitely have a bit of sort of died
back<00:00:26.279> here

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
back here

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.830 
back here
some<00:00:29.430> of<00:00:29.520> the<00:00:29.580> leaves<00:00:29.760> are<00:00:29.910> still<00:00:30.090> here<00:00:30.359> but<00:00:30.390> it

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
some of the leaves are still here but it

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.310 
some of the leaves are still here but it
really<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:32.309> not<00:00:32.489> sure<00:00:32.669> if<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.910> alive<00:00:33.320> I

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
really I'm not sure if this is alive I

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.540 
really I'm not sure if this is alive I
do<00:00:34.769> notice<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.790> little<00:00:37.040> semi<00:00:38.040> frozen<00:00:38.430> in

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
do notice it's a little semi frozen in

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.500 
do notice it's a little semi frozen in
the<00:00:38.610> ground<00:00:43.100> but<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.160> think<00:00:44.370> overall<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.180> should

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the ground but I think overall it should

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.700 
the ground but I think overall it should
be<00:00:45.899> still<00:00:46.170> alive

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
be still alive

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.600 
be still alive
it's

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.060 

been<00:00:52.149> around<00:00:54.420> lows<00:00:55.420> of<00:00:55.690> minus<00:00:56.140> seven<00:00:56.530> Celsius

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
been around lows of minus seven Celsius

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.860 
been around lows of minus seven Celsius
which<00:00:57.520> is<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:58.120> think<00:00:58.840> I<00:00:58.899> wrote<00:00:58.960> 20<00:00:59.440> I'm<00:01:00.340> sorry

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
which is I think I wrote 20 I'm sorry

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.109 
which is I think I wrote 20 I'm sorry
you<00:01:01.870> have<00:01:01.989> about<00:01:02.079> 20<00:01:02.440> degrees<00:01:02.800> Fahrenheit

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:14.820 

we<00:01:07.119> have<00:01:07.240> sort<00:01:07.900> of<00:01:10.770> frozen<00:01:12.690> bottom<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:14.770> the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
we have sort of frozen bottom all the

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.310 
we have sort of frozen bottom all the
snow<00:01:15.159> will<00:01:15.310> probably<00:01:15.610> be<00:01:15.700> gone<00:01:15.930> within<00:01:16.930> the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
snow will probably be gone within the

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.219 
snow will probably be gone within the
next<00:01:17.530> five<00:01:17.890> days<00:01:18.149> I<00:01:19.149> think<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:19.930> might<00:01:20.080> add<00:01:20.200> a

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
next five days I think I might add a

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.749 
next five days I think I might add a
little<00:01:20.290> bit<00:01:20.500> of<00:01:20.590> warm<00:01:20.740> water<00:01:20.800> to<00:01:21.159> this<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.490> see

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
little bit of warm water to this you see

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.150 
little bit of warm water to this you see
how<00:01:22.360> that<00:01:22.600> helps<00:01:23.470> because<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.800> top<00:01:23.979> is<00:01:24.009> a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
how that helps because the top is a

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.130 
how that helps because the top is a
little<00:01:24.399> bit<00:01:24.490> dry<00:01:27.479> now<00:01:28.479> let's<00:01:28.690> have<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.869> look<00:01:28.990> at

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
little bit dry now let's have a look at

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.499 
little bit dry now let's have a look at
the<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:30.310> I<00:01:30.340> have<00:01:30.550> on<00:01:30.580> my<00:01:30.880> rooftop<00:01:33.509> container

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
the one I have on my rooftop container

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.960 
the one I have on my rooftop container
garden<00:01:36.119> now<00:01:37.119> this<00:01:37.270> one<00:01:37.479> looks<00:01:38.580> pretty<00:01:39.580> dormant

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
garden now this one looks pretty dormant

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.740 
garden now this one looks pretty dormant
that's<00:01:40.360> for<00:01:40.600> sure<00:01:40.720> so<00:01:42.420> I'll<00:01:43.420> have<00:01:43.570> some

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
that's for sure so I'll have some

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.300 
that's for sure so I'll have some
moisture<00:01:44.200> that's<00:01:44.710> fine<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.720> little<00:01:47.110> bit

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
moisture that's fine and a little bit

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.240 
moisture that's fine and a little bit
more<00:01:48.310> damp<00:01:48.880> soil<00:01:49.090> on<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.479> top<00:01:50.009> covered<00:01:51.009> up<00:01:51.100> of

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
more damp soil on the top covered up of

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:05.120 
more damp soil on the top covered up of
it<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:53.020> think<00:01:53.740> this<00:01:53.800> one's<00:01:54.039> still<00:01:54.220> alive<00:02:03.179> I

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
it I think this one's still alive I

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.969 
it I think this one's still alive I
checked<00:02:06.130> last<00:02:06.310> night<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.560> temperature

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
checked last night the temperature

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.080 
checked last night the temperature
differential<00:02:09.369> i<00:02:10.110> measured<00:02:11.340> from<00:02:12.340> about<00:02:12.640> 20

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
differential i measured from about 20

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.320 
differential i measured from about 20
feet<00:02:13.239> away<00:02:13.420> from<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.500> one<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.830> backyard

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
feet away from the one in the backyard

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.510 
feet away from the one in the backyard
and<00:02:16.330> then<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.540> measured<00:02:17.190> after<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:20.280> right<00:02:21.280> in

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
and then I measured after that right in

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.449 
and then I measured after that right in
the<00:02:21.640> pot<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:23.470> difference<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.890> found<00:02:24.069> was

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
the pot and the difference I found was

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.229 
the pot and the difference I found was
about<00:02:24.790> three<00:02:25.209> degrees<00:02:25.480> Fahrenheit<00:02:25.930> which<00:02:26.770> is

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
about three degrees Fahrenheit which is

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.530 
about three degrees Fahrenheit which is
the<00:02:28.239> one<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.690> half<00:02:29.129> degrees<00:02:30.129> Celsius<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.270> I

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
the one and a half degrees Celsius so I

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.199 
the one and a half degrees Celsius so I
guess<00:02:32.349> that's<00:02:32.530> all<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.830> get<00:02:34.410> when<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:36.209> move

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
guess that's all you get when you move

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.930 
guess that's all you get when you move
it<00:02:37.360> that<00:02:37.480> way<00:02:37.540> but<00:02:37.959> it's<00:02:38.200> better<00:02:38.349> than<00:02:38.440> nothing

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
it that way but it's better than nothing

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.290 
it that way but it's better than nothing
and<00:02:39.940> they<00:02:40.120> do<00:02:40.239> up<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.480> wind<00:02:40.660> protection<00:02:42.300> so

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
and they do up the wind protection so

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.379 
and they do up the wind protection so
thanks<00:02:44.020> for<00:02:44.110> watching
