00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
this and try Michael just like you but

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.430 
this and try Michael just like you but
it<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.459> handy<00:02:22.000> do<00:02:22.209> logon<00:02:22.720> once<00:02:22.989> every<00:02:23.319> couple

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
it is handy do logon once every couple

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.250 
it is handy do logon once every couple
hours<00:02:23.769> so<00:02:24.459> definitely<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.330> pays<00:02:25.599> off<00:02:25.840> if<00:02:26.110> you

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
hours so definitely it pays off if you

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.430 
hours so definitely it pays off if you
get<00:02:26.470> one<00:02:26.680> or<00:02:27.040> even<00:02:27.069> two<00:02:30.120> doesn't<00:02:31.120> look<00:02:31.269> like

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
get one or even two doesn't look like

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.520

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
to search under trees for I'm pretty

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.960 
to search under trees for I'm pretty
sure<00:02:41.260> they<00:02:41.410> will<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:42.130> about<00:02:42.310> always<00:02:42.610> be

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
sure they will just about always be

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.690 
sure they will just about always be
under<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.300> tree<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:47.200> give<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.190> couple<00:02:48.340> more

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
under a tree just give it a couple more

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.170 
under a tree just give it a couple more
seconds<00:02:49.210> looking<00:02:50.490> but<00:02:51.490> looks<00:02:51.790> like<00:02:52.000> this

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
seconds looking but looks like this

i<00:02:58.330> believe<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.720> respawn<00:02:59.110> times<00:02:59.380> i<00:02:59.800> heard<00:03:00.160> just

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
i believe the respawn times i heard just

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.250 
i believe the respawn times i heard just
three<00:03:01.180> days<00:03:01.210> and<00:03:01.750> not<00:03:01.900> one<00:03:01.990> hundred<00:03:02.050> percent

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
three days and not one hundred percent

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.240 
three days and not one hundred percent
sure<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:02.920> don't<00:03:03.100> take<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.460> to<00:03:03.670> heart<00:03:05.250> anyways

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250

sure so don't take that to heart anyways
let's<00:03:06.430> go<00:03:06.580> find<00:03:06.910> another<00:03:07.150> one<00:03:07.830> now<00:03:08.830> this<00:03:08.980> is

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
let's go find another one now this is

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.130 
let's go find another one now this is
where<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.460> can<00:03:09.580> find<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.180> darting<00:03:10.630> actually

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
where you can find the darting actually

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.180 
where you can find the darting actually
you<00:03:12.130> set<00:03:12.370> out<00:03:12.400> here<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.790> dustwallow<00:03:13.120> marsh<00:03:13.180> and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
you set out here to dustwallow marsh and

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.930 
you set out here to dustwallow marsh and
fly<00:03:15.190> around<00:03:15.340> in<00:03:16.020> this<00:03:17.020> area<00:03:17.260> right<00:03:17.620> here<00:03:17.940> you

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
fly around in this area right here you

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.700 
fly around in this area right here you
know<00:03:19.000> look<00:03:19.270> under<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.600> trees<00:03:19.840> there<00:03:20.140> are<00:03:20.260> some

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
know look under the trees there are some

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.220 
know look under the trees there are some
nests<00:03:21.370> that<00:03:21.400> are<00:03:21.730> under<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.210> trees<00:03:22.600> but

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
nests that are under the trees but

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.590 
nests that are under the trees but
they're<00:03:23.410> not<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:24.130> actual<00:03:24.280> nest<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:25.030> need<00:03:25.240> so

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
they're not the actual nest you need so

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.520 
they're not the actual nest you need so
don't<00:03:26.230> get<00:03:26.380> confused<00:03:26.560> by<00:03:27.100> those<00:03:28.260> but<00:03:29.260> still

don't get confused by those but still
it's<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.800> same<00:03:29.980> idea<00:03:30.430> just<00:03:30.610> fly<00:03:30.940> around<00:03:31.120> keep

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.880 
it's the same idea just fly around keep
looking<00:03:32.200> under<00:03:32.470> these<00:03:32.650> trees<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:34.890> hopefully

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
looking under these trees and hopefully
