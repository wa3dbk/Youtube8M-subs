00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
obviously but what a lot of people don't

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.740 
obviously but what a lot of people don't
know<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.730> he<00:00:53.969> doesn't<00:00:54.180> train<00:00:54.539> for

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
know is that he doesn't train for

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.099 
know is that he doesn't train for
CrossFit<00:00:55.170> by<00:00:55.320> doing<00:00:55.649> crossfit<00:00:56.840> you<00:00:57.840> can't

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
CrossFit by doing crossfit you can't

training<00:01:18.630> sucked<00:01:18.930> then<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:21.150> rich<00:01:21.450> Froning

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
training sucked then so rich Froning

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.060 
training sucked then so rich Froning
trains<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.439> CrossFit<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.979> then

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
trains for CrossFit and then

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.100 
trains for CrossFit and then
occasionally<00:01:23.369> tests<00:01:24.180> his<00:01:24.509> progress

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
occasionally tests his progress

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.499 
occasionally tests his progress
so<00:01:25.890> apparently<00:01:26.340> one<00:01:26.670> year<00:01:26.909> he<00:01:27.030> fucked<00:01:27.299> up

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
so apparently one year he fucked up

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.340 
so apparently one year he fucked up
because<00:01:27.869> he<00:01:29.240> he<00:01:30.240> lost<00:01:30.450> some<00:01:30.810> rope<00:01:31.020> climbing

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
because he he lost some rope climbing

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.160 
because he he lost some rope climbing
event<00:01:31.909> well<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.689> can<00:01:33.840> bet<00:01:33.990> your<00:01:34.020> bottom

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
event well you can bet your bottom

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.899 
event well you can bet your bottom
dollar<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.710> when<00:01:35.100> he<00:01:35.220> trained<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> next

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
dollar that when he trained for the next

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.969 
dollar that when he trained for the next
games<00:01:36.180> he<00:01:36.840> worked<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.200> rope<00:01:37.380> climbing<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.829> lot

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
games he worked on rope climbing a lot

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.310 
games he worked on rope climbing a lot
because<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.119> came<00:01:39.270> up<00:01:39.450> again<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.229> would

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
because if it came up again that would

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.300 
because if it came up again that would
be<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:40.530> Achilles<00:01:40.950> heel<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:43.159> that's<00:01:44.159> what<00:01:44.250> I

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
be as Achilles heel so that's what I

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.889 
be as Achilles heel so that's what I
think<00:01:44.460> about<00:01:44.520> rich<00:01:44.790> Froning<00:01:45.180> he's<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> beast<00:01:45.689> at

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
think about rich Froning he's a beast at

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.539 
think about rich Froning he's a beast at
CrossFit<00:01:46.170> he's<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> pretty<00:01:46.799> decent<00:01:46.890> lifter<00:01:48.200> but

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
CrossFit he's a pretty decent lifter but

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.840 
CrossFit he's a pretty decent lifter but
he<00:01:50.549> doesn't<00:01:50.909> do<00:01:51.149> CrossFit<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.899> train<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.350> it

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
he doesn't do CrossFit to train for it

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.359 
he doesn't do CrossFit to train for it
so<00:01:53.850> he's<00:01:54.600> really<00:01:54.990> not<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.500> poster<00:01:56.009> boy<00:01:56.159> of

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
so he's really not the poster boy of

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.660 
so he's really not the poster boy of
CrossFit<00:01:58.100> they<00:01:59.100> should<00:01:59.310> pick<00:01:59.430> someone

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
CrossFit they should pick someone

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.020 
CrossFit they should pick someone
homegrown<00:02:00.360> who<00:02:01.219> started<00:02:02.219> out<00:02:02.340> doing<00:02:02.520> crossfit

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
homegrown who started out doing crossfit

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.149
