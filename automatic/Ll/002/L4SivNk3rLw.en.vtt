 we will have precisely in front and 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.830
 stationary with loss of the 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.619

 of cold air continues to affect the region 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.870
 temperature values ​​not very high 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.240

 center and you have descended the 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.860
 temperature slightly for what it is 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.760
