00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
you see him come out of the water and

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.810 
you see him come out of the water and
the<00:05:54.630> shark<00:05:54.870> just<00:05:55.050> fly<00:05:55.470> right<00:05:55.710> by<00:05:56.280> I'm<00:05:56.490> like<00:05:56.639> out

the shark just fly right by I'm like out
of<00:05:56.970> the<00:05:57.060> water<00:05:57.300> maybe<00:05:58.050> it's<00:05:58.860> more<00:05:59.190> of<00:05:59.280> the

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
of the water maybe it's more of the

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.250 
of the water maybe it's more of the
cooler<00:05:59.580> shots<00:05:59.970> of<00:06:00.150> the<00:06:00.210> movie<00:06:00.510> there<00:06:01.110> are<00:06:01.169> also

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
cooler shots of the movie there are also

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.409 
cooler shots of the movie there are also
some<00:06:01.650> cool<00:06:01.860> shots<00:06:02.070> with<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.700> camera<00:06:03.030> like<00:06:03.150> on

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
some cool shots with the camera like on

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.029 
some cool shots with the camera like on
the<00:06:03.599> back<00:06:03.810> of<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:04.169> shark<00:06:04.410> which<00:06:04.650> is<00:06:04.740> kind<00:06:04.979> of

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
the back of the shark which is kind of

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.180 
the back of the shark which is kind of
interesting<00:06:05.280> but<00:06:06.260> in<00:06:07.260> the<00:06:07.560> end<00:06:07.650> there's<00:06:07.950> a<00:06:08.010> lot

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
interesting but in the end there's a lot

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.500 
interesting but in the end there's a lot
of<00:06:08.220> teams<00:06:09.150> screaming<00:06:10.020> and<00:06:11.240> some<00:06:12.240> people

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
of teams screaming and some people

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.150 
of teams screaming and some people
linked<00:06:12.990> it<00:06:13.080> to<00:06:13.110> some<00:06:13.320> of<00:06:13.380> the<00:06:13.470> slasher<00:06:13.919> fix

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
linked it to some of the slasher fix

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.379 
linked it to some of the slasher fix
that<00:06:14.310> we're<00:06:14.400> becoming<00:06:14.520> popular<00:06:15.000> at<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:15.330> time

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
that we're becoming popular at the time

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:18.050 
that we're becoming popular at the time
it<00:06:15.690> makes<00:06:16.020> sense<00:06:16.410> you<00:06:16.500> get<00:06:16.620> a<00:06:16.650> bunch<00:06:16.740> of<00:06:17.060> kids

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
it makes sense you get a bunch of kids

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.719 
it makes sense you get a bunch of kids
that<00:06:18.270> are<00:06:18.599> you<00:06:18.930> know<00:06:19.160> out<00:06:20.160> there<00:06:20.250> to<00:06:20.460> get<00:06:20.550> eaten

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
that are you know out there to get eaten

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.930 
that are you know out there to get eaten
I<00:06:21.060> think<00:06:21.960> one<00:06:22.200> of<00:06:22.229> the<00:06:22.470> the<00:06:23.010> first<00:06:23.310> kid<00:06:23.789> that

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
I think one of the the first kid that

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.659 
I think one of the the first kid that
gets<00:06:24.030> eaten<00:06:24.530> was<00:06:25.530> the<00:06:25.710> really<00:06:26.039> horny<00:06:26.490> one

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
gets eaten was the really horny one

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:27.830 
gets eaten was the really horny one
that's<00:06:26.910> having<00:06:27.060> sex<00:06:27.539> with<00:06:27.690> his<00:06:27.780> girlfriend

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
that's having sex with his girlfriend

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.390 
that's having sex with his girlfriend
all<00:06:28.320> the<00:06:28.410> time<00:06:29.570> sound<00:06:30.570> familiar

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
all the time sound familiar

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.969 
all the time sound familiar
so<00:06:33.330> some<00:06:33.479> of<00:06:33.509> the<00:06:33.630> kids<00:06:33.750> die<00:06:34.020> eventually<00:06:34.199> chief

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
so some of the kids die eventually chief

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:40.100 
so some of the kids die eventually chief
Brody<00:06:35.250> like<00:06:35.729> they<00:06:37.340> kind<00:06:38.340> of<00:06:39.110> extends

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
Brody like they kind of extends

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.560 
Brody like they kind of extends
throughout<00:06:40.350> the<00:06:40.500> movie<00:06:40.740> like<00:06:41.419> leaving<00:06:42.419> up<00:06:42.539> to

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
throughout the movie like leaving up to

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.749 
throughout the movie like leaving up to
him<00:06:42.870> using<00:06:43.199> what<00:06:43.800> he<00:06:43.860> uses<00:06:44.039> to<00:06:44.190> kill<00:06:44.490> the<00:06:44.580> shark

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 
him using what he uses to kill the shark

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:47.320 
him using what he uses to kill the shark
eventually<00:06:45.330> he<00:06:45.509> accidentally<00:06:46.350> pulls<00:06:46.590> up<00:06:46.770> a

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
eventually he accidentally pulls up a

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.249 
eventually he accidentally pulls up a
electric<00:06:48.330> wire<00:06:48.570> that<00:06:48.780> goes<00:06:48.840> out<00:06:49.080> to<00:06:49.199> this

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 
electric wire that goes out to this

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:52.749 
electric wire that goes out to this
island<00:06:49.470> they<00:06:49.770> were<00:06:49.830> at<00:06:50.810> cable<00:06:51.810> Junction<00:06:52.080> and

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 
island they were at cable Junction and

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:55.430 
island they were at cable Junction and
he<00:06:53.759> tracks<00:06:54.120> a<00:06:54.270> shirt<00:06:54.419> by<00:06:54.570> banging<00:06:54.870> on<00:06:55.169> it<00:06:55.199> which

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
he tracks a shirt by banging on it which

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.920 
he tracks a shirt by banging on it which
I<00:06:55.530> guess<00:06:55.680> kind<00:06:55.919> of<00:06:56.009> makes<00:06:56.160> sense<00:06:56.370> shark<00:06:57.330> tries

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
I guess kind of makes sense shark tries

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.390 
I guess kind of makes sense shark tries
to<00:06:58.050> get<00:06:58.169> him<00:06:58.320> by<00:06:58.530> to<00:06:58.590> the<00:06:58.860> wire<00:06:59.070> and

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
to get him by to the wire and

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.400 
to get him by to the wire and
essentially<00:07:00.300> gets<00:07:00.539> shocked<00:07:00.780> and<00:07:00.990> catches<00:07:01.289> on

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
essentially gets shocked and catches on

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.710 
essentially gets shocked and catches on
fire<00:07:01.680> which<00:07:02.009> is<00:07:02.180> interesting<00:07:03.180> in<00:07:03.330> fact<00:07:03.600> I

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
fire which is interesting in fact I

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.820 
fire which is interesting in fact I
don't<00:07:05.060> it's<00:07:06.060> no<00:07:06.270> shooting<00:07:06.780> the<00:07:06.930> snowshoe<00:07:07.680> ting

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830 
don't it's no shooting the snowshoe ting

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.500 
don't it's no shooting the snowshoe ting
the<00:07:08.010> scuba<00:07:08.400> tank<00:07:08.610> out<00:07:08.789> of<00:07:08.880> the<00:07:08.970> shark's<00:07:09.270> mouth

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510 
the scuba tank out of the shark's mouth

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.920 
the scuba tank out of the shark's mouth
but<00:07:09.810> I<00:07:10.310> wouldn't<00:07:11.310> say<00:07:11.370> it's<00:07:11.669> a<00:07:11.729> ridiculous

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
but I wouldn't say it's a ridiculous

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.980 
but I wouldn't say it's a ridiculous
shark<00:07:12.930> movie<00:07:13.350> it's<00:07:13.560> it's<00:07:13.889> uh<00:07:14.010> it's<00:07:14.660> good<00:07:15.660> it's

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 
shark movie it's it's uh it's good it's

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.770 
shark movie it's it's uh it's good it's
just<00:07:16.199> kind<00:07:16.440> of<00:07:16.820> 60<00:07:17.820> close<00:07:18.030> to<00:07:18.150> the<00:07:18.210> original<00:07:18.300> if

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 
just kind of 60 close to the original if

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.969 
just kind of 60 close to the original if
I<00:07:18.870> want<00:07:19.050> to<00:07:19.080> see<00:07:19.199> the<00:07:19.320> original<00:07:19.440> I<00:07:19.680> would<00:07:19.830> just

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 
I want to see the original I would just

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:23.540 
I want to see the original I would just
see<00:07:20.130> jaws<00:07:20.490> because<00:07:20.970> it's<00:07:21.120> just<00:07:21.300> better<00:07:22.550> it's

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550 
see jaws because it's just better it's

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.450 
see jaws because it's just better it's
not<00:07:23.729> nearly<00:07:24.270> as<00:07:24.419> bad<00:07:25.260> as<00:07:25.470> jaws<00:07:25.710> three<00:07:26.070> and<00:07:26.190> four

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 
not nearly as bad as jaws three and four

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.600 
not nearly as bad as jaws three and four
some<00:07:27.090> of<00:07:27.150> the<00:07:27.240> other<00:07:27.330> things<00:07:27.630> I've<00:07:27.810> done<00:07:27.840> but

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:28.610 
some of the other things I've done but

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.570 
some of the other things I've done but
it's<00:07:29.610> worth<00:07:29.940> checking<00:07:29.970> out<00:07:30.949> Roy<00:07:31.949> Schneider<00:07:32.340> is

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 
it's worth checking out Roy Schneider is

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.029 
it's worth checking out Roy Schneider is
where<00:07:33.090> Shire<00:07:33.330> strider<00:07:33.930> is<00:07:34.229> always<00:07:34.889> a<00:07:34.919> good

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 
where Shire strider is always a good

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:41.450 
where Shire strider is always a good
actor<00:07:35.960> so<00:07:36.960> uh<00:07:36.990> I<00:07:38.599> guess<00:07:39.599> I<00:07:40.470> would<00:07:40.710> recommend<00:07:41.099> it
