whine so this isn't generated by any of
my<00:00:21.060> equipment<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.990> actually<00:00:22.260> holds<00:00:22.680> true

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
my equipment and it actually holds true

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.420

even on my laptop I've actually tried

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.250 
even on my laptop I've actually tried
this<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:28.310> a<00:00:29.310> second<00:00:29.939> Microsoft<00:00:30.779> camera<00:00:31.170> and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
this with a second Microsoft camera and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.020 
this with a second Microsoft camera and
it<00:00:31.349> does<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.590> same<00:00:31.619> thing<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.340> little<00:00:32.700> bit<00:00:32.790> soft
