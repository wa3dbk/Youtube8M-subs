00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
setup and you can pretty much change it

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.170 
setup and you can pretty much change it
early<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.070> any<00:00:20.220> way<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.460> want<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.000> I

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
early is it any way you want it to I

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.580 
early is it any way you want it to I
just<00:00:21.570> had<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> guns<00:00:21.990> I'm<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.410> for<00:00:22.560> a

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
just had the guns I'm going for a

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.099 
just had the guns I'm going for a
marksman<00:00:22.949> rifle<00:00:23.340> gun<00:00:24.210> streak<00:00:24.630> because<00:00:24.930> it's

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
marksman rifle gun streak because it's

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.310 
marksman rifle gun streak because it's
pretty<00:00:25.289> much<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.619> easiest<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:27.320> not

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
pretty much the easiest and it's not

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.900 
pretty much the easiest and it's not
really<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.680> difficult<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.279> me<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.730> do

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
really that difficult for me to do

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.880 
really that difficult for me to do
because<00:00:30.179> it's<00:00:30.510> just<00:00:30.630> one<00:00:30.810> track<00:00:30.960> one<00:00:31.170> kill<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
because it's just one track one kill and

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.470 
because it's just one track one kill and
you<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.160> change<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.520> gun<00:00:32.669> any<00:00:32.880> way<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.180> want

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
you can change the gun any way you want

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.900 
you can change the gun any way you want
to<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.989> if<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.100> were<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.489> running<00:00:35.640> in

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.270 
to and if I were going to be running in
a<00:00:36.030> yarn<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.540> I'd<00:00:36.750> probably<00:00:37.079> have<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
a yarn this I'd probably have in the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.190 
a yarn this I'd probably have in the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
with the marksman rifle it's a bit

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.119 
with the marksman rifle it's a bit
easier<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.050> me<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.170> aim<00:00:55.350> down<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.590> bit<00:00:55.890> quicker

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
easier for me to aim down a bit quicker

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.220 
easier for me to aim down a bit quicker
and<00:00:56.430> yeah<00:00:57.420> that's<00:00:57.600> pretty<00:00:57.719> much<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.020> my<00:00:58.199> a

normally I like to rock the bison

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.440

or something like that I think that's

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.379 
or something like that I think that's
what<00:03:18.200> it's<00:03:18.290> called<00:03:18.319> and<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.549> will<00:03:19.700> I<00:03:20.090> mean

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
what it's called and that will I mean

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:21.520 
what it's called and that will I mean
it's<00:03:20.510> just<00:03:20.569> it<00:03:20.870> comes<00:03:21.019> with<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.260> peripheral

those ezb Hills and yeah that's pretty

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.099 
those ezb Hills and yeah that's pretty

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
really run some machine guns when I'm

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.610 
really run some machine guns when I'm
running<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.060> sulfur<00:03:41.480> so<00:03:42.079> for<00:03:42.319> this<00:03:42.410> I'm<00:03:42.530> gonna

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
running a sulfur so for this I'm gonna

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.610 
running a sulfur so for this I'm gonna
be<00:03:42.799> running<00:03:42.889> the<00:03:43.190> Remington<00:03:43.700> r5<00:03:44.660> with<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.410> red

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620

this<00:03:48.620> is<00:03:48.739> because<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.099> rooming<00:03:49.400> Tenaya

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
this is because the rooming Tenaya

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.839 
this is because the rooming Tenaya
staminate<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.079> believe<00:03:51.470> and<00:03:51.769> I<00:03:52.400> think<00:03:52.430> it's

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
staminate I believe and I think it's

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.909 
staminate I believe and I think it's
probably<00:03:53.120> one<00:03:53.299> the<00:03:53.359> better<00:03:53.599> AR<00:03:54.019> especially<00:03:54.709> on

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
probably one the better AR especially on

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.690 
probably one the better AR especially on
silence<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:56.000> then<00:03:56.299> lethal<00:03:57.139> c4<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:57.980> as<00:03:58.549> I<00:03:58.639> said

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
silence and then lethal c4 and as I said

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.650 
silence and then lethal c4 and as I said
you<00:03:58.849> can<00:03:58.970> probably<00:03:59.120> think<00:03:59.299> is<00:03:59.480> off<00:03:59.569> and

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
you can probably think is off and

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.809 
you can probably think is off and

take hardline off and I'm gonna put this

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.920 
take hardline off and I'm gonna put this
