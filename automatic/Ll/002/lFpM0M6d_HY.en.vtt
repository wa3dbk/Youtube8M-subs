good<00:00:20.279> for<00:00:20.609> me<00:00:21.000> much<00:00:21.689> like<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.170> one<00:00:22.410> but<00:00:22.820> what

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
good for me much like this one but what

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.259 
good for me much like this one but what
usually<00:00:24.029> happens<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.289> map<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:26.269> people

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
usually happens on this map is people

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.910 
usually happens on this map is people
just<00:00:27.449> camp<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> buildings<00:00:28.320> especially

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
just camp in the buildings especially

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.160 
just camp in the buildings especially
that<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.760> building<00:00:30.090> or<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.810> know<00:00:30.929> they're

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
that a building or you know they're

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.020 
that a building or you know they're
there<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.500> creeping<00:00:32.279> around<00:00:32.460> everywhere

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
there just creeping around everywhere

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.530 
there just creeping around everywhere
and<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.380> very<00:00:34.620> slow<00:00:35.250> pace<00:00:35.640> map<00:00:36.120> so

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
and it just it's a very slow pace map so

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.500 
and it just it's a very slow pace map so

from this map um but today I've got a 47

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.470 
from this map um but today I've got a 47
and<00:00:47.180> one<00:00:48.180> Moab<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.440> guys<00:00:49.710> um<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.760> could

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and one Moab for you guys um this could

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.760 
and one Moab for you guys um this could
have<00:00:51.690> potentially<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.829> been<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:54.469> double<00:00:55.469> Moab

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
have potentially have been a double Moab

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.930 
have potentially have been a double Moab
gameplay<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.239> kind<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.780> fucked<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.320> and

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
gameplay but I kind of fucked it up and

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.250 
gameplay but I kind of fucked it up and
you<00:00:59.940> know<00:01:00.059> there's<00:01:00.300> some<00:01:00.570> parts<00:01:01.020> where<00:01:01.230> it

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
you know there's some parts where it

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.799 
you know there's some parts where it
kind<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.710> slows<00:01:02.160> down<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.640> little<00:01:02.879> bit<00:01:03.210> just

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
kind of slows down a little bit just

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.070 
kind of slows down a little bit just
because<00:01:03.930> uh<00:01:05.150> we're<00:01:06.150> putting<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> beat<00:01:06.810> down<00:01:07.020> on

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
because uh we're putting a beat down on

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.130 
because uh we're putting a beat down on
these<00:01:07.439> kids<00:01:07.740> pretty<00:01:08.040> bad<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.840> kids<00:01:09.840> kept

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
these kids pretty bad so kids kept

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.450 
these kids pretty bad so kids kept
quitting<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.860> everything<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.400> that

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
quitting and everything like that

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.390 
quitting and everything like that
because<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.200> think<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.500> don't<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.890> think<00:01:14.130> I'm<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
because I think I don't I think I'm in a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.969 
because I think I don't I think I'm in a
party<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.030> five<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:15.900> maybe<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.770> full

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
party of like five or maybe it's a full

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.490 
party of like five or maybe it's a full
party<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.460> six<00:01:17.759> not<00:01:18.060> really<00:01:18.390> sure<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:19.020> um<00:01:19.350> I

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
and this is my first gameplay or moab i

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.700 
and this is my first gameplay or moab i
should<00:01:26.430> say<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.330> ACR<00:01:28.020> i<00:01:28.049> know<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.500> kind

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
should say with the ACR i know it's kind

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.880 
should say with the ACR i know it's kind
of<00:01:28.770> weird<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:30.630> typically<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.439> ACR<00:01:31.860> is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
of weird you know typically the ACR is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.069 
of weird you know typically the ACR is
probably<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.430> easiest<00:01:33.030> gun<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> MOAB

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
probably the easiest gun to get a MOAB

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.649 
probably the easiest gun to get a MOAB
with<00:01:34.369> but<00:01:35.369> i<00:01:35.400> don't<00:01:35.909> know<00:01:36.000> i'm<00:01:36.180> not<00:01:36.360> i'm<00:01:36.600> not
