00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.530
 to know a little more about the 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.080
 manufacture of sidewalks for 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.930
 feeders let's take as an example one 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.510
 which is in the process of construction here 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.150
 the floor height stands out from 5 to 6 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.460
 centimeters at the level of the step 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.189
 Scale depth is from 40 to 50 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.710
 centimeters and the length of the platform 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.570
 occupies all the space of the coral it 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.040
 recommends that the height of the module in 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.230
 which are the bars for the 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.230
 feeder is 30 centimeters 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.420
 yes 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.750
 and really important is a matter 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.239
 maybe elementary for many but very 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.340
 important in its effect really it 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.680
 does this tier 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.800
 also the fastest response 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.320
 quick and the least important of all 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.050
 is to avoid with trampling in this area 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.720
 the animals very often 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.150
 make open gaps open up 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.400
 let's say so great that 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.080
 we are in need and filling them 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.240
 with some frequency but only the most 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.640
 important the most important 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.820
 truly is that this meets 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.509
 a part of safety in animals 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.970
 who are in the coral when you have 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:35.270
 several animals there is an order 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:37.190
 social or is always going to want the 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.200
 better position will want the best food 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.210
 you will want to eat and will do 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 want to displace others from your site 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:49.190
 of location try that this tier 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.280
 gives us a security zone that 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.299
 it works in the following way 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.330
 the bovine really has a mind 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.900
 simple what we call a mind of 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.960
 only one way he can only think and 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.380
 act in one activity at the same 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.230
 time then based on that principle 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.000
 elementary of the cattle we know that 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.160
 that animal has its hands placed 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.120
 highlight this tier while it is 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.030
 eating your letters will be 1 meter 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.250
 1 with 50 more back I have a height 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.800
 different then she to be able 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.200
 change from one place to another to 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.989
 being able to change from one hole to another has 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.000
 that obligatorily that back down give 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.160
 the return and pass because both the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.220
 animals to enter another hole that does not 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.739
 It prevents animals from knocking 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.600
 this area are not going to hit the 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.690
 heads with one another can 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.180
 cause injuries injuries injuries 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.160
 because like they are eating loose 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.800
 because they can fight for the position 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.580
 that they have but this tier avoids 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.580
 that problem 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.230
 you are not going to see equally that a 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.760
 animal will then move 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.709
 frontally on this degrees in this 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.910
 way as you can give 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.760
 account 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.489
 the animal would have its two members 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.230
 right laterals in this case in a 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.900
 height and the two lateral members 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.090
 left in another total height of that 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.290
 the animal the bovine is not in capacity 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.290
 to make that movement 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.739
 in the area of the stables can 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.989
 used with double function the first 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.879
 floor for the mobility of animals and 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.870
 the second as a warehouse for 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.870
 livestock segments 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.840
 then the design of this tailpiece 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.969
 allows in this central alley 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.900
 where we are now standing can 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:51.480
 enter a truck 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.790
 and when located in this area it can be 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.209
 downloaded by the part above it 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.879
 streamlines and facilitates change many 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.900
 Sometimes we have seen, for example, a 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:07.010
 truck with 450 500 bales of hay can 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.750
 be downloaded in less than 45 minutes 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.250
 for the usually tomatoes works 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.909
 do it when we're working to 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.909
 floor level 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.520
 is to remember that you see 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:29.259
 continuation is an imported pen but 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.259
 production is easy
