00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 sat he's damn too much when you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.799
 find in this video a little bit 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.540
 sick hence the fact that our water will be 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.660
 a little bit of special minutes 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.070
 words especially blurry since I almost 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.330
 to make the camera fall from you that I 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.940
 am sick but the rest is 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.379
 perfectly visible sweat salutes them 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.970
 jewelry too happy to find me in 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.949
 this video where I get back to you a little bit 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.390
 sick it's been a week already that I 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.020
 drag my little rhinopharyngitis and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.020
 consciousness have grown 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.130
 I prayed to pencil with eyebrows that aligns 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.690
 sun drop on home benefits shade 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.890
 immediate I know that I make you 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.690
 a review but I would like to quickly 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.220
 talk about it anyway because it's a 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.290
 pencil that I really wanted to test 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.390
 for a long time I had given my 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.830
 lucky pencil that my mom feels 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.430
 3 because he still had the stamp 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.200
 from my house 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.640
 but absolutely cracked on the achievement 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.180
 trolls that is really perfect for 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.650
 my eyebrows 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.360
 this one is the one I wear 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.280
 currently and what I will say to 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.809
 level of this brush is that it's going 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.700
 give you next to them in one level 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.840
 wax holding etc 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.520
 you're going to have your eyebrows that 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.810
 will hold all day and it's for 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.760
 that I recommend to girls 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.070
 who really have very very very little 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.440
 eyebrows and who need a lot of 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.610
 color them me I just need to 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.800
 fill in a few holes to know a 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.180
 big scar a few things 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.070
 I would like a quick one we will say 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.360
 fulfilled but really quickly and for 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.190
 the shot is not a customer who is made 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.660
 for me I find it much too fat 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.950
 while the kiko and many more is 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.990
 which allows me to have something 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.880
 more natural even if it remains a very 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.860
 big eyebrow pencil and worry 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.630
 major I would say with secret y years and 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.850
 which ends at an incredible pace 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.780
 so I think I thai all the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.610
 two uses 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.860
 I use very little because he 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.600
 should not be sworn at 100% 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.070
 even though I use them a lot because 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.229
 that they please me a little bit when 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.479
 I want to have something 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.920
 perfect a little bit I do not want to 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.070
 to say overrated but when I want 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.180
 to have something really very 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.740
 pronounced at the level of the deaf if it is 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.780
 not necessarily what I want but 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.479
 I used it since I bought them and 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.470
 I would say that this pencil will suit 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.750
 rather to people who want 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.549
 to have a very visible finish at the level 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.110
 eyebrows or who have near turns if 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.280
 at the base and suddenly it's not 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.450
 necessarily for girls like me 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.070
 who just want to fill them 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.890
 quickly since I find that the 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.479
 result is far too visible then 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.570
 this is the purchase I would call 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.100
 a pressure like this film gold he yes I 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.450
 know I'm one of the only ones maybe to 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.670
 hate the lord of the rings but 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.790
 I have not been able to watch it if 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.860
 precious is the waltz of durban says that 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.930
 we know that in the palette nec and 3 which 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.040
 just out and I will not buy it 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.790
 what's the simple and good reason she 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.350
 looks like the nec in addition to dew and 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.980
 for once I'm not necessarily 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.959
 desire 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.459
 43 euros in a palette like this 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.989
 knowing that there are other palettes that 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.069
 are a lot more original and for the 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.330
 blow I think if I want to 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.799
 orientate me towards a note will guide you 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.209
 rather to their snag that makes me 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.409
 much more of the eye I wanted 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.420
 to open with you I have not at all 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.590
 open yet was not beautiful 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.299
 it's the palette I'm going to use 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.160
 for a make up of fact because I 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.959
 simply find divine good 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.790
 introduced daily also what 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.170
 I hope that I will try to 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.790
 tame this device I almost failed 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.220
 fuck on the floor there are less than two 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.660
 seconds and I'm going to make you 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.810
 super sosh with all its colors 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.910
 because he or she looks me divine g 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.230
 either their store and I fell 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.569
 really in love with all 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.849
 colors and I already see how 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.900
 use the rosa and for me it's 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.400
 really the pallet that you have to buy 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.840
 for the holidays much more interesting 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.730
 that naked three in any case my sense 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.950
 and you really have a palette with 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.090
 absolutely splendid colors that this 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.470
 either at the neutral level or at the level 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.870
 women who are much more 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.160
 bubbly yeah I would say sparkling 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.150
 especially in relation to all these 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.709
 colors oh la la 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.530
 they are ignoring all the layers and 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.930
 it's all there is I think we can 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.000
 do really great smoky with 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.680
 supers make up i'll do it to you i'll you 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.810
 the silk i will be on my blog really 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.280
 watch because the time that I 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.480
 This touches a little one camera 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.919
 that I have a little neglected these 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.870
 lately and I will make you 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:53.260
 supers swatch promised and the detail that 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:55.480
 kill the opening the stuff that does not serve 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.680
 absolutely nothing but who makes you 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.720
 the effect because you paid your pallet 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.480
 forty euros 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.500
 and you had some diamond info 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.109
 pity that this is not the real one 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.160
 not want to have everything and I think I 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.989
 you will make a video on it because 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.540
 it's really a great gift to make 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.720
 for the ear, you'll do it tonight 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.799
 offer or magic 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.090
 so if you follow in the videos I 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.180
 think you're up against his 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.070
 moment I'm good in flesh and for 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.690
 motivate you for my story recovery 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.700
 I took a little leather leggings 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.560
 who is wrong but who will not go when 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.270
 would have lost 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.710
 the thing in principle not to do I 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.210
 know that I have plenty of jeans there 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.470
 in my wardrobe but I do not need 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.420
 to add me I need more 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.490
 motivation with something new 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.430
 and I found a super nice leggings in 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.250
 leather chick here it is the gi defeated 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.570
 put in leatherette leggings and I 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.710
 found them really beautiful because 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:51.250
 that there is a small zipper at 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:52.630
 Low level people this style the material 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.300
 is really very beautiful 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.090
 all disgusting leatherette you know a 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.970
 little bit like in like out strawberries 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.810
 body but leather pants that the 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.010
 burn in the crotch who wants to open 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.290
 this episode does nothing to me but to 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.760
 thinking assures us and I like because 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.130
 that I found them really well 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.350
 finished he has to scratch like all 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.700
 other little leggings and he has a very 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.010
 beautiful finish as I told you 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.890
 with the small zipper at the bottom 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.230
 for an even more rocky side 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.520
 it's really my motivation it seems 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.770
 stupid but that's the thing that motivates me 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.690
 to play sports and to give me 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.100
 even more 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.000
 but here I am going to show you my 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.160
 winter coat 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.780
 finally you said on instagram that 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.280
 I had found the perfect coat for 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.810
 me in any case for this winter 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.520
 that's what I'm looking for right now 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.350
 I absolutely wanted a hood in 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.840
 fake fur like this one is the one 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.540
 it is really very dense and secundo I 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.830
 found them will end up with a fur 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.540
 absolutely divine 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.310
 it's a gorgeous gray duffle coat 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.170
 hood I tell you from before that 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.180
 when you buy it you have 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.600
 the impression that you are going to eat or 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.120
 pasta for 6 months or rice 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.910
 and less arr just early it costs 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.280
 really very expensive but when I see the 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.860
 difference between a beautiful coat of 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.840
 super quality and a coat a lesser 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.250
 cost really I did not hesitate I got 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.720
 said I take this pretty coat he me 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.280
 will last very, very, very long 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.350
 I will buy little coats to 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.850
 during the balances to keep after for 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.200
 the rest of the year who are not 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.850
 necessarily as beautiful as this one 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.610
 Did you see this dengue hood that 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:27.190
 touch my hood it's removable I 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.220
 believe yes it is removable but it does not 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.590
 would not come to my mind 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.500
 vettel go away splendid I you 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:37.340
 show it right now 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:41.330
 you have seen the size of the hood have 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:43.460
 shot one night too much to be hooded no 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.420
 i really like ohlala too much you can
