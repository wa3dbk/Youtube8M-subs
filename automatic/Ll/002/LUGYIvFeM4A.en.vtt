probably read my write-up on MJ's
nutrition<00:01:07.450> way<00:01:07.570> about<00:01:08.230> why<00:01:08.650> having<00:01:09.190> intact

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
nutrition way about why having intact

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.270 
nutrition way about why having intact
weight<00:01:10.090> concentrate<00:01:10.870> is<00:01:11.050> a<00:01:11.250> beneficial<00:01:12.250> thing

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
weight concentrate is a beneficial thing

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.300 
weight concentrate is a beneficial thing
and<00:01:12.730> the<00:01:13.450> thing<00:01:13.480> is<00:01:13.720> when<00:01:14.590> you<00:01:14.710> strip<00:01:15.070> things

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
and the thing is when you strip things

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.370 
and the thing is when you strip things
down<00:01:15.550> into<00:01:15.790> isolates<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:16.600> hydrolysates

does<00:01:23.080> by<00:01:23.500> keeping<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:23.950> milk<00:01:24.130> proteins<00:01:24.640> intact

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
does by keeping the milk proteins intact

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
you know I'm not to agree with that if

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.240 
you know I'm not to agree with that if
you're<00:01:37.390> keeping<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:37.780> intact<00:01:38.080> that's<00:01:38.710> a<00:01:38.980> good

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
you're keeping it intact that's a good

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.100 
you're keeping it intact that's a good
thing<00:01:39.310> now<00:01:39.940> there's<00:01:40.120> a<00:01:40.210> blend<00:01:40.450> of<00:01:40.540> total<00:01:40.930> milk

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
thing now there's a blend of total milk

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.740 
thing now there's a blend of total milk
protein<00:01:41.530> again<00:01:42.220> it's<00:01:42.400> intact<00:01:42.820> leucine

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
protein again it's intact leucine

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.350 
protein again it's intact leucine
glutamine<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:44.620> probably<00:01:45.250> namu<00:01:45.610> seen<00:01:45.880> again

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
glutamine and probably namu seen again

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.880 
glutamine and probably namu seen again
you're<00:01:46.720> taking<00:01:47.110> that<00:01:47.140> they're<00:01:47.440> spiking

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
you're taking that they're spiking

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.920 
you're taking that they're spiking
levels<00:01:48.280> of<00:01:48.340> leucine<00:01:48.730> this<00:01:49.270> is<00:01:49.480> a<00:01:49.510> good<00:01:49.750> thing

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
levels of leucine this is a good thing

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.780 
levels of leucine this is a good thing
and<00:01:50.140> this<00:01:50.620> is<00:01:50.770> part<00:01:50.980> of<00:01:51.040> their<00:01:51.160> protein<00:01:51.580> blend

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
and this is part of their protein blend

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.420 
and this is part of their protein blend
so<00:01:52.150> you<00:01:52.540> have<00:01:52.660> intact<00:01:53.110> milk<00:01:53.470> proteins<00:01:53.980> with

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
so you have intact milk proteins with

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.010 
so you have intact milk proteins with
the<00:01:54.550> freeform<00:01:55.000> loosing<00:01:55.420> which<00:01:55.600> is<00:01:55.750> again

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
the freeform loosing which is again

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.660 
the freeform loosing which is again
going<00:01:56.230> to<00:01:56.320> spike<00:01:56.560> your<00:01:56.590> protein<00:01:57.100> synthesis

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
going to spike your protein synthesis

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.710 
going to spike your protein synthesis
and<00:01:57.700> that's<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:58.450> good<00:01:58.810> thing<00:01:59.100> next<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:01.420> card

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
and that's a good thing next the card

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.320 
and that's a good thing next the card
source<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:03.159> card<00:02:03.430> source<00:02:03.670> is<00:02:03.820> a<00:02:03.850> little<00:02:04.210> bit

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
source the card source is a little bit

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.720 
source the card source is a little bit
different<00:02:04.720> here<00:02:04.900> it's<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.950> blend<00:02:06.550> of

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
different here it's a blend of

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.389 
different here it's a blend of
hydroxypropyl<00:02:07.420> die<00:02:08.080> starch<00:02:08.410> phosphate<00:02:08.950> now

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
hydroxypropyl die starch phosphate now

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.300 
hydroxypropyl die starch phosphate now
essentially<00:02:09.970> a

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
essentially a

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.640 
essentially a
up<00:02:10.399> on<00:02:10.550> this<00:02:10.640> card<00:02:10.940> source<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:12.319> get<00:02:12.620> a

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
up on this card source and I get a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.110 
up on this card source and I get a
little<00:02:12.770> scientific<00:02:13.310> with<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.090> really

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
little scientific with you and I really

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.229 
little scientific with you and I really
can't<00:02:14.780> but<00:02:15.620> I'm<00:02:15.709> not<00:02:15.830> going<00:02:16.069> to<00:02:16.340> it's<00:02:17.060> a

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
can't but I'm not going to it's a

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.570 
can't but I'm not going to it's a
high-molecular-weight<00:02:18.280> resistant<00:02:19.280> starch

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
high-molecular-weight resistant starch

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.420 
high-molecular-weight resistant starch
and<00:02:20.000> what<00:02:20.930> this<00:02:21.080> does<00:02:21.140> essentially<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.069> helps

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
and what this does essentially it helps

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.030 
and what this does essentially it helps
to<00:02:23.209> channel<00:02:23.690> nutrients<00:02:24.170> helps<00:02:24.440> partition

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
to channel nutrients helps partition

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.100 
to channel nutrients helps partition
nutrients<00:02:25.520> in<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.760> muscle<00:02:26.120> basically

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
nutrients in the muscle basically

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.290 
nutrients in the muscle basically
without<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:28.069> insulin<00:02:28.550> spike<00:02:28.819> which<00:02:29.030> could

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
without the insulin spike which could

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.210 
without the insulin spike which could
lead<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.630> fat<00:02:29.840> gain<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:30.560> essentially<00:02:30.980> getting

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
lead to fat gain so essentially getting

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.210 
lead to fat gain so essentially getting
controlled<00:02:31.730> release<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:32.180> carbohydrates<00:02:32.930> and

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
controlled release of carbohydrates and

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.949 
controlled release of carbohydrates and
it's<00:02:34.220> not<00:02:34.519> going<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.819> spike<00:02:35.090> your<00:02:35.120> insulin<00:02:35.360> so

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
it's not going to spike your insulin so

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.640 
it's not going to spike your insulin so
they<00:02:36.110> say<00:02:36.459> like<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:37.819> don't<00:02:38.330> know<00:02:38.599> a<00:02:38.660> dextrose<00:02:39.319> or

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
they say like I don't know a dextrose or

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.949 
they say like I don't know a dextrose or
a<00:02:39.709> straight-up<00:02:40.010> maltodextrin<00:02:40.540> now<00:02:41.540> that's<00:02:41.810> a

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
a straight-up maltodextrin now that's a

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:42.970 
a straight-up maltodextrin now that's a
good<00:02:42.140> thing<00:02:42.410> if<00:02:42.560> you're<00:02:42.680> eating<00:02:42.799> it

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
good thing if you're eating it

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.220 
good thing if you're eating it
throughout<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.459> day<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.569> turn<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.049> milk
