 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.200
 new video to destiny in this video 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.510
 it's about the new red cross end 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.910
 we have been asked many times since yesterday 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.949
 when more videos to the new raid 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.539
 So we will get our timetable 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.650
 for the next few days on our 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.499
 youtube channel 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.499
 yesterday we have the whole dlc 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:29.539
 So gambled the raid the strike 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:32.509
 dawn strike ended and everything from 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.699
 Alone, some are already waiting 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.309
 on the whole video material therefore 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.289
 here our planning in the next 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.300
 days will be a lot of new videos 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.850
 in which we appear every phase of the 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.679
 Explain new waits carefully and 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.390
 so that the whole thing must be reasonable 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.640
 you wait one more day 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.070
 but let me tell you that wait 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.839
 It is also worth the new twilight 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.609
 strike was successful by us 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.589
 finished there will be a video 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.660
 where we tell you how you 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.339
 you have to play the dawn track 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.519
 without problems 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.920
 even for level 28 he has no problems 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.780
 In addition, every single one of them is more 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.450
 mission shown in the video and 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.610
