00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
okay I was gonna say it looks a little

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.540 
okay I was gonna say it looks a little
far<00:00:05.130> out<00:00:05.160> I<00:00:06.529> was<00:00:07.529> thinking<00:00:07.859> that<00:00:07.919> yeah<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.250> can

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
far out I was thinking that yeah I can

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.980 
far out I was thinking that yeah I can
maybe<00:00:08.730> experiment<00:00:09.480> with<00:00:09.599> Kickstarter<00:00:10.230> yeah

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
maybe experiment with Kickstarter yeah

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.270 
maybe experiment with Kickstarter yeah
cut<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.110> out<00:00:13.230> maybe<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.769> could<00:00:13.920> drop<00:00:14.099> them

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
cut it out maybe you could drop them

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.910 
cut it out maybe you could drop them
over<00:00:14.400> just<00:00:14.759> enough<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.690> course<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.529> more<00:00:16.740> you

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
over just enough of course the more you

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.880 
over just enough of course the more you
drop<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:18.380> the<00:00:19.380> more<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:20.369> comes<00:00:21.300> out<00:00:21.859> in<00:00:22.859> a

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
drop it the more this comes out in a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.859 
drop it the more this comes out in a
relationship<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.390> might<00:00:24.630> have

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
relationship to this and this might have

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.980 
relationship to this and this might have
to<00:00:24.900> come<00:00:25.260> out<00:00:25.560> more<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.730> type<00:00:27.510> thing<00:00:27.869> or<00:00:29.990> yep

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
to come out more the type thing or yep

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.540 
to come out more the type thing or yep
so<00:00:31.199> there's<00:00:31.380> these<00:00:31.560> two<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.219> still<00:00:32.430> have

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
so there's these two that you still have

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.900 
so there's these two that you still have
to<00:00:32.700> get<00:00:32.850> yeah<00:00:33.239> looks<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.200> maybe<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.910> smoke

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
to get yeah looks like maybe like smoke

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.290 
to get yeah looks like maybe like smoke
here<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.630> they<00:00:36.809> go<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.489> one-piece<00:00:38.489> round<00:00:38.790> slope

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
here so they go a one-piece round slope

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.619 
here so they go a one-piece round slope
with<00:00:39.480> two<00:00:39.660> brackets<00:00:40.140> coming<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:41.059> nice<00:00:42.059> welds

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
with two brackets coming up nice welds

00:00:42.629 --> 00:01:00.259 
with two brackets coming up nice welds
on<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:42.989> swing<00:00:43.290> arm<00:00:43.500> here<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.980> these

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:31.160

yeah<00:01:31.770> are<00:01:32.760> they<00:01:32.790> hard<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.300> escape<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.810> places

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:50.320

everybody was like I got a really nice

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.190 
everybody was like I got a really nice
welder<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.110> machine<00:01:51.650> but<00:01:55.690> it<00:01:56.690> was<00:01:56.810> all<00:01:56.990> about

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
welder and machine but it was all about

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.710 
welder and machine but it was all about
the<00:01:57.380> skills<00:01:57.680> just<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.610> weird<00:01:58.940> kind<00:01:59.240> of<00:01:59.360> skill

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720

the skills just a weird kind of skill
and<00:02:00.020> like<00:02:00.260> machining<00:02:02.080> anyway<00:02:03.080> I<00:02:03.110> mean<00:02:03.320> by<00:02:03.500> that

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
and like machining anyway I mean by that

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.560 
and like machining anyway I mean by that
well<00:02:04.250> when<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:04.610> give<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:04.910> machines<00:02:05.270> doing

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
well when you give the machines doing

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.350 
well when you give the machines doing
doing<00:02:06.380> a<00:02:06.440> lot<00:02:06.620> of<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:06.890> stuff<00:02:07.130> yeah<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:07.970> well

then you take your hand holding this

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.740 
then you take your hand holding this
thing<00:02:10.310> instead<00:02:10.580> of<00:02:10.700> floating<00:02:11.120> this<00:02:11.480> thing

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
thing instead of floating this thing

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.080 
thing instead of floating this thing
idea<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.920> know<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.520> then<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.760> other<00:02:13.880> problem

idea you know and then the other problem
is<00:02:14.300> all<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.600> extension<00:02:15.140> codes<00:02:15.760> there's<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.790> lot

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
is all the extension codes there's a lot

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.220 
is all the extension codes there's a lot
more<00:02:17.590> combination<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.740> it<00:02:18.860> yeah<00:02:20.020> machine<00:02:21.020> is

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
more combination of it yeah machine is

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:44.699 
more combination of it yeah machine is
all<00:02:21.470> about<00:02:21.910> instead<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:26.170> always<00:02:27.170> put<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.590> in

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.580 

machining<00:02:45.709> is<00:02:45.800> all<00:02:45.920> about<00:02:46.160> violence<00:02:46.820> and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
machining is all about violence and

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:55.780 
machining is all about violence and
loathing<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:48.680> all<00:02:48.830> about<00:02:49.180> massage<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:55.459> metal

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
loathing is all about massage the metal

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.070

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:52.120 
slide the motor forward the trick is
this<00:03:46.050> whooshing<00:03:50.090> little<00:03:51.090> bit<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.900> right

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
no well it's bigger on the frame side so

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.660 
no well it's bigger on the frame side so
you<00:04:03.060> can't<00:04:03.360> really<00:04:03.540> put<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.930> on<00:04:04.050> wrong<00:04:04.670> she

ok excellence and with the cool thing
about<00:04:10.440> this<00:04:10.739> instance<00:04:11.190> we're<00:04:11.400> original<00:04:12.360> it's

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
about this instance we're original it's

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.110 
about this instance we're original it's
12<00:04:13.230> millimeter<00:04:13.650> but<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.160> new<00:04:14.670> one<00:04:14.910> or<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.180> old

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
12 millimeter but the new one or the old

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.120 
12 millimeter but the new one or the old
17<00:04:18.120> millimeter<00:04:18.540> volt

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
17 millimeter volt

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.219 
17 millimeter volt
I<00:04:20.190> pulled<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.000> bushings<00:04:21.390> right<00:04:21.540> out<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:21.750> cases

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
I pulled the bushings right out of cases

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.440 
I pulled the bushings right out of cases
and<00:04:22.470> put<00:04:23.100> new<00:04:23.310> ones<00:04:23.460> in<00:04:23.700> that<00:04:23.940> are<00:04:24.060> stainless

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
and put new ones in that are stainless

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.960 
and put new ones in that are stainless
with<00:04:24.600> a<00:04:24.660> smaller<00:04:24.930> hole<00:04:25.290> to<00:04:25.830> get<00:04:26.310> down<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.700> 12

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
with a smaller hole to get down to 12

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.690 
with a smaller hole to get down to 12
and<00:04:27.180> by<00:04:27.570> doing<00:04:27.780> this<00:04:28.080> it<00:04:28.560> takes<00:04:29.070> all<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.310> load

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
and by doing this it takes all the load

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.960 
and by doing this it takes all the load
and<00:04:30.060> puts<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:31.140> puts<00:04:31.620> it<00:04:31.770> way<00:04:31.950> out<00:04:32.130> here<00:04:32.490> not<00:04:32.820> on

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
and puts it puts it way out here not on

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.480 
and puts it puts it way out here not on
the<00:04:33.090> oh<00:04:33.600> yeah<00:04:35.000> I<00:04:36.110> think<00:04:37.110> that's<00:04:37.620> minister<00:04:38.130> and

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
the oh yeah I think that's minister and

the oh yeah I think that's minister and
then<00:04:38.640> I<00:04:38.789> got<00:04:39.000> these<00:04:39.289> maybes<00:04:40.289> we<00:04:40.320> are<00:04:40.890> Delrin

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
then I got these maybes we are Delrin

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.680 
then I got these maybes we are Delrin
locator<00:04:42.390> discs<00:04:43.490> but<00:04:44.490> these<00:04:44.970> are<00:04:45.120> he<00:04:45.270> treated

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
locator discs but these are he treated

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.170 
locator discs but these are he treated
by<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.900> way<00:04:46.140> going<00:04:46.680> in<00:04:46.979> there<00:04:47.160> seals<00:04:47.610> on<00:04:47.970> both

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
by the way going in there seals on both

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.279 
by the way going in there seals on both
sides<00:04:48.510> nice<00:04:49.229> so<00:04:50.150> this<00:04:51.150> is<00:04:51.300> going<00:04:51.479> to<00:04:51.539> rust<00:04:51.870> this

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
sides nice so this is going to rust this

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:53.750 
sides nice so this is going to rust this
is<00:04:52.350> going<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:52.650> chose<00:04:52.919> I'm<00:04:53.220> going<00:04:53.370> to<00:04:53.460> put<00:04:53.640> some

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
is going to chose I'm going to put some

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.880 
is going to chose I'm going to put some
black<00:04:53.910> paint<00:04:54.300> on<00:04:54.479> it<00:04:54.690> okay<00:04:55.200> or<00:04:55.530> something<00:04:55.800> like

black paint on it okay or something like
that<00:04:57.560> okay<00:04:58.590> so<00:04:59.310> then<00:04:59.640> when<00:04:59.820> putting<00:05:00.360> it<00:05:00.450> back

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
that okay so then when putting it back

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.930 
that okay so then when putting it back
together<00:05:02.930> baby<00:05:03.930> like<00:05:04.310> sticks<00:05:05.310> out<00:05:05.520> like<00:05:05.550> that

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
together baby like sticks out like that

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.310 
together baby like sticks out like that
you're<00:05:06.360> kind<00:05:06.539> of<00:05:06.570> what<00:05:06.720> you<00:05:06.810> do<00:05:06.930> is<00:05:07.020> you<00:05:07.110> kind

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
you're kind of what you do is you kind

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.120 
you're kind of what you do is you kind
of<00:05:07.350> slide<00:05:08.160> it<00:05:08.430> over<00:05:08.960> onto<00:05:09.960> this<00:05:12.650> and<00:05:13.650> get<00:05:14.010> it

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
of slide it over onto this and get it

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:21.330 
of slide it over onto this and get it
back<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.850> other<00:05:14.970> way<00:05:16.010> over<00:05:17.010> there

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.010 

and<00:05:22.340> that<00:05:22.460> goes<00:05:22.700> in<00:05:22.880> there<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:23.510> then<00:05:23.630> we<00:05:23.720> come

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
and that goes in there and then we come

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.230 
and that goes in there and then we come
back<00:05:24.260> come<00:05:25.010> back<00:05:25.040> go<00:05:25.400> into<00:05:25.610> it<00:05:27.040> and<00:05:28.040> then<00:05:29.030> the

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
back come back go into it and then the

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.780 
back come back go into it and then the
trick<00:05:29.510> thing<00:05:29.750> to<00:05:29.930> do<00:05:30.110> is<00:05:30.770> to<00:05:30.950> put<00:05:31.190> the<00:05:31.280> bolt<00:05:31.580> in

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
trick thing to do is to put the bolt in

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.940 
trick thing to do is to put the bolt in
just<00:05:32.780> not<00:05:33.160> take<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.390> axle<00:05:35.390> bolt<00:05:35.630> and<00:05:36.050> put<00:05:36.830> it

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
just not take the axle bolt and put it

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:46.930 
just not take the axle bolt and put it
on<00:05:37.130> the<00:05:37.280> other<00:05:37.400> side<00:05:44.620> now<00:05:45.620> as<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:46.670> British

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
on the other side now as the British

00:05:46.940 --> 00:06:01.420 
on the other side now as the British
would<00:05:47.060> say<00:05:47.240> offer<00:05:47.540> up<00:05:47.960> the<00:05:48.200> engine<00:06:00.220> that<00:06:01.220> was

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
would say offer up the engine that was

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
would say offer up the engine that was
good<00:06:02.500> so<00:06:03.500> that's<00:06:03.680> that<00:06:04.100> you<00:06:05.000> know<00:06:05.120> then<00:06:05.330> you

straight but then I measured that thing
and<00:06:24.920> that<00:06:25.100> thing<00:06:25.370> isn't<00:06:26.150> exactly<00:06:26.780> on<00:06:26.990> the

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.140 
and that thing isn't exactly on the

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:32.610 
and that thing isn't exactly on the
actual<00:06:27.620> centerline<00:06:29.140> yeah<00:06:30.140> like<00:06:30.920> a<00:06:31.190> millimeter

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
actual centerline yeah like a millimeter

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:45.180 
actual centerline yeah like a millimeter
a<00:06:33.640> Bigfoot<00:06:34.640> agreed<00:06:37.690> to<00:06:38.690> piece<00:06:38.960> its<00:06:39.620> best<00:06:40.100> in

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.780
