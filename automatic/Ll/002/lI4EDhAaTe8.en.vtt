non-insulin-dependent diabetes if I had
to<00:01:09.180> choose<00:01:09.320> what<00:01:10.320> type<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.280> diabetes<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:12.180> them

to choose what type of diabetes is them
that<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> most<00:01:13.530> successful<00:01:14.040> about

that is the most successful about
occurring<00:01:15.509> or<00:01:15.689> favorably<00:01:16.500> managing<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.100> would

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
occurring or favorably managing it would

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.899

be<00:01:17.400> type<00:01:17.670> 2<00:01:17.880> diabetes<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.369> type<00:01:20.369> 2<00:01:20.580> diabetes

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
be type 2 diabetes so type 2 diabetes

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.570 
be type 2 diabetes so type 2 diabetes
like<00:01:21.330> type<00:01:21.600> 1<00:01:21.840> diabetes<00:01:22.170> has<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> component<00:01:23.250> of

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
like type 1 diabetes has a component of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.230 
like type 1 diabetes has a component of
autoimmunity<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.479> genetic<00:01:25.140> predisposition

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
autoimmunity and genetic predisposition

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.120 
autoimmunity and genetic predisposition
some<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.720> maybe<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.049> bit<00:01:28.259> less<00:01:28.500> than<00:01:28.560> type

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
some think maybe a bit less than type

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.999 
some think maybe a bit less than type
one<00:01:29.369> certainly<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.390> doesn't<00:01:30.689> matter<00:01:31.009> what

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
one certainly but it doesn't matter what

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.890 
one certainly but it doesn't matter what
does<00:01:32.220> matter<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.240> recognized<00:01:33.750> as

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
does matter is that if we recognized as

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.359 
does matter is that if we recognized as
an<00:01:34.020> immune<00:01:34.259> element<00:01:34.680> there<00:01:34.860> when<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.189> work

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
an immune element there when we work

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.890 
an immune element there when we work
someone<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.759> with<00:01:35.939> lab<00:01:36.180> work<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.689> sort

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
someone up with lab work and that sort

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.630 
someone up with lab work and that sort
of<00:01:36.930> thing<00:01:36.990> we<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.439> look<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:37.799> specific<00:01:37.950> immune

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
of thing we can look for specific immune

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.859 
of thing we can look for specific immune
parameters<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> manage<00:01:39.630> them<00:01:39.750> as

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
parameters and the manage them as

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.130 
parameters and the manage them as
naturally<00:01:40.200> as<00:01:40.259> possible<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:42.210> she'd<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
naturally as possible so she'd like to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.950 
naturally as possible so she'd like to
know<00:01:43.409> Kathy<00:01:43.770> would<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.189> know<00:01:44.960> besides

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
know Kathy would like to know besides

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.080 
know Kathy would like to know besides
medication<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.860> what<00:01:47.100> she<00:01:47.280> could<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.640> well

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
medication of what she could do well

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.670 
medication of what she could do well
again<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.360> don't<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.750> Kathy<00:01:49.200> what<00:01:49.500> you've

in<00:02:04.500> Kathy's<00:02:04.860> case<00:02:05.010> I<00:02:05.190> doubts<00:02:05.400> that<00:02:05.520> that's<00:02:06.090> a

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
in Kathy's case I doubts that that's a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.240 
in Kathy's case I doubts that that's a
truth<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.630> even<00:02:07.140> if<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.320> were<00:02:07.590> true<00:02:07.890> that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
truth and even if it were true that

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.449 
truth and even if it were true that
would<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> very<00:02:09.509> sad<00:02:09.929> way<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> go<00:02:10.470> because<00:02:10.950> we

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
would be a very sad way to go because we

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.760 
would be a very sad way to go because we

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
this stuff out what the unique

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.670 
this stuff out what the unique
nutritional<00:04:59.700> and<00:05:00.090> dietary<00:05:00.150> needs<00:05:00.720> are<00:05:01.020> now

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
nutritional and dietary needs are now

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.950 
nutritional and dietary needs are now
just<00:05:01.860> because<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.280> food<00:05:02.550> on<00:05:02.820> some<00:05:03.090> list<00:05:03.389> says

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
just because of food on some list says

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.260 
just because of food on some list says
it's<00:05:04.139> low<00:05:04.380> glycemic<00:05:05.040> which<00:05:05.910> means<00:05:06.150> it

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
it's low glycemic which means it

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.400 
it's low glycemic which means it
shouldn't<00:05:06.570> cause<00:05:06.720> much<00:05:06.900> of<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.050> sugar<00:05:07.229> problem

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
shouldn't cause much of a sugar problem

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.080 
shouldn't cause much of a sugar problem
doesn't<00:05:07.770> mean<00:05:08.040> it<00:05:08.160> won't<00:05:08.340> in<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.610> individual

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
doesn't mean it won't in the individual

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.440 
doesn't mean it won't in the individual
so<00:05:10.020> we<00:05:10.260> spend<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:11.370> time<00:05:11.639> to<00:05:12.000> figure<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:12.389> out

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
so we spend the time to figure that out

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.800 
so we spend the time to figure that out
based<00:05:13.020> on<00:05:13.169> individual<00:05:13.650> responses<00:05:14.250> to<00:05:14.520> this<00:05:15.510> is

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
based on individual responses to this is

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.719 
based on individual responses to this is
an<00:05:16.320> area<00:05:16.620> of<00:05:16.680> confusion<00:05:17.250> when<00:05:17.340> people<00:05:17.580> think

not working we're not textbooks it

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.050 
not working we're not textbooks it
doesn't<00:05:22.110> mean<00:05:22.380> that<00:05:22.440> if<00:05:23.160> we've<00:05:23.580> tried<00:05:23.820> things

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
doesn't mean that if we've tried things

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.370 
doesn't mean that if we've tried things
to<00:05:24.150> where<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.360> textbook<00:05:24.720> says<00:05:24.930> it<00:05:25.110> doesn't

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
work that it can't work we just have to

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.250 
work that it can't work we just have to
figure<00:05:27.210> this<00:05:27.419> out<00:05:27.630> so<00:05:27.870> we're<00:05:27.990> literally

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
figure this out so we're literally

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.379 
figure this out so we're literally
