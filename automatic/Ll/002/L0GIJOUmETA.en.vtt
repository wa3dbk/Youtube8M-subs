videos recorded before I realized that

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:57.809

the standard definition view was better

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.899 
the standard definition view was better
and<00:03:58.180> I<00:03:58.689> wasn't<00:03:58.959> about<00:03:59.139> to<00:03:59.290> reduce<00:03:59.769> 10<00:04:00.099> 15<00:04:00.579> hours

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
and I wasn't about to reduce 10 15 hours

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.300 
and I wasn't about to reduce 10 15 hours
of<00:04:00.939> game<00:04:01.329> progression<00:04:01.840> just<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.709> change<00:04:03.040> the

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
of game progression just to change the

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.270 
of game progression just to change the
format<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:03.970> such<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.209> minor<00:04:04.510> thing<00:04:05.129> also<00:04:06.129> in

recent<00:04:06.609> videos<00:04:06.939> i<00:04:07.239> turn<00:04:07.449> the<00:04:07.569> battle

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
recent videos i turn the battle

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.050 
recent videos i turn the battle
animations<00:04:08.079> off<00:04:08.739> because<00:04:09.639> when<00:04:09.790> i<00:04:09.819> was

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
animations off because when i was

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.969 
animations off because when i was
grinding<00:04:10.509> it<00:04:10.659> was<00:04:10.780> making<00:04:11.169> battles<00:04:11.590> take<00:04:11.799> way

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:11.979 
grinding it was making battles take way

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.249 
grinding it was making battles take way
too<00:04:12.009> long<00:04:12.189> for<00:04:12.609> my<00:04:12.699> liking<00:04:12.729> as<00:04:13.329> a<00:04:13.389> result

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:14.259 
too long for my liking as a result

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.289 
too long for my liking as a result
turning<00:04:14.919> them<00:04:15.009> off<00:04:15.220> made<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:15.699> grinding<00:04:16.120> go

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
turning them off made the grinding go

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.939 
turning them off made the grinding go
more<00:04:16.570> quickly<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:17.049> made<00:04:17.409> it<00:04:17.530> more<00:04:17.680> tolerable

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
more quickly and made it more tolerable

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.789 
more quickly and made it more tolerable
but<00:04:18.599> because<00:04:19.599> of<00:04:19.630> this<00:04:19.959> i<00:04:20.229> forgot<00:04:20.529> to<00:04:20.560> turn

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
but because of this i forgot to turn

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.260 
but because of this i forgot to turn
them<00:04:21.010> back<00:04:21.130> on<00:04:21.370> when<00:04:21.639> i<00:04:21.669> started<00:04:21.969> recording

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
them back on when i started recording

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.450 
them back on when i started recording
again<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:22.930> they've<00:04:23.469> been<00:04:23.650> off<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.159> we'll<00:04:24.310> be

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
again and they've been off and we'll be

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.560 
again and they've been off and we'll be
off<00:04:24.610> until<00:04:24.789> about<00:04:25.180> video

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
off until about video

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.160 
off until about video
23<00:04:26.460> however<00:04:27.460> at<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.880> same<00:04:27.910> time<00:04:28.420> I<00:04:28.780> don't<00:04:28.960> feel

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
23 however at the same time I don't feel

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.020 
23 however at the same time I don't feel
like<00:04:29.350> it's<00:04:29.530> a<00:04:29.620> big<00:04:29.800> loss<00:04:30.130> because<00:04:30.670> battle

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
like it's a big loss because battle

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.700 
like it's a big loss because battle
animations<00:04:31.180> don't<00:04:31.900> really<00:04:32.170> appeal<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.560> me

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
animations don't really appeal to me

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.400 
animations don't really appeal to me
anyway<00:04:33.250> they<00:04:34.150> had<00:04:34.330> very<00:04:34.570> little<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.200> game

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
anyway they had very little to the game

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.170 
anyway they had very little to the game
and<00:04:35.650> if<00:04:35.740> anything<00:04:35.950> slow<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.610> battles<00:04:36.970> down

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
and if anything slow the battles down

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.550 
and if anything slow the battles down
immensely<00:04:37.510> when<00:04:37.930> I<00:04:37.960> just<00:04:38.260> want<00:04:38.440> to<00:04:38.500> make

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
immensely when I just want to make

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.160 
immensely when I just want to make
progress<00:04:38.980> I'll<00:04:39.970> turn<00:04:40.360> them<00:04:40.570> back<00:04:40.690> on<00:04:40.900> if<00:04:41.080> you

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
progress I'll turn them back on if you

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.620 
progress I'll turn them back on if you
guys<00:04:41.350> really<00:04:41.560> want<00:04:41.710> me<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.250> but<00:04:42.700> understand

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
guys really want me to but understand

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.820 
guys really want me to but understand
that<00:04:43.690> it's<00:04:43.900> not<00:04:44.050> going<00:04:44.200> to<00:04:44.320> be<00:04:44.440> an<00:04:44.620> option

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
that it's not going to be an option

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.760 
that it's not going to be an option
until<00:04:45.160> video<00:04:45.550> 24<00:04:46.090> anyway<00:04:46.540> so<00:04:47.290> I<00:04:47.320> don't<00:04:47.620> really

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
until video 24 anyway so I don't really

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.470 
until video 24 anyway so I don't really
