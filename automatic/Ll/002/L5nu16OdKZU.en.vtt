pretty exciting into alternate tunings

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.040 
pretty exciting into alternate tunings
and<00:00:08.160> we're<00:00:08.250> going<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.550> examine<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.269> open<00:00:09.719> C

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
and we're going to examine the open C

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.039 
and we're going to examine the open C
tuning<00:00:10.670> also<00:00:11.670> known<00:00:11.820> as<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.090> banjo<00:00:12.630> tuning

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
tuning also known as the banjo tuning

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.289 
tuning also known as the banjo tuning
okay<00:00:13.380> because<00:00:13.910> essentially<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.179> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
okay because essentially this is the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.320 
okay because essentially this is the
same<00:00:15.630> tuning<00:00:16.020> as<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> banjo<00:00:16.580> just<00:00:17.580> up<00:00:17.730> five

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
same tuning as a banjo just up five

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.560 
same tuning as a banjo just up five
frets<00:00:18.660> where<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> banjo<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.890> open<00:00:20.250> G<00:00:20.570> your

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
frets where a banjo is open G your

ukulele today is an open seat alright so

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.750 
ukulele today is an open seat alright so
this<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.170> something<00:00:25.380> new<00:00:25.710> new<00:00:26.130> territory<00:00:26.670> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
this is something new new territory a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.910 
this is something new new territory a
lot<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.090> cool<00:00:27.240> things<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.539> explore<00:00:28.019> come<00:00:28.619> on<00:00:28.680> in

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
lot of cool things to explore come on in

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.410 
lot of cool things to explore come on in
follow<00:00:29.250> me<00:00:29.429> let's<00:00:29.699> break<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.029> down

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
follow me let's break it down

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.389 
follow me let's break it down
okay<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> first<00:00:31.529> thing<00:00:31.679> with<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.980> tuning<00:00:32.309> is

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
okay the first thing with the tuning is

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.310 
okay the first thing with the tuning is
we<00:00:32.520> should<00:00:32.669> look<00:00:32.790> at<00:00:32.969> how<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.480> tuned<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
we should look at how it's tuned the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.900 
we should look at how it's tuned the
only<00:00:34.530> difference<00:00:34.860> between<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.370> tuning<00:00:35.760> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
only difference between this tuning and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.740 
only difference between this tuning and
regular<00:00:36.239> tuning<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:38.239> down<00:00:39.239> here<00:00:39.600> is

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
regular tuning is this a down here is

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.990 
regular tuning is this a down here is
going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.170> lowered<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.620> C<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.550> these<00:00:41.760> two

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
going to be lowered to a C so these two

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.650 
going to be lowered to a C so these two
strings<00:00:42.360> are<00:00:44.120> essentially<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.180> same<00:00:45.390> note

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
strings are essentially the same note

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.959 
strings are essentially the same note
but<00:00:45.899> what<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.829> does<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.309> when<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.579> play<00:00:47.820> it

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
but what that does is when we play it

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.790 
but what that does is when we play it
open<00:00:48.620> we<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> C<00:00:50.039> chord<00:00:50.250> okay

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
open we have a C chord okay

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.130 
open we have a C chord okay
and<00:00:52.730> this<00:00:52.910> is<00:00:53.060> the<00:00:53.210> characteristic<00:00:53.900> of<00:00:53.990> the

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
and this is the characteristic of the

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.250 
and this is the characteristic of the
open<00:00:54.440> tuning<00:00:55.300> now<00:00:56.300> what<00:00:56.540> else<00:00:56.660> can<00:00:56.900> we<00:00:56.990> do<00:00:57.140> with

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
open tuning now what else can we do with

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.910 
open tuning now what else can we do with
this<00:00:57.410> well<00:00:57.860> if<00:00:58.130> this<00:00:58.400> is<00:00:58.610> an<00:00:58.730> open<00:00:59.770> that<00:01:00.770> means

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
this well if this is an open that means

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.760 
this well if this is an open that means
we<00:01:01.040> can<00:01:01.190> bar<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:02.330> get<00:01:03.110> other<00:01:03.380> open<00:01:03.920> voicings

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
we can bar and get other open voicings

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.090 
we can bar and get other open voicings
so<00:01:06.770> in<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.250> key<00:01:07.400> of<00:01:07.430> C<00:01:07.730> our<00:01:07.970> one<00:01:08.180> chord<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.479> C

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
so in the key of C our one chord is C

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.600 
so in the key of C our one chord is C
but<00:01:10.100> we<00:01:10.160> also<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:10.520> our<00:01:10.670> on<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.150> fifth<00:01:11.420> fret

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
but we also have our on the fifth fret

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.760 
but we also have our on the fifth fret
this<00:01:13.610> is<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:13.880> F<00:01:14.030> chord<00:01:14.360> or<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.840> four<00:01:14.990> chord

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.050 

right<00:01:18.770> here<00:01:18.979> on<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.190> seventh<00:01:19.520> fret<00:01:19.670> we<00:01:19.940> have

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
right here on the seventh fret we have

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.060 
right here on the seventh fret we have
our<00:01:20.210> G<00:01:22.450> so<00:01:23.450> if<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:23.690> think<00:01:23.900> of<00:01:24.020> maybe<00:01:24.140> a<00:01:24.590> little

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
our G so if you think of maybe a little

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.110 
our G so if you think of maybe a little
basic<00:01:25.310> strong<00:01:25.640> pattern

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
basic strong pattern

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.790 
basic strong pattern
let's<00:01:28.120> think<00:01:28.600> of<00:01:28.720> a<00:01:28.810> basic<00:01:29.140> strum<00:01:29.320> pattern<00:01:29.650> and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
let's think of a basic strum pattern and

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:44.709 
let's think of a basic strum pattern and
let's<00:01:30.580> play<00:01:30.730> some<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:30.940> these<00:01:31.000> chords

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.870 

pretty<00:01:45.719> cool<00:01:45.930> huh<00:01:45.960> all<00:01:46.590> right<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.729> little

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
pretty cool huh all right it's a little

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.310 
pretty cool huh all right it's a little
trickier<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.360> play<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.780> because<00:01:48.990> you're<00:01:49.289> not

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
trickier to play this because you're not

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.109 
trickier to play this because you're not
really<00:01:49.740> doing<00:01:50.189> all<00:01:50.460> these<00:01:50.640> shapes<00:01:50.939> you're

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
really doing all these shapes you're

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.910 
really doing all these shapes you're
just<00:01:51.270> using<00:01:51.420> one<00:01:51.689> finger<00:01:51.929> so<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
just using one finger so if you have a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.770 
just using one finger so if you have a
strap<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.520> kind<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.820> recommend<00:01:54.090> playing<00:01:54.509> it's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
strap I kind of recommend playing it's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.149 
strap I kind of recommend playing it's
going<00:01:54.929> to<00:01:54.990> make<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> open<00:01:55.619> tuning<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> little

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
going to make the open tuning a little

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.309 
going to make the open tuning a little
easier<00:01:56.429> okay<00:01:56.670> all<00:01:57.539> right<00:01:57.689> some<00:01:57.869> other<00:01:58.049> tips

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
easier okay all right some other tips

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.719 
easier okay all right some other tips
and<00:01:58.649> tricks<00:01:59.539> here<00:02:00.829> you<00:02:01.829> have<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> root<00:02:02.280> note<00:02:02.520> all

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
and tricks here you have a root note all

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.139 
and tricks here you have a root note all
right

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
right

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.219 
right
this<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> scene<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.799> here<00:02:05.039> to<00:02:05.219> obviously

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
this is the scene and here to obviously

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.210 
this is the scene and here to obviously
but<00:02:07.229> you're<00:02:07.380> able<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.710> kind<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.979> add<00:02:08.190> some

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
but you're able to kind of add some

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.219 
but you're able to kind of add some
spice<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.119> your<00:02:09.149> strum<00:02:09.479> pattern<00:02:09.840> with<00:02:10.080> this

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
spice to your strum pattern with this

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:20.600 
spice to your strum pattern with this
three<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.310> five

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:29.310 

okay<00:02:27.750> which<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:28.870> cool

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
okay which is cool
