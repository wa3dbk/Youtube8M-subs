I<00:03:14.349> think<00:03:14.560> it's<00:03:14.709> very<00:03:15.010> tightly<00:03:15.430> designed<00:03:15.700> I

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
I think it's very tightly designed I

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.420 
I think it's very tightly designed I
love<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.720> actions<00:03:17.200> there's<00:03:17.530> enough<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.250> do

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
love the actions there's enough to do

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.210 
love the actions there's enough to do
without<00:03:19.120> overwhelming<00:03:20.019> people<00:03:20.380> I<00:03:20.590> think<00:03:21.070> you

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
without overwhelming people I think you

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.250 
without overwhelming people I think you
could<00:03:21.400> teach<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:21.790> pretty<00:03:22.000> much<00:03:22.150> any<00:03:22.450> age<00:03:22.900> as

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
could teach it to pretty much any age as

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.949 
could teach it to pretty much any age as
well<00:03:23.560> it's<00:03:23.859> really<00:03:24.370> family<00:03:24.820> friendly<00:03:24.959> one

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
well it's really family friendly one

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.289 
well it's really family friendly one
thing<00:03:26.170> that<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.700> potentially<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.730> negative<00:03:28.150> for

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
thing that is potentially a negative for

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.819 
thing that is potentially a negative for
this<00:03:28.420> game<00:03:28.600> is<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.989> fact<00:03:29.109> that<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.319> think<00:03:29.410> it

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
this game is the fact that I think it

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.710 
this game is the fact that I think it
might<00:03:30.160> be<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.370> little<00:03:30.730> bit<00:03:31.060> weak<00:03:31.359> on<00:03:31.569> the

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
might be a little bit weak on the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.660 
might be a little bit weak on the
two-player<00:03:32.200> end<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.890> lot<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.400> mechanics

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
two-player end a lot of the mechanics

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.059 
two-player end a lot of the mechanics
are<00:03:33.970> very<00:03:34.000> sort<00:03:34.359> of<00:03:34.450> take<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:34.720> mechanics<00:03:35.530> and

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
are very sort of take that mechanics and

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.559 
are very sort of take that mechanics and
those<00:03:36.519> are<00:03:36.670> really<00:03:36.910> going<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.060> be<00:03:37.209> at<00:03:37.359> their

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
those are really going to be at their

those are really going to be at their
strongest<00:03:38.170> when<00:03:38.440> you're<00:03:38.560> in<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.799> larger<00:03:39.280> group

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
strongest when you're in a larger group

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.710 
strongest when you're in a larger group
with<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:39.700> lot<00:03:39.940> of<00:03:39.970> different<00:03:40.299> people<00:03:40.569> that<00:03:40.660> you

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
with a lot of different people that you

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.720 
with a lot of different people that you
can<00:03:40.930> interact<00:03:41.200> with<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:41.829> it<00:03:42.220> might<00:03:42.489> be<00:03:42.549> a

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
can interact with so it might be a

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.729 
can interact with so it might be a
little<00:03:43.269> bit<00:03:43.359> better<00:03:43.569> as<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.840> group<00:03:44.170> game<00:03:44.410> rather

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
little bit better as a group game rather

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.129 
little bit better as a group game rather
than<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.190> two-player<00:03:45.579> game<00:03:45.819> another<00:03:46.540> potential

weakness<00:03:47.470> of<00:03:47.590> dragons<00:03:47.980> hoard<00:03:48.190> is<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.700> little

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
weakness of dragons hoard is a little

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.509 
weakness of dragons hoard is a little
bit<00:03:49.209> more<00:03:49.480> group<00:03:49.780> specific<00:03:50.380> because<00:03:51.220> there

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
bit more group specific because there

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.550 
bit more group specific because there
are<00:03:51.609> so<00:03:51.730> many<00:03:51.760> take<00:03:52.120> that<00:03:52.299> mechanics<00:03:52.840> and

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
are so many take that mechanics and

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.370 
are so many take that mechanics and
because<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:54.670> is<00:03:54.880> a<00:03:55.180> game<00:03:55.359> that's<00:03:55.600> a<00:03:55.840> race<00:03:56.109> to

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
because it is a game that's a race to

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.530 
because it is a game that's a race to
the<00:03:56.470> most<00:03:56.680> points<00:03:57.160> you<00:03:57.700> can<00:03:57.850> get<00:03:58.030> groups<00:03:58.299> that

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
the most points you can get groups that

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.960 
the most points you can get groups that
really<00:03:58.930> like<00:03:59.109> to<00:03:59.350> gang<00:03:59.650> up<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.160> just<00:04:00.430> bash<00:04:00.700> on

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
really like to gang up and just bash on

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.699 
really like to gang up and just bash on
the<00:04:01.090> leader<00:04:01.299> as<00:04:01.600> soon<00:04:01.959> as<00:04:02.109> anybody<00:04:02.319> starts

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
the leader as soon as anybody starts

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.319 
the leader as soon as anybody starts

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
pulling a little bit ahead they get

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.360 
pulling a little bit ahead they get

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
pulled right back down that can't bog

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.979 
pulled right back down that can't bog
the<00:04:06.609> game<00:04:06.790> down<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:07.120> little<00:04:07.389> bit<00:04:07.569> in<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.810> late

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
game sometimes where it just feels like

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.000 
game sometimes where it just feels like
there's<00:04:10.420> so<00:04:10.690> much<00:04:10.840> back<00:04:11.079> and<00:04:11.109> forth<00:04:11.319> that<00:04:11.829> the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
there's so much back and forth that the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.860 
there's so much back and forth that the
game<00:04:12.160> isn't<00:04:12.609> really<00:04:12.639> progressing<00:04:13.329> forward<00:04:13.720> as
