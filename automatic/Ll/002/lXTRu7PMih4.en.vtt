00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
according to light you've got color tone

negatives<00:02:39.230> set<00:02:40.069> here<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.580> obviously<00:02:41.569> emboss

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
negatives set here and obviously emboss

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.259 
negatives set here and obviously emboss
if<00:02:43.069> you<00:02:43.190> choose<00:02:43.430> any<00:02:43.610> of<00:02:43.700> those<00:02:43.819> you'll<00:02:44.060> see

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
if you choose any of those you'll see

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.820 
if you choose any of those you'll see
that<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.480> will<00:02:44.569> change<00:02:44.840> instantly<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:45.769> you'll

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
that it will change instantly and you'll

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.339 
that it will change instantly and you'll
see<00:02:46.160> change<00:02:46.519> into<00:02:46.819> negative<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:48.170> hopefully

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
see change into negative so hopefully

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.380 
see change into negative so hopefully
you<00:02:48.560> can<00:02:48.650> see<00:02:48.799> that<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.040> video<00:02:49.299> sepia<00:02:50.299> is

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
you can see that the video sepia is

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.059 
you can see that the video sepia is
obviously<00:02:50.720> giving<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.079> that<00:02:51.170> old<00:02:51.410> style<00:02:51.769> with

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
obviously giving it that old style with

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.850 
obviously giving it that old style with
a<00:02:52.099> little<00:02:52.310> orange<00:02:52.519> look<00:02:52.880> onto<00:02:53.239> it<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.470> if

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
a little orange look onto it and and if

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.680 
a little orange look onto it and and if
we<00:02:54.980> choose<00:02:55.250> emboss<00:02:55.910> it<00:02:55.940> looks<00:02:56.360> like<00:02:56.510> something

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
we choose emboss it looks like something

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.539 
we choose emboss it looks like something
from<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.959> har<00:02:57.170> har<00:02:57.380> video<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:58.160> they're<00:02:58.310> always

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
from a har har video so they're always

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.780 
from a har har video so they're always
quite<00:02:58.910> interesting<00:02:59.769> so<00:03:00.769> jump<00:03:01.370> back<00:03:01.519> on<00:03:01.670> to

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
quite interesting so jump back on to

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.729 
quite interesting so jump back on to
normal<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.269> then<00:03:03.110> you've<00:03:03.260> got<00:03:03.290> something

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
normal and then you've got something

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.949 
normal and then you've got something
called<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.129> self<00:03:04.400> timer<00:03:04.700> so<00:03:05.150> obviously<00:03:05.780> if<00:03:05.900> you

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
called a self timer so obviously if you

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.479 
called a self timer so obviously if you
wanted<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.200> get<00:03:06.290> yourself<00:03:06.470> in<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:06.890> picture<00:03:07.220> as

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
wanted to get yourself in the picture as

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.490 
wanted to get yourself in the picture as
you'll<00:03:07.760> always<00:03:08.150> will<00:03:08.360> and<00:03:08.569> you<00:03:09.110> can<00:03:09.260> choose
