00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
a taquito um if you don't know what one

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.219 
a taquito um if you don't know what one
is<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> taquito<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
is just like a taquito but it's with the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.700 
is just like a taquito but it's with the
flour<00:01:07.909> flour<00:01:08.909> tortilla<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:10.380> kind<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
flour flour tortilla it's kind of like a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.200 
flour flour tortilla it's kind of like a
burrito<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.100> guess<00:01:11.400> because<00:01:11.580> usually<00:01:11.880> they

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
burrito I guess because usually they

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.649 
burrito I guess because usually they
they<00:01:12.689> deep-fry<00:01:12.960> them<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.090> these<00:01:15.090> aren't<00:01:15.420> deep

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
they deep-fry them and these aren't deep

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.090 
they deep-fry them and these aren't deep
fried<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.670> that's<00:01:17.670> kind<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.799> kind<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.890> weird

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
fried so that's kind of a kind of weird

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.300 
fried so that's kind of a kind of weird
most<00:01:20.939> taquitos<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.600> plots<00:01:22.200> us<00:01:22.380> flops<00:01:23.159> us

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
most taquitos and plots us flops us

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.830 
most taquitos and plots us flops us

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.759 
I care about my guacamole and then I
just<00:02:33.400> don't<00:02:33.640> want<00:02:33.790> no<00:02:33.880> brown<00:02:34.120> walk<00:02:34.650> all<00:02:35.650> right

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
just don't want no brown walk all right

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.530 
just don't want no brown walk all right
so<00:02:35.920> he<00:02:36.040> was<00:02:36.160> like<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.370> first<00:02:36.519> bite<00:02:36.850> since<00:02:37.360> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
so he was like the first bite since the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.729 
so he was like the first bite since the
first<00:02:37.780> one<00:02:37.959> was<00:02:38.110> kind<00:02:38.319> of<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:40.170> yeah<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.500> know<00:02:41.620> it

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
first one was kind of a yeah you know it

00:02:41.739 --> 00:03:05.080 
first one was kind of a yeah you know it
was<00:02:41.830> up<00:02:41.980> with<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.220> first<00:02:42.430> one

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.900 

so<00:03:06.090> it's<00:03:06.210> pretty<00:03:06.330> much<00:03:06.450> cheese<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.380> chicken

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
so it's pretty much cheese and chicken

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.140 
so it's pretty much cheese and chicken
cheese<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.090> chicken<00:03:09.210> in<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.750> tortilla<00:03:11.150> it's

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
cheese and chicken in the tortilla it's

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.480 
cheese and chicken in the tortilla it's
not<00:03:12.270> bad<00:03:12.830> it's<00:03:13.830> not<00:03:14.010> bad<00:03:14.190> at<00:03:14.370> all<00:03:16.490> something

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
not bad it's not bad at all something

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.740 
not bad it's not bad at all something
you<00:03:17.580> probably<00:03:17.760> couldn't<00:03:18.090> get<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.210> taco<00:03:18.510> bell

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
you probably couldn't get a taco bell

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.210 
you probably couldn't get a taco bell
though<00:03:18.990> or<00:03:20.060> anywhere<00:03:21.060> else<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:22.070> always<00:03:23.070> I

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
though or anywhere else I always I

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.560 
though or anywhere else I always I
always<00:03:23.340> related<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.910> talk<00:03:24.090> about<00:03:24.270> because

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
always related to talk about because

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.360 
always related to talk about because
that's<00:03:24.840> that's<00:03:25.260> basically<00:03:25.590> what<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:25.920> eat<00:03:26.160> like

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
that's that's basically what I eat like

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.050 
that's that's basically what I eat like
three<00:03:27.150> or<00:03:27.240> four<00:03:27.390> days<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.570> week<00:03:27.840> no<00:03:28.440> why<00:03:29.060> not

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
three or four days a week no why not

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:49.430 
three or four days a week no why not
healthy<00:03:30.420> but<00:03:30.450> it's<00:03:30.990> true

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.480 

so<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.100> chicken<00:03:50.430> kind<00:03:51.330> of<00:03:51.390> has<00:03:51.510> like<00:03:51.660> a

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
so the chicken kind of has like a

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.360 
so the chicken kind of has like a
normal-size<00:03:53.490> like<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.790> bacony<00:03:54.510> flavor<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:55.710> don't

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
normal-size like a bacony flavor I don't

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.710 
normal-size like a bacony flavor I don't
know<00:03:56.430> if<00:03:56.520> that's<00:03:56.670> like<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.970> charbroiled<00:03:57.540> miss

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
know if that's like the charbroiled miss

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.050 
know if that's like the charbroiled miss
that<00:03:57.930> they<00:03:58.110> probably<00:03:58.980> artificially<00:03:59.730> added

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
that they probably artificially added

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.620 
that they probably artificially added
into<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.330> chicken<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:01.740> is<00:04:01.860> nice<00:04:02.070> it's<00:04:02.430> nice<00:04:02.700> um

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
into the chicken it is nice it's nice um

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.000 
into the chicken it is nice it's nice um
I<00:04:04.310> think<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.580> would<00:04:05.700> probably<00:04:06.620> go<00:04:07.620> somewhere

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
I think I would probably go somewhere

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.700 
I think I would probably go somewhere
else<00:04:08.040> if<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.460> was<00:04:08.640> looking<00:04:08.910> for<00:04:09.120> some<00:04:09.710> blood

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
else if I was looking for some blood

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.600 
else if I was looking for some blood
tests<00:04:11.810> or<00:04:12.810> attack<00:04:13.410> you<00:04:13.590> those<00:04:13.770> it's<00:04:14.490> not

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
tests or attack you those it's not

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.640 
tests or attack you those it's not
really<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:14.910> best<00:04:15.000> thing<00:04:15.300> I<00:04:15.660> was<00:04:15.840> kind<00:04:16.049> of<00:04:16.140> had

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
really the best thing I was kind of had

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.150
