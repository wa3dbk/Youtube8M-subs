really differentiate like one Down
syndrome<00:02:04.479> person<00:02:04.750> from<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:04.990> next<00:02:05.259> you<00:02:05.740> know

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
syndrome person from the next you know

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.080 
syndrome person from the next you know
cuz<00:02:05.979> they<00:02:06.070> kind<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.340> all<00:02:06.430> look<00:02:06.549> exactly<00:02:06.850> the

all<00:02:08.950> related<00:02:09.459> to<00:02:09.610> one<00:02:09.940> another<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:11.170> one<00:02:11.500> time<00:02:11.650> I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680
