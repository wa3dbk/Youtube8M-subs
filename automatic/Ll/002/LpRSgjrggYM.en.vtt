00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.960
 August 15 for the residents of Nawashino a 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.480
 more specifically workers open 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.120
 joint stock company Oka Shipyard 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.309
 will be remembered as a big holiday this 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.550
 the day was self-propelled 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.130
 bulk vessel Volga fleet tanker 22 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.340
 deadweight of about seven thousand tons 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.220
 Project 27, the tanker is designed to 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.130
 mixed swimming area river sea i 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.960
 on transportation of crude oil and 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.390
 petroleum products he became the last of 12 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.989
 similar vessels built by Ob 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.879
 shipyards and according to the contract but for 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.610
 areas for plant is enough 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.870
 large order value 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.090
 worth over six billion 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.110
 rubles but we sects overclocked so 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.440
 this is not enough for us 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.430
 and today I would like to look into 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.950
 long run 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.770
 so that you can make plans for 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.300
 enterprise upgrades there investment 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.580
 to invest and mean in development 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.460
 enterprises, unfortunately, we work so far 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.320
 still jerky means there is a contract we 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.900
 We work no contracts and today we 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.400
 almost no contracts today 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.229
 already from the podium said that 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.600
 the new contract on 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.940
 building 20 ships is generally but 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.740
 in modern history it's decent well 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.260
 It used to be in the history of our Soviet 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.110
 when the red sormovo ended 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.350
 construction project Sormovsky means 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.150
 1557 project such a 87 ship 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.910
 can you imagine if we have today 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.960
 there was a contract for 87 ships or 100 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:37.300
 here we should certainly be launched and treats 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.150
 of course we could then talk 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.830
 there are not 80 vessels the most 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.990
 fulfill large orders by 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.360
 ship building for an enterprise 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.399
 quite capable over the past three years 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.890
 PhD sky shipyard I held 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.530
 large-scale modernization of production 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.240
 purchased a whole line of modern 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.100
 imported equipment 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.200
 thanks to which in particular 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.110
 almost tripled 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.720
 metal cutting and cutting capacity 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.940
 which means improved performance and 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.310
 as a result of the ability of the plant 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.850
 increase the pace of construction of ships 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.170
 different classes and naturally but on 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.290
 today's plan that is 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.420
 building ships but there is just 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.819
 credit opportunities they are exhausted 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.590
 but today to work out good 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.720
 programs with banks this program 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.000
 building ships for leasing it then 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.180
 when not attracted 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.730
 own funds and the shipowner here 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.680
 here is built on the money the bank surrenders to 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.080
 gum means shipowner it too 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.180
 one of the normal good laughter and i 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.640
 so I think that today in the bank already to 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.120
 this case began to turn the face 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.250
 catch up with this idea and have it 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.980
 I think many will develop 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.780
 shipowners will start will come to 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.000
 ship building we work 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.670
 Today some more contrasting such 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.370
 we were talking to medium-sized 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.540
 shipowners exactly according to the scheme 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.120
 leasing at the ceremony 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.580
 descent of the new ship attended 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.390
 enterprise management representatives 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.890
 trade union court of industrialists as well 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.739
 strategic partners in particular 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.200
 Sberbank and St. Petersburg Bank by the way 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.810
 A new tanker was built with the support of 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.239
 Sberbank and therefore the ship will 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.910
 installed a special name plate 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.790
 Well, the honor to perform the most important 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.010
 tradition when launching any vessel 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.650
 was granted to the godmother 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.150
 tanker 22 employee open 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.760
 joint stock company 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.760
 Oka shipyard deer and ganina
