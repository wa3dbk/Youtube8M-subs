00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.619 

okay<00:00:01.350> so<00:00:01.410> what<00:00:01.770> we<00:00:01.890> have<00:00:02.040> here<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:02.399> a

00:00:02.619 --> 00:00:02.629 
okay so what we have here is a

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.230 
okay so what we have here is a
instrument<00:00:03.629> cluster<00:00:04.140> from<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:05.120> mm<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.240> 150<00:00:06.870> and

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
instrument cluster from a mm of 150 and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.169 
instrument cluster from a mm of 150 and
oops<00:00:09.469> these<00:00:10.469> clusters<00:00:11.010> were<00:00:11.219> used<00:00:11.490> for<00:00:11.790> quite

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
oops these clusters were used for quite

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.230 
oops these clusters were used for quite
a<00:00:12.210> few<00:00:12.420> years<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.990> for<00:00:13.230> trucks<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
a few years and for trucks and the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.410 
a few years and for trucks and the
problem<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.680> odometer<00:00:17.240> after<00:00:18.240> it's

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
problem is that the odometer after it's

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.519 
problem is that the odometer after it's
been<00:00:19.670> running<00:00:20.670> for<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.970> while<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.960> trucks<00:00:22.260> and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
been running for a while the trucks and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.390 
been running for a while the trucks and
running<00:00:22.769> for<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> while

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
running for a while

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.400 
running for a while
pedometer<00:00:24.300> will<00:00:24.510> dim<00:00:24.720> out<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.230> sometimes

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
pedometer will dim out and sometimes

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.790 
pedometer will dim out and sometimes
just<00:00:25.830> go<00:00:25.980> out<00:00:26.130> completely<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.560> when<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.650> did

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
just go out completely and when it did

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.529 
just go out completely and when it did
here<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.189> already<00:00:29.429> took<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.119> instrument

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
here is I already took the instrument

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.709 
here is I already took the instrument
cluster<00:00:30.630> apart<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.289> can<00:00:31.439> see<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:32.390> this<00:00:33.390> here

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
cluster apart you can see that this here

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.220 
cluster apart you can see that this here
is<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.079> back<00:00:34.559> cover<00:00:34.890> for<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.540> cam<00:00:36.780> up<00:00:36.960> here

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
is the back cover for the cam up here

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.979 
is the back cover for the cam up here
take<00:00:37.980> there's<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> bunch<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.640> screws<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.300> hold

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
take there's a bunch of screws that hold

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.590 
take there's a bunch of screws that hold
that<00:00:40.140> back<00:00:40.350> cover<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.739> take<00:00:41.520> those<00:00:41.760> out<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that back cover on take those out and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.930 
that back cover on take those out and
after<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.469> carefully<00:00:44.070> pry

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
after you do that you can carefully pry

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.830 
after you do that you can carefully pry
this<00:00:45.239> back<00:00:46.460> try<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.520> circuit<00:00:48.090> board<00:00:48.329> back<00:00:48.570> you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
this back try the circuit board back you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.630 
this back try the circuit board back you
won't<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.350> disconnect<00:00:49.770> any<00:00:49.950> gauges<00:00:50.489> or

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
won't have to disconnect any gauges or

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.920 
won't have to disconnect any gauges or
anything<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:51.059> with<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> Chevy<00:00:51.600> truck

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
anything like with the Chevy truck

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.139 
anything like with the Chevy truck
because<00:00:52.199> all<00:00:52.350> these<00:00:52.500> prongs<00:00:52.860> they<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:54.000> go

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
because all these prongs they just go

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.630 
because all these prongs they just go
right<00:00:54.300> through<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.690> leads<00:00:55.219> and<00:00:56.219> once<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> get

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
right through the leads and once you get

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.209 
right through the leads and once you get
it<00:00:56.760> back<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.840> here's<00:00:58.140> your<00:00:58.320> odometer<00:00:58.620> feed

and<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.369> soldered<00:01:08.640> onto<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.420> circuit<00:01:09.810> board

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
and it's soldered onto the circuit board

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.690 
and it's soldered onto the circuit board
right<00:01:10.229> here<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.740> where<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.189> really<00:01:11.430> want<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
right here and where you really want to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.390 
right here and where you really want to

right<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> one<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.860> will

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
right here this is the one that will

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.840 
right here this is the one that will
crack<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:19.009> take<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.070> magnifying<00:01:20.340> glass

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
crack and if you take a magnifying glass

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.219 
crack and if you take a magnifying glass
I<00:01:21.210> don't<00:01:21.330> know<00:01:21.390> if<00:01:21.479> you'll<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.750> able<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.960> see<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
I don't know if you'll be able to see it

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.590 
I don't know if you'll be able to see it
here<00:01:22.320> or<00:01:22.560> not<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> crack<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.360> kind<00:01:24.570> of

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
here or not see the crack it's kind of

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.820 
here or not see the crack it's kind of
hard<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> lighting<00:01:25.259> right<00:01:25.409> when

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
hard to get the lighting right when

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.410 
hard to get the lighting right when
you're<00:01:26.009> working<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> magnifying<00:01:27.299> glass

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you're working with a magnifying glass

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.380 
you're working with a magnifying glass
but<00:01:28.250> if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.340> take<00:01:29.520> your<00:01:29.700> magnifying<00:01:30.150> glass

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
but if you take your magnifying glass

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.749 
but if you take your magnifying glass
and<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.689> look<00:01:30.869> at<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.259> solder<00:01:32.100> joint<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
and you look at that solder joint and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.609 
and you look at that solder joint and
you'll<00:01:33.000> see<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.540> right<00:01:33.810> around<00:01:34.140> where<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you'll see that right around where the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.770 
you'll see that right around where the
lead<00:01:34.860> sticks<00:01:35.640> through<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.119> circuit<00:01:36.509> board

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
lead sticks through the circuit board

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.830 
lead sticks through the circuit board
there<00:01:36.990> will<00:01:37.079> be<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> circular<00:01:38.070> crack

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
there will be like a circular crack

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.080 
there will be like a circular crack
around<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.020> solder<00:01:40.320> joint<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.310> once

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
around that solder joint and that once

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.539 
around that solder joint and that once
it'll<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.899> okay<00:01:43.200> when<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.649> cold<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.189> once<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
it'll be okay when it's cold but once it

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.130 
it'll be okay when it's cold but once it
starts<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.970> heat<00:01:45.180> up<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.479> little<00:01:45.570> bit

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
starts to heat up a little bit

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.700 
starts to heat up a little bit
the<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.430> tends<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.820> lose<00:01:48.060> contact<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.930> know<00:01:49.439> it's

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the it tends to lose contact I know it's

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.300 
the it tends to lose contact I know it's
on<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:49.950> one<00:01:50.159> too<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:52.500> solder<00:01:52.770> joint<00:01:53.130> at

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
on this one too that the solder joint at

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.429 
on this one too that the solder joint at
the<00:01:53.460> other<00:01:53.579> end<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:54.030> too<00:01:54.299> seems<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.899> be<00:01:55.140> crack

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
the other end here too seems to be crack

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.830 
the other end here too seems to be crack
just<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.890> little<00:01:56.130> bit<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.549> all<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.659> just

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
just a little bit so all you do is just

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.340 
just a little bit so all you do is just
take<00:01:58.079> your<00:01:58.110> soldering<00:01:58.649> iron<00:01:59.420> a<00:02:00.420> little<00:02:01.020> bit<00:02:01.229> of

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
take your soldering iron a little bit of

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.240 
take your soldering iron a little bit of
really<00:02:01.740> fine

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
really fine

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.800 
really fine
solder<00:02:02.729> here<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.270> oh<00:02:03.860> this<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.159> 32<00:02:06.030> 30

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
solder here like oh this is like 32 30

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.730 
solder here like oh this is like 32 30
mm<00:02:07.560> solder

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
mm solder

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.010 
mm solder
and<00:02:09.830> all<00:02:10.670> I<00:02:10.760> do<00:02:10.850> is<00:02:11.000> just<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.600> heater<00:02:11.840> up<00:02:11.990> a

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
and all I do is just a heater up a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.420 
and all I do is just a heater up a
little<00:02:12.230> bit<00:02:12.440> put<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.650> little<00:02:12.830> drop<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.220> sod

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
little bit put a little drop the sod

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.110 
little bit put a little drop the sod
around<00:02:13.760> there

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
around there

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.740 
around there
clean<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.050> up<00:02:15.140> if<00:02:15.380> you<00:02:15.650> can<00:02:15.860> or<00:02:16.040> use<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.310> little

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
clean it up if you can or use a little

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.360 
clean it up if you can or use a little
little<00:02:17.750> flux<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.350> clean<00:02:18.560> up<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.710> joint<00:02:19.130> and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
little flux to clean up that joint and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.390 
little flux to clean up that joint and
just<00:02:19.880> solder<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.360> back<00:02:20.570> together<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.400> maybe

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
just solder that back together and maybe

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.520 
just solder that back together and maybe
check<00:02:22.670> out<00:02:22.850> tests<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.600> other<00:02:23.750> one<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.140> see<00:02:24.410> any

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
check out tests the other one to see any

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.260 
check out tests the other one to see any
cracks<00:02:24.830> on<00:02:25.100> any<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.430> these<00:02:25.520> other<00:02:25.760> ones<00:02:25.910> maybe

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
cracks on any of these other ones maybe

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.360 
cracks on any of these other ones maybe
just<00:02:26.570> solder<00:02:26.810> them<00:02:27.050> up<00:02:27.200> too<00:02:27.410> but<00:02:27.590> it's<00:02:27.770> it's

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
just solder them up too but it's it's

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.010 
just solder them up too but it's it's
generally<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:29.030> one<00:02:29.180> right<00:02:29.390> at<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.570> end<00:02:29.810> here

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
generally the one right at the end here

generally the one right at the end here
that<00:02:30.080> will<00:02:30.380> break<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:31.250> starter<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:31.760> up<00:02:31.940> then

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
that will break you starter that up then

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.730 
that will break you starter that up then
your<00:02:32.720> odometer<00:02:33.590> will<00:02:34.100> work<00:02:34.310> in<00:02:34.550> just<00:02:34.940> like<00:02:35.120> new

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740

odometer dimming note or just going out
completely<00:03:07.220> till<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.580> next<00:03:07.790> time<00:03:07.940> you<00:03:08.090> start

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
completely till the next time you start

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.180 
completely till the next time you start
the<00:03:08.780> truck<00:03:09.020> cools<00:03:09.290> down<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:09.770> next<00:03:09.890> time<00:03:10.070> you

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
the truck cools down and next time you

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.810 
the truck cools down and next time you
start<00:03:10.460> it<00:03:10.520> up<00:03:10.640> again<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:11.330> again<00:03:11.870> it's<00:03:12.170> just

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
start it up again so again it's just

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.700 
start it up again so again it's just
it's<00:03:13.820> fairly<00:03:14.420> easy<00:03:14.570> to<00:03:14.900> repair<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.500> takes

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
it's fairly easy to repair it takes

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.860 
it's fairly easy to repair it takes
probably<00:03:16.100> more<00:03:16.220> time<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.520> get<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.870> instrument

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
probably more time to get the instrument

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.150 
probably more time to get the instrument
cluster<00:03:18.050> out<00:03:18.380> of<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.560> truck<00:03:18.800> because<00:03:18.920> there's

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160

leave<00:03:38.630> it<00:03:38.780> lay<00:03:38.900> there<00:03:39.080> -<00:03:39.290> you're<00:03:39.410> ready<00:03:39.560> to

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
leave it lay there - you're ready to

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.230 
leave it lay there - you're ready to
reinstall<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.280> cluster<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:40.880> it'll<00:03:41.090> slide

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
reinstall the cluster and it'll slide

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.970 
reinstall the cluster and it'll slide
right<00:03:41.390> back<00:03:41.780> in<00:03:41.990> there<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.530> don't<00:03:42.620> want<00:03:42.860> to

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
right back in there you don't want to

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.980 
right back in there you don't want to
start<00:03:43.790> yanking<00:03:44.030> on<00:03:44.300> it<00:03:44.330> because<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:44.840> can

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
start yanking on it because you can

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.420 
start yanking on it because you can
break<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.350> cable<00:03:45.710> or<00:03:45.770> you<00:03:45.890> can<00:03:46.040> break<00:03:46.250> the

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
break the cable or you can break the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.000 
break the cable or you can break the
cluster<00:03:47.270> cluster<00:03:47.420> or<00:03:47.900> more<00:03:48.500> likely<00:03:48.860> what

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
cluster cluster or more likely what

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.190 
cluster cluster or more likely what
you'll<00:03:49.040> break<00:03:49.310> is<00:03:49.520> where<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.880> PRNDL<00:03:50.690> cable<00:03:51.110> is

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
you'll break is where the PRNDL cable is

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.500 
you'll break is where the PRNDL cable is
anchored<00:03:51.560> onto<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:51.950> steering<00:03:52.220> column<00:03:52.520> so

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
anchored onto the steering column so

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.950 
anchored onto the steering column so
that's<00:03:54.380> about<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:54.620> for<00:03:55.270> this<00:03:56.270> year<00:03:56.540> I<00:03:56.810> know

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
that's about it for this year I know

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.700 
that's about it for this year I know
this<00:03:57.260> is<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.680> 2000<00:03:58.960> f150<00:03:59.960> but<00:04:00.170> you'll<00:04:00.530> find

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
this is a 2000 f150 but you'll find

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.070 
this is a 2000 f150 but you'll find
these<00:04:00.920> in<00:04:01.070> expeditions<00:04:01.820> and<00:04:02.030> I<00:04:02.390> think<00:04:02.870> all<00:04:02.990> the

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
these in expeditions and I think all the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.440 
these in expeditions and I think all the
way<00:04:03.140> up<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:03.380> like<00:04:03.590> Oh<00:04:03.770> three<00:04:04.070> or<00:04:04.220> four<00:04:04.670> heritage

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
way up to like Oh three or four heritage

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.580 
way up to like Oh three or four heritage
