and it's this uh it basically makes
infertile<00:03:01.659> seats<00:03:02.590> it's<00:03:02.859> a<00:03:02.980> plan<00:03:03.190> if<00:03:03.489> they<00:03:03.639> are

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
infertile seats it's a plan if they are

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.899 
infertile seats it's a plan if they are
the<00:03:04.269> plans<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.690> have<00:03:04.720> this<00:03:05.370> can't<00:03:06.370> reproduce

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
the plans that have this can't reproduce

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.030 
the plans that have this can't reproduce
so<00:03:07.780> which<00:03:07.989> is<00:03:08.109> fantastic<00:03:08.260> you're<00:03:08.769> asking

let's say your farmer if you have your
own<00:03:16.299> stuff<00:03:16.810> obviously<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.470> don't<00:03:17.620> have<00:03:17.709> to

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
own stuff obviously you don't have to

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.189 
own stuff obviously you don't have to
buy<00:03:17.980> seats<00:03:18.310> cuz<00:03:18.699> your<00:03:19.150> product<00:03:19.810> gives<00:03:20.049> you

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:20.199 
buy seats cuz your product gives you

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.309 
buy seats cuz your product gives you
seats<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.829> replant<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.400> stuff<00:03:22.109> but<00:03:23.109> guess

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
seats you replant that stuff but guess

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.039 
seats you replant that stuff but guess
what<00:03:23.530> if<00:03:23.889> this<00:03:24.310> crap<00:03:24.910> which<00:03:25.329> supposedly<00:03:25.930> is

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
what if this crap which supposedly is
