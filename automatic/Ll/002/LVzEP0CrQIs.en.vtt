00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.010
 when we do not do it properly it's very 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.010
 impressive 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:20.090
 otherwise it's very scary and it's for 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.470
 that you always have to wear a harness 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.660
 when you walk on an object and 3 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.339
 your balance depends on a principle 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.339
 absolutely fundamental scientist 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.510
 your weight that applies from your 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.640
 center of gravity must be at the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.190
 vertical point of contact between your 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.860
 feet and rope 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.539
 otherwise a rotation will take place dismissed your 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.520
 arm in order to better distribute the whole 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.579
 of your mass it will be easier to do 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.680
 do not switch if you lose the balanced 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.870
 and that the rope is a little loose 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.870
 you can try to bring it back just 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.370
 below you but once 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.809
 your center of mass has moved to 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.910
 outside your surface of 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.690
 sustenance it is very difficult to 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.040
 return to this central position before 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.780
 to engage in experiments 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.549
 breakneck 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.659
 I suggest you start not too much 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.689
 far from the ground there is hardly 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.890
 do not forget do not forget you can 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.280
 try to find the position 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.280
 power plant 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.140
 not only the agreement is not allowed 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.360
 make 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.640
 but in addition she takes revenge this bar 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.510
 is located a little higher but she is 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.130
 also wider 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:39.229
 so it's easier to keep his 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.250
 balance but I think he regrets 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.250
 for choosing a metal bar 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.740
 the bar is rather wide but do you have 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.530
 well aware that when it's frozen it 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:56.119
 slips I'm surprised he went 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.250
 as far as further height is 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:04.149
 but our tester considers that he did 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.149
 no need harness too bad for him 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.340
 he used his arms for better 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.080
 control his balance but as soon as his 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.150
 center of mass deviates from the surface 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.610
 lift is the fall 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.900
 there we go to serious things very 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.959
 good use of the arms for 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.280
 control the position of the center of mass 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:28.680
 here is finally someone who knows what he 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:31.220
 done except when it comes down to 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.220
 rope
