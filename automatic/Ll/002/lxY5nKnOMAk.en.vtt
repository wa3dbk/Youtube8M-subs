00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.960

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.670
 here we are in a new commented video 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.620
 in this video we are going to see a bit of 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.410
 comparisons of the new generations 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.839
 new consoles that just 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.480
 present in this year and all that in the 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.360
 which are which are playstation 4 and 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.760
 the xbox one and good yesterday was 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.730
 presented the console of microsoft xbox 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.820
 one and some time ago on February 20 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.370
 was presented the playstation 4 by 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.040
 part of the sony company and good since 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.500
 about 7 years that they did not know 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.720
 that they had not taken out a new console 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.079
 because after just 7 years 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.670
 present these new consoles and good 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.530
 now let's see the comparisons 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.630
 later on right here they are watching 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.950
 some images and good now we follow 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.510
 with the comparison of consoles 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.190
 here we are at the controls first 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.170
 that nothing we will see the control of the xbox 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.640
 one here is the control on the screen 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.200
 exclusion control and up to here in 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.520
 screen in case they want to see a 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.200
 little difference now I myself 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.989
 I am going to say what is special about 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.610
 what has new and all that we are going to 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.490
 see now also the comparison of 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.900
 xbox 360 with the xbox one what the 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.270
 control and all that 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.910
 here as you can see the sticks the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.860
 sticks are much more comfortable in the 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.320
 xbox one and all that also has a 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.390
 very very good design and there are occasions in 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.880
 what some people including me 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.040
 me when we're playing call of duty 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.500
 for example I go or play that then 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.630
 I'm going to give you an example, I'll select 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.180
 I put select and just to review 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.790
 to obviously check my skills and my 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.250
 dead and then at the moment that you 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.770
 I put it reads that I'm good pressed him 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.530
 a little bit bad or a little more salty and you 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.170
 I put the middle button then it's 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.570
 much more comfortable and better that is the 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.060
 button in the middle of the xbox button 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.800
 central button of the control that now 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.420
 in the xbox one this one 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.460
 the top part the top 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.620
 because for the reason that I am 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.110
 saying that there are times when in the 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.540
 Well, we do not realize it or because 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.730
 Error will chop the middle button and no 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.440
 the correct button for example will be like 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.480
 start that are closest to the button 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.580
 in the middle and then at the moment of 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.260
 press this because maybe they kill us or 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.840
 something like that then it 's much better in the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.280
 top part also the button 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.380
 select and the back and the start sorry 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.300
 they already tell us they already tell us in the part in 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.700
 the led control of the xbox one no longer say 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.090
 nothing do not have anything written for example 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.550
 on the 360 the button on the left to be 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.340
 closest to the button in the middle of the 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.140
 left side because it said back the one of the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.810
 right part said start and in the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.940
 new control the control of the xbox one no 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.190
 says nothing there are only icons that 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.810
 in network did not reach them to see so 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.460
 when they return to show the control and 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.900
 in a small sum the buttons it knows 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.760
 what is each one called so nothing is 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.650
 Ex control information 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.520
 software and now we move to the control of 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.520
 Playstation 4 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.569
 playstation 4 and good that has 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.040
 difference this good control first 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.900
 that nothing exists control so that what 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.430
 see a little bit and all that we are going to see 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.739
 the difference of the comparisons of the 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.959
 playstation 3 the control of the play are 3 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.010
 with playstation 4 control and good 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.540
 this one does have a little bit more 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.019
 difference that comparison of control 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.950
 of the xbox one against the xbox 360 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.079
 this one does have a little bit more 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.760
 difference first of all in controlling 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.189
 the play station 3 had the two buttons 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.659
 main that was salegi star and the 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.719
 middle button that is also main 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:30.450
 and good that is the home but the 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.739
 main you could say that's him 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.150
 it's okay to read that they have always 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.819
 existed in the controls of the play 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.829
 station and good is the start the select in 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.629
 the control of playstation 4 does not 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.659
 existing in the playstation control 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.790
 4 there are only options and options and 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.199
 share share button serves 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.900
 obviously to share the video 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:51.239
 gameplay your friends through the 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.819
 internet and to pages like youtube and 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.139
 facebook at times I do not know if those two 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.449
 they are the only pages that you are going to 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.519
 to share the video with your gameplay 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.959
 through that button but if there's more 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.340
 programs over time 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.349
 I'll say it 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.060
 the cameras that differ from the 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.129
 Playstation 3 cameras with camera 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.660
 of playstation 4 good as the camera 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.480
 of the play are 3 does not record on high 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.000
 definition or in hd and the camera of the play 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.220
 are 4 then I was going to record hd right now they are 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.560
 watching the camera on screen here are 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.750
 I'm putting several images and it 's 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.520
 the official camera of the play are four 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.050
 this camera from the play are webs 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.220
 treatment until now I 'm going to 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.610
 show the one from the xbox one 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.830
 the camera of the xbox one the camera here 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.110
 here is on screen as you can see 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.910
 It has a very nice design very nice to 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.490
 I liked it too much it has gratings 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.200
 ventilation also has the logo 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.650
 that was what caught my attention 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.420
 a little more has logo and all that 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.150
 also because this camera records in hd in 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.800
 1080 pixels that is what I know and good 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.890
 well also this what is going to be 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.450
 operate the graf system in snap that 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.590
 is what I told you yesterday 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.140
 If you want to go see the video 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.020
 serious in snap there I tell them their 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.820
 functions something good is play session 4 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.040
 It is that you are going to be compatible with the 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.480
 piecita system is to say what you see the 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.340
 what is vital is what you will be able to see in your 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.190
 large television in the same way 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.780
 also something that is special about the 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.640
 play are four is that everything 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.800

 without the need for a capture 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.270
 but playstation 4 is not the only one with 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.699

 exit date of the former software so 

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.800
