00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
come out and do a free estimate we send

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.450 
come out and do a free estimate we send
one<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.020> our<00:01:07.080> estimators<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.770> what<00:01:08.340> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
one of our estimators out what that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.770 
one of our estimators out what that
estimator<00:01:08.850> ado<00:01:09.090> we'll<00:01:09.299> go<00:01:09.420> through<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
estimator ado we'll go through with the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.750 
estimator ado we'll go through with the
customer<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.439> walk<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.159> job<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.549> them<00:01:11.640> and

customer and walk the job with them and
find<00:01:11.939> out<00:01:12.090> exactly<00:01:12.240> what<00:01:12.750> their<00:01:12.930> needs<00:01:13.110> are

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.200 
find out exactly what their needs are
and<00:01:13.799> then<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.130> do<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.430> estimate<00:01:14.790> right<00:01:15.060> on

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
and then we do that estimate right on

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.359 
and then we do that estimate right on
the<00:01:15.330> spot<00:01:15.450> good<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.560> put<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.130> into<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the spot good and we put it into a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.609 
the spot good and we put it into a
computer<00:01:17.670> form<00:01:18.030> estimate<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.409> will

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
computer form estimate and we will

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.260 
computer form estimate and we will
answer<00:01:19.830> all<00:01:20.009> their<00:01:20.400> questions<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:21.150> them

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
answer all their questions for them

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.880 
answer all their questions for them
right<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> spot<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.930> leave<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> estimate

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
right on the spot and leave the estimate

job again with the homeowner to go
through<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> contract<00:02:00.719> make<00:02:01.140> sure

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
through the contract make sure

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.289 
through the contract make sure
everybody's<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.979> same<00:02:02.009> page<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.909> then

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
everybody's on the same page and then

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.880 
everybody's on the same page and then
they<00:02:03.450> begin<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.869> painting<00:02:04.200> process<00:02:04.350> from

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
they begin the painting process from

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.289 
they begin the painting process from
there<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.520> guess<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.850> painting<00:02:06.149> process

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
there and I guess the painting process

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.819 
there and I guess the painting process
starts<00:02:06.840> with<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.020> little<00:02:07.170> surface<00:02:07.530> preparation

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
starts with a little surface preparation

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.979 
starts with a little surface preparation

redwood sherwin-williams and those are

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.979

the color accents as well as sable tell

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.900 
the color accents as well as sable tell
me<00:04:20.109> a<00:04:20.140> little<00:04:20.200> bit<00:04:20.560> about<00:04:20.859> mixing<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.730> colors

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
me a little bit about mixing the colors

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.670 
me a little bit about mixing the colors
first<00:04:22.540> of<00:04:22.690> all<00:04:22.720> you<00:04:22.780> have<00:04:23.050> to<00:04:23.200> use<00:04:23.350> glaze

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
first of all you have to use glaze

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.290 
first of all you have to use glaze
because<00:04:24.190> glaze<00:04:24.520> gives<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:25.000> train

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
because glaze gives the train

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.360 
because glaze gives the train
perrin<00:04:25.629> see<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:26.319> the<00:04:26.409> base<00:04:26.590> coat<00:04:26.919> and<00:04:27.220> that

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
perrin see to the base coat and that

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.189 
perrin see to the base coat and that
gives<00:04:27.729> you<00:04:27.909> that<00:04:28.060> textured<00:04:28.569> finish<00:04:28.780> the

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
gives you that textured finish the

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.950 
gives you that textured finish the
visual<00:04:29.620> texture<00:04:29.979> and<00:04:30.280> you<00:04:30.819> mix<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.150> glaze<00:04:31.419> for

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
visual texture and you mix the glaze for

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.020 
visual texture and you mix the glaze for
parts<00:04:32.289> glaze<00:04:32.500> with<00:04:32.800> one<00:04:33.009> part<00:04:33.250> paint<00:04:33.520> I<00:04:33.849> use

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
parts glaze with one part paint I use

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.499 
parts glaze with one part paint I use
acrylic<00:04:34.599> latex<00:04:35.259> paints<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:37.060> just<00:04:37.330> mix

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
acrylic latex paints and you just mix

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:38.760 
acrylic latex paints and you just mix

little easier for you you did a little

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.640 
little easier for you you did a little
preparation<00:04:49.449> work<00:04:49.870> maybe<00:04:50.110> tell<00:04:50.440> us<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.560> little

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
preparation work maybe tell us a little

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.350 
preparation work maybe tell us a little
bit<00:04:50.770> about<00:04:50.979> that<00:04:51.159> yeah<00:04:51.490> so<00:04:51.639> he<00:04:51.789> is<00:04:51.879> a<00:04:51.909> two-inch

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
bit about that yeah so he is a two-inch

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.360 
bit about that yeah so he is a two-inch
tape<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.379> gives<00:04:53.530> a<00:04:53.680> nice<00:04:53.830> barrier

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
tape and that gives a nice barrier

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.369 
tape and that gives a nice barrier
against<00:04:55.090> your<00:04:55.210> adjacent<00:04:55.659> walls<00:04:55.840> that<00:04:56.199> you're

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:56.379 
against your adjacent walls that you're

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.260 
against your adjacent walls that you're
not<00:04:56.530> getting<00:04:57.159> the<00:04:57.250> glaze<00:04:57.430> on<00:04:57.699> everything<00:04:58.090> else

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
not getting the glaze on everything else

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.700 
not getting the glaze on everything else
all<00:04:58.509> right<00:04:58.690> our<00:04:58.840> ladder<00:04:59.050> set<00:04:59.379> up<00:04:59.500> in<00:04:59.620> the

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
all right our ladder set up in the

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.409 
all right our ladder set up in the
corner<00:05:00.009> so<00:05:00.219> I'm<00:05:00.340> assuming<00:05:00.580> we're<00:05:01.060> starting

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
corner so I'm assuming we're starting

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.629 
corner so I'm assuming we're starting
even<00:05:01.509> we<00:05:01.780> are<00:05:02.050> starting<00:05:02.469> in<00:05:02.949> the<00:05:02.979> corner<00:05:03.490> I

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
even we are starting in the corner I

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.850 
even we are starting in the corner I
like<00:05:03.789> to<00:05:03.909> begin<00:05:04.060> in<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.330> corners<00:05:04.780> because<00:05:05.080> it

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
like to begin in the corners because it

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.309 
like to begin in the corners because it
gives<00:05:06.009> a<00:05:06.159> nice<00:05:06.340> flow<00:05:06.969> there<00:05:07.389> to<00:05:07.840> keep<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.139> wet

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:08.319 
gives a nice flow there to keep a wet

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.439 
gives a nice flow there to keep a wet
edge<00:05:08.530> and<00:05:08.979> I'm<00:05:09.699> just<00:05:09.879> putting<00:05:10.030> a<00:05:10.150> little<00:05:10.180> bit

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
edge and I'm just putting a little bit

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:12.890 
edge and I'm just putting a little bit
of<00:05:10.539> glaze<00:05:10.810> on<00:05:11.169> this<00:05:11.500> four<00:05:11.800> inch<00:05:11.949> nylon<00:05:12.250> brush

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
of glaze on this four inch nylon brush

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.740 
of glaze on this four inch nylon brush
and<00:05:13.900> kind<00:05:14.110> of<00:05:14.319> scattering<00:05:15.009> it<00:05:15.250> around<00:05:15.599> so<00:05:16.599> this

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
and kind of scattering it around so this

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.390 
and kind of scattering it around so this
is<00:05:16.930> very<00:05:17.110> cool<00:05:17.379> we're<00:05:17.620> just<00:05:17.830> putting<00:05:18.069> on<00:05:18.340> the

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
is very cool we're just putting on the

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.459 
is very cool we're just putting on the
two<00:05:18.759> different<00:05:19.060> colors<00:05:19.419> of<00:05:19.449> paint<00:05:19.870> correct

two different colors of paint correct
absolutely<00:05:21.280> I'm<00:05:21.550> a<00:05:21.580> little<00:05:21.669> nervous<00:05:21.909> about

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.659 
what about the dry you know you can't
have<00:05:25.659> these<00:05:25.780> things<00:05:26.020> dry<00:05:26.259> out<00:05:26.289> yeah<00:05:26.889> the<00:05:27.460> glaze

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
have these things dry out yeah the glaze

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.149 
have these things dry out yeah the glaze
creates<00:05:28.210> a<00:05:28.300> nice<00:05:28.419> open<00:05:28.780> time<00:05:29.229> you<00:05:29.710> can<00:05:29.860> start
