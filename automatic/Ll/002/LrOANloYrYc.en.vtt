00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
this upgrading a row of walls is great

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.700 
this upgrading a row of walls is great
because<00:00:33.450> when<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.840> hit<00:00:33.989> higher<00:00:34.170> Town<00:00:34.500> Hall

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
because when you hit higher Town Hall

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.160 
because when you hit higher Town Hall
levels<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.520> get<00:00:35.700> 25<00:00:36.210> or<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.570> more<00:00:36.930> wall

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
levels and you get 25 or so more wall

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990 
levels and you get 25 or so more wall
pieces<00:00:37.440> at<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> time<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.820> more

why<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.479> prioritize<00:01:00.929> gold<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.829> my<00:01:01.979> rates<00:01:02.249> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
why I prioritize gold in my rates and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.340 
why I prioritize gold in my rates and
then<00:01:02.999> when<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> maxed<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.629> my<00:01:03.749> troops<00:01:04.019> there

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
then when I maxed out my troops there

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.050 
then when I maxed out my troops there
basically<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.979> nothing<00:01:05.370> left<00:01:05.550> for<00:01:05.700> me<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.850> do

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
basically be nothing left for me to do

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.750 
basically be nothing left for me to do

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
with my elixir now however when I raid I

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.580 
with my elixir now however when I raid I
will<00:01:09.060> try<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.330> find<00:01:09.600> bases<00:01:09.960> with<00:01:10.140> both<00:01:10.290> high

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
will try to find bases with both high

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.520 
will try to find bases with both high

there's<00:01:13.770> more<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.190> than<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
there's more to it than that now from a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.940 
there's more to it than that now from a
defensive<00:01:15.630> perspective<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.620> usually

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
defensive perspective I usually

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.190 
defensive perspective I usually
protected<00:01:17.400> gold<00:01:17.970> storages<00:01:18.420> more<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.170> now

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
protected gold storages more but now

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.470 
protected gold storages more but now
effective<00:01:19.980> base<00:01:20.190> designs<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:20.940> be<00:01:21.090> ones<00:01:21.360> that

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
effective base designs will be ones that

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.780 
effective base designs will be ones that
protect<00:01:21.960> gold<00:01:22.260> and<00:01:22.500> elixir<00:01:22.620> equally<00:01:23.370> so

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
protect gold and elixir equally so

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.700 
protect gold and elixir equally so
definitely<00:01:24.000> keep<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.570> mind<00:01:24.900> elixir

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
definitely keep that in mind elixir

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.290 
definitely keep that in mind elixir
might<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.340> become<00:01:26.520> more<00:01:27.090> valuable

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
might have just become more valuable

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.180 
might have just become more valuable
than<00:01:27.720> gold<00:01:27.780> because<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.470> more<00:01:28.710> versatile

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
than gold because it's more versatile

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.160 
than gold because it's more versatile
now<00:01:29.370> it<00:01:29.730> can<00:01:29.940> basically<00:01:30.120> trained<00:01:30.600> troops<00:01:30.900> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
now it can basically trained troops and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.890 
now it can basically trained troops and
upgrade<00:01:31.770> walls<00:01:31.980> at<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> same<00:01:32.550> time<00:01:32.900> lastly

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
upgrade walls at the same time lastly

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.780 
upgrade walls at the same time lastly
there<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.260> form<00:01:34.590> sneak<00:01:34.920> peek<00:01:35.190> where<00:01:35.400> replays

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
there is a form sneak peek where replays

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.760 
there is a form sneak peek where replays
and<00:01:36.000> library<00:01:36.390> plays<00:01:36.600> now<00:01:36.870> show<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.290> attackers

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
and library plays now show the attackers

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
and library plays now show the attackers
available<00:01:38.370> troops<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.360> see<00:01:39.480> exactly

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
available troops so you can see exactly

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.720 
available troops so you can see exactly
what<00:01:40.230> does<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.680> doesn't<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.160> deployed<00:01:41.460> and

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
what does and doesn't get deployed and

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.640 
what does and doesn't get deployed and
when<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.720> also<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.170> cool<00:01:43.470> because

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
when this is also really cool because

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.140 
when this is also really cool because
you<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:43.920> see<00:01:44.250> an<00:01:44.340> attackers<00:01:44.820> army

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
you can see an attackers army

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.120 
you can see an attackers army
composition<00:01:45.420> live<00:01:45.930> before<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.800> end<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.010> the
