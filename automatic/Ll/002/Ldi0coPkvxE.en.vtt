00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.910
 what will happen from july is next again 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.520
 like and welcome to one 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.980
 minutes faq again on my channel 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.279
 Guys I actually wanted an unboxing 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.540
 make and this controller here 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.580
 closer to the scaf controller 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.980
 where I ordered optics force 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.210
 but I have it planned his colleague 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.170
 I was so I wanted the thing 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.199
 unpack quickly 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.930
 I think I'll get a question first 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.930
 why would you youtuber and because of whom 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.260
 Of course, my friends are very clear 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.839
 and because of little to answer then 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.680
 I think there is george washington 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.760
 this opinion that also less caches 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.489
 Of course it was just fun 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.409
 ok now comes to the next question 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.350
 you dogs like this event or like 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.119
 you do not see dogs because yes no 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.070
 I had a dog myself at the time 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.840
 and that's why I do not care about me 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.909
 love for 100 finds, despite being as 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.740
 Quiet with cat had it difficult 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.270
 but as I said, I think of myself 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.520
 About crass you were in school 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.799
 bullied or what you bullied one of 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.509
 I 've got I got off course too 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.740
 People made that I'm not like that 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.229
 type that can be done 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.060
 and yes no idea so I'm holding 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.560
 made some but in hindsight was 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.570
 that's over shit and so I have too 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.880
 get bad once because always 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.439
 bullied five people and so I have a 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.539
 I'm not very proud of it 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.979
 if you look straight now somehow 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.630
 and communities the other people in the morning 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.939
 You stop that because the person 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.619
 does not feel awesome with it 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.450
 every case about katherine did that 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.429
 tat is also far below and grid 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.689
 smells times if you like other people murder 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.460
 because they feel like shit and stuff 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.429
 Of course you want authority over you 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.469
 did bring with it but that's 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.780
 end not so because in hindsight 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.520
 they are always the best because they too 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.679
 later better jobs and stuff 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.920
 you get too much on something 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.140
 does not stiffen her that much because 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.240
 you just want to attack what would be a 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.340
 reason for you to stop using youtube 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.680
 So who would have a reason here , of course 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.870
 eg none 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.750
 if something family about crass 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.400
 somebody dies or not 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.299
 Anyhow somehow one becomes ill and over 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.650
 and so on 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.599
 I would definitely go first 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.159
 to stop for a while until he 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.450
 health is better again 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.219
 but then i would definitely 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.569
 have to carry on fun yet the 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.459
 people to entertain I have 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.030
 a thousand spectators approximately 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:40.379
 without fun you guys i like you the and 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.969
 That's why I like it too 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.459
 your parents and friends before yours 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.500
 youtube career actually no 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.209
 I've already told my story about it 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.540
 but she asks a video from time to time 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.470
 The team saw a video 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.480
 no idea why 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.260
 and yes my sister asks from time to time 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.969
 after and yes no friends the fingers 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.340
 she says stop her right now 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:07.109
 actually great when subscribers 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.500
 already one of the middle fishes I say 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.689
 times 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.079
 because you have to have a certain 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:15.299
 potential should I even so what on 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.549
 every case with the faq video and without 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.949
 fun wanted because the video has driven 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.169
 load easier and describe all in 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.449
 the comments 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:26.909
 a question i want to ask so many 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:29.760
 do not care writing is creative 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.930
 write in the comments for questions 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.120
 the next just cool video 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.120
 I 'm looking forward to it
