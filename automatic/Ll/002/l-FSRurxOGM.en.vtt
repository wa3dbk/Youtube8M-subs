00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.540
 with the intention of coming the females of the scouts the day of pampering 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:11.329
 don't forget that 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:15.599
 I am a full professional trainer but most of the people who work for us yes they are after 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.109
 the party 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.180
 and that outside network that is very much 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.130
 yes like you actually 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.489
 for our football club 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.489
 and those people are hardly home or not at all 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.399
 in the street that she is usually bringing together this weekend with one of them 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.059
 milligen that is also the prelude to us 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.680
 watch matches 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.970
 scouting analyzes make players discover 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.890
 be it red zebra so that means that the females in a fan are too little or too 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.120
 not 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.250
 And this is actually a kind of teambuilding evening for the ladies that she is 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.700
 yes that once pampered is good food here in this country 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.090
 between 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.250
 the people here 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.820
 just as good for us 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.090
 delicious to eat and the ladies are appreciated 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.530
 and then it's really about 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.880
 the intention is that we really look forward to each other's intentions 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.200
 the sun 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.869
 we can follow the intimate being to each other blindly 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.550
 and after it 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.250
 well 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.640
 trainer actually finds that super important 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.720
 the quality must be delivered delivered 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.720
 and when it is delivered, it is important that we 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.310
 currently able to pull to the 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.250
 jokingly this term states of course that everyone knows them 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.070
 it's lexa.nl your pieter, the typical trainer 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 the less visible part of the technical staff it suggests 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.570
 few people know how many people there 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.689
 how long have been spent with 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.990
 That is true a lot, we spend a lot of time after 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.460
 yes we are new spin off 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.830
 this time per match 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.740
 but 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.740
 I like working perfectly temporary behind the scenes 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.460
 well that is appreciated by the trainers staff 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.520
 that is important to me actually 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.060
 with this device becomes the sentiment 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.060
 With three people they have two bushes for video analysis 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.829
 and one still won the game afterwards, it didn't leave anything 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.959
 so everyone knew opponent waiting the three times viewed 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.959
 so with or without the training at 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.959
 the team with the players viewed the most 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.489
 afterthought for considerations 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.019
 how is that we are realistic 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:26.959
 with that falls 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.989
 In that, the adjustment is somewhat more common to something that you are in 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.919
 country lake 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.919
 8 you also do not take over 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.699
 sam catchy belgium ep because soon extinguished 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:41.449
 and not to say 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.790
 the artist that it doesn't take that closely 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.149
 the oldest son 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:48.910
 the meaning of their claim and the animals is unfortunately no longer up to date 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.159
 and as the barber the clio 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.080
 and here, however, rather than Rome, the race of all those young ones 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.609
 the plant 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.039
 and voila you those who are here who are invited and tasty food 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.289
 a nice drink 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:03.929
 in the drawer 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:07.669
 I understand that the one is all number of athletes, of course 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.989
 harting that 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.919
 supporters of course the importance of a 10 in the field always very important 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.889
 but a tenth like the field is a very important one and then you were sitting 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:18.369
 also 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:20.019
 past match 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.230
 that total emissions 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.700
 pommer duc scores with a hard band in four with the campsite with the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.269
 supposed to be political 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.319
 yes in addition to that would put the newspaper there I will still have a little money there 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.549
 three men 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.180
 I sometimes go to the masses of men enormously 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.449
 trust 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:40.089
 And yes, that is also very important that you do something against poles 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:45.309
 but again what is very important in a family club like us that everyone 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:46.499
 very important 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:50.229
 We have now seen that we have been doing very well with ours since a few weeks 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.399
 ball boys 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:54.369
 stand up for the competition in the dressing room aso ordinary book us in the 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:56.879
 join the dressing room with the first team 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.989
 yes he gives the day gives a lot of warmth gives my skin back appreciation 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.749
 and for us, of course, because we are also very important and 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.499
 when we win 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:11.889
 yes with a little bit of rmd tossing up at times where losing should pretty much 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.899
 yes do a little report 

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:16.829
 and that and that is together with the scouts 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.249
 very important for us to analyze his matches 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:23.439
 after the trainers when it would also go a lot pieter jan and me 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.389
 Men need the help of that man too 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.840
 find you here and me 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.279
 They are very important in this 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.039
 we see that again this season there is a very professional heading top favorite 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:36.860
 divestments 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.800
 we pretend analysis 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.990
 Well do the analysis on video 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.449
 Rhine values ​​ores 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.409
 she was a very good moment like a day 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:51.069
 being able to prove in the f3 that it wasn't really that good at times 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:52.080
 that it 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.480
 well that there are still a lot of work points that still have a lot of marks 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:57.960
 and 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.509
 it must not have room to improve 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.409
 we also analyze the opponents very well on video on paper 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.960
 only the fish is always better, which gives a greater impact 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.599
 there then the words you think and 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.710
 to see his own failure on the things that are good analysts analyze 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:21.060
 the Lachapelle state must all be in the right direction, so it must be 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:22.620
 of course also an investment 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.830
 because that is the computer program that still costs a little money 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.130
 and the people who get out of jari offer also cost a little bit of money 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.930
 of course some expense reports 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.219
 we are for that matter 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:37.159
 at the showers by antwerp football club 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:40.080
 together a seriously good road will hit you 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.319
 never before has it been a very tasty this and good luck
