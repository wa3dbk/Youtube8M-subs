00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.620
 How are you all, welcome back to my lab, where safety is the number one priority 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:17.520
 Today I have this sparkling drink here, the soda water drink, as you know, is a very sweet and delicious gaseous drink 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.040
 As you know, especially when you are a little boy, you love one of these types, do not you? 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:30.620
 But, to try to figure out the amount of sugar actually found in this thing, it is said to contain 55 grams of sugar, as you know, or nearly 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.280
 But how much is it actually, how much is there? Is it a large amount? Or is not it? 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.820
 Why do not we boil this thing and see what will happen 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.980
 Because when you boil water, nothing stays after boiling and evaporating 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.300
 But if you still have enough sugar, we can actually see how much sugar you have left in one of these 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.800
 Well let's do this! 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.560
 We'll open one of these 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.280
 Oh no, I should not have 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.540
 but it's okay 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.780
 Then ... we carry it and set it in it 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.300
 Only one of them, and we will boil until it evaporates 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.860
 Then we see what happens 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.340
 As you notice it started boiling, ....... we will wait until it completely evaporates 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.220
 So we must wait for a period of time 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.440
 It evaporates slowly, hoping to evaporate soon 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.200
 As you can see, it is nearing the end 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.200
 Destiny became very dirty 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.340
 But, we will know when ... ... fully evaporates 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.220
 If, this amount of sugar remaining from one small bottle of soda drink 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.660
 Do you understand my intention? 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.500
 This is crazy, look how many ..... Look at how black it is 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.120
 It must be sugar 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.040
 With the rest of the chemicals and other things 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.200
 But...... 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.900
 Each time you drink a small amount of soft drinks 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.800
 In fact you eat all that sugar and all things whatever inside 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.380
 Well, I lifted it up and put it away from the fire, and look at all these things 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.020
 This sugar coherent, look at this 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.980
 It's burned, but that's a lot of waste! 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.280
 It's only one gas canister, imagine this 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.660
 If the next time you want to drink gaseous water, remember this video 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.140
 And, you know, this is the amount of sugar and all the other things you drink already 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.760
 Each time you drink a small bottle of one such a soft water 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.620
 However, imagine if you drink a 2 liter bottle 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.980
 Well, why imagine? 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.120
 Let's just boil one and know how much waste there is 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.080
 Well, each bottle contains 500 milliliters 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.620
 So, two of them give 1000 milliliters and 1,000 milliliters equals 1 liter 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.420
 And so, if we have four of these we will have 2 liters 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.560
 As you notice this is full 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.980
 Now we will wait until it completely evaporates, and see how much sugar we have left 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.500
 Well, as you can see, a large part of it has evaporated 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.040
 We still have to wait another 10-20 minutes and then see what happens 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.440
 Well, we'll move it, and as you can see, it boils strangely, because it's very thick 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.140
 Well, ..... we'll give it more time, ....... until it becomes darker in color 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.420
 Do you see how much smoke you smoke from burning sugar? Do you see how much sugar you have? 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.260
 Oh no, I seem to have overdone it 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.200
 Oh 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.340
 But 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.580
 As you know, that's why you have to be careful 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.980
 This is what happens when we cook sugar over and over 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.520
 Look at how much the amount of waste in it, and how much is the amount of sugar in it 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.340
 Is not this crazy? ... Of course, it is sugar burned 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:16.200
 Well, this is the amount of sugar that remained from the soda water drink, 2 liters of soda water, soda syrup 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.760
 Including a good amount of sugar 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.840
 If you boil them, you can see how much sugar will burn 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.240
 This is a lot of quantity, if you drink them 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.800
 This quantity every day, 2 liters 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.480
 This is very bad for you 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.400
 Well, it's a good experience 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.020
 If, you will definitely know next time 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.660
 How much sugar you will drink 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.440
 If, the decision is yours 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.220
 If you do not care and drink it, drink or do not drink because it is more healthy 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.920
 Well guys, that was all
