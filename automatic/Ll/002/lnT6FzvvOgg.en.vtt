00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Good day to all my name is 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.960
 Pavel and today we have the first 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.580
 intro video on our channel 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.330
 which is dedicated to mini programming 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.360
 games in this video, I will tell you how we 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.000
 what shall we do as everything will be 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.850
 happen how to take part in our 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.850
 project and what is it actually made for 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.550
 the main point is that we 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.090
 we will write some small game 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.010
 which you personally think up every 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.100
 absolutely everyone can take part 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.320
 by visiting our website and clicking share 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.390
 the idea 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.390
 fill in the form 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.809
 so small that is the form of sending 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.230
 to send a letter 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:54.170
 I model every idea I post on 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:58.559
 site and you can vote for them 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:02.460
 Now ideas are needed in common, that is about what 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.400
 the game will be in general I will take the dignity good 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.810
 I will hang them and that idea that are gaining 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.060
 most votes 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.689
 it will be implemented 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.380
 then again you will share your 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.140
 ideas but more subtle that is not about 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.700
 what the game is about as a whole and what is already 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.670
 specifically there will be some characters 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.289
 there will be what we will specifically do there 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.570
 what will be features 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.170
 how will it be different from the other 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.700
 similar games and so on so on 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.119
 the project is designed to be possible 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.929
 someone to help someone to entertain 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.200
 if someone is already addicted 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:44.069
 programming then i think every 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.009
 everyone who starts he is interested 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:50.009
 games of some degree in small and 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.289
 big but interested hope that 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.950
 data videos that will 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:58.200
 publish on youtube and on the site and they 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.310
 will help to somehow navigate somewhere 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.370
 maybe help 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.170
 by some sort of algorithm or 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.480
 maybe someone will also want to write on 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.130
 the platform on which I will show 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.370
 I 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.440
 but those who just want to have fun I 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.150
 I think it will also be interesting how everyone 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.790
 the game starts from the very beginning to 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.000
 the very end yes and I think everyone wants 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.440
 share an idea and how is it possible 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.350
 affect the project I will write 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.190
 main key moments of the creation of the game 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.910
 these are some algorithms 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.310
 brain teaser 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.520
 thinking about how to do 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.320
 one or the other because every action is possible 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.380
 perform with different ways we will 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.420
 look for something simpler 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.640
 perhaps more complicated but that will 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.210
 performed more graceful more beautiful 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.770
 in terms of programming 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.030
 for those people who are interested 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.580
 I think it will be games 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.250
 interesting and absolutely absolutely 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:05.700
 everyone can deduct something for themselves 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.660
 I will give some advice how to start 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.150
 I where what what information removed 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.890
 maybe there are some practical advice for 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.850
 someone for someone not seem not 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.390
 very practical but still i hope that 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.940
 The project will also help people to shoot 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.170
 some entertaining videos where i'm 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.700
 I will already be messing with some 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.110
 variables maybe speeding up and slowing down 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.270
 and so on, but we will find that when 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.450
 creating a game that is full 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.320
 created i will post it in 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.090
 free access 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.150
 so that everyone can download and 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.190
 try it on your computer 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.550
 I will write on the sarc on the platform 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.780
 xml therefore in order to final 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.860
 group we will need to try 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.739
 install framework 4 and oxana game 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.530
 studio 4 resistor beat angle it weighs 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.230
 everything is there I am not mistaken no more than 100 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.760
 megabyte that is a principle for everyone 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.450
 it is possible 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.970
 I am especially grateful to those people who are already 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.750
 subscribed to the channel thanks for your 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:20.049
 support i hope i won't let you down and 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.850
 everyone will be from some part like our 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.430
 project 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.400
 let's create a game of revenge along with 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:32.070
 managers all thanks for watching everyone 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.070
 good luck with you was pavel all bye
