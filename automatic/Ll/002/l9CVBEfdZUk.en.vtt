 whole colombia celebrates the triumph 3-0 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.450
 against greece in its world premiere 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.220
 from Brazil a victorious return of the country 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.790
 in a tournament in which I did not participate 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.279
 16 years ago to the rhythm of bugle whistles 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.440
 foam flags and cries colombia 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.750
 I celebrate this triumph also marked by 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.940
 an election date in which it is decided 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.260
 the president of the country an appointment that the 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.260
 football has made forget 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.150
 one of the busiest points was the 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.910
 from the park of 93 in the north of 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.470
 Bogota where a crowd of about 5000 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.630
 people met to watch the game 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.150
 on a giant screen installed by 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.370
 movistar the crowd threw jets of 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.739
 foam while others danced to the rhythm 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.080
 of a papayera band typical of 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.180
 towns of the country yellow shirts 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.160
 they dominated the scene along with the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.860
 tumbled hats from the north of the country 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.480
 the painted faces yellow wigs 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.350
 like the hair of Carlos 'the kid' 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.290
 valderrama 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.629
 the tricolor tricolor balloons all served 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.450
 to show support to the team led 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.210
 by the Argentine young Jose Pekerman 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.500
 Older adults all today give you 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.720
 a vote of confidence to the selection 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.170
 tricolor that they see in rooms 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.170
 of end 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.079
 Colombia has what and we will take out 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.079
 The things of this world 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:36.370
 but if we really expect a victory 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.370
 we do not know how many dead 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.900
 each goal was celebrated with more zeal 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.240
 than the other until at 91 minutes 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.220
 James Rodriguez scored the third goal and 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.380
 set the party that surely will 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.330
 will continue until Sunday despite the fact that 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.850
 this afternoon the dry law comes into force 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.590
 for tomorrow's elections 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.810
 the question now after this 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.910
 unexpected victory is tomorrow the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.620
 polling stations will be so full 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.620
 of voters as of fans
