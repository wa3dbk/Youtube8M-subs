but now when you press m2 it cancels the

now obviously this is going to cancel my
voice<00:01:55.160> as<00:01:55.370> well<00:01:55.520> because<00:01:55.790> it<00:01:55.880> takes<00:01:56.150> in<00:01:56.390> all

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
voice as well because it takes in all

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.330

the ambient noise inside the cabin and

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.750 
the ambient noise inside the cabin and
just<00:01:59.080> cancels<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.200> out<00:02:00.350> so<00:02:01.190> you'll<00:02:01.490> have<00:02:01.610> to

just cancels it out so you'll have to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.390 
just cancels it out so you'll have to

at all but like the idea I mean you

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.540 
at all but like the idea I mean you
could<00:05:10.930> transfer<00:05:11.440> it<00:05:11.470> so<00:05:11.740> you<00:05:11.800> get<00:05:12.040> a<00:05:12.070> mini
