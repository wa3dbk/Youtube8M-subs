00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
I think I pushed it down a little bit

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.600 
I think I pushed it down a little bit
too<00:04:02.690> much<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.470> it's<00:04:03.650> like<00:04:03.680> started<00:04:04.250> right<00:04:04.400> but

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
too much so it's like started right but

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.370 
too much so it's like started right but
this<00:04:04.730> one's<00:04:04.940> my<00:04:05.120> favorite<00:04:05.540> it's<00:04:05.930> in<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.110> color

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
this one's my favorite it's in the color

this one's my favorite it's in the color
perky<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.010> don't<00:04:07.370> think<00:04:07.610> they<00:04:07.730> sell<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.120> by

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
perky I don't think they sell it by

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.850 
perky I don't think they sell it by
itself<00:04:08.720> it's<00:04:09.050> about<00:04:09.200> twenty<00:04:09.650> nine<00:04:09.830> dollars

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
for the set of five and i think it's

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.240 
for the set of five and i think it's
about<00:04:13.820> thirty<00:04:14.300> dollars<00:04:14.810> or<00:04:15.050> 25<00:04:15.709> something

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
about thirty dollars or 25 something

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.880 
about thirty dollars or 25 something
like<00:04:16.370> that<00:04:16.549> just<00:04:16.580> for<00:04:17.180> one<00:04:17.450> so<00:04:18.140> why<00:04:18.380> not<00:04:18.410> get

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
like that just for one so why not get

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.360 
like that just for one so why not get
five<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:19.609> them<00:04:19.790> instead<00:04:20.239> of<00:04:20.419> just<00:04:20.630> one<00:04:21.250> even<00:04:22.250> if
