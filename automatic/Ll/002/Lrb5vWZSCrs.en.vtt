00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:47.849 
only to go up to a hundred knots and

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:49.460 
only to go up to a hundred knots and
then<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.149> would<00:01:48.300> close<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.750> throttles<00:01:49.200> and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
then we would close the throttles and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.940 
then we would close the throttles and
slow<00:01:50.399> down<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.940> stop<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.929> accelerated<00:01:52.619> away

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
slow down and stop we accelerated away

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.359 
slow down and stop we accelerated away
and<00:01:53.520> about<00:01:54.360> 80<00:01:54.690> or<00:01:54.929> 90<00:01:55.289> knots<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.800> I<00:01:55.950> called

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
and about 80 or 90 knots like I called

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.380 
and about 80 or 90 knots like I called
for<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.789> copilot<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.569> close<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.020> throttles

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
for the copilot to close the throttles

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.710 
for the copilot to close the throttles
but<00:02:00.390> he<00:02:00.630> actually<00:02:00.810> froze<00:02:02.119> we<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.330> kept<00:02:03.629> going

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
but he actually froze we just kept going

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.680 
but he actually froze we just kept going
and<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.340> called<00:02:05.610> for<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.910> throttles<00:02:06.300> to<00:02:06.569> be

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
and so I called for the throttles to be

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.859 
and so I called for the throttles to be
closed<00:02:06.989> again<00:02:08.090> but<00:02:09.090> again<00:02:09.390> absolutely

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
closed again but again absolutely

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.809 
closed again but again absolutely
nothing<00:02:10.349> happened<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.069> glanced<00:02:11.670> across

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
nothing happened and I glanced across

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.630 
nothing happened and I glanced across
and<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.510> saw<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.080> he<00:02:13.830> had<00:02:13.860> got<00:02:14.069> his<00:02:14.099> hands<00:02:14.520> on

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and I saw that he had got his hands on

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.309 
and I saw that he had got his hands on
the<00:02:14.730> throttles<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:15.390> he<00:02:15.480> wasn't<00:02:15.660> pulling<00:02:16.170> them

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
the throttles but he wasn't pulling them

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.460 
the throttles but he wasn't pulling them
back<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:17.700> at<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.209> stage<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.720> realized<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.290> was

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
back so at that stage I realized I was

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.260 
back so at that stage I realized I was
going<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.739> have<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.069> do<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.730> meant<00:02:21.090> taking

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
going to have to do it that meant taking

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.420 
going to have to do it that meant taking
my<00:02:21.629> left<00:02:21.840> hand<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.800> was<00:02:22.950> holding<00:02:22.980> the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.100 
thought we were in for very serious
trouble<00:02:50.489> because<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.209> most<00:02:51.450> likely<00:02:51.840> cause<00:02:52.080> of

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
trouble because the most likely cause of

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.190 
trouble because the most likely cause of
action<00:02:52.860> was<00:02:53.040> for<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.310> aircraft<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:54.030> stall<00:02:54.629> and

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
action was for the aircraft to stall and

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.300 
action was for the aircraft to stall and
we<00:02:55.620> would<00:02:55.769> just<00:02:55.980> crash<00:02:56.430> wherever<00:02:57.239> we<00:02:57.390> were<00:02:58.310> but

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
we would just crash wherever we were but

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.899 
we would just crash wherever we were but
I<00:02:59.670> realized<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.470> aircraft<00:03:02.010> was

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
I realized that the aircraft was

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.330 
I realized that the aircraft was
actually<00:03:03.420> flying<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:04.110> was<00:03:04.260> responding<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.220> my

actually flying and was responding to my

flying control inputs and having
realized<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.329> and<00:03:09.690> pushed<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.500> nose<00:03:10.650> down

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
realized that and pushed the nose down

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.640 
realized that and pushed the nose down
our<00:03:11.340> eyes<00:03:11.640> has<00:03:11.849> still<00:03:12.120> got<00:03:12.420> more<00:03:13.140> than<00:03:13.410> half

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650

the runway left available to me and with
the<00:03:17.970> nose<00:03:18.180> down<00:03:18.569> I<00:03:18.959> managed<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.620> point<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.129> back

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
the nose down I managed to point it back

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.170 
the nose down I managed to point it back
over<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.299> grass<00:03:21.540> but<00:03:21.870> towards<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.349> runway

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
and make a controlled landing and I

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.030 
and make a controlled landing and I
managed<00:03:27.359> to<00:03:27.390> get<00:03:27.569> it<00:03:27.720> back<00:03:27.930> onto<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.500> tarmac

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
managed to get it back onto the tarmac

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.339 
managed to get it back onto the tarmac
of<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.519> runway<00:03:29.879> and<00:03:30.569> once<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:30.930> was<00:03:31.079> there

of the runway and once I was there

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.180 
of the runway and once I was there
braking<00:03:32.040> was<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.579> would<00:03:33.150> say<00:03:33.290> near<00:03:34.290> maximum<00:03:34.829> and

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
braking was I would say near maximum and

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.520 
braking was I would say near maximum and
we<00:03:35.280> stopped<00:03:35.640> with<00:03:35.910> several<00:03:36.750> hundred<00:03:37.109> feet<00:03:37.139> to

we stopped with several hundred feet to

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.520 
we stopped with several hundred feet to
go<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.919> end<00:03:38.069> of<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.250> runway<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:42.440> couldn't<00:03:43.440> I

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
go to the end of the runway I couldn't I

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.500 
go to the end of the runway I couldn't I
was<00:03:43.680> petrified<00:03:44.310> but<00:03:44.639> I<00:03:44.700> really<00:03:45.090> didn't<00:03:45.389> have

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
was petrified but I really didn't have

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.690 
was petrified but I really didn't have
time<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.840> be<00:03:46.139> it<00:03:46.530> all<00:03:46.709> happened<00:03:47.160> so<00:03:47.250> quickly

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
time to be it all happened so quickly

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.309 
time to be it all happened so quickly
that<00:03:47.910> my<00:03:48.299> whole<00:03:48.680> attention<00:03:49.680> was<00:03:50.370> purely<00:03:50.790> on

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
that my whole attention was purely on

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.530 
that my whole attention was purely on
applying<00:03:52.319> my<00:03:52.620> well<00:03:53.190> learnt<00:03:53.519> flying<00:03:53.880> skills<00:03:54.329> to

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
applying my well learnt flying skills to

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.360 
applying my well learnt flying skills to
get<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.840> back<00:03:55.109> down<00:03:55.349> on<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.680> ground<00:03:55.919> in<00:03:56.130> one

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
get it back down on the ground in one

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.300 
get it back down on the ground in one
piece<00:03:56.780> it<00:03:57.780> wasn't<00:03:58.139> until<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.470> saw<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:58.859> video

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
piece it wasn't until I saw the video

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.839 
piece it wasn't until I saw the video
that<00:03:59.700> AI<00:04:00.239> realized<00:04:00.959> it'd<00:04:01.500> been<00:04:02.190> to<00:04:02.579> a<00:04:02.609> height

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
that AI realized it'd been to a height

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.020 
that AI realized it'd been to a height
of<00:04:02.880> about<00:04:03.299> a<00:04:03.359> hundred<00:04:03.840> feet<00:04:04.459> that<00:04:05.459> had<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.910> only

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
of about a hundred feet that had I only

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.780 
of about a hundred feet that had I only
been<00:04:06.329> airborne<00:04:06.780> for<00:04:07.079> nine<00:04:07.410> maybe<00:04:07.799> ten<00:04:08.160> seconds

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
been airborne for nine maybe ten seconds

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.979 
been airborne for nine maybe ten seconds
and<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.959> was<00:04:10.290> stunned<00:04:10.829> to<00:04:11.190> see<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.669> the<00:04:12.180> way<00:04:12.630> the

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
and I was stunned to see a the way the

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.949 
and I was stunned to see a the way the
aircraft<00:04:13.280> nosed<00:04:14.280> up<00:04:14.609> and<00:04:14.940> lept<00:04:15.269> into<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.810> air

aircraft nosed up and lept into the air

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.500 
aircraft nosed up and lept into the air
and<00:04:16.260> was<00:04:16.919> swept<00:04:17.310> immediately<00:04:17.940> over<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.269> grass

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
and was swept immediately over the grass

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.839 
and was swept immediately over the grass
by<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.870> crosswinds

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
by the crosswinds

very<00:04:23.130> very<00:04:23.400> quickly<00:04:23.760> in<00:04:24.150> my<00:04:24.690> mind<00:04:24.990> I<00:04:25.200> knew<00:04:25.410> I

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
very very quickly in my mind I knew I

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.230 
very very quickly in my mind I knew I
had<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.770> keep<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.130> speed<00:04:26.460> up<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:26.729> avoid

had to keep the speed up to avoid

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.950 
had to keep the speed up to avoid
stalling

I<00:04:28.050> probably<00:04:28.380> pitched<00:04:28.919> it<00:04:29.130> a<00:04:29.220> little<00:04:29.430> bit<00:04:29.610> too

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
I probably pitched it a little bit too

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.330 
I probably pitched it a little bit too
far<00:04:30.120> down<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.660> start<00:04:30.960> with<00:04:31.260> but<00:04:31.889> it<00:04:32.010> kept<00:04:32.220> the

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
far down to start with but it kept the

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.580 
far down to start with but it kept the
speed<00:04:32.669> up<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.210> then<00:04:33.419> it<00:04:33.630> allowed<00:04:33.930> me<00:04:34.169> to<00:04:34.199> do

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
speed up and then it allowed me to do

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.460 
speed up and then it allowed me to do
almost<00:04:35.070> normal<00:04:35.820> landing<00:04:36.449> recovery<00:04:37.260> and

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
almost normal landing recovery and

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.129 
almost normal landing recovery and
putting<00:04:37.979> it<00:04:38.099> down<00:04:38.130> on<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.639> grass<00:04:38.880> but<00:04:39.479> it<00:04:39.990> all

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
putting it down on the grass but it all

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.990 
putting it down on the grass but it all
happened<00:04:40.530> so<00:04:40.620> quickly<00:04:41.099> and<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.700> were

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
happened so quickly and it were

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.570 
happened so quickly and it were
really<00:04:42.870> part<00:04:43.170> of<00:04:43.320> instinct<00:04:43.860> born<00:04:44.040> anything

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
really part of instinct born anything

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.430 
really part of instinct born anything
else<00:04:44.760> I<00:04:46.970> would<00:04:47.970> love<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.540> go<00:04:48.690> back<00:04:48.900> to<00:04:49.140> flying

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
else I would love to go back to flying

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.160 
else I would love to go back to flying
and<00:04:49.830> it's<00:04:50.550> a<00:04:50.730> bit<00:04:50.910> of<00:04:51.030> a<00:04:51.090> joke<00:04:51.330> now<00:04:51.540> really<00:04:51.960> this

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
and it's a bit of a joke now really this

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.710 
and it's a bit of a joke now really this
I'm<00:04:52.380> I'm<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.770> last<00:04:53.100> Victor<00:04:53.550> pilots<00:04:54.060> but<00:04:54.420> I

I'm I'm the last Victor pilots but I

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.870 
I'm I'm the last Victor pilots but I
