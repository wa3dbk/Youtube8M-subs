00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
normally would make them look bigger but

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.920 
normally would make them look bigger but
because<00:02:13.770> it

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
because it

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.300

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
eyeliner inside and that definitely

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.500 
eyeliner inside and that definitely
closes<00:02:22.900> up<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.409> eggs<00:02:23.709> a<00:02:23.829> little<00:02:23.950> bit<00:02:24.099> more<00:02:24.510> so

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
because she does not that bronzy look

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.539 
because she does not that bronzy look
it's<00:02:38.200> kind<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.889> peachy<00:02:39.989> bronzy<00:02:40.989> cheek<00:02:41.549> and
