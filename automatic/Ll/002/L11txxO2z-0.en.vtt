00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.090
 two first regional aspects per 10 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.250
 for yes the volume of game created 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.130
 opportunities if there can be a winner of 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.500
 more dilated score 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.480
 had some problems saw snow and zero 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:26.029
 George stressed that even the bench that 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.920
 had Alex and then the quest to continue the 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.140
 same standard but with players of the 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.939
 different feature options 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.590
 we still had the congress discuss in a 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.910
 ball that you could have set and will have 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.729
 made 2 to 0 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.260
 and then the game gets more relaxed after all 

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:42.589
 that he has forgotten that he has 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.830
 technical quality in your exchange of passes 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:47.900
 and the aa the couple that the screen ray the people 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.949
 of course because the main asset in 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.199
 City 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.180
 the opponent grew up balanced and then with 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.799
 God worthy of time easy to make 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.150
 which made a stop ball it is well 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:59.239
 truth but your experience of the other 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.680
 niche because inside still goes because it is 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.269
 an important game because we tried to 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.390
 some way to make the team more 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.369
 aggressive and even vulnerable to put the 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.110
 lower output players 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.409
 We had the ball game in late June 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.200
 at the end of the game even more but without the 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.689
 second, a better condition of the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.310
 time to do others using a word in the 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:24.530
 your first vulnerable response 80 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.689
 vulnerable because any act comes here 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.659
 and puts the international hand is so 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.689
 even if you have many doubts regarding 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.999
 to play against the palm trees now in two 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.609
 least clever penalties 

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:39.920
 against the flamengo pi please do 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.929
 were marked after he was 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.929
 is vulnerable 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.490
 I did not want to talk about it, she sees 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.520
 in a situation of yourselves so that 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.790
 did not have a different interpretation 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.580
 now it's a joke 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.620
 It's a joke to block what 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.010
 happened on the fourth daughter who 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.780
 speculated that what happened today is the 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.820
 good part is in a life and yours 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.920
 also remember to talk about him 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.270
 I give justifying score was not 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.399
 known in the second half the team 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.200
 grew and appeared I recognized that she 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.030
 had the doctors tie 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.380
 I recognized will be left on the volume button 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.760
 of greater game 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.130
 I recognized that it became vulnerable 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.290
 I was in the most aggressive team she 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.270
 pulls aggressive campaign became more 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.100
 venerated recognizes that not having a 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.780
 player with the characteristics to 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.940
 do the middle ground according to the 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.980
 porter capital malé dissolution of 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.380
 because we do not have a player either 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.390
 to reflect daniel carvalho comes not 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.070
 wanted to detail side the last one that does not have 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.380
 this feature is a new destination 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.790
 together with recognition but still 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.980
 paradise season 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.310
 I remember chance would be a series of 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.100
 games and see now again it seems that 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.410
 It has been crying did not think it was good. 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.180
 although it was from the flowers but it is a 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.830
 That's right. 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.930
 intention is against 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.140
 I feel like I wonder if here 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.060
 who won one more referee the people of a 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:06.190
 bar the third in number of goals that have 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:08.830
 lost in recent games I not to 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.100
 after a win today is very easy 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.630
 We will take care of something magical sun 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.940
 had a species that arrives in this 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.810
 season had in the first wine press of the 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.240
 time 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.860
 is the game of the time troubled over 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.380
 trees but with the balanced game of 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.490
 technical level to act or not 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.010
 make a difference 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.950
 we have created because unfortunately the 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.780
 team prf she's been losing the game for 1 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.580
 to 0 next season 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.250
 the canal of bertioga that we had a 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.410
 video series because we have a range 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.530
 of 15 the team that had five more hotels 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.110
 sung at the show back in morale and 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.830
 numerous joseph antónio verney end already 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.690
 exchange but informed me the amazon was 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.940
 so I brought him into the game 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.330
 will have 15 30 in the slum of the heavy 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.010
 possible to jump for you more more more 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.980
 more running I do not have more coordination 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.690
 said the resident again then that 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.950
 that is the mechanics of the team that 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.950
 repeating the vision is impaired 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.110
 I think there's a team on the other side. 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.299
 that he was always at the hotel also at 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.959
 Sometimes you put that and respond 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.459
 specifically the local course there are several 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.079
 equipment to set the games on the 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.120
 our preference within portugal 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.160
 set the field when the game is 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.050
 working is training then done 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.400
 an intensive job for it did 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.180
 during the games, soon enough 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.060
 answers to god's hand and such 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.400
 it was not possible in time and before 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.710
 game if the game we can for a 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.750
 first bid he is an employee in 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:44.810
 around the item was not one secadinha 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.810
 they were not against their work 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.690
 we can still pay or collect the pawn 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.010
 I threw on the old woman wanted to make more 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.990
 old that I recognize that it will 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.050
 get to know a little tomorrow in one 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.850
 important moment of his career had 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.139
 other important reserves also do 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.569
 which they did not want to assess the quality 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.849
 was against the ipatinga when it came out 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.740
 injured in the following 81 said that the 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.139
 production fall the state the numbers 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.479
 he told her that he voted against the 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.819
 palm trees inter won today with the vote 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.830
 was winning what 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:24.710
 could the goal of draw the inter 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:29.539
 turned dependent we is not one is one is 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.370
 a position where we have come from 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.770
 daniel carvalho has this characteristic 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.870
 to make a composition of the line of 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.199
 front of the party to compose four 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:43.520
 Players in the central lawn strip 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:46.789
 I already know the image of the 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.400
 meshed and we had still saved 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:52.129
 radio in life at a crossroads to give 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.990
 a good legal condition to help 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:55.759
 Brazilians to happen and now 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.569
 first house the matching house I 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:59.539
 I think it 's so 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:01.030
 according to George in games he forgets 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:03.310
 up to 10 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.770
 young people entered the sea with the crew is the 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.270
 first kiss, bye, ann 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.710
 then gets the hint the player more 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.280
 characteristic magical leads 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.390
 disfavor feature the cast because 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.550
 my entire career and I'm wondering 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.490
 who was the national design expanding 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.370
 an attacker of specific area energy 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:24.070
 however it looks like another vehicle 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.350
 it's like daniel work that's why 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.670
 brought him because he technically believes 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.700
 that the player in this characteristic 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:33.420
 while all the evidence of 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:40.330
 speed releasing adrian is absurd 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:43.590
 police uep flight tap flies idea idea a 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.590
 idea of what it is
