00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.020
I just love this time of year.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.250
It's when the Hydrangeas begin to bloom.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.150
I've kind of become a Hydrangea-crazed fool
in a way.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
I have all different kinds.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.780
Everywhere I can find a shady spot that they'll
thrive in, I stick a Hydrangea in there.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.150
For instance, just look at these two basic
types.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.930
This is called a Mophead or the big rounded
head, Macrophylla Hydrangea.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.540
And then this one up here, you can see, is
one called a Lacecap.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.780
So what we have here is two entirely different
flower forms, but they require the same conditions.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.469
They like a little bit of sun.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.749
I would say partial shade, or you could give
them even some morning sun up until about

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:58.540
11 o'clock.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.839
And as their name implies, Hydrangea, they
like moist soil.

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.820
Consistently moist soil, not soggy wet feet,
not boggy ground, but just consistently moist

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.820
soil.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.610
And yes it is true you can change the color
by changing the pH or the chemistry of the

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.610
soil.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.640
If you want them to be pink like this, what
you want is a soil that is much more alkaline,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.940
meaning that you would want to apply a lot
of lime, hydrated lime around them.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.750
If you want them to be blue, well, you can
add something the acidifies the soil like

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.080
aluminum sulfate.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.700
Now don't think you can just throw a little
around there and it'll change automatically.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.420
It'll take a full season for these plants
to uptake those chemicals, which have a bearing

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.860
on the color of the bloom.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.600
Something I learned a long time ago -- whether
you're cutting Lacecaps or you're cutting

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.160
these Mophead types, you wanna do two things:
You want to cut the Hydrangea bloom in the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.970
early morning, okay?

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.230
Secondly, what you wanna do is you wanna cut
a more mature bloom.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.850
You can see, they're coming on in waves of
blooms.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.140
Here's one that's just forming here.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.910
Here's one that's a little more mature here.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.030
You see, here's one that's coming along.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.030
Here's one next.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.980
But this one looks like a much older bloom,
and this one's even older than that there.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.450
So the more mature the bloom the better it's
gonna hold up.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.349
Because what will happen is you'll get, what
I call, Hydrangea collapse with the bloom.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.660
You'll cut them, they'll look fine, you'll
put them in a vase of water, you'll come back

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.129
30 minutes later and they will have just collapsed.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.819
So you want them cut in the morning.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.569
You want them cut as mature plants.

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.489
And then what I do is just take off a few
of the lower leaves like this, and it's ready

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.499
to go into some water.

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:43.409
You wanna get it in water as quickly as possible.

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.129
Isn't that a gorgeous flower?

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.410
