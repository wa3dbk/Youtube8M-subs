okay<00:00:26.720> let's<00:00:27.720> try<00:00:27.930> again<00:00:28.230> five<00:00:28.769> six<00:00:29.359> seven

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
okay let's try again five six seven

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.180 
okay let's try again five six seven
eight<00:00:30.630> slide<00:00:31.399> up<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.850> back<00:00:33.270> up<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.660> back<00:00:34.380> step

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
eight slide up and back up and back step

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.369 
eight slide up and back up and back step
turn<00:00:37.489> cha-cha-cha<00:00:38.510> okay<00:00:39.510> we're<00:00:40.050> gonna<00:00:40.140> come

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
turn cha-cha-cha okay we're gonna come

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.840 
turn cha-cha-cha okay we're gonna come
back<00:00:40.530> over<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.940> do<00:00:42.120> after<00:00:43.020> you

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
back over so you have to do after you

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.880 
back over so you have to do after you
cha-cha-cha<00:00:44.850> you're<00:00:45.270> gonna<00:00:45.420> lean<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.739> two

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
cha-cha-cha you're gonna lean for two

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.450 
cha-cha-cha you're gonna lean for two
counts

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
counts

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.490 
counts
so<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.090> lean<00:00:48.450> tune<00:00:49.170> up<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.190> cross<00:00:50.879> step<00:00:51.660> one

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
so it's lean tune up in cross step one

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
so it's lean tune up in cross step one
to<00:00:52.860> back<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:54.379> okay<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.620> know<00:00:55.949> that's<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
to back up okay I know that's the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.670 
to back up okay I know that's the
probably<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> most<00:00:57.270> difficult<00:00:57.510> part<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.109> I'm

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
probably the most difficult part so I'm

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.709 
probably the most difficult part so I'm
gonna<00:00:58.890> actually<00:00:59.730> both<00:01:00.059> those<00:01:00.270> remove<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.570> turn

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
gonna actually both those remove it turn

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.799 
gonna actually both those remove it turn
this<00:01:00.840> way<00:01:01.219> we're<00:01:02.219> gonna<00:01:02.340> lean<00:01:02.609> lean<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.780> right
