00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
writing and I think that's pretty much

summed<00:02:34.870> up<00:02:35.020> by<00:02:35.880> just<00:02:36.880> looking<00:02:37.060> at<00:02:37.360> least

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
summed up by just looking at least

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.780 
summed up by just looking at least
general<00:02:38.050> pages<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.980> as<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.220> can<00:02:39.310> see<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.640> is

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
general pages and as you can see this is

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.240 
general pages and as you can see this is
exactly<00:02:40.240> why<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.510> don't<00:02:40.690> have<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.440> lined<00:02:41.920> paper

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580
