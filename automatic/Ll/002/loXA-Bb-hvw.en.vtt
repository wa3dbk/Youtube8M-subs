00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
sound difficult are really the ones that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.290 
sound difficult are really the ones that
are<00:01:28.720> using<00:01:30.100> hammer-ons<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.400> little<00:01:31.700> patterns

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
are using hammer-ons and little patterns

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.180 
are using hammer-ons and little patterns
or<00:01:32.540> game<00:01:32.690> once<00:01:32.960> you<00:01:33.110> learn<00:01:33.470> like<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.950> little

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
or game once you learn like the little

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.590 
or game once you learn like the little
three<00:01:34.460> note<00:01:34.640> pattern<00:01:34.880> then<00:01:35.240> all<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:35.390> have<00:01:35.420> to

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
three note pattern then all you have to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.530 
three note pattern then all you have to
do<00:01:35.690> is<00:01:35.840> kind<00:01:35.960> of<00:01:36.080> speed<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.530> up<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:37.180> it<00:01:38.180> sounds

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
do is kind of speed it up and it sounds

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.600 
do is kind of speed it up and it sounds
really<00:01:38.630> fancy<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:39.440> for<00:01:39.619> example<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:40.369> know

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
really fancy so for example you know

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:48.130 
really fancy so for example you know
this<00:01:40.880> lick<00:01:41.150> right<00:01:41.330> here

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.419 

sounds<00:01:49.140> fancy<00:01:49.409> right<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.009> only<00:01:50.130> three

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
sounds fancy right but it's only three

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.810 
sounds fancy right but it's only three
notes<00:01:50.700> right<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.869> basically<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:53.039> okay<00:01:53.640> i'm

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.850 
parts are kind of like you know the
double<00:04:16.820> bends<00:04:20.110> that's<00:04:21.110> just<00:04:21.290> a<00:04:21.380> you<00:04:21.680> know<00:04:21.709> you

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
double bends that's just a you know you

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.050 
double bends that's just a you know you
would<00:04:22.010> normally<00:04:22.100> here<00:04:22.370> like<00:04:22.460> a<00:04:22.490> single<00:04:22.820> bin

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
would normally here like a single bin

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.220 
would normally here like a single bin
like<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:25.280> all<00:04:25.550> I'm<00:04:25.640> doing<00:04:25.820> is<00:04:25.880> grabbing<00:04:26.230> the

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
like and all I'm doing is grabbing the

like and all I'm doing is grabbing the
GMB<00:04:27.740> string<00:04:28.010> at<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.130> same<00:04:28.310> time<00:04:29.680> so<00:04:30.680> it<00:04:30.770> kind

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
GMB string at the same time so it kind

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.380 
GMB string at the same time so it kind
of<00:04:31.010> sounds<00:04:31.250> like<00:04:31.310> a<00:04:31.430> train<00:04:31.640> horn<00:04:31.970> type<00:04:32.180> deal

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
of sounds like a train horn type deal

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.920 
of sounds like a train horn type deal
you<00:04:32.510> know<00:04:36.730> big<00:04:37.730> randy<00:04:38.060> rhoads<00:04:38.360> technique

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
you know big randy rhoads technique

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.720 
you know big randy rhoads technique
there<00:04:39.170> and<00:04:39.350> then<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:40.160> only<00:04:40.190> other<00:04:40.490> thing

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
there and then the only other thing

there and then the only other thing
that's<00:04:41.690> kind<00:04:41.840> of<00:04:41.930> interesting<00:04:42.110> about<00:04:42.530> the

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
that's kind of interesting about the

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.970 
that's kind of interesting about the
