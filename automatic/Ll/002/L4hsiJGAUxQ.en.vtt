00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:13.340
 always wondered how it works 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.340
 return line as I go there for hrenaten 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.760
 at night it turns out like this 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:25.350
 here we still have a hole and they 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.320
 Just pressed in and I do not know 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.960
 will it be able to shoot on the injectors 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 which already stand inside 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.980
 engine but outside for now basically 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.370
 it turns out it looks like 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.370
 like this 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:05.130
 here is the stub here is the return pipe it is not welded 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.130
 screwed there is absolutely nothing 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.070
 at the moment, while running smoothly 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.070
 maybe it will break but 2 got 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:18.160
 same got not broken get not 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:21.600
 get it done but there is a chance 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.600
 what to attract if something like this 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.640
 it turns out here 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.360
 such a hole 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.170
 he has nothing smooth and clean there 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:04.970
 the only thing that you just need to measure 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.970
 now pick a diameter drill 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.320
 here and so inclined then 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:16.880
 leave to drill quietly 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:22.400
 invent but whether there will be mud 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:26.360
 fall or not I do not know that she 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:31.820
 it's really true 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:34.360
 uncomfortable but knocked the knife to whom 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.360
 will come in handy 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:49.340
 Well, and finally, here they can return 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:51.320
 to be useful to someone I do not know that is 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:57.490
 inner diameter outer 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:04:00.490
 sorry 47 and here the hole is obtained 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.490
 46 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.760
 so here and under the pressure she there 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:13.360
 just come in here and everything you can 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.360
 there is nothing 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.209
 such a front eyelet was made
