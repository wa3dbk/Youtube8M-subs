the<00:00:23.279> woods<00:00:23.730> valve<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.269> sir<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.380> just

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
the woods valve in sir that is just

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.640 
the woods valve in sir that is just
basically<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.420> hollow<00:00:27.420> tube<00:00:27.930> if<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.260> can<00:00:28.410> see

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
basically a hollow tube if you can see

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.070 
basically a hollow tube if you can see
that<00:00:28.890> yep<00:00:29.519> straight<00:00:29.880> through<00:00:30.119> there<00:00:30.359> that's

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
that yep straight through there that's

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.030 
that yep straight through there that's
your<00:00:31.320> hollow<00:00:31.470> tube

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
your hollow tube

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.360 
your hollow tube
there's<00:00:32.309> your<00:00:32.640> valve<00:00:33.300> insert<00:00:34.100> that's<00:00:35.100> just

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
there's your valve insert that's just

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.610 
there's your valve insert that's just
dust<00:00:35.670> cap<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:38.100> bit<00:00:38.340> there<00:00:39.230> is<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
dust cap and that bit there is the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.970 
dust cap and that bit there is the
retainer<00:00:41.629> locking<00:00:42.629> retainer<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.350> holds<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
retainer locking retainer that holds the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.850 
retainer locking retainer that holds the
valve<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.120> place<00:00:45.420> probably<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.350> using<00:00:46.649> quite

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
valve in place probably not using quite

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.930 
valve in place probably not using quite
the<00:00:47.010> right<00:00:47.219> terminology

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the right terminology

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.690 
the right terminology
there's<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.629> valve<00:00:49.070> as<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.430> see<00:00:50.550> it's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
there's the valve as you can see it's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.569 
there's the valve as you can see it's
got<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> bit<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> rubber<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.600> now<00:00:52.530> if<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.219> show

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
got a bit of rubber on it now if I show

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.389 
got a bit of rubber on it now if I show
you<00:00:55.969> one<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.120> those<00:00:57.649> without<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.010> rubber<00:00:59.219> on

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
you one of those without the rubber on

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.340 
you one of those without the rubber on
it<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.660> width<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:00.930> see<00:01:01.199> there's<00:01:01.320> a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
it and the width you can see there's a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.020 
it and the width you can see there's a
little<00:01:01.469> hole<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.579> that's<00:01:02.730> just

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
little hole in it and that's just

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.660 
little hole in it and that's just
basically<00:01:03.830> again<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> tube

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
basically again a tube

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.590 
basically again a tube
it<00:01:06.450> won't<00:01:07.320> stop<00:01:08.100> air<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.420> won't

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it won't stop air going in and it won't

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.590 
it won't stop air going in and it won't
stop<00:01:09.840> air<00:01:10.080> coming<00:01:10.320> out<00:01:10.619> now<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.939> rubber

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
stop air coming out now with the rubber

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.840 
stop air coming out now with the rubber
on<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.799> stops<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.280> air<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.610> coming

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
on that that stops the air and coming

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.789 
on that that stops the air and coming
back<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.270> but<00:01:15.509> still<00:01:15.780> allows<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.470> when<00:01:16.680> you

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
back out but still allows you when you

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.899 
back out but still allows you when you
pump<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.700> push<00:01:17.880> air<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.720> between<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.560> rubber

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
pump to push air in between the rubber

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.219 
pump to push air in between the rubber
so<00:01:20.909> that's<00:01:21.119> how<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.390> valve<00:01:21.810> where<00:01:22.049> it's

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
so that's how that valve where it's

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.280 
so that's how that valve where it's
quite<00:01:22.470> straightforward<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:24.390> obviously

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
quite straightforward and that obviously

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.080 
quite straightforward and that obviously
will<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.409> attached<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> inner<00:01:26.040> tube<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
will be attached to the inner tube the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.830 
will be attached to the inner tube the
valve<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:28.560> view<00:01:29.130> there<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.759> valve<00:01:30.060> goes<00:01:30.540> in

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
valve going view there the valve goes in

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.120 
valve going view there the valve goes in
you<00:01:31.710> find<00:01:32.009> there's<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:33.560> notches<00:01:34.560> there<00:01:35.009> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
you find there's little notches there to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.370 
you find there's little notches there to
line<00:01:35.369> up<00:01:37.400> talk<00:01:38.400> back<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.850> that's<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.380> then

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
line up talk back in that's it and then

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.100 
line up talk back in that's it and then
that<00:01:40.650> screws<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:42.119> retainer<00:01:42.479> screws<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
that screws on the retainer screws on to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.090 
that screws on the retainer screws on to
hold<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.560> place<00:01:44.899> and<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.829> pump

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
hold it in place and then you just pump

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.270 
hold it in place and then you just pump
through<00:01:47.790> there<00:01:48.200> there's<00:01:49.200> nothing<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:50.070> sits

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
through there there's nothing one sits

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.069 
through there there's nothing one sits
in<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.610> situation<00:01:51.329> there's<00:01:51.509> nothing<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.930> do

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
in that situation there's nothing to do

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.569 
in that situation there's nothing to do
all<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.619> put<00:01:52.799> your<00:01:52.920> pump<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.340> and

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
all you do is put your pump on it and

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.990 
all you do is put your pump on it and
and<00:01:53.729> inflate<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:56.460> only<00:01:56.579> take<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
and inflate it and you only take the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.030 
and inflate it and you only take the
valve<00:01:57.240> out<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:58.049> there's<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> problem<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:58.860> it

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
valve out if there's a problem with it

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.399 
valve out if there's a problem with it
so<00:01:59.700> they're<00:01:59.880> very<00:01:59.909> very<00:02:00.210> simple<00:02:00.840> I'm<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.229> to

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
so they're very very simple I'm going to

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.679 
so they're very very simple I'm going to
show<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.530> something<00:02:01.890> else<00:02:02.040> these<00:02:02.790> this

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
show you something else these this

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.700 
show you something else these this
that's<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> old<00:02:04.290> type<00:02:04.500> woods<00:02:05.070> valve<00:02:06.469> which<00:02:07.469> is

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
that's the old type woods valve which is

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.529 
that's the old type woods valve which is
quite<00:02:07.979> hard<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.610> flight<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.149> need<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.390> put

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
quite hard to in flight you need to put

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.380 
quite hard to in flight you need to put
quite<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.869> bit<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.200> pressure<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.709> it

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
quite a bit of pressure on it

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.210 
quite a bit of pressure on it
but<00:02:11.569> at<00:02:11.960> some<00:02:12.260> point<00:02:12.319> I've<00:02:12.800> been<00:02:12.860> trying<00:02:12.950> to

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
but at some point I've been trying to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.680 
but at some point I've been trying to
find<00:02:13.370> out<00:02:13.550> when<00:02:13.910> but<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.180> think<00:02:14.450> it's<00:02:14.600> around

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
find out when but I think it's around

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.370 
find out when but I think it's around
about<00:02:15.040> 1960s<00:02:16.040> or<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:16.660> they<00:02:17.660> brought<00:02:17.900> our<00:02:18.140> easy

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
about 1960s or so they brought our easy

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.340 
about 1960s or so they brought our easy
pump<00:02:18.740> that's<00:02:19.569> that's<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.750> original<00:02:20.900> easy

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
pump that's that's the original easy

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.510 
pump that's that's the original easy
pump<00:02:21.830> valve<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.819> has<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:24.890> there<00:02:25.190> so<00:02:25.400> you've

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
pump valve that has in there so you've

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.120 
pump valve that has in there so you've
got<00:02:25.700> two<00:02:26.540> holes<00:02:26.810> in<00:02:26.990> there<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.230> think<00:02:27.350> yeah<00:02:27.890> two

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
got two holes in there I think yeah two

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.640 
got two holes in there I think yeah two
holes<00:02:28.340> in<00:02:28.520> there<00:02:28.700> but<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:29.750> has<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.290> little

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
holes in there but that has a little

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.180 
holes in there but that has a little
spring<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.330> rubber<00:02:32.540> seal<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:33.080> there<00:02:33.350> and

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
spring and a rubber seal in there and

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.370 
spring and a rubber seal in there and
when<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.430> blow<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.760> up<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.690> moves<00:02:36.140> the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
when you blow it up it it moves the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.340 
when you blow it up it it moves the
rubber<00:02:36.590> seal<00:02:36.860> away<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:38.060> when<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:39.050> stopped

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
rubber seal away and when you stopped

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.620 
rubber seal away and when you stopped
inflating<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.640> air<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.060> tube<00:02:41.270> holds

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
inflating it the air in the tube holds

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.900 
inflating it the air in the tube holds
rubber<00:02:41.900> seal<00:02:42.170> back<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:42.650> place<00:02:42.950> stop<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.820> air

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
rubber seal back in place stop the air

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.010 
rubber seal back in place stop the air
coming<00:02:44.180> back<00:02:44.330> out<00:02:44.540> again

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
coming back out again

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.100 
coming back out again
that's<00:02:45.410> called<00:02:45.680> an<00:02:45.800> easy<00:02:45.980> pump<00:02:46.340> valve<00:02:46.730> and

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
that's called an easy pump valve and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.330 
that's called an easy pump valve and
that<00:02:48.110> was<00:02:48.260> introduced<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:48.980> think<00:02:49.010> probably

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
that was introduced I think probably

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.660 
that was introduced I think probably
1960s<00:02:50.180> maybe<00:02:50.440> 1970s<00:02:51.440> but<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.769> remember<00:02:52.550> them

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
1960s maybe 1970s but I remember them

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.560 
1960s maybe 1970s but I remember them
coming<00:02:52.970> in<00:02:53.090> years<00:02:53.330> ago<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.870> they've<00:02:54.769> made

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
coming in years ago and they've made

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.380 
coming in years ago and they've made
sense<00:02:56.570> lots<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:57.050> different<00:02:57.670> styles<00:02:58.670> of<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
sense lots of different styles of the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.780 
sense lots of different styles of the
same<00:02:59.630> thing<00:03:00.190> like<00:03:01.190> so

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
same thing like so

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.550 
same thing like so
and<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.300> just<00:03:02.480> take<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.870> original<00:03:03.019> insert

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
and you just take the original insert

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.140 
and you just take the original insert
out<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:03.950> then<00:03:04.600> put<00:03:05.600> those<00:03:05.930> in<00:03:06.230> instead<00:03:06.739> now<00:03:07.730> if

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
out and then put those in instead now if

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.960 
out and then put those in instead now if
you've<00:03:08.480> got<00:03:08.660> an<00:03:08.750> original<00:03:08.959> valve<00:03:09.530> like<00:03:09.970> that

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
you've got an original valve like that

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.940 
you've got an original valve like that
one<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.510> rubbers<00:03:11.840> perished<00:03:12.290> or<00:03:12.650> the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
one and the rubbers perished or the

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.509 
one and the rubbers perished or the
rubber<00:03:14.080> it's<00:03:15.080> missing<00:03:15.560> like<00:03:15.799> it<00:03:15.950> is<00:03:16.070> on<00:03:16.250> there

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
rubber it's missing like it is on there

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:24.100 
rubber it's missing like it is on there
you<00:03:17.420> can<00:03:17.690> buy<00:03:19.810> tubing<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.940> what<00:03:23.269> you<00:03:23.390> do<00:03:23.660> you

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
you can buy tubing and what you do you

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.580 
you can buy tubing and what you do you
just<00:03:24.350> moisten<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:26.600> valve<00:03:26.930> with<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.290> little<00:03:27.500> bit

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
just moisten the valve with a little bit

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.250 
just moisten the valve with a little bit
of<00:03:27.620> spittle<00:03:28.070> just<00:03:28.250> I'll<00:03:29.209> just<00:03:29.480> lick<00:03:29.989> you<00:03:30.110> my

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
of spittle just I'll just lick you my

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.750 
of spittle just I'll just lick you my
finger<00:03:30.590> there<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.860> make<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.040> little<00:03:31.280> bit<00:03:31.489> where

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
finger there to make a little bit where

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.920 
finger there to make a little bit where
and<00:03:32.480> push<00:03:33.280> I'm<00:03:34.280> not<00:03:34.519> I<00:03:34.700> notice<00:03:35.120> it<00:03:35.329> just<00:03:35.360> just

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
and push I'm not I notice it just just

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.710 
and push I'm not I notice it just just
made<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:36.320> wet<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:37.390> then<00:03:39.310> push<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.519> rubber

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
made that wet and then push the rubber

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.470 
made that wet and then push the rubber
in<00:03:41.720> place<00:03:42.820> like<00:03:43.820> so<00:03:45.250> so<00:03:46.250> it<00:03:46.370> goes<00:03:46.579> over<00:03:46.880> the

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
in place like so so it goes over the

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.110 
in place like so so it goes over the
shoulder<00:03:48.130> once<00:03:49.130> it's<00:03:49.340> over<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.610> shoulder

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
shoulder once it's over the shoulder

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.979 
shoulder once it's over the shoulder
just<00:03:53.120> going<00:03:53.360> to<00:03:53.420> grab<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:53.600> pair<00:03:53.870> of<00:03:53.900> scissors

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
just going to grab a pair of scissors

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.789 
just going to grab a pair of scissors
and<00:03:54.500> chop<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:55.730> remainder<00:03:56.090> off<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:57.530> then<00:03:57.680> it's

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
and chop the remainder off and then it's

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.060 
and chop the remainder off and then it's
usable<00:03:58.220> so<00:03:58.910> that's<00:03:59.090> no<00:03:59.269> perfectly<00:03:59.690> usable

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
usable so that's no perfectly usable

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
usable so that's no perfectly usable

that's all there is to words we have
