okay<00:00:01.170> guys<00:00:01.380> so<00:00:01.530> we<00:00:02.340> got<00:00:02.520> here<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:02.909> phantom<00:00:03.300> 2

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
okay guys so we got here the phantom 2

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.210 
okay guys so we got here the phantom 2
vision<00:00:03.980> from<00:00:04.980> DJI<00:00:05.839> this<00:00:06.839> is<00:00:07.109> not<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.740> Phantom

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
vision from DJI this is not the Phantom

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.150 
vision from DJI this is not the Phantom
it's<00:00:08.460> not<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.940> phantom<00:00:09.420> 2<00:00:09.599> this<00:00:10.440> phantom<00:00:10.980> 2

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
it's not the phantom 2 this phantom 2

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.270 
it's not the phantom 2 this phantom 2
vision<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.480> third<00:00:12.830> copter<00:00:13.830> today<00:00:14.070> made

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
vision so is the third copter today made

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.880 
vision so is the third copter today made
it's<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.880> quad<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.470> I'm<00:00:16.470> going<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.650> make<00:00:16.770> this

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
it's a quad and I'm going to make this

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.370 
it's a quad and I'm going to make this
one<00:00:17.070> short<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.760> purely<00:00:18.119> about

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
one short this is purely about

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.840 
one short this is purely about
calibrating<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.980> not<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.460> GPS

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
calibrating it and this is not the GPS

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.140 
calibrating it and this is not the GPS
calibration<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.519> then<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.640> problem<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.090> I

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
calibration and then the problem that I

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.179 
calibration and then the problem that I
had<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:24.539> when<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.779> bought<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.769> did<00:00:26.010> not

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
had with when I bought it is I did not

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.310 
had with when I bought it is I did not
understand<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.300> don't<00:00:27.359> think<00:00:27.599> Colleen's

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
understand and I don't think Colleen's

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.400 
understand and I don't think Colleen's
made<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.830> very<00:00:29.160> easy<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.210> understand<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:30.929> I'm

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
made it very easy to understand so I'm

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:40.310 
made it very easy to understand so I'm
not<00:00:31.590> plugging<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.009> battery<00:00:39.079> just<00:00:40.079> for<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
not plugging the battery just for the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.840 
not plugging the battery just for the
sake<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> argument<00:00:40.800> I'm<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.489> power

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
sake of the argument I'm going to power

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.720 
sake of the argument I'm going to power
on<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> remote<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.309> Wi-Fi<00:00:44.840> repeater<00:00:47.629> so

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
on the remote and the Wi-Fi repeater so

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.689 
on the remote and the Wi-Fi repeater so
when<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.850> want<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.090> calibrate<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.719> right<00:00:52.140> now

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
when you want to calibrate it right now

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.000 
when you want to calibrate it right now
the<00:00:53.699> yellow<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.840> orange<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:56.850> beeping

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
the yellow the orange here are beeping

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.529 
the yellow the orange here are beeping
so<00:00:59.010> I'm<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> put<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.000> calibration<00:01:00.329> mode

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
so I'm going to put in calibration mode

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.450 
so I'm going to put in calibration mode
of<00:01:00.690> course<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.960> already<00:01:01.050> know<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.460> you're

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
of course you already know this you're

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.910 
of course you already know this you're
going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.640> click<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.030> s1<00:01:03.719> about<00:01:04.470> 10<00:01:04.650> times

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
going to click this s1 about 10 times

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.580 
going to click this s1 about 10 times
and<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:06.270> once<00:01:06.960> they<00:01:07.110> are<00:01:07.170> steady<00:01:12.380> okay<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.439> now

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and now once they are steady okay so now

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.850 
and now once they are steady okay so now
we<00:01:13.650> got<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> steady<00:01:14.250> yellow<00:01:14.520> light<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.860> because

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
we got a steady yellow light and because

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.740 
we got a steady yellow light and because
I<00:01:16.950> love<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> tail<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:17.970> what<00:01:18.210> my<00:01:18.360> table<00:01:18.689> is

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
I love the tail this is what my table is

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.940 
I love the tail this is what my table is
going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.900> be<00:01:18.990> much<00:01:19.140> easier<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.470> me<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:19.890> I'm

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
going to be much easier for me so I'm

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.260 
going to be much easier for me so I'm
just<00:01:20.009> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.310> spin<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.610> at<00:01:21.299> 360<00:01:22.259> degrees<00:01:23.270> and

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
just going to spin it at 360 degrees and

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.690 
just going to spin it at 360 degrees and
this<00:01:24.540> will<00:01:24.720> become<00:01:24.990> green<00:01:25.220> you<00:01:26.220> say<00:01:26.400> it's

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
this will become green you say it's

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.880 
this will become green you say it's
green<00:01:26.939> now<00:01:27.350> calibration<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.590> complete

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
green now calibration is not complete

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.039 
green now calibration is not complete
yet<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.670> you're<00:01:29.790> going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.939> turn<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.990> this

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
yet so you're going to turn it like this

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.760 
yet so you're going to turn it like this
and<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:32.400> one<00:01:32.640> more<00:01:32.909> spin<00:01:33.299> around<00:01:33.630> its<00:01:34.049> axis<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
and do one more spin around its axis and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.980 
and do one more spin around its axis and
now<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.130> watch<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:36.060> will<00:01:36.270> turn<00:01:36.509> off

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
now just watch this this will turn off

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.090 
now just watch this this will turn off
okay<00:01:39.650> now<00:01:40.650> it's<00:01:41.009> calibrated<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.920> when<00:01:43.920> they

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
okay now it's calibrated so when they

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.230 
okay now it's calibrated so when they
show<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.579> they<00:01:44.670> give<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> impression

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
show that they give you the impression

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.600 
show that they give you the impression
like<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.930> light<00:01:46.079> has<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.560> stay<00:01:46.740> green<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.520> it

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
like the light has to stay green but it

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.370 
like the light has to stay green but it
doesn't<00:01:48.000> once<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.630> turn<00:01:48.810> around<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.259> going

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
doesn't once you turn around it's going

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.920 
doesn't once you turn around it's going
to<00:01:49.439> come<00:01:49.619> back<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.220> yellow<00:01:50.930> flashing

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
to come back in this yellow flashing

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.219 
to come back in this yellow flashing
here<00:01:52.140> means<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.619> still<00:01:52.710> searching<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
here means it's still searching for the

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.420 
here means it's still searching for the
GPS<00:01:55.229> signal<00:01:55.619> which<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:55.920> will<00:01:56.009> never<00:01:56.159> get

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
GPS signal which we will never get

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.459 
GPS signal which we will never get
because<00:01:56.610> I'm<00:01:56.820> inside<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.840> that's<00:01:58.020> how<00:01:58.170> that's

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
because I'm inside so that's how that's

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.810 
because I'm inside so that's how that's
how<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:58.979> keep<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.250> mind<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.460> do<00:01:59.670> not

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
how it is so keep in mind you do not

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.139 
how it is so keep in mind you do not
need<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:01.200> get<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.890> green

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
need to get the green

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.590 
need to get the green
steady<00:02:03.630> green<00:02:03.960> after<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.590> do<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.280> second<00:02:05.729> 360

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
steady green after you do the second 360

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.749 
steady green after you do the second 360
rotation<00:02:06.960> they<00:02:07.590> will<00:02:07.710> turn<00:02:07.890> off<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.640> you're

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
rotation they will turn off and you're

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.719 
rotation they will turn off and you're
going<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.910> get<00:02:09.090> back<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.539> blinking<00:02:10.080> yellow

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
going to get back the blinking yellow

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.390 
going to get back the blinking yellow
we're<00:02:11.660> orange<00:02:12.020> we<00:02:12.110> want<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.319> call<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:13.129> it's

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
we're orange we want to call it and it's
