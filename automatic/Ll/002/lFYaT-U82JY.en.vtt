 Land Flat Guides - Part 1: The Blank Theater 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:13.800
 This is part of a series of guides that will help you understand the design of the flat ground we live on and who are effective in the trick of hiding what it is about you 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:23.040
 The function you have to look at is built on another plot around us for decades called the Space Program 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.420
 Most of those who watch this section are aware of what is going on around NASA's theories of "conspiracy" 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.800
 Apollo Program, Space Shuttle, International Space Station and so on 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.340
 The function itself is not based on any of these topics which are highly controversial 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.620
 But on the lack of a definitive film specifically based on realistic events 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.760
 This function - like any other in the string - is something you can make sure of yourself 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.340
 All you need to do is search the web, 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.680
 For a start, think of all the movies you have seen throughout your life and that contain travel to space 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.660
 It will begin with months: space war, spacewalk, strangers just mention some 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:15.740
 In fact if you look at your own list you will come across more than a hundred different films and your sweat is not dripping tired, this part is easy 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:28.940
 On the other hand, as a second list, he tried to find films that were not based on fantasy. They would come on films like the Red Planet, Gravity, Mission to Mars, 2001 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.380
 These films usually do not rely on a glum look in the future 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.660
 So that we are close to realizing it as a reality 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.960
 The list remains quite long 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.320
 These first two films were encouraged by influential people 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.260
 Because they re-imposed the theory of spherical ground by assumption 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.920
 The entertainment system introduced the spherical earth scenes and the concept of the solar system as a gift 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.020
 It is therefore identical to the real view of the earth 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.540
 In other words, if you use your aid to disbelieve and you see a movie like gravity 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.900
 Your eyes re-impose the film as a reality at the top of your world 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:21.020
 The more you watch and enjoy these kinds of movies, the more the lines between what you want to believe and what you've already learned will fade 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.860
 Watch enough movies about Mars and be less surprised if NASA announces a real mission to Mars 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.320
 The same applies to the Moon and other solar system and so on 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:42.120
 The launch of the 2001 Space Odyssey in 1968 before the launch of the real moon flights was no accident 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:53.600
 He took one of the greatest directors of his age five years to take him out and many people who saw the film in the cinema at the time claimed that they read the thank-you for several military in the index of the end of the film, only to be deleted after years 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.520
 But the 2001 film is just a side note of this connotation 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.840
 For those who really want to explore the hidden visions of Stanley Kubrick's films I strongly advise them to film room 237 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.680
 The movie link is also sorry 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.500
 Now you're surrounded by the first two sets of space movies 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.360
 There are films that contain a large amount of fantasy and films that try to paint the features of the near future 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.000
 These two groups are easy to find 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.260
 The third set is the challenge and again this is what makes things interesting. The missions to go to the moon ended in 1972 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.960
 To date, it is considered the greatest achievement of mankind 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.320
 No single film based on real events was produced until the documentary material was released in 1983 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.000
 Now you may say that it is only 11 years and it is possible that it is difficult to take production rights and so on ... 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.840
 But that's not what makes the film interesting 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:04:00.060
 The film was a very long 1983 show and came in 3 hours 12 minutes, watching it exhausting, addressing the process of selecting astronauts 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:11.160
 Competitions and training facilities themselves, but when the time-series displays are displayed only after 3 hours they display tasks in low Earth orbit 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.640
 Just look for the right staff: (Wright Stav) and see how much space you can find! 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.920
 The film won four Oscars and brought great returns at the box office, but Apollo's missions were not even touched 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:36.040
 The only other film that showed the real program of the moon voyages was Apollo 13 in 1995 after 12 full years 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:44.120
 Apollo 13 covered only a single orbit around the moon, no attempt to land, no approach to the real events of previous trips or places of landing on the Moon 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.700
 After 1995 ... this is all and nothing beyond him at all 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.720
 Hollywood is known to leave no trace without stirring up and re-producing from almost every corner of every story or idea that may generate money 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:05.560
 Here is about 60 years old and there is no one film dealing with the landing on the moon based on real events 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.320
 Hundreds of references to him in science fiction movies 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.540
 Everything from Superman to Transformers 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.220
 But literally nothing covers the surface of the moon 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:25.040
 Six full missions to the moon contained vehicles, lunar vehicles and golf, and no one wants to touch these events 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.420
 Now to be fair there is a television series in 1998 covered the subject 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.660
 It was produced by Tom Hanks 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.860
 Which overlapped due to his Apollo 13 movie trailer 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.740
 There is no professional production of any level since that time 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.600
 Once again for fun, search for a series of stories from the Earth to the Moon and see what you will find! 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.540
 The: Why easy and clear indication 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.000
 If Hollywood produced a film about the landing on the moon it could be distinguished from the real 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.820
 So how do you know which is real? 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.500
 It will also raise questions about site preparation techniques and how much time has been set 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.840
 If Hollywood can fake it now 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.660
 When was the first time I found the possibility 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.040
 There is another film standing alone 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.480
 I refer to him because I do not believe how he could be made 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.040
 It is Capricon Wen 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.240
 The film focuses on how to produce a trick for a mission to Mars 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.560
 In short, it is part of the Bible of global conspiracies 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.340
 I strongly recommend to see it and its link below 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.820
 To summarize ... all space films were encouraged by the influential 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.440
 Except for those that have real events 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.620
 Those are not allowed 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.860
 The landing program on the moon is buried entertainment (film industry) because the moon can not be reached 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.340
 Either it is out of reach or it is a high-resolution image 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.280
 Like any planet you see when you enter a video game 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.180
 The world is flat 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.360
 This passage is only one indication 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.900
 You do some research and ask some questions
