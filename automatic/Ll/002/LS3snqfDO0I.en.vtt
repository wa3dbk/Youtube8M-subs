it's<00:00:13.400> about<00:00:13.580> back<00:00:13.970> to<00:00:14.150> where<00:00:14.330> we<00:00:14.450> started<00:00:15.010> now

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
it's about back to where we started now

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.800 
it's about back to where we started now
remember<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:16.640> first<00:00:16.670> shrink<00:00:17.300> brought<00:00:17.630> the

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
remember the first shrink brought the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.040 
remember the first shrink brought the
edge<00:00:17.930> down<00:00:18.260> about<00:00:18.560> 3/8<00:00:19.040> of<00:00:19.220> an<00:00:19.340> inch<00:00:19.810> now<00:00:20.810> we're

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
edge down about 3/8 of an inch now we're

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.109 
edge down about 3/8 of an inch now we're
down<00:00:21.230> about<00:00:21.500> oh<00:00:22.750> I'd<00:00:23.750> say<00:00:23.810> 5/8<00:00:24.500> of<00:00:24.710> an<00:00:24.830> inch

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
down about oh I'd say 5/8 of an inch

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.720 
down about oh I'd say 5/8 of an inch
9/16<00:00:26.119> 5/8<00:00:26.509> so<00:00:26.869> almost<00:00:27.710> twice<00:00:28.009> as<00:00:28.189> much<00:00:28.369> as<00:00:28.579> we

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
9/16 5/8 so almost twice as much as we

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.620 
9/16 5/8 so almost twice as much as we
had<00:00:28.910> it<00:00:29.060> first

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
had it first

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.749 
had it first
and<00:00:29.720> again<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:30.739> shrinking<00:00:31.220> action<00:00:31.640> the

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
and again the shrinking action the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.770 
and again the shrinking action the
doming<00:00:32.119> action<00:00:32.540> goes<00:00:33.230> in<00:00:33.470> almost<00:00:33.920> two<00:00:34.250> inches

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
doming action goes in almost two inches

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.729 
doming action goes in almost two inches
so<00:00:35.780> far<00:00:36.020> so<00:00:36.230> good

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
so far so good

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.040 
so far so good
okay<00:00:37.700> what<00:00:37.940> if<00:00:38.030> we<00:00:38.120> want<00:00:38.329> to<00:00:38.420> make<00:00:38.570> this<00:00:38.720> a<00:00:38.780> nice

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
okay what if we want to make this a nice

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.470 
okay what if we want to make this a nice
complete<00:00:39.500> curve<00:00:40.040> with<00:00:40.610> a<00:00:40.640> gentle<00:00:41.059> curve<00:00:41.270> all

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
complete curve with a gentle curve all

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.200 
complete curve with a gentle curve all
the<00:00:41.600> way<00:00:41.719> from<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.050> edge<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:42.680> edge<00:00:42.890> to<00:00:43.760> do<00:00:43.940> that

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
the way from the edge to edge to do that

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.800 
the way from the edge to edge to do that
I'm<00:00:44.450> going<00:00:44.630> to<00:00:44.720> have<00:00:44.930> to<00:00:45.080> dome<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:46.010> center<00:00:46.400> and

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
I'm going to have to dome the center and

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.010 
I'm going to have to dome the center and
this<00:00:47.810> machine<00:00:48.080> doesn't<00:00:48.740> do<00:00:48.950> that<00:00:49.600> so<00:00:50.600> a<00:00:50.630> good

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
this machine doesn't do that so a good

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.610 
this machine doesn't do that so a good
way<00:00:51.080> to<00:00:51.230> dome<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:51.770> center<00:00:52.160> is<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:53.690> work<00:00:54.380> with<00:00:54.590> a

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
way to dome the center is to work with a

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.910 
way to dome the center is to work with a
mallet<00:00:54.980> in<00:00:55.310> sandbag<00:00:57.190> so<00:00:58.190> here's<00:00:58.490> the<00:00:58.640> sandbag

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
mallet in sandbag so here's the sandbag

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.740 
mallet in sandbag so here's the sandbag
I've<00:01:00.920> got<00:01:01.160> a<00:01:01.190> selection<00:01:01.550> of<00:01:01.850> mallets<00:01:02.180> I<00:01:02.420> think

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
I've got a selection of mallets I think

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.109 
I've got a selection of mallets I think
I'll<00:01:02.870> use<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.260> largest<00:01:03.530> mallet<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:04.339> what<00:01:05.030> I'm

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
I'll use the largest mallet and what I'm

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.410 
I'll use the largest mallet and what I'm
going<00:01:05.329> to<00:01:05.420> do<00:01:05.689> is<00:01:06.079> to<00:01:06.619> work<00:01:07.460> from<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:07.909> inside

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
going to do is to work from the inside

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.710 
going to do is to work from the inside
into<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.259> sandbag<00:01:09.860> with<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:10.970> nose<00:01:11.210> of<00:01:11.600> the

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
into the sandbag with the nose of the

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.899 
into the sandbag with the nose of the
largest<00:01:12.020> mallet<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:12.799> you'll<00:01:13.399> see<00:01:13.610> that<00:01:13.759> that

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
largest mallet and you'll see that that

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.320 
largest mallet and you'll see that that
domes<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.390> metal<00:01:14.720> pretty<00:01:14.960> quickly<00:01:19.330> there's

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
domes the metal pretty quickly there's

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.010 
domes the metal pretty quickly there's
four<00:01:20.659> hits<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.040> can<00:01:22.250> see<00:01:22.400> it's<00:01:22.520> moving

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
four hits so you can see it's moving

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.780 
four hits so you can see it's moving
doesn't<00:01:24.020> look<00:01:24.170> very<00:01:24.200> nice<00:01:24.680> now<00:01:25.010> but<00:01:25.310> trust<00:01:25.610> me

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
doesn't look very nice now but trust me

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.550 
doesn't look very nice now but trust me
I<00:01:25.940> know<00:01:26.090> how<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.420> make<00:01:26.659> it<00:01:26.810> look<00:01:26.930> nice<00:01:27.200> in<00:01:27.440> the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
I know how to make it look nice in the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:56.730 
I know how to make it look nice in the
end

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.510 

so<00:01:57.370> there's<00:01:57.610> what<00:01:57.850> we've<00:01:58.000> got<00:01:58.830> so<00:01:59.830> the<00:02:00.159> work<00:02:00.369> I

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
so there's what we've got so the work I

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.280 
so there's what we've got so the work I
did<00:02:00.729> with<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.000> shrinker<00:02:01.510> brought<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.110> edge

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
did with the shrinker brought the edge

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.530 
did with the shrinker brought the edge
down<00:02:02.619> about<00:02:02.950> five<00:02:03.250> eighths<00:02:03.460> of<00:02:03.610> an<00:02:03.729> inch<00:02:03.850> the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
down about five eighths of an inch the

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.969 
down about five eighths of an inch the
work<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:04.900> did<00:02:04.960> with<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.320> mallet<00:02:05.650> and<00:02:05.740> bag

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
work I did with the mallet and bag

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.010 
work I did with the mallet and bag
brought<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.460> center<00:02:06.820> up<00:02:06.970> about<00:02:07.690> another

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
brought the center up about another

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.749 
brought the center up about another
three<00:02:08.440> quarters<00:02:08.770> of<00:02:08.890> an<00:02:08.979> inch<00:02:09.100> so<00:02:09.399> we<00:02:09.520> have<00:02:09.729> a

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
three quarters of an inch so we have a

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.449 
three quarters of an inch so we have a
fairly<00:02:10.209> deep<00:02:10.630> dome<00:02:10.929> now<00:02:11.200> more<00:02:11.950> than<00:02:12.100> an<00:02:12.250> inch

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
fairly deep dome now more than an inch

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.040 
fairly deep dome now more than an inch
of<00:02:12.640> doming<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.270> that<00:02:13.450> happened<00:02:13.780> pretty<00:02:13.930> fast

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
of doming and that happened pretty fast

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.740 
of doming and that happened pretty fast
right<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.580> wouldn't<00:02:15.819> take<00:02:15.940> much<00:02:16.120> bondo<00:02:16.630> to

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
right and it wouldn't take much bondo to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.970 
right and it wouldn't take much bondo to
smooth<00:02:17.020> this<00:02:17.170> no<00:02:17.970> well-well<00:02:18.970> smooth<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:19.569> out

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
smooth this no well-well smooth this out

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.600 
smooth this no well-well smooth this out
any<00:02:20.980> any<00:02:21.489> questions<00:02:21.940> so<00:02:22.120> far<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:24.280> how<00:02:24.430> do<00:02:24.489> you

any any questions so far so how do you

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.520 
any any questions so far so how do you
smooth<00:02:24.880> out<00:02:25.030> lumpy<00:02:25.450> metal<00:02:25.810> that's<00:02:26.140> something

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
smooth out lumpy metal that's something

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.350 
smooth out lumpy metal that's something
we<00:02:26.680> all<00:02:26.860> deal<00:02:27.100> with<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.550> working<00:02:27.700> on<00:02:27.940> old<00:02:28.090> cars

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
we all deal with and working on old cars

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.780 
we all deal with and working on old cars
they<00:02:29.080> always<00:02:29.470> have<00:02:29.680> lumpy<00:02:30.070> metal<00:02:30.370> on<00:02:30.489> it<00:02:30.519> and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
they always have lumpy metal on it and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.520 
they always have lumpy metal on it and
if<00:02:31.390> you're<00:02:31.570> making<00:02:31.720> something<00:02:32.080> from<00:02:32.320> new

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
if you're making something from new

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.650 
if you're making something from new
metal<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.280> looks<00:02:33.580> pretty<00:02:33.790> lumpy<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.390> start

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
metal it looks pretty lumpy to start

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.750 
metal it looks pretty lumpy to start
with<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.230> early<00:02:35.530> stages<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:36.010> shaping<00:02:36.580> it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
with in the early stages of shaping it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.110 
with in the early stages of shaping it
tends<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.540> look<00:02:37.810> lumpy<00:02:38.640> well<00:02:39.640> there's<00:02:39.970> many

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
tends to look lumpy well there's many
