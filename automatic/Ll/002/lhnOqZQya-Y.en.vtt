just<00:03:33.040> some<00:03:33.220> fish<00:03:34.380> then<00:03:35.380> pop<00:03:35.590> her<00:03:35.710> on<00:03:35.830> top

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.450 

just<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.500> be<00:03:41.590> sure<00:03:41.620> I'm<00:03:41.980> gonna<00:03:42.100> go<00:03:42.280> around

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
just to be sure I'm gonna go around

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.910 
just to be sure I'm gonna go around
corners<00:03:42.790> as<00:03:43.180> well<00:03:45.690> press<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.870> down<00:03:46.930> then

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
corners as well press that down then

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.700 
corners as well press that down then
I'll<00:03:48.010> go<00:03:48.160> in<00:03:48.280> with<00:03:48.310> my<00:03:48.580> little<00:03:48.790> spatula<00:03:49.150> tool

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
I'll go in with my little spatula tool

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.570 
I'll go in with my little spatula tool
and<00:03:50.710> I<00:03:51.040> will<00:03:51.370> cut<00:03:51.820> right<00:03:52.120> across<00:03:53.400> lining<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.490> up

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
and I will cut right across lining it up

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:07.140 
and I will cut right across lining it up
with<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.820> wafer<00:03:55.030> paper

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.900 

once<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:07.870> have<00:04:07.989> that<00:04:08.170> curl<00:04:09.099> the<00:04:10.050> end<00:04:11.910> just

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
once you have that curl the end just

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.839 
once you have that curl the end just
where<00:04:13.150> you<00:04:13.269> want<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.650> so<00:04:14.650> just<00:04:15.069> after<00:04:15.370> there

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
where you want it so just after there

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.379 
where you want it so just after there
just<00:04:16.090> before<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.600> J<00:04:17.139> for<00:04:17.470> Jessica<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:19.150> press

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
just before the J for Jessica and press

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.550 
just before the J for Jessica and press
that<00:04:19.600> down<00:04:19.680> do<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.739> same<00:04:20.979> for<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.220> other<00:04:21.340> side

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
that down do the same for the other side

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.320 
that down do the same for the other side
so<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.770> writing<00:04:24.070> is<00:04:24.280> almost<00:04:24.760> C<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.970> then<00:04:28.150> let

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
so the writing is almost C and then let

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.570 
so the writing is almost C and then let
this<00:04:28.449> dry<00:04:28.660> overnight<00:04:28.770> but<00:04:29.770> upside<00:04:30.160> down<00:04:30.370> and

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
this dry overnight but upside down and

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.909 
this dry overnight but upside down and
that<00:04:30.669> way<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:30.880> get<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.030> nice<00:04:31.270> flat<00:04:32.050> sign

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
that way you get a nice flat sign

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.530 
that way you get a nice flat sign
otherwise<00:04:33.280> you<00:04:33.550> end<00:04:33.580> up<00:04:33.820> having<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.180> warped

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
otherwise you end up having a warped

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.290 
otherwise you end up having a warped
kind<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:35.310> thing<00:04:36.310> going<00:04:36.490> on<00:04:36.669> if<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:37.000> like<00:04:37.150> that

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
kind of thing going on if you like that

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.550 
kind of thing going on if you like that
look<00:04:37.389> you<00:04:37.510> just<00:04:37.660> leave<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:37.990> like<00:04:38.020> that<00:04:38.110> I'll

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
look you just leave it like that I'll

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.140 
look you just leave it like that I'll
add<00:04:38.710> my<00:04:38.889> sign<00:04:39.130> to<00:04:39.280> dry<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.520> little<00:04:39.669> bit<00:04:39.820> and<00:04:39.940> then

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
add my sign to dry a little bit and then

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.490 
add my sign to dry a little bit and then
I<00:04:40.240> stood<00:04:40.479> it<00:04:40.600> upright<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.139> gave<00:04:41.229> it<00:04:41.350> a<00:04:41.410> little

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
I stood it upright and gave it a little

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.350 
I stood it upright and gave it a little
bit<00:04:41.650> of<00:04:41.800> curve<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.790> let<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.060> dry<00:04:43.330> overnight

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
bit of curve and let it dry overnight

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.870 
bit of curve and let it dry overnight
like<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:44.050> next<00:04:45.010> I've<00:04:45.130> got<00:04:45.160> my<00:04:45.490> little

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
like that next I've got my little

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.550 
like that next I've got my little
blossom<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.970> I'm<00:04:52.090> going<00:04:52.240> to<00:04:52.330> punch<00:04:52.540> it<00:04:52.780> in

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
blossom and I'm going to punch it in

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:11.640 
blossom and I'm going to punch it in
between<00:04:54.120> each<00:04:55.120> of<00:04:55.150> these

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.680 

and<00:05:12.160> I<00:05:12.280> also<00:05:12.400> decided<00:05:12.790> be<00:05:13.000> a<00:05:13.030> good<00:05:13.210> idea<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.570> add

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
and I also decided be a good idea to add

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.580 
and I also decided be a good idea to add
one<00:05:13.870> of<00:05:13.960> the<00:05:14.020> top<00:05:14.230> two<00:05:15.900> just<00:05:16.900> around<00:05:17.170> one<00:05:17.560> of

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
one of the top two just around one of

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.410 
one of the top two just around one of
those<00:05:17.800> perimeter<00:05:18.340> wouldn't<00:05:18.970> add<00:05:19.060> any<00:05:19.240> on<00:05:19.330> the

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
those perimeter wouldn't add any on the

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.350 
those perimeter wouldn't add any on the
top<00:05:19.600> I'm<00:05:19.810> like<00:05:19.960> too<00:05:20.200> much<00:05:20.820> comes<00:05:21.820> out<00:05:22.000> fizzle

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
top I'm like too much comes out fizzle

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.510 
top I'm like too much comes out fizzle
preference<00:05:22.750> anyway

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.270 

put<00:05:28.030> this<00:05:28.150> last<00:05:28.389> step<00:05:28.600> find<00:05:29.410> which<00:05:29.740> he<00:05:30.039> is<00:05:30.100> a

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
put this last step find which he is a

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.629 
put this last step find which he is a
previous<00:05:30.880> section<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.600> make<00:05:31.780> other<00:05:32.020> fight

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
previous section and make other fight

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.020 
previous section and make other fight
and<00:05:33.639> then<00:05:33.789> position<00:05:34.270> your<00:05:34.300> kicked<00:05:35.259> up<00:05:35.940> just<00:05:36.940> in

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
and then position your kicked up just in

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.159 
and then position your kicked up just in
the<00:05:37.090> middle<00:05:37.330> maybe<00:05:37.509> a<00:05:37.630> little<00:05:37.840> bit<00:05:37.990> more

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
the middle maybe a little bit more

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.400 
the middle maybe a little bit more
forward<00:05:38.470> or<00:05:39.250> is<00:05:39.370> it's<00:05:39.550> nice<00:05:39.759> even<00:05:40.449> kind<00:05:41.380> of

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
forward or is it's nice even kind of

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.050 
forward or is it's nice even kind of
bring<00:05:41.620> it<00:05:41.680> back<00:05:41.949> to<00:05:42.400> me<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:45.520> I'm<00:05:45.639> also<00:05:45.759> adding

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
bring it back to me and I'm also adding

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.909 
bring it back to me and I'm also adding
a<00:05:46.210> little<00:05:46.389> bit<00:05:46.479> of<00:05:46.569> cream<00:05:46.810> at<00:05:46.960> the<00:05:47.050> back<00:05:47.470> just

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
a little bit of cream at the back just

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:56.490 
a little bit of cream at the back just
to<00:05:48.729> keep<00:05:48.880> it<00:05:49.060> anchored<00:05:54.870> and<00:05:55.870> that's<00:05:56.199> how<00:05:56.349> it's

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
to keep it anchored and that's how it's

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.909 
to keep it anchored and that's how it's
done

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
done

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.200 
done
