 all this freedom she gets anti 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.960
 Roma considered very Iberian 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.150

 more named first the situation is very 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.910
 difficult 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.430
 estimating several huge 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.610
 of course you have to go around the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:32.630
 table be sent traitors and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:32.630
 teacher putties

 150 euros strong 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.990
 divided greening even though this launched some 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:58.740
 passes and will go to reindeer were 250 euros 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:02:03.570
 for 3 6-1 Figaro Beneteau 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.890
 these two tables had the upper hand on 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.350
 tracks and devices like both 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.750
 hours if maintaining 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.030
 there are some who like salted butter we go 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.459
 put back also allowed a little rain 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.410
 sugar that is the same 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.410
 heel the isr each layer of dough 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.880
 well done that police the places of 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.269
 drama 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.269
 during the drama and benefits from it 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.350
 morning what is called precisely 9th 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.769
 purpose for my book is worthless nada a 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.769
 bullet drawn 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:30.730
 the military had the most ugly 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.550
 ascending course to bafoussam will become 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.980
 a fuel will diminish if I enjoyed 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.820
 is very hot as a unit like you 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.850
 have reduced his defense is a little 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.610
 Characteristic back the role is cited where 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.910
 ageas and cats so we are 26 the period 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.990
 where there has tirades 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.440
 and you if you have at home at the 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.690
 cooking in general I decided to change 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:03.010
 our regions determined in the gloves 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:06.490
 purpose of the flying duisis so we have 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:14.500
 taken this stage I'm vibrating at the rhythm already 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:19.690
 three basic Japanese layers for 3 if 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:22.570
 these people but romelu pop have hit home 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.260
 basically know belvedere 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.420
 after then those here we here less 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.480
 on that side we put poor people 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:37.390
 to do it a day next here is 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.920
 the one involved to keep a long time and 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.950
 for example I heard golden 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.650
 disinhibit others as it is if it does not 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.680
 doesnt that the star as well as 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.690
 pump the chu and not reject the 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.780
 things because there are plenty of friends 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.540
 sweet concentrated very nice but 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.070
 a problem a focus a contrast so 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.490
 underwater and on board have all done 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:04.000
 alpha on some of the temple toilets 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:11.650
 and all armies of Lyon can more 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:14.200
 nice plus the rest that's it then 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:21.970
 advantage well tell a dead but 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:25.930
 denis where had this is no need 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.640
 that's basically so but from 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.230
 Armagnac going from the fruits of their 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.240
 trip from a camp but in the way 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:35.190
 marginal of tomorrow 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.080
 secret making damask people 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:42.280
 that's high tech barriac in two 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.849
 high school spoon so he then leaves for 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.849
 Armagnac 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.169
 because the way actually like that and 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.539
 then at 200 degrees for 40 minutes 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.520
 you have made it very bright and 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:57.370
 the more the pole that's why it's 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.620
 against x send them so projects 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.330
 presented of the romantine mad of Armagnac 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.199
 above the cape and we they indicate 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:08.710
 often there is not only the baule and there I 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:12.430
 add a little pinch it's ironic 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.530
 it's good but when we go into the 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.759
 romance rose to sugar and original 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:20.590
 so we always have a little bit of sugar 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:23.560
 and banana that pushes her to always go 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.360
 scare the old and then what is 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.349
 alright but you have to thank roger 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:33.099
 milla that never target cold in them 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:38.460
 rades la nive in 2006 have colonized 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:38.460
 close is not good so I see it there 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.980
 in the day several bases on 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:48.030
 I patients, which is our little 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:52.080
 veal of the coustilles see the devils 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.080
 and drop it off 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:05.210
 and that's what compares to betting on 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:09.020
 and here you have finished you then this is the 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:12.520
 softness in a finished container and 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.520
 Obviously I did not mad 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.760
 and that's all this talent
