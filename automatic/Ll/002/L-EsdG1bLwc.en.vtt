00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
know let the fish try to tell you what

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.510 
know let the fish try to tell you what
they<00:01:18.700> want<00:01:19.000> on<00:01:19.210> that<00:01:19.240> given<00:01:19.780> day<00:01:20.069> but<00:01:21.069> the<00:01:21.340> one

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
thing I can tell you that is a constant

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.410 
thing I can tell you that is a constant
is<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.289> way<00:01:23.619> that<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:24.099> actually<00:01:24.369> jerk<00:01:25.090> debate

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
is the way that you actually jerk debate

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.199 
is the way that you actually jerk debate
is<00:01:25.630> very<00:01:26.440> very<00:01:26.739> critical<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.520> maximize<00:01:28.000> the

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:28.209 
is very very critical to maximize the

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:29.969 
is very very critical to maximize the
action<00:01:28.539> what<00:01:28.989> you<00:01:29.140> want<00:01:29.319> out<00:01:29.440> of<00:01:29.470> a<00:01:29.560> jerk<00:01:29.770> bait

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
action what you want out of a jerk bait

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.609 
action what you want out of a jerk bait
is<00:01:30.220> super<00:01:30.910> erratic<00:01:31.390> side-to-side<00:01:31.869> never<00:01:32.410> go

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
is super erratic side-to-side never go

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.020 
is super erratic side-to-side never go
to<00:01:32.709> the<00:01:32.800> same<00:01:33.009> place<00:01:33.310> twice

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
to the same place twice

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.419 
to the same place twice
type<00:01:34.270> action<00:01:34.899> and<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.410> do<00:01:35.590> that<00:01:35.800> you<00:01:36.220> got<00:01:36.399> to

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
type action and to do that you got to

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.219 
type action and to do that you got to
fish<00:01:36.729> it<00:01:36.910> with<00:01:37.090> slack<00:01:37.420> in<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.750> line<00:01:37.899> you<00:01:38.140> know

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
fish it with slack in the line you know

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.930 
fish it with slack in the line you know
whether<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.770> use<00:01:38.890> a<00:01:38.920> bait<00:01:39.220> casting<00:01:39.580> outfit

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
whether you use a bait casting outfit

has a pretty good you know tip to it
with<00:01:47.649> some<00:01:47.860> backbone<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.310> want<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:48.700> make<00:01:48.819> that

with some backbone I want to make that

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.180 
with some backbone I want to make that
bait<00:01:49.239> jump<00:01:49.690> forward<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:50.259> really<00:01:50.440> snap<00:01:50.830> I'm

bait jump forward and really snap I'm
going<00:01:51.429> to<00:01:51.489> use<00:01:51.580> fluorocarbon<00:01:52.060> line<00:01:52.390> because

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
going to use fluorocarbon line because

that I'm always jerking it with slack in

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.680 
that I'm always jerking it with slack in
the<00:03:38.860> line<00:03:39.010> start<00:03:39.550> and<00:03:39.670> finish<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.420> all<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.570> do

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
the line start and finish and all I do

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.720 
the line start and finish and all I do
is<00:03:40.780> turn<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.170> handle<00:03:41.200> just<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.740> little<00:03:41.980> bit<00:03:42.160> to

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
is turn the handle just a little bit to

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.550 
is turn the handle just a little bit to
pick<00:03:42.940> up<00:03:43.090> that<00:03:43.240> line<00:03:43.510> this<00:03:43.930> reel<00:03:44.170> right<00:03:44.350> here

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
pick up that line this reel right here

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.920 
pick up that line this reel right here
is<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.650> high<00:03:44.830> speed<00:03:45.100> reel<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.880> brings<00:03:46.150> in<00:03:46.330> 27

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
is a high speed reel it brings in 27

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.990 
is a high speed reel it brings in 27
inches<00:03:47.170> of<00:03:47.320> line<00:03:47.470> per<00:03:47.770> turn<00:03:48.040> so<00:03:48.400> you<00:03:48.850> know<00:03:48.970> a

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
inches of line per turn so you know a

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.940 
inches of line per turn so you know a
half<00:03:49.270> a<00:03:49.390> turn<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:49.930> I'm<00:03:50.110> moving<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.530> bait<00:03:50.709> you

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
half a turn and I'm moving the bait you

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.490 
half a turn and I'm moving the bait you
know<00:03:51.280> 15<00:03:52.090> 18<00:03:52.450> inches<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:52.840> you<00:03:52.959> got<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.260> be<00:03:53.350> real

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
know 15 18 inches so you got to be real

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.860 
know 15 18 inches so you got to be real
careful<00:03:53.709> about<00:03:54.100> that<00:03:54.310> so<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.030> like<00:03:55.600> a<00:03:55.630> high

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
careful about that so I like a high

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.480 
careful about that so I like a high
speed<00:03:56.140> reel<00:03:56.350> just<00:03:56.680> because<00:03:56.860> it<00:03:56.980> makes<00:03:57.190> it<00:03:57.340> very

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
speed reel just because it makes it very

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.610 
speed reel just because it makes it very
easy<00:03:57.610> just<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.300> pick<00:03:58.900> up<00:03:59.050> that<00:03:59.170> little<00:03:59.380> bit<00:03:59.530> of

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
easy just to pick up that little bit of

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.680 
easy just to pick up that little bit of
slack<00:03:59.830> line<00:04:00.070> after<00:04:00.430> each<00:04:00.459> after<00:04:01.209> each<00:04:01.300> jerk

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
slack line after each after each jerk

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.740 
slack line after each after each jerk
and<00:04:01.930> series<00:04:02.620> of<00:04:02.770> twitches<00:04:03.390> not<00:04:04.390> moving<00:04:04.690> it

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
and series of twitches not moving it

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.780 
and series of twitches not moving it
very<00:04:04.930> far<00:04:05.110> forward<00:04:05.560> but<00:04:06.070> I'm<00:04:06.160> really<00:04:06.400> popping

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
very far forward but I'm really popping

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.850 
very far forward but I'm really popping
it<00:04:06.880> hard<00:04:07.120> with<00:04:07.660> slack<00:04:07.930> in<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.170> line<00:04:08.350> to<00:04:08.709> give

it hard with slack in the line to give
