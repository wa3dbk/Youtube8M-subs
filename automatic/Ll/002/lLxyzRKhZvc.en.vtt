the<00:02:59.370> four-inch<00:02:59.849> series<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:01.049> roughly<00:03:01.410> four

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
the four-inch series the roughly four

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.460 
the four-inch series the roughly four
inches<00:03:01.769> anyways<00:03:02.130> let's<00:03:03.060> look<00:03:03.420> at<00:03:03.599> Mario<00:03:03.989> first

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
inches anyways let's look at Mario first

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.890 
inches anyways let's look at Mario first
so<00:03:04.950> here<00:03:05.160> is<00:03:05.280> Mario<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:06.000> does<00:03:06.569> come<00:03:06.750> with<00:03:06.780> a

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
so here is Mario it does come with a

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.890 
so here is Mario it does come with a
hidden<00:03:07.170> mystery<00:03:07.799> item<00:03:08.040> there<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.790> also<00:03:09.120> Yoshi

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
hidden mystery item there is also Yoshi

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.500 
hidden mystery item there is also Yoshi
and<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:11.549> believe<00:03:11.910> there's<00:03:12.150> going<00:03:12.329> to<00:03:12.390> be<00:03:12.450> a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
and I believe there's going to be a

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.880 
and I believe there's going to be a
Wario<00:03:12.930> because<00:03:13.230> there's<00:03:13.380> Wario<00:03:13.680> on<00:03:13.799> the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
Wario because there's Wario on the

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.380 
Wario because there's Wario on the
bottom-left<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.579> think<00:03:14.849> I've<00:03:14.970> seen<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.269> online

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
bottom-left I think I've seen it online

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.140 
bottom-left I think I've seen it online
as<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:15.959> four-inch<00:03:16.500> figurine<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.190> there's

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
as this four-inch figurine and there's

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.150 
as this four-inch figurine and there's
also<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.569> Legend<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:18.989> Zelda<00:03:19.290> link<00:03:19.530> which<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.859> so

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
also a Legend of Zelda link which is so

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.470 
also a Legend of Zelda link which is so
hard<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.519> find<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:20.910> these<00:03:21.030> ones<00:03:21.239> are<00:03:21.329> already

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
hard to find and these ones are already

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.970 
hard to find and these ones are already
doubling<00:03:22.019> in<00:03:22.139> price<00:03:22.230> or<00:03:22.470> tripling<00:03:22.739> in<00:03:22.829> price

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
doubling in price or tripling in price

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.220 
doubling in price or tripling in price
on<00:03:23.160> eBay<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:24.030> those<00:03:24.180> are<00:03:24.359> usually<00:03:24.660> around

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
on eBay so those are usually around

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.979 
on eBay so those are usually around
twelve<00:03:25.650> dollars<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.579> think<00:03:26.609> 1199<00:03:27.420> in<00:03:27.540> Canada

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
twelve dollars I think 1199 in Canada

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.479 
twelve dollars I think 1199 in Canada
will<00:03:28.350> leave<00:03:28.500> Mario<00:03:28.829> over<00:03:29.010> there<00:03:29.160> just<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.400> keep

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
will leave Mario over there just to keep

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.789 
will leave Mario over there just to keep
you<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.760> idea<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:31.230> there<00:03:31.350> were<00:03:31.440> three

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
you the idea so there were three

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.229 
you the idea so there were three
different<00:03:31.889> ones<00:03:32.130> Micro<00:03:32.639> Land<00:03:32.850> two<00:03:33.060> inch

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.110 
more like $18.00 16 to 20 dollars
depending<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.519> where<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.790> are

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
depending on where you are

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.720 
depending on where you are
they<00:03:51.450> are<00:03:51.630> simply<00:03:52.019> massive<00:03:52.829> I'm<00:03:53.130> only<00:03:53.519> going

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
they are simply massive I'm only going

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.160 
they are simply massive I'm only going
to<00:03:53.790> show<00:03:53.819> Bowser<00:03:54.510> for<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.720> rest<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.989> video

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
to show Bowser for the rest of the video

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.319 
to show Bowser for the rest of the video
so<00:03:55.920> there<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.130> have<00:03:56.160> four<00:03:56.670> different<00:03:57.000> ideas

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
so there you have four different ideas

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.690 
so there you have four different ideas
and<00:03:57.750> moving<00:03:58.410> on<00:03:58.530> from<00:03:58.560> there<00:03:59.069> we<00:03:59.310> also<00:03:59.489> have

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
and moving on from there we also have

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.940 
and moving on from there we also have
other<00:04:00.120> figurines<00:04:00.540> from<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.200> same<00:04:01.440> type<00:04:01.920> of

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
other figurines from the same type of

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.849 
other figurines from the same type of
series<00:04:02.400> these<00:04:02.910> are<00:04:03.060> called<00:04:03.299> coin<00:04:03.780> racers<00:04:04.319> so

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
series these are called coin racers so

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.559 
series these are called coin racers so
these<00:04:04.950> ones<00:04:05.099> exit<00:04:05.459> talks<00:04:05.670> about<00:04:05.970> in<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.299> Mario

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
these ones exit talks about in the Mario

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.599 
these ones exit talks about in the Mario
Kart<00:04:06.630> video<00:04:06.930> last<00:04:07.139> time<00:04:07.380> you<00:04:07.829> do<00:04:07.980> have<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.160> Mario

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
Kart video last time you do have a Mario

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.180 
Kart video last time you do have a Mario
you<00:04:09.180> have<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.720> Luigi<00:04:10.169> and<00:04:10.380> you<00:04:10.470> have<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.919> Yoshi

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
you have a Luigi and you have a Yoshi

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.520 
you have a Luigi and you have a Yoshi
great<00:04:11.880> options<00:04:12.269> these<00:04:12.480> ones<00:04:12.750> are<00:04:12.959> more<00:04:13.139> like<00:04:13.349> I

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
great options these ones are more like I

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.080 
great options these ones are more like I
think<00:04:13.590> eight<00:04:13.859> to<00:04:14.040> ten<00:04:14.280> dollars<00:04:14.609> depending<00:04:15.000> on

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
think eight to ten dollars depending on

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.289 
think eight to ten dollars depending on
where<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.419> are<00:04:16.549> another<00:04:17.549> cool<00:04:17.849> little<00:04:17.880> item

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
where you are another cool little item

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.539 
where you are another cool little item
so<00:04:18.900> that's<00:04:19.079> five<00:04:19.349> different<00:04:19.650> things<00:04:20.010> so<00:04:20.280> far

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
so that's five different things so far

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.990 
so that's five different things so far
and<00:04:20.820> then<00:04:21.120> there<00:04:21.359> are<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:22.610> Mario<00:04:23.610> Kart<00:04:23.669> with

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
and then there are the Mario Kart with

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.700 
and then there are the Mario Kart with
launcher<00:04:24.479> that<00:04:24.630> I<00:04:24.690> also<00:04:24.840> mentioned<00:04:25.260> last<00:04:25.440> time

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
launcher that I also mentioned last time

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.560 
launcher that I also mentioned last time
but<00:04:26.070> there<00:04:26.250> are<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.400> few<00:04:26.580> different<00:04:26.880> ones<00:04:26.970> there

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
but there are a few different ones there

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
but there are a few different ones there
well<00:04:27.750> we're<00:04:28.020> gonna<00:04:28.110> put<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:28.380> in<00:04:28.500> the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
well we're gonna put that in the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.040 
well we're gonna put that in the
background<00:04:28.980> so<00:04:29.370> there's<00:04:29.490> Mario<00:04:29.820> then<00:04:30.630> I<00:04:30.660> did

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
background so there's Mario then I did

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.250 
background so there's Mario then I did
find<00:04:31.410> Luigi<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:32.730> did<00:04:32.940> find<00:04:33.240> Bowser<00:04:33.600> as<00:04:34.020> well

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
find Luigi and I did find Bowser as well

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.410 
find Luigi and I did find Bowser as well
so<00:04:34.560> these<00:04:34.680> ones<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:34.980> think<00:04:35.040> are<00:04:35.400> $12.99<00:04:36.240> in

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
so these ones I think are $12.99 in
