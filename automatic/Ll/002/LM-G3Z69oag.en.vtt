00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
things about this guitar this is the non

things about this guitar this is the non
reverse<00:00:49.140> guitar<00:00:50.140> where<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.739> horn<00:00:51.310> up<00:00:51.579> here

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
reverse guitar where the horn up here

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.620 
reverse guitar where the horn up here
normally<00:00:53.050> on<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.410> Firebirds<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.640> lower<00:00:55.180> horn

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
normally on the Firebirds the lower horn

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.600 
normally on the Firebirds the lower horn
would<00:00:55.899> be<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.230> one<00:00:56.380> that<00:00:56.590> sticks<00:00:56.950> further<00:00:57.280> out

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
would be the one that sticks further out

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.790 
would be the one that sticks further out
and<00:00:57.940> this<00:00:58.870> one<00:00:59.050> will<00:00:59.140> be<00:00:59.260> in<00:00:59.380> a<00:00:59.470> little<00:00:59.590> further

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
and this one will be in a little further

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.170 
and this one will be in a little further
but<00:01:00.070> this<00:01:00.250> is<00:01:00.370> what's<00:01:00.550> called<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.910> non

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
but this is what's called the non

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.639 
but this is what's called the non
reverse<00:01:01.600> Firebird<00:01:02.140> so<00:01:02.290> it's<00:01:02.410> kind<00:01:02.590> of

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
reverse Firebird so it's kind of

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.859 
reverse Firebird so it's kind of
different<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.430> upper<00:01:04.089> horn<00:01:04.330> is<00:01:04.479> actually

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869

bigger<00:01:05.050> than<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.380> lower<00:01:05.560> horn<00:01:05.950> now<00:01:06.880> this

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
bigger than the lower horn now this

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.469

and it's um it's kind of neck heavy big

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.259 
and it's um it's kind of neck heavy big
then<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.390> neck<00:02:37.569> is<00:02:37.599> kind<00:02:37.989> of<00:02:38.079> thin<00:02:38.409> but<00:02:38.680> chunky

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
then the neck is kind of thin but chunky

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.509 
then the neck is kind of thin but chunky
so<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.450> guitar<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:41.019> kind<00:02:41.349> of<00:02:41.560> if<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.129> was<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.340> put

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
so the guitar is kind of if I was to put

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.199 
so the guitar is kind of if I was to put
it<00:02:42.549> here<00:02:42.760> we<00:02:42.879> kind<00:02:43.090> of<00:02:43.180> zip<00:02:43.689> go<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.140> way<00:02:44.319> so

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
it here we kind of zip go this way so

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.569 
it here we kind of zip go this way so
for<00:02:46.209> me<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.810> really<00:02:47.680> don't<00:02:47.890> like<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:48.370> way<00:02:48.459> it

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
for me I really don't like the way it

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.160 
for me I really don't like the way it
feels<00:02:48.640> or<00:02:49.120> plays<00:02:49.329> but<00:02:49.629> that's<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.959> great

everything<00:03:04.329> is<00:03:04.450> kind<00:03:04.569> of<00:03:04.689> shifted<00:03:05.260> up<00:03:05.379> on<00:03:05.650> this

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
everything is kind of shifted up on this

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.610 
everything is kind of shifted up on this
guitar<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.489> look<00:03:06.849> how<00:03:06.970> much<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.200> neck<00:03:08.379> is<00:03:08.409> I

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
guitar and look how much the neck is I

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.860 
guitar and look how much the neck is I
kind<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.340> play<00:03:09.519> more<00:03:09.760> with<00:03:09.879> my<00:03:10.030> hand<00:03:10.269> back<00:03:10.450> here

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
kind of play more with my hand back here

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.720 
kind of play more with my hand back here
so<00:03:11.439> this<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:11.859> a<00:03:11.889> little<00:03:11.950> bit<00:03:12.280> different<00:03:12.609> so<00:03:12.669> it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
so this is a little bit different so it

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.449 
so this is a little bit different so it
just<00:03:12.879> feels<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.180> little<00:03:13.209> uncomfortable<00:03:13.480> but

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
just feels a little uncomfortable but

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.500 
just feels a little uncomfortable but
again<00:03:15.459> I<00:03:15.489> wanted<00:03:15.909> to<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.060> thought<00:03:16.299> it<00:03:16.359> would<00:03:16.419> be

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
again I wanted to I thought it would be

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.449 
again I wanted to I thought it would be
nice<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.930> pull<00:03:17.139> it<00:03:17.260> out<00:03:17.379> so<00:03:17.919> you<00:03:17.980> could<00:03:18.099> hear

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
nice to pull it out so you could hear

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.339 
nice to pull it out so you could hear
what<00:03:18.849> this<00:03:19.000> sounds<00:03:19.389> like<00:03:19.419> and<00:03:19.750> kind<00:03:19.930> of<00:03:20.019> see<00:03:20.260> it

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
what this sounds like and kind of see it

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.869 
what this sounds like and kind of see it
because<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.769> Firebird<00:03:21.250> is<00:03:21.400> such<00:03:21.579> a<00:03:21.609> cool

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
because the Firebird is such a cool

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.610 
because the Firebird is such a cool
instrument<00:03:22.180> let<00:03:22.989> me<00:03:23.049> go<00:03:23.169> through<00:03:23.319> some<00:03:23.470> of<00:03:23.500> the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
instrument let me go through some of the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.250 
instrument let me go through some of the
pickup<00:03:23.950> combinations<00:03:24.730> here<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:25.930> again<00:03:26.139> this

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
pickup combinations here and again this

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.020 
pickup combinations here and again this
is<00:03:26.409> all<00:03:26.530> tricked<00:03:26.889> out<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.340> wired<00:03:27.549> and<00:03:27.819> I'm<00:03:27.879> not

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
is all tricked out and wired and I'm not

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.990 
is all tricked out and wired and I'm not
sure<00:03:28.680> exactly<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.950> which<00:03:30.489> because<00:03:30.700> it<00:03:30.819> looks

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
sure exactly of which because it looks

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.550 
sure exactly of which because it looks
like<00:03:31.120> there's<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.510> lot<00:03:31.780> of<00:03:31.810> different

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
like there's a lot of different

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.649 
like there's a lot of different
combinations<00:03:33.220> here<00:03:33.909> original<00:03:34.329> he<00:03:34.389> looks<00:03:34.569> like

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
combinations here original he looks like

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.180 
combinations here original he looks like
there<00:03:34.810> was<00:03:34.900> another<00:03:35.139> pickup<00:03:35.560> not<00:03:35.799> originally

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
there was another pickup not originally

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.559 
there was another pickup not originally

pick<00:03:37.870> up<00:03:38.049> and<00:03:38.229> probably<00:03:38.919> the<00:03:39.099> switches<00:03:39.699> was

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
pick up and probably the switches was
