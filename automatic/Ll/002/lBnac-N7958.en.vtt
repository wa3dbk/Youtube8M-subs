i<00:00:58.680> will<00:00:58.710> put<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> screen<00:00:59.579> here<00:00:59.609> for

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
i will put it on the screen here for

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.599

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
what looks like skis it's labeled skis i

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.690 
what looks like skis it's labeled skis i
believe<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.650> there's<00:01:04.650> no<00:01:04.769> knowing<00:01:05.549> really

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
believe and there's no knowing really

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.179 
believe and there's no knowing really
knows<00:01:06.060> what<00:01:06.479> they're<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.500> so

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
knows what they're going to be for so

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.770 
knows what they're going to be for so
we'll<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.700> see<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:08.970> those<00:01:09.450> maybe

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
we'll have to see for those maybe

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.539 
we'll have to see for those maybe
they'll<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.200> replace<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.650> rail<00:01:11.070> texture

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
they'll just replace the rail texture

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.310 
they'll just replace the rail texture
with<00:01:11.700> skis<00:01:12.060> or<00:01:12.299> something<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> maybe<00:01:12.900> make<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
with skis or something to maybe make the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.140 
with skis or something to maybe make the
minecarts<00:01:13.770> invisible<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.400> don't<00:01:14.580> know<00:01:14.670> it'll

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
minecarts invisible I don't know it'll

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.910 
minecarts invisible I don't know it'll
look<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.390> we're<00:01:15.570> skiing<00:01:15.869> or<00:01:16.439> maybe<00:01:16.680> there's

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
look like we're skiing or maybe there's

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.770 
look like we're skiing or maybe there's
an<00:01:17.040> actual<00:01:17.220> ski<00:01:17.729> item<00:01:18.150> that's<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> be

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
an actual ski item that's going to be

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.920 
an actual ski item that's going to be
added<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.259> game<00:01:19.560> who<00:01:20.430> knows<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.720> yeah

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
added to the game who knows so yeah

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.770 
added to the game who knows so yeah
start<00:01:22.680> your<00:01:22.770> theorizing<00:01:23.520> but<00:01:24.060> yeah<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.720> is

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
start your theorizing but yeah this is

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.420 
start your theorizing but yeah this is
going<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.320> at<00:01:25.530> least<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.860> chest<00:01:26.130> looks

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
going to be at least the chest looks

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.070 
going to be at least the chest looks
like<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.150> temporary<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.840> for

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
like it's going to be temporary just for

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.109 
like it's going to be temporary just for
Christmas<00:01:28.500> whereas<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.310> skis<00:01:29.640> who<00:01:29.909> knows

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
Christmas whereas the skis who knows

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.999 
Christmas whereas the skis who knows
maybe<00:01:30.420> they're<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.409> texture<00:01:31.740> right<00:01:31.860> now

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
maybe they're just a texture right now

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.710 
maybe they're just a texture right now
but<00:01:32.220> maybe<00:01:32.400> they<00:01:32.670> will<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:33.000> added<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:33.390> an<00:01:33.540> item

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
but maybe they will be added as an item

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.010 
but maybe they will be added as an item
not<00:01:34.530> sure<00:01:34.829> I'm<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.880> lean<00:01:36.119> towards<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
not sure I'm going to lean towards the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.140 
not sure I'm going to lean towards the
texture<00:01:37.650> because<00:01:38.009> i'm<00:01:38.310> not<00:01:38.490> sure<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:38.820> skis

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
texture because i'm not sure if skis

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.940 
texture because i'm not sure if skis
would<00:01:39.450> fit<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.780> Minecraft<00:01:40.409> world<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
would fit the Minecraft world all the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.710 
would fit the Minecraft world all the
time<00:01:41.100> anyways<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.970> way<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.210> texture<00:01:42.540> looks

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
time anyways the way the texture looks

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.330 
time anyways the way the texture looks
it<00:01:42.899> might<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> rail<00:01:43.740> retexture

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
it might just be like a rail retexture

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.520 
it might just be like a rail retexture
