especially when there's a lot of weight
inside<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.780> trailer<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.399> was<00:01:34.399> really

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
inside the trailer I was really

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.179 
inside the trailer I was really
impressed<00:01:35.119> with<00:01:35.390> how<00:01:35.630> tough<00:01:35.929> the<00:01:36.200> atv<00:01:36.799> wagon

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
impressed with how tough the atv wagon

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.569 
impressed with how tough the atv wagon
actually<00:01:37.909> is<00:01:38.119> it's<00:01:38.899> very<00:01:39.259> light<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.219> it<00:01:40.340> allows

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
actually is it's very light so it allows

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.999 
actually is it's very light so it allows
you<00:01:40.759> to<00:01:40.850> carry<00:01:41.090> a<00:01:41.179> lot<00:01:41.359> of<00:01:41.390> weight<00:01:41.689> in<00:01:41.929> it<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.380> I

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
you to carry a lot of weight in it and I

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.649 
you to carry a lot of weight in it and I
thought<00:01:43.219> that<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:43.429> would<00:01:43.670> maybe<00:01:43.969> adversely

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
thought that that would maybe adversely

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.590 
thought that that would maybe adversely
affect<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:45.920> ability<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.340> go<00:01:46.549> places<00:01:46.820> with

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
affect the ability to go places with

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.419 
affect the ability to go places with
this<00:01:47.899> behind<00:01:48.320> your<00:01:48.499> ATV<00:01:48.859> or<00:01:48.890> behind<00:01:49.219> your

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
this behind your ATV or behind your

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.700 
this behind your ATV or behind your

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
side-by-side I had the opportunity to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.499 
side-by-side I had the opportunity to
take<00:01:51.950> this<00:01:52.130> out<00:01:52.310> on<00:01:52.490> about<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:52.759> 50<00:01:53.270> mile

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509
