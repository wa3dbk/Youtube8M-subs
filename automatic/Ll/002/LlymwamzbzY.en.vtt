00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
just going to roll it out like that now

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.440 
just going to roll it out like that now
you<00:02:42.510> can<00:02:42.720> use<00:02:42.959> any<00:02:43.910> cookie<00:02:44.910> cutter<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.239> you

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
you can use any cookie cutter that you

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.930 
you can use any cookie cutter that you
like<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.930> have<00:02:46.230> these<00:02:46.500> small<00:02:46.890> little<00:02:47.190> shamrocks

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
like I have these small little shamrocks

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.809 
like I have these small little shamrocks
and<00:02:48.360> that's<00:02:49.049> what<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.010> comes<00:02:50.040> out<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.459> be

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
and that's what it comes out to be

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.210 
and that's what it comes out to be
although<00:02:51.299> I<00:02:51.840> kind<00:02:52.319> of<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.890> heart-shaped

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
although I kind of like the heart-shaped

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.360 
although I kind of like the heart-shaped
better<00:02:53.849> and<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.750> didn't<00:02:55.049> have<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.620> cookie<00:02:56.130> cutter

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
better and I didn't have a cookie cutter

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.479 
better and I didn't have a cookie cutter
that<00:02:56.670> was<00:02:57.239> small<00:02:57.570> enough<00:02:57.959> in<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:59.010> heart<00:02:59.220> shape

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
that was small enough in the heart shape

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.780 
that was small enough in the heart shape
so<00:03:00.269> what<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.510> did<00:03:00.660> was<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.590> took<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:02.340> cookie

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
so what I did was I took this cookie

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.870 
so what I did was I took this cookie
cutter<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.290> just<00:03:04.560> pinched<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.310> edge<00:03:05.459> here

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
cutter and I just pinched the edge here

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.990 
cutter and I just pinched the edge here
to<00:03:06.090> make<00:03:06.269> this<00:03:06.480> heart<00:03:06.780> shape<00:03:07.640> so<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:08.730> just

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
to make this heart shape so you just

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.039 
to make this heart shape so you just
take<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.049> push<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.530> down<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:14.900> touch<00:03:15.900> your

take it and push it down and touch your
heart<00:03:16.260> out<00:03:16.730> then<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.880> need<00:03:18.239> three<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:18.750> them<00:03:19.049> to

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
heart out then you need three of them to

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:28.009 
heart out then you need three of them to
make<00:03:19.590> one<00:03:19.859> shamrock

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:35.750

it's a little sticky alright there's
your<00:03:41.310> shamrock<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.390> then<00:03:43.019> what<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.260> did<00:03:43.410> for

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
works well and obviously a large

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.170 
works well and obviously a large
marshmallow<00:04:34.650> then<00:04:35.340> when<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.520> get<00:04:35.639> us<00:04:35.940> I<00:04:36.150> just

you want it nice and firm then this is

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.760
