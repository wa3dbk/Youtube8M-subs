Vita system so if you have a PS Vita

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.000 
Vita system so if you have a PS Vita
already<00:03:21.389> and<00:03:21.690> then<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.810> get<00:03:22.049> that<00:03:22.319> you'll<00:03:22.889> be

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
already and then you get that you'll be

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.589 
already and then you get that you'll be
able<00:03:23.069> to<00:03:23.220> do<00:03:23.340> multiplayer<00:03:23.729> between<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.389> two

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
able to do multiplayer between the two

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.780 
able to do multiplayer between the two
it's<00:03:25.019> also<00:03:25.290> gonna<00:03:25.470> have<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.829> use<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.370> Dual<00:03:26.760> Shock

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
it's also gonna have to use a Dual Shock

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.059 
it's also gonna have to use a Dual Shock
controller<00:03:27.079> now<00:03:28.079> this<00:03:28.319> means<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.769> not<00:03:29.010> all

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
controller now this means that not all

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.099 
controller now this means that not all
PS<00:03:29.549> Vita<00:03:29.819> games<00:03:30.030> will<00:03:30.269> be<00:03:30.359> supported<00:03:30.900> by<00:03:31.049> this

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
PS Vita games will be supported by this

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.860 
PS Vita games will be supported by this
because<00:03:31.680> they<00:03:31.949> require<00:03:32.609> touch<00:03:33.030> functions<00:03:33.659> on

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
because they require touch functions on

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.990 
because they require touch functions on
the<00:03:34.319> screen<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.859> back<00:03:35.040> panels<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.729> of

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
the screen and the back panels and of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.939 
the screen and the back panels and of
course<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.870> Dual<00:03:37.049> Shock<00:03:37.079> controller<00:03:37.290> doesn't

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
course the Dual Shock controller doesn't

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:39.469 
course the Dual Shock controller doesn't
have<00:03:38.069> all<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:38.939> we're<00:03:39.060> gonna<00:03:39.150> have<00:03:39.359> to

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:39.479 
have all of that so we're gonna have to

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:40.969 
have all of that so we're gonna have to
see<00:03:39.629> which<00:03:39.840> games<00:03:40.139> aren't<00:03:40.409> gonna<00:03:40.530> be<00:03:40.709> able<00:03:40.919> to

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
see which games aren't gonna be able to

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.249 
see which games aren't gonna be able to
go<00:03:41.129> to<00:03:41.189> it<00:03:41.370> not<00:03:41.939> all<00:03:42.150> of<00:03:42.180> them<00:03:42.419> obviously<00:03:43.049> but

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:43.259 
go to it not all of them obviously but

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:45.339 
go to it not all of them obviously but
I'm<00:03:43.379> pretty<00:03:43.590> sure<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:44.009> all<00:03:44.129> PSP<00:03:44.669> games<00:03:44.970> and
