00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.570
 who can be military in the subject 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.960

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.110
 Czech goal chatroulette

 bush unfortunately forgive me and very kind between a good referee 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.850
 and it was right to teach me 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.160
 as the bases 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.430

 nothing, there is much more 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.450
 efe in the df 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.410
 they demand a lot 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.280
 and there are also many types 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.280
 studies plans 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.970
 but himself 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.510
 deficit 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.510
 well, so far, no 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.850
 hence, any body gesture 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.850
 the best way to do it 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.610
 the inti gas 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.610
 Then you have to see it 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.130

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.960
 so normally I only knew mona 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.870
 the companies of the sector 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.899

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.659
 to rescue at balance price 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.279
 in principle for being professionals of both streets 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.249

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:21.719
 for a big plate umÃ¡rov 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:24.719

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.569
 collaborator 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.569

 one more week 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.379

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.699
 this action 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.699
 the others already shown as the most mediatic 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.550
 it is striking to see 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.590
 can learn in their programs 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.819
 the tattooed session attracts attention 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:34.180
 but calmly by can you get an idea 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.180
 Gonzalo Bones and Galicia 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.330
 it's more like a vicar lioness 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.889
 I was married 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.960

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.569
 gin 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.249
 once it gets too little 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:01.349
 there everyone wants 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.349
 but there is another time when he did 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.110
 our intention 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.919
 like chip cases 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.979

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.979
