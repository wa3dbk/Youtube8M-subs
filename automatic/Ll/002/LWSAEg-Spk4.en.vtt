00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.519
 March is the ideal time to perform 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.070
 splitting coupling for the rest of us 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.139
 there are two things that the sad bearer is not 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.260
 nothing but the plant it will host 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.970
 our gear and gear instead 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.380
 branch that will produce the fruit 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.000
 that I want to go eat 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.240
 let us remember that it is important 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.960
 pick up the slips in January put them away 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.119
 in a bag and put them in the fridge to 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.879
 a temperature of 2 4 degrees this 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.949
 because the march must not vegetate and not 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.550
 say to dry should not dehydrate 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:41.890
 let's proceed then with the graft let's go 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.440
 to tie our graft holder 5 10 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.149
 centimeters below the cut that 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.760
 we have carried out that it will then be the point 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.879
 of grafting I am therefore going to cut the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.519
 graft holder for 3 4 cm while I remove the 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.350
 blade I insert a small retractor 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.879
 which will make the insertion easier for me 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.639
 of the marches 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.260
 at this point we prepare the marches 

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:04.409
 we hope our march 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.780
 we eliminate the most woody basal part 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.240
 we also eliminate the apical part more 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.150
 herbaceous we tend to keep good 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.730
 central part of our march 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.100
 let's make a cut 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.980
 both sides wedge-shaped in 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.010
 so we are going to insert it 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.560
 in our harbor grafting doing 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.130
 be careful that the two woods and 2 barks 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.810
 fit together since we have the space 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.240
 we are going to prepare the other march like this 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.130
 the chances of taking root 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.840
 they double we always mine ours 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.480
 basal part 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.410
 we eliminate the tc and go to do the 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.110
 so I go to ensure our wedge 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.470
 our March a still use of the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.470
 mafia 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.930
 tightening as much as possible 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:02.260
 then we are going to shorten the slips a 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:04.960
 two gems and then we go to close them all 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.100
 wounds with mastic using a 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.100
 brush but also simply a 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.100
 Lametini 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.150
 if you have other questions about 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.250
 grafts write on the page as well 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.590
 facebook of agricultural of the lake or 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.050
 unit find me cold evening thank you I am 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.010
 max hello 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.800
 let's remember to use a hacksaw 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.390
 for cutting of rootstock that 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.470
 plant that will explain our March 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.730
 because the use of scissors could 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.730
 crush the bark too much
