on a roller ski so I'm going to cover a
few<00:02:10.700> different<00:02:11.030> methods<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:12.019> slow<00:02:12.200> down<00:02:12.380> on

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590

Boulevard<00:02:15.980> second<00:02:16.550> would<00:02:16.640> be<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.820> do<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.110> snow

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110

plow<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.620> third<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.550> can<00:02:19.730> drag<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.060> roller<00:02:20.330> ski

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570

plow and third you can drag a roller ski
behind<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.980> kind<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.220> act<00:02:22.370> as<00:02:22.519> a<00:02:23.440> brake

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
behind you that kind of act as a brake

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.320 
behind you that kind of act as a brake
but<00:02:24.800> that's<00:02:25.220> my<00:02:25.370> least<00:02:25.610> favorite<00:02:25.910> way<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.030> slow

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
but that's my least favorite way to slow

down<00:02:26.680> well<00:02:27.680> we've<00:02:28.310> covered<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:29.030> equipment

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
down well we've covered the equipment

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.479 
down well we've covered the equipment
needed<00:02:29.510> for<00:02:29.750> roller<00:02:29.900> skiing<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.950> basics<00:02:31.370> to

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
get into your skis and poles and then

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.470 
get into your skis and poles and then
three<00:02:33.709> methods<00:02:34.100> on<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:34.670> how<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.150> stop

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
three methods on on how to stop

three methods on on how to stop
and<00:02:36.709> methodology<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:37.860> I'm<00:02:38.010> getting<00:02:38.370> rolling

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
and methodology and I'm getting rolling

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.470 
and methodology and I'm getting rolling
it's<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:40.050> practice<00:02:40.440> makes<00:02:40.620> perfect<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.480> get

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
it's just practice makes perfect so get

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.229 
it's just practice makes perfect so get
some<00:02:42.629> roller<00:02:42.870> skis<00:02:43.110> find<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.739> safe<00:02:43.950> spot<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.459> a

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
some roller skis find a safe spot to a

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.410 
some roller skis find a safe spot to a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
to roller ski and wear a helmet and just

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.970 
to roller ski and wear a helmet and just
get<00:02:48.629> some<00:02:48.810> kilometers<00:02:49.349> logged<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.739> summer

get some kilometers logged the summer

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.920 
get some kilometers logged the summer
you'll<00:02:50.310> get<00:02:50.489> fit<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.970> it's<00:02:51.120> actually<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.720> lot

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
you'll get fit and it's actually a lot
