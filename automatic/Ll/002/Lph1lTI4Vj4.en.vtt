00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
luckily thanks to their days of orgy

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.819 
luckily thanks to their days of orgy
training<00:00:39.719> they<00:00:39.870> were<00:00:39.930> able<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
training they were able to get to the

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.860 
training they were able to get to the
bottom<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.399> they<00:00:42.059> found<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.420> there<00:00:42.629> was

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
bottom of it they found that there was

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.529 
bottom of it they found that there was
an<00:00:43.140> excess<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.820> democracy<00:00:44.820> that's<00:00:45.239> right

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
an excess of democracy that's right

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.959 
an excess of democracy that's right
sounds<00:00:46.379> counterintuitive<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.430> democracy

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
sounds counterintuitive for a democracy

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.840 
sounds counterintuitive for a democracy
to<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.480> an<00:00:48.780> excess<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.410> democracy<00:00:50.219> sounds

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
to have an excess of democracy sounds

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.850 
to have an excess of democracy sounds
like<00:00:50.969> Glenn<00:00:51.300> Beck<00:00:51.600> having<00:00:52.110> an<00:00:52.230> excess<00:00:52.710> of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
like Glenn Beck having an excess of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.670 
like Glenn Beck having an excess of

half-baked lunacy trickling down his
