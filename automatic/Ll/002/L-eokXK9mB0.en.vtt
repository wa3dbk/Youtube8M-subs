well if the interesting features I've
just<00:00:28.060> found<00:00:28.270> out<00:00:28.509> on<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:29.439> on<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:30.250> Sony<00:00:30.520> TVs

sitting on the TV aren't gods I have any

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.100 
sitting on the TV aren't gods I have any
different<00:00:35.949> on<00:00:36.100> any<00:00:36.370> of<00:00:36.519> the<00:00:36.640> other<00:00:37.110> versions

different on any of the other versions

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.320 
different on any of the other versions
of<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.350> CRT<00:00:38.820> TVs<00:00:39.820> for<00:00:40.030> Sony's<00:00:42.150> some<00:00:43.150> of<00:00:43.239> you

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
of the CRT TVs for Sony's some of you

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.549 
of the CRT TVs for Sony's some of you
realized<00:00:43.900> that<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:45.160> that<00:00:45.580> the<00:00:46.239> Bang<00:00:47.019> &amp;<00:00:47.050> Olufsen

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
realized that in that the Bang &amp; Olufsen

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.510 
realized that in that the Bang &amp; Olufsen
sets<00:00:48.100> have<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.850> nice<00:00:49.260> useful<00:00:50.260> at<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:51.010> interlace

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
sets have a nice useful at the interlace

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.220 
sets have a nice useful at the interlace
feature<00:00:51.910> on<00:00:52.149> them<00:00:52.360> which<00:00:52.570> basically<00:00:52.899> means

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
feature on them which basically means

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.880 
feature on them which basically means
you<00:00:53.410> get<00:00:53.649> some<00:00:54.219> form<00:00:54.489> of<00:00:54.579> scanline<00:00:55.180> äj--<00:00:55.420> on<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
you get some form of scanline äj-- on a

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.600 
you get some form of scanline äj-- on a
console<00:00:57.579> that<00:00:57.820> outputs<00:00:58.360> for<00:00:58.600> ATI<00:00:59.190> if<00:01:00.190> you<00:01:00.340> take

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
console that outputs for ATI if you take

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.119 
console that outputs for ATI if you take
something<00:01:01.090> like<00:01:01.530> PlayStation<00:01:02.530> 2<00:01:02.890> for

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
something like PlayStation 2 for

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.820 
something like PlayStation 2 for
instance<00:01:03.190> which<00:01:03.789> most<00:01:04.660> etat<00:01:05.020> was<00:01:05.199> worth<00:01:05.440> for

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
instance which most etat was worth for

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.960 
instance which most etat was worth for
ATI<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.810> not<00:01:08.050> very<00:01:08.229> good<00:01:08.380> output<00:01:08.970> whether

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
ATI it's not very good output whether

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.820 
ATI it's not very good output whether
it's<00:01:10.119> a<00:01:10.210> CRT<00:01:10.570> where<00:01:10.960> he's<00:01:11.080> going<00:01:11.259> for<00:01:11.380> an<00:01:11.470> LCD

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
it's a CRT where he's going for an LCD

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.790 
it's a CRT where he's going for an LCD
now<00:01:12.310> for<00:01:12.520> a<00:01:12.550> CRT<00:01:12.910> on<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:14.170> back<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:14.470> officer

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
now for a CRT on the back and officer

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.450 
now for a CRT on the back and officer
and<00:01:14.920> you<00:01:15.100> have<00:01:15.340> a<00:01:15.789> an<00:01:16.450> option<00:01:17.170> that<00:01:17.410> will<00:01:17.920> allow

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
and you have a an option that will allow

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.109 
and you have a an option that will allow
you<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:19.780> interlaced<00:01:20.289> to<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.619> degree<00:01:21.060> now

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
you to be interlaced to a degree now

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.240 
you to be interlaced to a degree now
I've<00:01:22.450> just<00:01:22.990> found<00:01:23.259> this<00:01:23.470> out<00:01:23.650> it's<00:01:23.890> not<00:01:24.009> on<00:01:24.130> the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
I've just found this out it's not on the

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.980 
I've just found this out it's not on the
internet<00:01:24.610> or<00:01:24.880> haven't<00:01:25.240> looked<00:01:25.479> for<00:01:25.570> it<00:01:25.780> on<00:01:25.869> the

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
internet or haven't looked for it on the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.300 
internet or haven't looked for it on the
internet<00:01:26.350> but<00:01:26.500> I've<00:01:26.619> just<00:01:26.650> been<00:01:26.920> messing

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
internet but I've just been messing

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.649 
internet but I've just been messing
around<00:01:27.369> with<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:28.060> with<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:29.170> Sony<00:01:29.860> remote<00:01:30.130> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
around with the with the Sony remote and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.580 
around with the with the Sony remote and
just<00:01:31.659> to<00:01:31.720> prove<00:01:31.900> that<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:32.170> Sony<00:01:32.710> TV<00:01:34.380> now<00:01:35.380> this

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
just to prove that a Sony TV now this

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.219 
just to prove that a Sony TV now this
image<00:01:35.890> here<00:01:36.130> is<00:01:37.680> an<00:01:38.680> interlaced<00:01:39.189> image<00:01:39.369> but

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
image here is an interlaced image but

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.140 
image here is an interlaced image but
because<00:01:41.229> of<00:01:41.350> video<00:01:41.500> cameras<00:01:42.159> you<00:01:42.369> can't

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
because of video cameras you can't

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.469 
because of video cameras you can't
normally<00:01:43.450> pick<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:43.960> all<00:01:44.049> that<00:01:44.200> looks<00:01:44.409> quite

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
normally pick it all that looks quite

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.139 
normally pick it all that looks quite
quite<00:01:46.479> sort<00:01:46.899> of<00:01:47.020> scan<00:01:47.619> line<00:01:47.860> each<00:01:48.100> doesn't<00:01:49.090> it

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
quite sort of scan line each doesn't it

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.179 
quite sort of scan line each doesn't it
really<00:01:49.329> but<00:01:49.750> if<00:01:49.899> I<00:01:49.990> put<00:01:50.290> it<00:01:50.380> into<00:01:50.710> interlaced

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
really but if I put it into interlaced

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.730 
really but if I put it into interlaced
mode<00:01:51.310> let's<00:01:52.210> just<00:01:52.390> see<00:01:52.479> if<00:01:52.509> it<00:01:52.689> gets<00:01:52.869> picked<00:01:53.560> up

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
mode let's just see if it gets picked up

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.530 
mode let's just see if it gets picked up
on<00:01:53.950> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.930 

it's<00:01:58.540> not<00:01:58.720> going<00:01:58.900> to<00:01:58.960> show<00:01:59.170> very<00:01:59.500> well<00:01:59.940> but

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
it's not going to show very well but

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.610 
it's not going to show very well but
trust<00:02:01.270> me<00:02:01.390> there's<00:02:01.900> a<00:02:01.990> massive<00:02:02.410> difference

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
trust me there's a massive difference

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.960 
trust me there's a massive difference
watching<00:02:03.520> it<00:02:03.670> prosper<00:02:04.950> yeah<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.580> is<00:02:06.700> pretty

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
watching it prosper yeah it is pretty

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.249 
watching it prosper yeah it is pretty
hard<00:02:07.120> to<00:02:07.270> see<00:02:07.540> it

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
hard to see it

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.260 
hard to see it
okay<00:02:08.590> that's<00:02:08.800> interlaced<00:02:09.310> mode<00:02:09.430> let's<00:02:10.000> find

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
okay that's interlaced mode let's find

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:20.380 
okay that's interlaced mode let's find
something<00:02:10.630> that's<00:02:11.850> much<00:02:12.850> trouble<00:02:13.300> too

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.770 

rather<00:02:21.080> that's<00:02:21.610> that's<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.970> D<00:02:23.180> interlaced

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
rather that's that's the D interlaced

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.380 
rather that's that's the D interlaced
mode<00:02:23.960> and<00:02:24.920> that's<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.340> installation<00:02:25.970> mode<00:02:26.120> so

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
mode and that's the installation mode so

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.900 
mode and that's the installation mode so
it<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.930> looks<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.290> bit<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:28.670> looks<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.880> bit

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
it it looks a bit it looks a bit

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.480 
it it looks a bit it looks a bit
brighter<00:02:29.360> on<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.870> interlaced<00:02:30.830> mode<00:02:31.010> than<00:02:31.370> it

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
brighter on the interlaced mode than it

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.890 
brighter on the interlaced mode than it
does<00:02:31.670> on<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.910> day<00:02:32.090> until<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.450> try<00:02:32.690> not<00:02:32.840> to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
does on the day until I try not to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.100 
does on the day until I try not to
switch<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.530> there<00:02:33.770> but<00:02:34.400> trust<00:02:34.760> me<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.420> makes<00:02:35.840> a

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
switch to there but trust me it makes a

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.800 
switch to there but trust me it makes a
massive<00:02:36.590> difference<00:02:37.000> when<00:02:38.000> you're<00:02:38.420> looking

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
massive difference when you're looking

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.400 
massive difference when you're looking
at<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.020> game<00:02:39.230> like<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.010> said<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.520> yeah<00:02:41.410> we're

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
at the game like I said you yeah we're

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.690 
at the game like I said you yeah we're
going<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.590> struggle<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:43.040> see<00:02:43.220> this<00:02:43.430> on<00:02:43.580> this

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
going to struggle to see this on this

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.670 
going to struggle to see this on this
video<00:02:44.000> if<00:02:44.120> I'm<00:02:44.240> being<00:02:44.420> honest<00:02:44.720> right<00:02:46.360> that's

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
video if I'm being honest right that's

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
video if I'm being honest right that's
that's<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.890> interlaced

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
that's the interlaced

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.010 
that's the interlaced
that's<00:02:50.270> interlaced<00:02:50.810> yeah<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:52.100> interlaced

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
that's interlaced yeah the interlaced

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.540 
that's interlaced yeah the interlaced
interlaced<00:02:54.020> so<00:02:54.620> it's<00:02:54.740> slightly<00:02:54.980> clearer<00:02:55.370> on

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
interlaced so it's slightly clearer on

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.390 
interlaced so it's slightly clearer on
there<00:02:56.500> again<00:02:57.500> D<00:02:57.890> interlaced<00:02:58.930> interlaced<00:03:00.400> now

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
there again D interlaced interlaced now

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.490 
there again D interlaced interlaced now
the<00:03:01.459> only<00:03:01.820> disadvantage<00:03:02.420> with<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:02.959> Sony<00:03:03.200> set

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
the only disadvantage with the Sony set

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.850 
the only disadvantage with the Sony set
of<00:03:03.950> having<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.520> in<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:05.510> interlaced<00:03:05.959> mode<00:03:06.050> is

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
of having it in the interlaced mode is

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.320 
of having it in the interlaced mode is
you<00:03:07.100> get<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.910> that<00:03:08.660> 100<00:03:09.410> appear<00:03:10.100> in<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:11.090> top

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
you get and that 100 appear in the top

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.699 
you get and that 100 appear in the top
left<00:03:11.600> hand<00:03:11.660> corner<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.200> screen

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
left hand corner of the screen

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.870 
left hand corner of the screen
it<00:03:12.830> doesn't<00:03:13.160> really<00:03:13.250> detract<00:03:13.580> from<00:03:13.730> the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
it doesn't really detract from the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.290 
it doesn't really detract from the
gameplay<00:03:14.530> really<00:03:15.530> you<00:03:16.040> know<00:03:16.190> for<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.910> benefit

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
gameplay really you know for the benefit

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.570 
gameplay really you know for the benefit
you<00:03:17.420> get<00:03:17.630> on<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.050> actual<00:03:18.500> signal<00:03:18.709> itself<00:03:19.250> as

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
you get on the actual signal itself as

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.860 
you get on the actual signal itself as
regards<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.239> way<00:03:20.360> it<00:03:20.420> looks

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
regards to the way it looks

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.340 
regards to the way it looks
if<00:03:20.989> you'll<00:03:21.680> find<00:03:21.920> that<00:03:22.130> for<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.370> TI<00:03:22.640> picture<00:03:23.350> it

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
if you'll find that for a TI picture it

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.580 
if you'll find that for a TI picture it
is<00:03:25.220> nothing<00:03:25.640> it's<00:03:25.790> not<00:03:25.880> worth<00:03:26.440> worrying<00:03:27.440> about

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
is nothing it's not worth worrying about

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.450 
is nothing it's not worth worrying about
in<00:03:27.890> my<00:03:28.040> opinion<00:03:30.489> so<00:03:31.489> again<00:03:31.730> that's<00:03:31.850> in

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.950 

yeah<00:03:34.820> you<00:03:35.390> can't<00:03:35.630> really<00:03:35.750> tell<00:03:35.930> the

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
yeah you can't really tell the

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.220 
yeah you can't really tell the
difference<00:03:36.110> there<00:03:36.650> but<00:03:37.480> right<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.690> get<00:03:38.900> this

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
difference there but right to get this

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.940 
difference there but right to get this
let's<00:03:40.010> move<00:03:40.250> this<00:03:40.400> over<00:03:40.580> here<00:03:40.790> yeah<00:03:41.890> what<00:03:42.890> you

it must have 2d interlace the the
background<00:04:15.470> in<00:04:15.650> this<00:04:15.740> case<00:04:15.800> the<00:04:16.100> background
