00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
a track on the side with a glue gun

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.910 
a track on the side with a glue gun
which<00:01:13.760> is<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:13.909> great<00:01:14.210> idea<00:01:14.530> but<00:01:15.530> I<00:01:15.590> don't<00:01:15.740> have<00:01:15.860> a

enough<00:01:19.400> alone<00:01:19.640> because<00:01:19.970> I<00:01:20.119> don't<00:01:20.270> have<00:01:20.330> the

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
enough alone because I don't have the

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.280 
enough alone because I don't have the
skills<00:01:20.900> to<00:01:21.310> alter<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.640> unit<00:01:23.479> yet<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.020> I'm<00:01:24.110> gonna

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
not work but hey I can do it I can try

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.790 
not work but hey I can do it I can try
it<00:07:04.640> out<00:07:04.930> again<00:07:05.930> you<00:07:06.020> could<00:07:06.140> probably<00:07:06.380> pull<00:07:06.710> it

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
it out again you could probably pull it

up<00:07:06.920> a<00:07:07.040> little<00:07:07.220> bit<00:07:07.400> like<00:07:07.610> this<00:07:07.930> but<00:07:08.930> I<00:07:09.050> think<00:07:09.260> it

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 
up a little bit like this but I think it

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.280 
up a little bit like this but I think it
takes<00:07:09.740> away<00:07:09.920> from<00:07:10.130> the<00:07:10.850> style<00:07:11.360> i<00:07:11.840> think<00:07:14.230> but<00:07:15.230> i

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.290 
takes away from the style i think but i

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.590 
takes away from the style i think but i
think<00:07:15.770> i'm<00:07:15.890> gonna<00:07:15.980> leave<00:07:16.100> it<00:07:16.250> alone<00:07:16.540> anyway<00:07:17.540> to
