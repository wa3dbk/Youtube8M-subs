episode as we all can pretty much agree

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.930 
episode as we all can pretty much agree
the<00:00:03.810> pacing<00:00:04.290> was<00:00:04.410> pretty<00:00:04.799> bad<00:00:05.100> okay<00:00:05.370> we<00:00:05.819> can

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
the pacing was pretty bad okay we can

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.909 
the pacing was pretty bad okay we can
all<00:00:06.089> agree<00:00:06.240> with<00:00:06.480> that<00:00:06.569> one<00:00:06.750> this<00:00:07.200> episode<00:00:07.770> in

my<00:00:08.040> regard<00:00:08.340> was<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.700> lot<00:00:08.940> better<00:00:09.179> with<00:00:09.360> pacing

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
my regard was a lot better with pacing

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.720 
my regard was a lot better with pacing
wise<00:00:09.870> but<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.320> tried<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.590> rush<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:11.099> too<00:00:11.429> many

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
wise but it tried to rush in too many

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.759 
wise but it tried to rush in too many
elements<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.420> for<00:00:12.780> beginning<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.380> arc<00:00:13.679> I

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
elements and for beginning this arc I

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.499 
elements and for beginning this arc I

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
mean the entire introduction to an arc

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.420 
mean the entire introduction to an arc
is<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.719> main<00:00:16.080> crucial<00:00:16.560> thing<00:00:16.800> but<00:00:17.190> when<00:00:17.310> you

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
is a main crucial thing but when you

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.240

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
hunting her down at the beginning so I

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.979

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
entire anime just butchered so that's my

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.450 
entire anime just butchered so that's my
opinion<00:04:07.440> on<00:04:07.620> this<00:04:07.800> episode<00:04:08.070> it<00:04:08.130> was<00:04:08.190> good

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
opinion on this episode it was good

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.820 
opinion on this episode it was good
episode<00:04:08.610> not<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.330> bad<00:04:09.630> it's<00:04:10.200> just<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.470> wish

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.080 
episode not that bad it's just I wish
they<00:04:11.010> would<00:04:11.130> slow<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.520> down<00:04:11.550> but<00:04:11.880> we're

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
they would slow it down but we're

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.460 
they would slow it down but we're
probably<00:04:12.270> not<00:04:12.510> gonna<00:04:12.630> get<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:12.960> it's<00:04:13.260> already

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
probably not gonna get that it's already

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.870 
probably not gonna get that it's already
been<00:04:13.590> set<00:04:13.770> in<00:04:13.890> stone<00:04:14.070> that<00:04:14.220> this<00:04:14.400> pacing<00:04:14.610> is

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
been set in stone that this pacing is

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.820 
been set in stone that this pacing is
already<00:04:15.090> gonna<00:04:15.180> continue<00:04:15.570> going<00:04:15.600> fast<00:04:16.080> but

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
already gonna continue going fast but
