because<00:01:06.210> they<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.479> turn<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.689> your<00:01:06.900> GMOs<00:01:07.260> can

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
because they can turn on your GMOs can

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.800 
because they can turn on your GMOs can
turn<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.770> markers<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.430> your<00:01:08.490> own<00:01:08.760> DNA<00:01:08.970> because

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
turn on markers in your own DNA because

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870 
turn on markers in your own DNA because
they<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.320> basically<00:01:10.619> like<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:11.820> were

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
they have it's basically like you were

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.730 
they have it's basically like you were
to<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> cell<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.110> cell<00:01:13.170> was<00:01:13.470> made<00:01:13.619> up

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
to have a cell and this cell was made up

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.219 
to have a cell and this cell was made up
of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> rainbow<00:01:14.250> boom<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.540> rainbow<00:01:15.869> colors

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
of the rainbow boom the rainbow colors

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.920 
of the rainbow boom the rainbow colors
brutally<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.580> let's<00:01:17.790> say<00:01:18.060> well<00:01:18.420> we

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
brutally and then let's say well we

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.590 
brutally and then let's say well we
wanted<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.350> some<00:01:19.500> other<00:01:19.590> stuff<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:21.479> need

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
wanted to do some other stuff so we need

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.920 
wanted to do some other stuff so we need
to<00:01:21.659> put<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.159> brown<00:01:23.729> piece<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.390> but

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
to put this you know brown piece in but

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.300 
to put this you know brown piece in but
the<00:01:25.020> brown<00:01:25.200> piece<00:01:25.470> doesn't<00:01:25.680> fit<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.100> there

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the brown piece doesn't fit in there

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.550 
the brown piece doesn't fit in there
because<00:01:26.549> let's<00:01:27.030> go<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> rainbow<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.290> we'll

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
because let's go on the rainbow so we'll

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.530 
because let's go on the rainbow so we'll
do<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.920> look<00:01:29.100> at<00:01:29.189> these<00:01:29.310> silver<00:01:29.759> pieces<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
do is look at these silver pieces and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.590 
do is look at these silver pieces and
then<00:01:30.869> we'll<00:01:30.960> put<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.490> we<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.640> will<00:01:33.240> weaken

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
then we'll put like we know will weaken

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.710 
then we'll put like we know will weaken
the<00:01:33.659> other<00:01:33.869> cells<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.670> Ebola<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.150> other

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the other cells with Ebola and other

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.330 
the other cells with Ebola and other
strains<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.259> virus<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.650> we'll<00:01:37.860> infiltrate

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
strains of virus and we'll infiltrate

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.730 
strains of virus and we'll infiltrate
them<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.790> we'll<00:01:39.210> make<00:01:39.450> them<00:01:39.630> bond<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.590> these

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
them and we'll make them bond to these

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.410 
them and we'll make them bond to these
maybe<00:01:41.040> silver<00:01:41.310> blocks<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.030> then<00:01:42.150> we've<00:01:42.270> got

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
maybe silver blocks so then we've got

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.569 
maybe silver blocks so then we've got
the<00:01:42.570> brown<00:01:42.750> block<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.680> silver<00:01:44.100> blocks<00:01:44.340> is

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
the brown block the silver blocks is

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.880 
the brown block the silver blocks is
like<00:01:44.670> an<00:01:44.790> adapter<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.540> adapter<00:01:46.229> molecule<00:01:46.680> and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
like an adapter so adapter molecule and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.859 
like an adapter so adapter molecule and
then<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> other<00:01:47.369> ones<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.790> around<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.720> then

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
then the other ones going around so then

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.899 
then the other ones going around so then
when<00:01:48.990> these<00:01:49.049> go<00:01:49.200> into<00:01:49.380> your<00:01:49.530> body<00:01:49.710> they<00:01:50.670> tend

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
when these go into your body they tend

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.270 
when these go into your body they tend
to<00:01:51.000> break<00:01:51.780> away<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.409> then<00:01:52.920> these<00:01:53.040> other

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
to break away and then these other

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.370 
to break away and then these other
little<00:01:53.490> building<00:01:53.909> blocks<00:01:54.149> they<00:01:54.689> take<00:01:54.960> off<00:01:55.140> and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
little building blocks they take off and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.469 
little building blocks they take off and
then<00:01:55.710> these<00:01:55.890> break<00:01:56.549> away<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.060> something

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
then these break away and something

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.030 
then these break away and something
you've<00:01:57.659> got<00:01:57.810> all<00:01:57.990> these<00:01:58.140> cells<00:01:58.500> wandering

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
you've got all these cells wandering

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.800 
you've got all these cells wandering
free<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.579> when<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.119> look<00:02:00.270> at<00:02:00.360> your<00:02:00.479> blood<00:02:00.630> in

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
free and when you look at your blood in

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.569 
free and when you look at your blood in
a<00:02:00.869> slide<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.380> call<00:02:01.500> those<00:02:01.619> junk<00:02:02.009> cities<00:02:02.399> so

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
a slide we call those junk cities so

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.340 
a slide we call those junk cities so
just<00:02:02.790> cities<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.270> junk<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.840> your<00:02:03.869> blood

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
just cities of just junk in your blood

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.389 
just cities of just junk in your blood
but<00:02:05.280> um<00:02:06.270> they<00:02:07.229> break<00:02:07.500> away<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.799> then<00:02:08.190> now

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
but um they break away and then now

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.100 
but um they break away and then now
you've<00:02:08.580> got<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> bunch<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.330> wild<00:02:09.569> cards

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
you've got like a bunch of wild cards

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.240 
you've got like a bunch of wild cards
floating<00:02:10.950> around<00:02:11.039> your<00:02:11.310> body<00:02:11.489> that's

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
floating around your body that's

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.130 
floating around your body that's
Angela<00:02:12.580> why<00:02:12.670> GMOs<00:02:13.060> will<00:02:13.420> do<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.630> your<00:02:13.720> body<00:02:13.900> so

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
Angela why GMOs will do to your body so

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.400 
Angela why GMOs will do to your body so
you've<00:02:14.290> got<00:02:14.470> LEGO<00:02:15.220> pieces<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:17.020> can<00:02:17.170> make<00:02:17.290> up

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
you've got LEGO pieces that can make up

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.320 
you've got LEGO pieces that can make up
anything<00:02:17.980> they<00:02:18.220> want<00:02:18.460> going<00:02:18.940> around<00:02:19.120> in<00:02:19.240> your

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
anything they want going around in your

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330 
anything they want going around in your
body<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.720> when<00:02:19.840> they<00:02:19.930> form<00:02:20.350> we<00:02:21.040> call<00:02:21.220> those

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
body and when they form we call those

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.730 
body and when they form we call those
cancer<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:21.970> when<00:02:22.510> they<00:02:22.630> connect<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.500> your<00:02:23.590> own

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
cancer and when they connect to your own

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.650 
cancer and when they connect to your own
DNA<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.220> they<00:02:24.490> change<00:02:24.790> your<00:02:24.970> DNA<00:02:25.090> we<00:02:25.510> call

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
DNA and they change your DNA we call

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.699 
DNA and they change your DNA we call
that<00:02:25.840> an<00:02:26.140> allergy<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:29.080> essentially<00:02:29.590> if

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
that an allergy so that essentially if

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.050 
that an allergy so that essentially if
you<00:02:29.800> don't<00:02:29.950> understand<00:02:30.340> GMOs<00:02:30.670> we'll<00:02:30.820> break<00:02:30.940> it

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
you don't understand GMOs we'll break it

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.000 
you don't understand GMOs we'll break it
down<00:02:31.150> but<00:02:31.660> this<00:02:31.780> woman<00:02:32.080> not<00:02:32.500> only<00:02:32.530> became

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
down but this woman not only became

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.720 
down but this woman not only became
allergic<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.400> watermelons<00:02:34.000> all<00:02:35.010> melons<00:02:36.010> all

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
allergic to watermelons all melons all

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.210 
allergic to watermelons all melons all
of<00:02:37.270> them<00:02:37.390> she<00:02:38.200> was<00:02:38.320> no<00:02:38.500> longer<00:02:38.709> able<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.160> this

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
of them she was no longer able to this

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.010 
of them she was no longer able to this
is<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.400> woman<00:02:39.610> watermelons<00:02:40.420> every<00:02:40.630> day<00:02:40.750> and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
is a woman watermelons every day and

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.780 
is a woman watermelons every day and
because<00:02:41.650> she<00:02:41.800> was<00:02:41.830> eating<00:02:42.100> GMO<00:02:42.400> watermelon

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
because she was eating GMO watermelon

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.920 
because she was eating GMO watermelon
think<00:02:42.910> what<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.090> million<00:02:43.360> chance<00:02:43.660> by<00:02:43.780> how<00:02:43.870> many

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
think what a million chance by how many

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.860 
think what a million chance by how many
watermelons<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.620> she<00:02:44.709> eight<00:02:44.890> so<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:46.150> mean<00:02:46.600> think

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
watermelons is she eight so I mean think

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.000 
watermelons is she eight so I mean think
about<00:02:46.930> that's<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.350> lot<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.470> water<00:02:47.650> moans<00:02:47.890> like

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
about that's a lot of water moans like

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.949 
about that's a lot of water moans like
10<00:02:48.220> years<00:02:48.520> so<00:02:48.880> watermelons<00:02:49.330> not<00:02:49.510> just<00:02:49.720> as<00:02:49.810> long

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
10 years so watermelons not just as long

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.050 
10 years so watermelons not just as long
as<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:50.200> know<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.530> they've<00:02:50.650> been<00:02:50.739> GM<00:02:51.040> owing<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
as I know that they've been GM owing the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.340 
as I know that they've been GM owing the
watermelons<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:52.630> don't<00:02:52.750> really<00:02:52.870> know<00:02:52.989> how<00:02:53.140> long

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
watermelons I don't really know how long

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.210 
watermelons I don't really know how long
so<00:02:53.890> that's<00:02:54.100> just<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.459> seedless<00:02:54.880> ones<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:56.220> a

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
so that's just the seedless ones so a

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.180 
so that's just the seedless ones so a
real<00:02:57.550> live<00:02:57.730> account<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:58.180> somebody<00:02:58.480> actually

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
real live account of somebody actually

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.080 
real live account of somebody actually
having<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.250> change<00:03:00.459> their<00:03:00.610> entire<00:03:00.850> life

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
having to change their entire life

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.840 
having to change their entire life
because<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:01.900> GMO<00:03:02.370> product<00:03:03.370> that<00:03:03.520> actually

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
because of a GMO product that actually

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.280 
because of a GMO product that actually
you<00:03:04.180> know<00:03:04.300> caused<00:03:04.600> them<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.930> have<00:03:04.959> an<00:03:05.140> allergic

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
you know caused them to have an allergic

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.650 
you know caused them to have an allergic
reaction<00:03:05.590> just<00:03:06.400> like<00:03:06.640> when<00:03:07.239> they<00:03:07.360> were<00:03:07.390> making

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
reaction just like when they were making

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.780 
reaction just like when they were making
the<00:03:07.930> herb<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.950> they<00:03:09.010> wanted<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.400> plant<00:03:09.670> to

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
the herb and they wanted the plant to

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.630 
the herb and they wanted the plant to
produce<00:03:09.970> more<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.020> specific<00:03:11.560> enzyme<00:03:12.340> and

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
produce more of the specific enzyme and

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.630 
produce more of the specific enzyme and
so<00:03:12.790> they<00:03:13.000> genetically<00:03:13.750> modified<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.800> the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
so they genetically modified the the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.220 
so they genetically modified the the
ends<00:03:15.910> like<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.030> was<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.239> supplement

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
ends like this was a supplement

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.990 
ends like this was a supplement
genetically<00:03:17.920> modified<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.370> plan<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.730> create

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
genetically modified the plan to create

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.360 
genetically modified the plan to create
like<00:03:19.540> two<00:03:19.840> or<00:03:19.989> three<00:03:20.019> four<00:03:20.410> times<00:03:20.650> more<00:03:21.040> of<00:03:21.100> the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
like two or three four times more of the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.490 
like two or three four times more of the
enzyme<00:03:21.730> but<00:03:22.420> then<00:03:22.660> when<00:03:22.840> they<00:03:23.019> sent<00:03:23.350> it<00:03:23.440> out

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
enzyme but then when they sent it out

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.590 
enzyme but then when they sent it out
onto<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.920> racks<00:03:24.130> under<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.730> shelves<00:03:24.970> well<00:03:25.540> I

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
onto the racks under the shelves well I

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.000 
onto the racks under the shelves well I
feel<00:03:25.720> got<00:03:25.959> sick<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.620> had<00:03:26.739> one<00:03:27.180> distinct

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
feel got sick and it had one distinct

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.650 
feel got sick and it had one distinct
side<00:03:30.010> effect<00:03:30.310> symptom<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.360> so<00:03:31.510> they<00:03:31.600> were

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
side effect symptom and so they were

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.820 
side effect symptom and so they were
able<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.900> link<00:03:32.049> them<00:03:32.200> all<00:03:32.290> together<00:03:32.440> but<00:03:32.650> if<00:03:32.769> I

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
able to link them all together but if I

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.259 
able to link them all together but if I
hadn't<00:03:33.100> had<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.310> symptom<00:03:33.970> they<00:03:34.060> would<00:03:34.180> have

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
hadn't had that symptom they would have

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.280 
hadn't had that symptom they would have
never<00:03:34.390> known<00:03:34.630> just<00:03:34.840> like<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:34.989> Taco<00:03:35.170> Bell

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
never known just like the Taco Bell

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.009
