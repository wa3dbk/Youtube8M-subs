this is a mobile for Muji I think it's

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.289 
this is a mobile for Muji I think it's
pretty<00:01:45.930> handy<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.729> write<00:01:48.030> notes

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299

and it has a front kind of like a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.289 
and it has a front kind of like a
plastic<00:01:52.170> ziplock<00:01:53.100> bag<00:01:53.520> thing<00:01:53.909> where<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.149> can

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
plastic ziplock bag thing where you can

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.440 
plastic ziplock bag thing where you can
put<00:01:54.509> pen<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.380> inside<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.009> pen<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.430> also<00:01:56.759> from

because the pen is already inside the
Ziploc<00:02:06.590> compartment<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:07.580> this<00:02:08.030> is<00:02:08.180> pretty

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
it it's just pretty straightforward I

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.750 
it it's just pretty straightforward I
just<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:58.190> know<00:03:58.220> spar<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.090> flat<00:03:59.540> like<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.230> and

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
just you know spar it flat like that and

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.190 
just you know spar it flat like that and
the<00:04:01.760> great<00:04:02.000> thing<00:04:02.209> about<00:04:02.269> this<00:04:02.599> bag<00:04:02.810> is<00:04:03.019> that

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
the great thing about this bag is that

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.190 
the great thing about this bag is that
even<00:04:03.650> though<00:04:03.860> you<00:04:04.250> fold<00:04:05.120> it<00:04:05.360> like<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:05.599> you

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
even though you fold it like so you

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
even though you fold it like so you
would<00:04:06.319> think<00:04:06.349> that<00:04:06.620> there<00:04:06.890> would<00:04:07.040> be<00:04:07.069> a

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
would think that there would be a

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.430 
would think that there would be a
permanent<00:04:07.970> crease<00:04:08.390> mark<00:04:08.750> because<00:04:09.200> it's

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
permanent crease mark because it's

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.390 
permanent crease mark because it's
leather<00:04:09.709> but<00:04:10.580> it<00:04:10.760> really<00:04:11.000> doesn't<00:04:12.069> as<00:04:13.069> you<00:04:13.220> can

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
leather but it really doesn't as you can

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.960 
leather but it really doesn't as you can
see<00:04:14.170> I've<00:04:15.170> always<00:04:15.410> stored<00:04:15.950> it<00:04:16.130> like<00:04:16.310> so<00:04:16.639> but

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
see I've always stored it like so but

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.319 
see I've always stored it like so but
once<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:17.750> fill<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.200> up<00:04:18.229> with<00:04:18.380> stuff<00:04:18.919> you<00:04:19.370> can't

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
once you fill it up with stuff you can't

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.129 
once you fill it up with stuff you can't
really<00:04:20.540> see<00:04:20.840> that<00:04:21.079> there's<00:04:21.620> like<00:04:22.010> a<00:04:22.120> ugly

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
really see that there's like a ugly

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.600 
really see that there's like a ugly
crease<00:04:24.139> mark<00:04:24.500> or<00:04:24.680> something<00:04:24.830> like<00:04:25.130> that<00:04:25.340> it's

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
crease mark or something like that it's

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.200 
crease mark or something like that it's
pretty<00:04:26.330> good<00:04:26.419> so<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.919> leather<00:04:28.130> is<00:04:28.430> super<00:04:28.850> soft

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
pretty good so the leather is super soft

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.480 
pretty good so the leather is super soft
and<00:04:30.430> thick<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:31.639> smooshy<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:34.280> leather

zip<00:05:41.100> it<00:05:41.280> up<00:05:41.370> because<00:05:41.790> I<00:05:41.820> just<00:05:41.940> find<00:05:42.330> that<00:05:42.540> the

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
zip it up because I just find that the

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.500 
zip it up because I just find that the
flat<00:05:43.080> and<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:43.500> zip<00:05:43.800> is<00:05:44.070> just<00:05:44.790> too<00:05:44.970> cumbersome

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
flat and the zip is just too cumbersome

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.110 
flat and the zip is just too cumbersome
to<00:05:45.750> get<00:05:46.020> in<00:05:46.170> and<00:05:46.350> out<00:05:46.410> off<00:05:46.680> what<00:05:47.520> I<00:05:47.550> do<00:05:47.670> is<00:05:48.090> I

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
to get in and out off what I do is I

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.900

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
just you know at most I just buttoned

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.840 
just you know at most I just buttoned
the<00:05:54.510> flap<00:05:54.750> in<00:05:54.990> front<00:05:55.160> so<00:05:56.160> that<00:05:56.190> I<00:05:56.340> can<00:05:56.610> still

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
the flap in front so that I can still

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.990 
the flap in front so that I can still
squeeze<00:05:57.120> my<00:05:57.480> hand<00:05:57.810> is<00:05:58.050> to<00:05:58.890> get<00:05:59.220> stuff<00:05:59.640> if<00:05:59.880> I

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000
