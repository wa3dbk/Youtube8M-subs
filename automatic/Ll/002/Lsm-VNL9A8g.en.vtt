00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
already created a mask just for this

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.070 
already created a mask just for this
episode<00:02:39.440> I'm<00:02:40.070> gonna<00:02:40.400> hit<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.880> letter<00:02:41.060> H<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:42.020> my

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
episode I'm gonna hit the letter H on my

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.030 
episode I'm gonna hit the letter H on my
keyboard<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.850> shows<00:02:44.150> up<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.600> pins<00:02:45.040> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
keyboard and it shows up the pins the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.970 
keyboard and it shows up the pins the
pins<00:02:46.370> hold<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.300> mask<00:02:47.510> if<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.380> move<00:02:48.590> my<00:02:48.620> mouse

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
pins hold the mask if I move my mouse

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.020 
pins hold the mask if I move my mouse
over<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.880> pin<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.690> shows<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.320> mask<00:02:51.790> if<00:02:52.790> I

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
over the pin it shows the mask if I

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.680 
over the pin it shows the mask if I
select<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.870> pin<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.700> move<00:02:55.700> my<00:02:55.970> mouse<00:02:56.180> away

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
select the pin and move my mouse away

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.060 
select the pin and move my mouse away
from<00:02:57.080> it<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:58.760> mask<00:02:59.000> disappears<00:02:59.890> why<00:03:00.890> is<00:03:00.950> that

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
from it the mask disappears why is that

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.640 
from it the mask disappears why is that
so<00:03:01.810> this<00:03:02.810> mask<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.680> showing<00:03:04.310> up<00:03:04.460> as<00:03:04.730> an<00:03:05.000> overlay

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
so this mask is showing up as an overlay

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.890 
so this mask is showing up as an overlay
so<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.710> see<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.370> overlay<00:03:07.880> I<00:03:08.120> have<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.600> press

of the pins just press the letter H

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.970 
of the pins just press the letter H
again<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.880> masks<00:03:23.300> is<00:03:23.450> too<00:03:23.780> warm<00:03:24.020> we<00:03:24.680> just

again the masks is too warm we just

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.680 
again the masks is too warm we just
can't<00:03:25.220> see<00:03:25.490> it<00:03:25.520> because<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.240> overlay<00:03:26.660> is

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
can't see it because the overlay is

can't see it because the overlay is
turned<00:03:27.110> off<00:03:27.470> let's<00:03:28.220> turn<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.610> on<00:03:29.110> each<00:03:30.110> no<00:03:30.440> and

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
turned off let's turn it on each no and

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.930 
turned off let's turn it on each no and
pay<00:03:31.370> attention<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.209> avoided<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.680> eyes<00:03:33.940> the
