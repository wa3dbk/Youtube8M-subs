00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
legend so for this song I decided that

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.120 
legend so for this song I decided that
it<00:00:47.550> would<00:00:47.790> be<00:00:47.910> best<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.740> teach<00:00:49.740> you<00:00:49.950> how<00:00:50.070> to

it would be best to teach you how to
play<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.820> how<00:00:51.000> most<00:00:51.390> drummers<00:00:51.660> would

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930

play<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.530> say<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:53.760> Ringo<00:00:54.570> Starr

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
play it I say that because Ringo Starr

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.430

but<00:00:58.890> played<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> right-handed<00:01:00.000> kit<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
but played on the right-handed kit so a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.240 
but played on the right-handed kit so a
lot<00:01:01.110> of<00:01:01.140> his<00:01:01.350> drum<00:01:01.620> fills<00:01:01.890> lot<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.160> his

the snare drum I'm going to try to play
it<00:01:28.800> right-handed<00:01:29.720> because<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.840> think<00:01:30.960> that's

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
it right-handed because I think that's

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.110 
it right-handed because I think that's
more<00:01:31.710> comfortable<00:01:32.010> for<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.490> majority<00:01:32.850> of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
part but um despite the grief I'll
probably<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:48.180> from<00:01:48.930> some<00:01:49.140> YouTube<00:01:49.590> viewers

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
probably get from some YouTube viewers

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.920 
probably get from some YouTube viewers
about<00:01:50.250> well<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:50.850> not<00:01:51.030> quite<00:01:51.240> how<00:01:51.450> he<00:01:51.510> plays

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
about well it's not quite how he plays

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.520 
about well it's not quite how he plays
it<00:01:52.700> this<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.940> by<00:01:54.150> far<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.450> easier<00:01:55.020> way<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.260> play

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
it this is by far the easier way to play

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.490 
it this is by far the easier way to play
I<00:01:55.770> think<00:01:55.860> anyway<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:56.940> feel<00:01:57.869> free<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.170> course

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
I think anyway but feel free of course

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.680 
I think anyway but feel free of course
to<00:01:58.860> swap<00:01:59.460> hands<00:01:59.700> over<00:02:00.060> if<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> feels<00:02:00.540> more

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
to swap hands over if it feels more

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.289 
to swap hands over if it feels more
comfortable<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.320> you

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
comfortable for you

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.700

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
so the lick itself that they'll groove

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.130 
so the lick itself that they'll groove
the<00:02:04.979> drum<00:02:05.189> beat<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:06.510> main<00:02:06.689> groove<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.110> the

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
so the Andaz of each beat is played with

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.119 
so the Andaz of each beat is played with
the<00:03:07.349> left<00:03:07.560> hand<00:03:07.889> and<00:03:08.040> earth<00:03:08.669> so<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:10.500> first<00:03:10.799> bar

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129

the left hand and earth so the first bar
of<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:12.060> chart<00:03:14.090> let<00:03:15.090> me<00:03:15.180> play<00:03:15.359> that<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:15.569> you<00:03:15.810> to

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
of the chart let me play that for you to

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.149 
of the chart let me play that for you to
give<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.290> an<00:03:16.379> idea<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.709> what<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:16.950> drumbeat

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
give you an idea of what the drumbeat

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.640 
give you an idea of what the drumbeat
sounds<00:03:17.639> like<00:03:17.849> I'm<00:03:18.450> using<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.989> correct<00:03:19.260> sticky

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
sounds like I'm using the correct sticky

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.440 
sounds like I'm using the correct sticky
written<00:03:20.280> on<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.430> chart<00:03:20.669> any<00:03:20.819> way<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.269> here<00:03:21.359> we

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
written on the chart any way so here we

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:37.089 
written on the chart any way so here we
go<00:03:35.239> that's<00:03:36.239> all<00:03:36.359> it<00:03:36.599> is

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
go that's all it is

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.930 
go that's all it is
so<00:03:39.229> variations<00:03:40.229> on<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.650> how<00:03:41.040> ringo<00:03:41.430> plays<00:03:41.729> it

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
so variations on that how ringo plays it

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.539 
so variations on that how ringo plays it
here<00:03:42.150> we<00:03:42.269> go<00:03:42.449> so<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.379> could<00:03:43.650> play<00:03:43.889> as<00:03:44.129> ringo

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
here we go so you could play as ringo

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.270 
here we go so you could play as ringo
plays<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.060> left<00:03:45.810> right<00:03:46.319> right<00:03:46.349> left<00:03:46.620> right

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
plays it left right right left right

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:58.670 
plays it left right right left right
right<00:03:47.519> like<00:03:48.180> this<00:03:56.870> so<00:03:57.870> your<00:03:57.989> left<00:03:58.199> hand<00:03:58.440> plays

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
right like this so your left hand plays

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.469 
right like this so your left hand plays
all<00:03:58.889> the<00:03:59.129> accents<00:03:59.489> on<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.669> downbeat<00:04:00.090> one<00:04:00.299> two

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:00.479 
all the accents on the downbeat one two

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:05.000 
all the accents on the downbeat one two
three<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:00.870> four<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:03.180> could<00:04:03.329> also<00:04:04.010> vary

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
three and four you could also vary

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.309 
three and four you could also vary
between<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.909> way<00:04:06.000> I've<00:04:06.150> written<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:07.229> way

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
between the way I've written it the way

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.599 
between the way I've written it the way
I<00:04:07.349> think<00:04:07.439> most<00:04:07.709> drummers<00:04:07.859> will<00:04:08.099> play<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.400> and

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
I think most drummers will play it and

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.909 
I think most drummers will play it and
the<00:04:09.239> way<00:04:09.359> Ringo<00:04:09.780> plays<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.409> use<00:04:10.739> some

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
the way Ringo plays it and use some

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.189 
the way Ringo plays it and use some
single<00:04:11.340> strokes<00:04:11.609> instead<00:04:12.150> if<00:04:12.419> your<00:04:12.840> doubles

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
single strokes instead if your doubles

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.619 
single strokes instead if your doubles
aren't<00:04:13.470> up<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.709> speed<00:04:14.010> this<00:04:14.459> is<00:04:14.609> probably<00:04:14.939> a

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
aren't up to speed this is probably a

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.509 
aren't up to speed this is probably a
more<00:04:16.109> comfortable<00:04:16.380> way<00:04:16.680> for<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.949> to<00:04:16.979> play<00:04:17.310> it

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
more comfortable way for you to play it

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.189 
more comfortable way for you to play it
if<00:04:17.699> you<00:04:18.150> can't<00:04:18.389> get<00:04:18.509> your<00:04:18.599> left<00:04:18.780> hand<00:04:19.019> or<00:04:19.139> your

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
if you can't get your left hand or your

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.930 
if you can't get your left hand or your
right<00:04:19.320> hands<00:04:19.799> fast<00:04:20.310> enough<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:20.669> play<00:04:20.789> those

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
right hands fast enough to play those

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.939 
right hands fast enough to play those
quick<00:04:21.150> little<00:04:21.389> doubles<00:04:21.720> then<00:04:22.229> play<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.650> single

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
quick little doubles then play a single

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.620 
quick little doubles then play a single
stroke<00:04:23.250> pattern<00:04:23.490> instead<00:04:23.970> so<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:24.210> could<00:04:24.389> play

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
stroke pattern instead so you could play

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.499 
stroke pattern instead so you could play
