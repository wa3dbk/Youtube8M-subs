00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.200 
holes in and then I just nailed nails in
there<00:00:40.230> because<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:41.129> reason<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.520> jailed<00:00:41.850> first

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
there because the reason I jailed first

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.650 
there because the reason I jailed first
was<00:00:42.540> because<00:00:43.579> it<00:00:44.579> was<00:00:44.640> pretty<00:00:45.120> hard<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.510> get

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
was because it was pretty hard to get

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.389 
was because it was pretty hard to get
these<00:00:46.050> nails<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.559> there<00:00:46.710> even<00:00:47.129> though<00:00:47.219> they're

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
these nails in there even though they're

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.630 
these nails in there even though they're
pretty<00:00:48.030> short<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.789> can<00:00:50.789> hopefully<00:00:51.239> see

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
pretty short as you can hopefully see

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.920 
pretty short as you can hopefully see
there<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.820> go<00:00:54.230> yeah<00:00:55.230> they're<00:00:55.440> pretty<00:00:55.559> sharp

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
there you go yeah they're pretty sharp

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.569 
there you go yeah they're pretty sharp
man<00:00:57.930> after<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.260> did<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:59.129> took<00:00:59.309> some

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
man after I did that I just took some

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.000 
man after I did that I just took some
duct<00:01:00.420> taping<00:01:00.690> me<00:01:00.930> like<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> little<00:01:01.289> handle<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
duct taping me like a little handle and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.950 
duct taping me like a little handle and
I<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.250> put<00:01:02.460> these<00:01:02.579> two<00:01:02.850> ships<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:03.390> just

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
I just put these two ships here just

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.490 
I just put these two ships here just
because<00:01:04.229> they<00:01:04.260> were<00:01:04.409> extra<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.270> then<00:01:06.500> that's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
because they were extra and then that's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.280 
because they were extra and then that's
pretty<00:01:08.070> much<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.270> still<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> little

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
pretty much it and I still like a little

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.109 
pretty much it and I still like a little
hatchet<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.159> right<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.939> make<00:01:12.090> it

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
hatchet to it right here just to make it

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.149 
hatchet to it right here just to make it
look<00:01:12.240> kind<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.869> cool<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.750> would<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.080> a
