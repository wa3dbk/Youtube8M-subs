00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.259
 we are going to build a beautiful lake 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.479
 I like the idea 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.070
 good greeting with pleasure and much 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.349
 honey and I welcome regina 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.670
 so from home and regina you have 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.150
 seen my lip 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.130
 do not know your lips do not you take it good 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.789
 let's continue in the disappearance of 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.770
 My lip is great tell us about 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.780
 please look, I bring you today a 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.280
 idea to improve a space that by 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.410
 little one that is no longer a 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.660
 space if the other day I remembered that you 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.620
 he told me about the makeup you have 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.929
 a relax with your 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.969
 it happened to me the same they are that I had 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:41.859
 my earrings in a small box and it was 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.510
 as practical but as it was 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.420
 growing the number they start to 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.479
 I could not find the ones I wanted 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.589
 so I decided to look for a way to 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.899
 accommodate us much better that was more 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.549
 practical very good and I discovered this 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.679
 then it is very good idea and to do 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:59.049
 one that is what we're going to need there 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.030
 at home please take wave we give to 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.159
 this chance that goes for a feather and 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.060
 a paper to write down what we are going to 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:10.400
 which is needed is a mesh frame 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.460
 metal wire cutting pliers 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.600
 a wall stapler hooks 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.330
 small to hang necklaces 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.250
 and I'm going and all this where we can 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.430
 get and I really ask because 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.350
 many times we go to a stationery or 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.270
 we go to a hardware store or both 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.100
 places as the frame is easy 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.689
 get it in some stationery of the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.960
 large casualties not also in stores 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.670
 specialized in frames of things 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.860
 that you can also use a frame 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.840
 no longer occupy indicas Storytime &amp; 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.090
 also clear of good from some photo and 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.619
 they are very very parents magnificent already 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.330
 my blog to more materials in ones the 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.409
 palerÃ­a in a stationery are very 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.690
 simple let's see we are going to that 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.460
 please see here we have the framework of 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.429
 wood or that very simple as they can 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.350
 see and the first thing we're going to do is 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.869
 place the hooks 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.679
 for the hooks we make a little hole 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.330
 previous it is better to mark the first 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.640
 well here I already mark it with a 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.730
 rule that I gave myself the distance because 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.260
 I have three then this what 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.090
 I want is that this will serve us for the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.580
 of test and for necklaces very well we are going to 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.370
 put the hook this as they are 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.069
 these already in advance so that it gives us 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.959
 time and from we can mark nothing more 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.560
 with the pencil box and then we could 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.660
 mark a little bit audio angel 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.350
 have it as a guide and so there is already a table 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.330
 so nothing else is there at the beginning 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.010
 it's a little hard to work 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.840
 Hard elsa is hard the way but 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.350
 later since it goes well it's very very 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.620
 easy 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.030
 very easy itself exactly I thought 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.190
 that you were very strong but it is not very 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.440
 simple really because due to the 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.630
 Try our little one, but 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.060
 after today and regina do this 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.250
 first and then later you paint it not 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.110
 first I would paint it I am in this 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.730
 good case I'm not going to paint it here 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.500
 because it does not give you time management 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.910
 but the one that I already have them finished and 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.160
 it's painted yes 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.050
 I chose not a few shades like pastel 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.850
 They are trendy right now first be 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.250
 paint it well on both sides very well 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.410
 that perfectly dry and then 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.390
 then we use the exact hooks in 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.860
 If it does not go well with the 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.390
 with the help of the tweezers we finish 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.180
 which in the end is sometimes a little 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.240
 perfect hard and the same thing we're going to do 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.990
 with the ring to hang clear then 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:36.020
 it is important yes exact if not later not 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.630
 we have how to fix it and also I already 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.030
 I felt like it and I put this so that we have 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.730
 a little more advanced and we do what 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.670
 we would take the guide this we put 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.500
 It is not simpler with collars 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.300
 that isolated of all sizes and also 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.250
 can be with nails in this case these 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.980
 hooks were already with these fixed though 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.320
 he preferred to take advantage of them very well 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.990
 you want to do it alone I follow one 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.960
 practical itunes version to be seeing 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.580
 if they want to act any more look here 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.500
 that you do not go crooked is that as 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.970
 still does not arrive does not reach the base and 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.730
 still at the beginning it does not matter that 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.550
 move 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.739
 if you are strong refined he hears already after 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.609
 from working so much on everything for me already 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:21.040
 I am now it seems that there is no way what 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.930
 I finish because at the end it also gets 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.139
 a little bit more the escrow tell them 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.690
 we also have the mosquito net fabric 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.340
 we got this in a stationery 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.570
 then this is wire to me 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.750
 I like it much more than wire 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:39.100
 because it resists more than those that are 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.290
 that there are some that are nylon and then no 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.039
 They also hold to the earrings 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:48.340
 exact there is very well perfect and then 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.380
 we have now we are going to put the mesh what 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.810
 happens if we do not have this stapler of 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.240
 wall with what else we could paste it 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.830
 where so with one because if you start to 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.260
 detach maybe with a nail very 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.910
 small work and do something that fix it 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.949
 yes yes yes then but you're good 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.449
 staplers are also expensive to us 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.250
 they are hard to use they have very useful 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.960
 exact but you have to be careful 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.150
 so here it opens up a bit, we're going 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.410
 to cut with normal scissors 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.570
 normal scissor 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.840
 if you want also because it's easier 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.130
 Thank you 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.130
 and nothing more 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.210
 it's better if they have wire but a lot 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:30.040
 better but in case they do not live is 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.040
 pending here from the cut 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.310
 this is easy nothing more with care 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.590
 because sometimes the wire can cut 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.200
 a little bit if it stings you have to have 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.530
 watch out 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.210
 see what looks like a lie with so many 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.910
 things that you have one that you can 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.770
 recycling at home what is missing is a little 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.320
 of creativity and very good ideas like 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.330
 this in an extract voucher in the 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.070
 mine clear with simple materials that 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:01.100
 it's part of the joke not of these capsule 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:04.760
 and that I wire cloth to the nylon 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:07.850
 I also prefer the wire because it is 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.220
 another topic can be missed remember today 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.050
 at home all for a thousand at 12 a.m. 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.210
 midday to see the talents of 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.640
 regina that is not so strong this truth 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.900
 very, very strong with great techniques 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.580
 remember that it is the program of the three 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.610
 good times nice and cheap big 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.100
 designs what can do great 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.200
 wonders and a program with ideas 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.300
 original and simple we improve a 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.840
 space with only a thousand pesos then no 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.840
 miss it 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.030
 problems is better 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.910
 that all 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.950
 while on Wednesday at what time 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.090
 Wednesday at 12 noon at 20 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.090
 repeat on Saturdays 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:05.150
 and you're going to rush the idea of quite 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:05.150
 intense so that after 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.960
 I 'm going to stay, I do not fix it 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.720
 in 2000 we have learned that the 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.100
 errors have the network there is that equal me 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:23.970
 it helps a lot also gets me in trouble 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:25.980
 we had a lot of fun and we're going to see if 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.930
 there is a staple so nothing else is a thing of 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.240
 put it with the hammer today that 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.590
 I was thinking to see this is very fast 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.750
 because we have very little left and well 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.010
 refined if you put it like that on the wall 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.190
 then maybe it's going to cost you 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.720
 arito get the job but the arete 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.760
 what you invest or is done is all the 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.210
 decoration upside down and here you can 

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.210
 put 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:55.620
 and then if you can already you can 

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.930
 nail tushar this is better because it is not 

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.420
 difficult of this I had some trucks 

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.190
 clear but I do not bring budgets we are 

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.920
 little things but it's very easy nothing 

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:07.110
 more with we hang today ok not to go back to 

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.800
 pay us and now and they deserve drugs 

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.800
 while sides
