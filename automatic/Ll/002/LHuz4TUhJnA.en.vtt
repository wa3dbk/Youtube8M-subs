00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 fans were disappointed by gothic 3 and 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.790
 now and two years later, she brings that 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.230
 addon goddess twilight again 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.389
 right on the barricades 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.340
 publisher jowood promised full-bodied 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.160
 independently executable extension 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.020
 So a quasi-continuation clearly 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.150
 to test more elaborate and conscientious 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.430
 as the main game, the reality looks 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.109
 different from the worse, namely the game 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.390
 is packed heavily and does not even last 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.130
 the basic improvement which 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.019
 the community for gothic 3 already 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.760
 patched together in the reason 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.689
 but does not pursue goddess dusk 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.969
 bad approach 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.710
 it starts where gothic 3 left off 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.960
 and forms the bridge at its end 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.300
 fourth part of albania currently at 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.800
 spellbound is being developed though the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.780
 story is quite okay 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.700
 she starts with a lousy intro and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.620
 relies on a quest design that grows to 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.489
 Part far from the quality of a gothic 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.539
 2 remove story ok quest otherwise 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.370
 does not change much 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.649
 You can still fight during the fight 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.180
 just go to the inventory and yourself 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.000
 a few pounds of fried meat 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.780
 clean up to be both strengthened fight 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.559
 continue 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.559
 funny race 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.719
 for quests it is often npcs of a 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.820
 to escort to b 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.740
 that as long as funny to the types 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.240
 Just stop or get in 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.299
 prevent the environment as here too 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.299
 see 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.270
 we rarely saw a sonnet opponent 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.680
 This easy way can be peaceful by 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.659
 Shoot us with the bow 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.979
 this does not seem to be the case with opposing carotene 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.690
 continue also here you look up 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.820
 the most beautiful way possible by the 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.160
 ceiling the result of a rich 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.840
 clipping errors with such graphics 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.240
 Bugs you have to get along you want that 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.860
 Enjoy the game halfway 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.570
 So this week does not want us 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.040
 let 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.450
 Well, we just run nice sounds 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.200
 to the rear entrance and see us in it 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.850
 once around 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.860
 but stop that grumpy orkla already 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.860
 again see how he reacts now 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.399
 very believable 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.240
 the graphic is still for the end of 2008 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.010
 very handsome but so beautiful she is there 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.310
 again not that kind of rock 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.170
 be justified 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.860
 boring dialog of the role-playing game 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.900
 history 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.150
 no wonder if the npc no muck of 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.070
 there are texts at this point 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.200
 despite current patches just not 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.920
 the speech output is also displayed 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.810
 not listening 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.640
 such defects including some 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.720
 missing translation is unfortunately 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.720
 several times in the game 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.470
 No, that's not the floating act 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.570
 who speaks with us 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.980
 your owner is simply invisible 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.540
 a typical graphical error this 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.190
 Pig makes it right and uses the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.590
 dirty programming to his 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.000
 advantage out though our arrows hit 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.730
 should they brian at an invisible 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.520
 barrier off the animal just got it in 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.290
 orberg these features goddess dusk 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.240
 was under great time pressure of one 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.340
 inexperienced team developed and 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.350
 Worse of jowood knowingly in 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.920
 a miserable condition on the market 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.810
 thrown 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.060
 We do not find funny and the buyers 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.280
 not who gothic 3 in spite of all his 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.310
 you really loved wax dearly and warmly 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.690
 maybe still both eyes shut 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.550
 everyone else will be from the game and 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.550
 to be disappointed by jowood
