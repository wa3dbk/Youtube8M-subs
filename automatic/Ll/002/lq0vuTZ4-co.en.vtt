00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
burgers if there's a few secrets I think

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.200 
burgers if there's a few secrets I think
they're<00:00:32.439> being<00:00:32.529> successful<00:00:33.130> at<00:00:33.250> it<00:00:33.280> usually

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
they're being successful at it usually

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.460 
they're being successful at it usually
what's<00:00:34.390> good<00:00:34.570> is<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:34.809> try<00:00:34.960> and<00:00:34.989> break<00:00:35.230> it<00:00:35.380> up

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
what's good is to try and break it up

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.710 
what's good is to try and break it up
into<00:00:35.650> smaller<00:00:36.160> pieces<00:00:36.430> when<00:00:37.270> you<00:00:37.330> break<00:00:37.480> it<00:00:37.630> up

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
into smaller pieces when you break it up

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.820 
into smaller pieces when you break it up
like<00:00:37.870> that<00:00:37.989> makes<00:00:38.230> it<00:00:38.320> a<00:00:38.380> little<00:00:38.470> bit<00:00:38.620> easier

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
like that makes it a little bit easier

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.220 
like that makes it a little bit easier
to<00:00:39.010> season<00:00:39.489> it<00:00:39.550> evenly<00:00:39.910> without<00:00:40.570> having<00:00:41.140> to

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
to season it evenly without having to

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.930 
to season it evenly without having to
over<00:00:41.440> handle<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.830> meat<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.129> over<00:00:42.550> handle<00:00:42.850> it

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
over handle the meat the over handle it

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.070 
over handle the meat the over handle it
too<00:00:43.059> much<00:00:43.180> it<00:00:43.360> tends<00:00:43.570> to<00:00:43.570> make<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.900> burgers

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
too much it tends to make the burgers

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.770 
too much it tends to make the burgers
heavier<00:00:44.770> more<00:00:45.160> compact<00:00:45.580> keep<00:00:46.390> it<00:00:46.540> really

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
heavier more compact keep it really

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.970 
heavier more compact keep it really
really<00:00:46.930> simple<00:00:47.199> you<00:00:47.350> can<00:00:47.559> put<00:00:47.739> other<00:00:47.890> things

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
really simple you can put other things

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.920 
really simple you can put other things
in<00:00:48.309> there<00:00:48.460> but<00:00:48.670> honestly<00:00:49.120> I<00:00:49.180> think<00:00:49.270> the<00:00:49.629> salt

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
in there but honestly I think the salt

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.049 
in there but honestly I think the salt
and<00:00:50.080> pepper<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.590> then<00:00:50.890> let<00:00:51.460> your<00:00:51.670> your

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
and pepper and then let your your

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:53.360 
and pepper and then let your your
toppings<00:00:52.510> that<00:00:52.540> you<00:00:52.690> put<00:00:52.870> on<00:00:52.900> it<00:00:53.170> I've

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
toppings that you put on it I've

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.510 
toppings that you put on it I've
flavorings<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.519> it<00:00:55.950> the<00:00:56.950> other<00:00:57.040> things<00:00:57.340> we

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
flavorings to it the other things we

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.690 
flavorings to it the other things we

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.100 

hey

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.480 

when<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.200> grill<00:01:52.410> a<00:01:52.440> burger<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.430> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
when you grill a burger it's going to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.490 
when you grill a burger it's going to
shrink<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.300> usually<00:01:54.870> what<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.110> want<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.350> do

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
shrink and usually what you want to do

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.350 
shrink and usually what you want to do
is<00:01:55.740> make<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.130> little<00:01:56.400> bit<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.610> an<00:01:56.760> indentation

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
is make a little bit of an indentation

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.000 
is make a little bit of an indentation
in<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.660> middle<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.470> leave<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
in the middle so if you leave the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.580 
in the middle so if you leave the
outsides<00:01:59.580> a<00:01:59.760> little<00:02:00.090> bit<00:02:00.210> thicker<00:02:00.570> wind<00:02:01.410> up

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
outsides a little bit thicker wind up

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.560 
outsides a little bit thicker wind up
cooking<00:02:01.980> a<00:02:02.100> little<00:02:02.400> bit<00:02:02.490> more<00:02:02.640> evenly<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.390> if

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
cooking a little bit more evenly is if

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.150 
cooking a little bit more evenly is if
you<00:02:03.660> put<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.870> little<00:02:04.050> bit<00:02:04.260> of<00:02:04.320> olive<00:02:04.560> oil<00:02:04.830> just

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
you put a little bit of olive oil just

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.760 
you put a little bit of olive oil just
on<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.730> palm<00:02:05.910> of<00:02:05.940> your<00:02:06.090> hand<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:07.410> helps<00:02:07.710> to

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
on the palm of your hand it helps to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.590 
on the palm of your hand it helps to
keep<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.980> meat<00:02:08.280> from<00:02:08.430> sticking<00:02:08.940> add<00:02:09.330> them<00:02:09.510> out

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
keep the meat from sticking add them out
