back<00:00:12.150> out<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.840> wall<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.410> think<00:00:13.559> that

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
back out to the wall so I think that

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.750 
back out to the wall so I think that
she's<00:00:14.250> going<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.549> try<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:16.400> find<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.550> best

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
she's going to try and find the best

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.900 
she's going to try and find the best
possible<00:00:18.510> solution<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.070> situation<00:00:20.279> if

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
possible solution to the situation if

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.660 
possible solution to the situation if
there<00:00:21.060> even<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.359> one<00:00:21.800> ya<00:00:23.840> see<00:00:28.250> so<00:00:29.250> what<00:00:29.490> do<00:00:29.550> you

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
there even is one ya see so what do you

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.120 
there even is one ya see so what do you
imagine<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.210> will<00:00:30.359> happen<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:30.960> they<00:00:31.740> are

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
imagine that will happen if they are

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.130 
imagine that will happen if they are
successful<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.329> Bonnie<00:00:33.540> who's<00:00:33.780> bad<00:00:33.930> can

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
successful in the Bonnie who's bad can

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.660 
successful in the Bonnie who's bad can
she<00:00:34.170> pick<00:00:34.500> up<00:00:34.649> where<00:00:34.890> she<00:00:34.920> left<00:00:35.040> off<00:00:35.370> with

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
she pick up where she left off with

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.560 
she pick up where she left off with
Julie<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:37.100> think<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.280> would<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.579> plan<00:00:38.940> for

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
Julie I think that would be the plan for

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.030 
Julie I think that would be the plan for
the<00:00:39.690> character<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.440> moment<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:43.040> maybe

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the character at this moment or maybe

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.560 
the character at this moment or maybe
she<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.280> comes<00:00:44.850> back<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.120> life<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.420> then

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
she just comes back to life and then

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.400 
she just comes back to life and then
runs<00:00:45.750> away<00:00:46.340> I<00:00:47.719> don't<00:00:48.719> know<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.020> don't<00:00:49.110> know<00:00:49.230> what

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
runs away I don't know I don't know what

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.930 
runs away I don't know I don't know what
would<00:00:49.530> happen<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.219> character<00:00:50.550> came<00:00:50.730> back

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
would happen if the character came back

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.560 
would happen if the character came back
to<00:00:51.059> life<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:52.010> how<00:00:53.010> she<00:00:53.070> would<00:00:53.670> how<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> think

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
to life and how she would how I think

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.660 
to life and how she would how I think
that<00:00:54.750> she<00:00:54.960> would<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.680> able<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.980> react<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.460> that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
that she would be able to react to that

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.670 
that she would be able to react to that
I<00:00:56.730> think<00:00:57.000> she's<00:00:57.149> finally<00:00:58.820> come<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> terms<00:00:59.969> I

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
I think she's finally come to terms I

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.660 
I think she's finally come to terms I
starting<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.739> really<00:01:01.920> come<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.250> terms<00:01:02.460> with

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
starting to really come to terms with

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.020 
starting to really come to terms with
everything<00:01:03.239> at<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.750> point<00:01:04.640> well<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.790> weird

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
everything at this point well it's weird

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.109 
everything at this point well it's weird
because<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:08.130> last<00:01:08.760> week<00:01:09.000> I

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
because what what I like last week I

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.030 
because what what I like last week I
guess<00:01:09.299> when<00:01:09.810> Bonnie<00:01:10.350> put<00:01:10.530> her<00:01:10.590> hand<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
guess when Bonnie put her hand on the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.250 
guess when Bonnie put her hand on the
line<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.310> shoulder<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> Bonnie<00:01:13.020> knows

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
line of shoulder so Bonnie knows

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.510 
line of shoulder so Bonnie knows
everything<00:01:13.680> that's<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.460> with

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
everything that's going on with

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.780 
everything that's going on with
everybody<00:01:15.560> but<00:01:16.560> everybody<00:01:16.979> only<00:01:17.549> knows

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
everybody but everybody only knows

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.280 
everybody but everybody only knows
what's<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.360> Bonnie<00:01:18.630> through<00:01:18.990> what

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
what's going on Bonnie through what

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.859 
what's going on Bonnie through what
Jared<00:01:19.830> areas<00:01:20.130> will<00:01:20.280> tell<00:01:20.610> them<00:01:20.880> right<00:01:21.479> which

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
Jared areas will tell them right which

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.990 
Jared areas will tell them right which
kind<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.500> right<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:24.650> it<00:01:25.650> i<00:01:26.100> would<00:01:26.820> say

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
kind of that's right of it i would say

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.800 
kind of that's right of it i would say
advantage<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:28.140> was<00:01:28.290> any<00:01:28.500> sort<00:01:28.829> of

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
advantage if there was any sort of

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.359 
advantage if there was any sort of
need<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:31.110> some<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.500> information<00:01:31.799> but

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
need for some of that information but

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.460 
need for some of that information but
she<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.640> pop<00:01:32.820> up<00:01:32.850> anywhere<00:01:33.290> but<00:01:34.290> she

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
she can pop up anywhere but she

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.140 
she can pop up anywhere but she
definitely<00:01:34.799> has<00:01:35.159> kept<00:01:35.400> herself<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> loop

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
definitely has kept herself in the loop

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
definitely has kept herself in the loop

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.780 
it I think would make me wanna it would
make<00:01:42.810> me<00:01:42.960> miss<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.530> people<00:01:43.830> more<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.549> was

make me miss the people more if I was

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.180 
make me miss the people more if I was
aware<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.630> everything<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.710> couldn't<00:01:47.100> do

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
aware of everything and couldn't do

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.359 
aware of everything and couldn't do
anything<00:01:47.220> about<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.820> yeah<00:01:48.659> she's<00:01:49.440> very

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
anything about it yeah she's very

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.730 
anything about it yeah she's very
involved<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.270> how<00:01:51.450> Elena's<00:01:51.960> been<00:01:52.229> feeling

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
involved in how Elena's been feeling

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.870 
involved in how Elena's been feeling
what's<00:01:53.430> going<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> campus<00:01:54.630> and

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
what's going on on the campus and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.789 
what's going on on the campus and
Caroline<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.149> even<00:01:57.479> though<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.530> don't

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
Caroline so even though like you don't

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.570 
Caroline so even though like you don't
see<00:01:58.920> Bonnie<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.640> all<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.090> scenes<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:01.580> think

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
see Bonnie and all the scenes I think

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.389 
see Bonnie and all the scenes I think
it's<00:02:02.729> safe<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:02.970> assume<00:02:03.179> that<00:02:03.679> she<00:02:04.679> has<00:02:04.920> at<00:02:05.340> one

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
it's safe to assume that she has at one

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.249 
it's safe to assume that she has at one
point<00:02:05.759> heard<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.300> information<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.110> you

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
point heard this information that you

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.699 
point heard this information that you
guys<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.710> audience<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.280> hearing<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.709> she

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
guys the audience is hearing so she

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
stuff maybe I can still do that but not

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.000 
stuff maybe I can still do that but not
do<00:03:16.609> dark<00:03:16.849> magic<00:03:17.209> but<00:03:17.359> if<00:03:18.319> you<00:03:18.440> think<00:03:18.470> if<00:03:18.799> you

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
do dark magic but if you think if you

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.970 
do dark magic but if you think if you
kind<00:03:19.190> of<00:03:19.310> cooled<00:03:19.549> it<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:20.299> just<00:03:20.680> especially<00:03:21.680> as

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
kind of cooled it to just especially as

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.479 
kind of cooled it to just especially as
a<00:03:22.010> woman<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.549> just<00:03:22.790> kind<00:03:23.120> of<00:03:23.180> go<00:03:23.359> Raph<00:03:23.629> and<00:03:24.489> you

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
a woman to just kind of go Raph and you

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.940 
a woman to just kind of go Raph and you
know<00:03:25.639> hell<00:03:26.030> hath<00:03:26.060> no<00:03:26.209> fury<00:03:26.389> right<00:03:26.870> so<00:03:27.139> I<00:03:27.349> think

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
know hell hath no fury right so I think

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.640 
know hell hath no fury right so I think
that<00:03:28.099> would<00:03:28.250> be<00:03:28.340> really<00:03:28.459> cool<00:03:28.790> but<00:03:29.660> we'll<00:03:30.349> see

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
that would be really cool but we'll see

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.629 
that would be really cool but we'll see
I<00:03:30.919> mean<00:03:33.160> it's<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.280> really<00:03:34.489> good<00:03:34.669> question

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
I mean it's a really good question

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.860 
I mean it's a really good question
sometimes<00:03:37.639> they<00:03:37.760> leave<00:03:37.940> things<00:03:38.180> open<00:03:38.329> ended

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
sometimes they leave things open ended

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.470 
sometimes they leave things open ended
where<00:03:40.900> it's<00:03:41.900> like<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.290> drug<00:03:42.889> that<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.669> got

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
where it's like a drug that you got

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.750 
where it's like a drug that you got
pulled<00:03:44.690> away<00:03:44.840> from<00:03:44.989> you<00:03:45.319> and<00:03:45.560> then<00:03:48.609> you<00:03:49.609> might

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
pulled away from you and then you might

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.069 
pulled away from you and then you might
dabble<00:03:50.180> in<00:03:50.299> it<00:03:50.359> here<00:03:50.599> and<00:03:50.720> there<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:50.989> then

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
dabble in it here and there and then

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.589 
dabble in it here and there and then
just<00:03:51.260> have<00:03:51.349> a<00:03:51.379> complete<00:03:51.799> relapse<00:03:52.129> so<00:03:52.910> I<00:03:53.269> think

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
just have a complete relapse so I think

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.930 
just have a complete relapse so I think
that's<00:03:53.780> definitely<00:03:54.319> possible<00:03:54.790> with<00:03:55.790> the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
that's definitely possible with the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.030 
that's definitely possible with the
character<00:03:56.359> to<00:03:56.720> have<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.900> relapse<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.919> would

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
character to have a relapse it would

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.740 
character to have a relapse it would
take<00:03:58.190> something<00:03:58.579> I<00:03:59.120> think<00:03:59.569> pretty

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
take something I think pretty

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.650 
take something I think pretty
devastating

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
devastating

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.970 
devastating
or<00:04:02.030> epic<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.360> happen<00:04:03.780> for<00:04:04.200> her<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.560> have<00:04:04.710> to<00:04:04.860> go
