00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:11.029
 r2 good morning 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:14.729
 7 inch tablet very convenient for the faq hole 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.170
 very easily I can do playback controls with the 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.359
 button to turn on to turn it on 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.499
 behind the 3 cat 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.329
 he is happy i know. 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.329
 connection at sea 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.740
 dop cont the top up 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.520
 understood as if we think of it as Syria 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.670
 hdmi offenses honestly I'm not sure 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.800
 the best is formed on the connection look here 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.610
 let's see if you say love was certain that it will be summer 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.610
 is the 64 version 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.380
 based on linux we can 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.620
 I have to make the menu smaller with just a touch 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.230
 frame up 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.140
 obviously 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.740
 multitaskin this is the camera 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.160
 shoots videos 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.600
 hd 720p 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.510
 if we want to minimize 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.260
 we make this gesture we move into 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.640
 and here we are twitter 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.700
 photo hd front cam but above all uai connection if you want 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.800
 does not connect cities 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.800
 mobile network we must for a blackberry because on blackberry it will be 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.550
 the atac application 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.370
 blackberry bridge that will allow us to go online via bluetooth 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.650
 rather than retune our calendar minds with playmate hewitt 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.990
 calendar 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.439
 blackberry maybe a bit limited as connectivity because it forces us to 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.440
 Having a 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.840
 blackberry as the main phone the entire race without connection 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.900
 wi-fi maps 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.250
 is a choice of 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.010
 a primma we will see if it pays 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.530
 so it seems to us 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.830
 a dual-core processor makes applications safe by simply pushing them 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.070
 atc remember a little 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.910
 railway bowes this 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.069
 this functionality 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.409
 we'll try it soon 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.129
 Ian hope to have a copy available
