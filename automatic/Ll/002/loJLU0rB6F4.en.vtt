nicer<00:02:43.599> if<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.870> band<00:02:44.140> was<00:02:44.290> black<00:02:44.980> like<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.459> just

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
nicer if the band was black like it just

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.940 
nicer if the band was black like it just
would<00:02:45.790> have<00:02:45.819> made<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.599> crystals<00:02:47.019> stand<00:02:47.799> out

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
would have made the crystals stand out

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.589 
would have made the crystals stand out
more<00:02:47.980> just<00:02:48.400> go<00:02:48.549> along<00:02:48.879> with<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.090> more<00:02:49.359> but<00:02:49.510> you

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
more just go along with it more but you

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:50.670 
more just go along with it more but you
can't<00:02:49.780> really<00:02:49.870> see<00:02:49.989> it<00:02:50.170> through<00:02:50.379> your<00:02:50.500> eyes

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.770 
watermelon play nothing I've ever seen
before<00:05:00.170> I<00:05:00.800> really<00:05:01.280> like<00:05:01.460> how<00:05:01.670> it's<00:05:02.060> a<00:05:02.360> mixed

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
before I really like how it's a mixed

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.330 
before I really like how it's a mixed
metal<00:05:03.020> like<00:05:03.200> usually<00:05:03.530> I<00:05:03.590> don't<00:05:03.680> like<00:05:04.070> mixing

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
metal like usually I don't like mixing

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.460 
metal like usually I don't like mixing
metals<00:05:04.820> but<00:05:05.480> when<00:05:05.930> it's<00:05:06.080> in<00:05:06.200> a<00:05:06.230> piece<00:05:06.440> of

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
metals but when it's in a piece of

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.290 
metals but when it's in a piece of
jewelry<00:05:06.890> and<00:05:06.920> metals<00:05:07.400> are<00:05:07.550> already<00:05:07.760> mixed<00:05:08.030> and

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
jewelry and metals are already mixed and

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.850 
jewelry and metals are already mixed and
it<00:05:08.360> makes<00:05:08.540> it<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.660> lot<00:05:08.810> easier<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.260> pair<00:05:09.620> up<00:05:09.710> with

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
it makes it a lot easier to pair up with

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.530 
it makes it a lot easier to pair up with
other<00:05:10.040> things<00:05:10.340> so<00:05:10.880> you<00:05:10.940> can't<00:05:11.270> really<00:05:11.300> go

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
other things so you can't really go

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.480 
other things so you can't really go
wrong<00:05:11.570> with<00:05:12.260> any<00:05:12.440> other<00:05:12.590> color<00:05:12.980> outfit

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
wrong with any other color outfit

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.240 
wrong with any other color outfit
because<00:05:13.880> there's<00:05:14.450> basically<00:05:14.780> two<00:05:15.230> color<00:05:15.890> too

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
because there's basically two color too

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.030 
because there's basically two color too
so<00:05:17.150> it<00:05:17.780> makes<00:05:17.960> it<00:05:18.080> easier<00:05:18.350> for<00:05:18.500> you<00:05:18.590> well<00:05:18.830> it
