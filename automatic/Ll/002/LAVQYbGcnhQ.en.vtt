 to each one of you I know you very 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.120
 very well for example I know what 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.510
 when they ask you to order the room 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.269
 that rather you get distracted that you already thought 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.540
 that first after the funniest of the 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:35.349
 world and that you prefer to play 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.200
 but you have to collaborate and look for a 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:42.659
 way to make it fun when 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.659
 you want you do it very well like when 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:51.210
 and ask that you go to sleep and you do 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:53.080
 case to the first to the second and that 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:04:01.410
 it's very good 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:01.410
 by the way when I had so far 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.580
 they know that television because the end 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.650
 of time the truth we can not be 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.150
 but imagine it 's a beautiful thing and I 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.460
 they gave their lives to see right now the 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.530
 my daughter's face thinking knowingly like 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.420
 santa speaks to him he tells her the things that 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.640
 he does well as he arrives in this 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.010
 case by way and I'll get it right there already 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.660
 form the message as how the father 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.700
 can show your children what you can 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.560
 show the moment because it is formed in 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.450
 Alitalia mind or you can send it 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.330
 email or know you could as a 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.880
 surprise in the in the mail tray 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.950
 of your son or daughter that said be of 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.020
 step the ages are quite broad 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.880
 for up to ten years but still 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.860
 have an option to surprise that 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.020
 adult who still thinks he is a child 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.550
 then hopefully I would love it 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.140

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.000
