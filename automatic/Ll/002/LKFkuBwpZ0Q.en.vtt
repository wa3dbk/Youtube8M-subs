thing with iOS 5.1 which i think is the
most<00:00:53.250> recent<00:00:53.730> version<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.260> operating

most recent version of the operating

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.619 
most recent version of the operating
system<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.579> still<00:00:56.820> not<00:00:56.969> built<00:00:57.239> into<00:00:57.539> the

system it's still not built into the
browser<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.289> evidently<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:59.160> not<00:00:59.550> an

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
possibly the developers will look at it

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.450 
possibly the developers will look at it
it's<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.399> can't<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.420> hard<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.409> do<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:59.219> take

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
it's it can't be that hard to do to take

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.910 
it's it can't be that hard to do to take
the<00:01:59.640> safari<00:01:59.969> browser<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.689> convert<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.619> to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the safari browser and convert that to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.830 
the safari browser and convert that to
cascade<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> text<00:02:02.969> nicely<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.659> you're<00:02:03.780> not

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
cascade the text nicely so you're not

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.319 
cascade the text nicely so you're not
pain<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.259> side<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.560> side<00:02:04.710> off<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.280> screen<00:02:05.640> so

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
pain in side to side off the screen so

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.210 
pain in side to side off the screen so
we'll<00:02:06.630> see<00:02:06.899> what<00:02:07.229> happens<00:02:07.439> with<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> next

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
we'll see what happens with the next

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.150 
we'll see what happens with the next
iteration<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.390> iOS<00:02:10.020> operating<00:02:10.379> system

iteration of the iOS operating system

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.390 
iteration of the iOS operating system
and<00:02:11.400> possibly<00:02:12.270> even<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.780> iphone<00:02:13.349> 5<00:02:13.739> when<00:02:14.250> it

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
and possibly even the iphone 5 when it

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.490 
and possibly even the iphone 5 when it
comes<00:02:14.549> out<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.849> summer<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:15.450> we<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.319> have

cascading down the page instead of

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.410 
cascading down the page instead of
