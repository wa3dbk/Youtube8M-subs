 It's finally reached a fruitful autumn and it's a big 3 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.720
 Concert that appeals to Sakurajima 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.690
 Sakurajima, a symbol of public investment 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.690
 1.07 million people have started the corridor to deliver 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.359
 Hello first day is was underway in the mountainous areas 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.640

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.879
 I had a little Tiger donation 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.250
 At first we decided minds 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.270
 This is a laugh 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.629
 Iwasaki will be a venue for concerts in Go Nagashima 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.429
 The audience is still 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:45.429
 This year's not done just before the storm 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.810
 Rearing of Yokohama City 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.810

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.880

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.470
 Ayase co-starring souls collide with each other 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.470
 The third place came in 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
 Year 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.620
 Then there is the third announcement 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.230
 Fans waiting for opening will gather one after another in a large venue 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.230
 I'm getting started 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.039
 I want to be my true Sakurajima ferry 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.600
 Here is a long line of insights for Sakurajima 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.599
 making 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.249
 I will tell you that the lawsuit of Sakurajima, but I have a weak business 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.199
 It is Sakurajima 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.759
 It took three hours to start 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.339
 The concert venue is about 2.5 kilometers away from here 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:26.329
 There are a lot of crowds here as you see 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.009
 I'm heading to the venue one after another 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:32.009
 From the morning the waves never stop 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.810
 A heavy rain fell temporarily at around 2 pm, but it is now merged 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:38.799
 I am also making the economy 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.510
 More than half of the audience is people from outside the prefecture and lava on Sakurajima and roadside 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.209
 Walking while watching 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.650

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.589
 It was more than Sakurajima 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:03.019
 Opening was an actor 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.900
 Mr. Paper says that it is going to go on Ecosert score 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.019
 How is the weather from tonight to tomorrow 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.779
 Let's take a look from the state of the rain cloud 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.829
 There was a developing rain cloud after noon, but this 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.599
 I am listening to rain clouds almost around the time difference plasma occasionally 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.299
 Kubo was thin and it was sunny, but it was south-west 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.919
 Most of the damp air flow from now on 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.349
 I can not see, but there is still some rain on the southwestern sea 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.119
 I'll be late tonight from tonight and will be torn 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:36.529
 Unstable weather with divided production seems to continue again 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.839
 It is necessary to pay attention to the expansion too 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:41.039
 It is evaluated 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:44.849
 Warning of heavy rain thunder perfume comes out around 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.429
 It's been just how to open tomorrow and the weather is 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:51.859
 I will go for a little recovery 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.619
 To do 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:55.629
 I want you to have something to close
