00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
allows the packet to go halfway which is

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.570 
allows the packet to go halfway which is
me<00:03:43.489> know<00:03:43.610> when<00:03:43.760> you're<00:03:43.880> loading<00:03:44.209> obviously<00:03:44.870> um

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
me know when you're loading obviously um

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.780 
me know when you're loading obviously um
so<00:03:46.580> yeah<00:03:46.820> extends<00:03:47.690> one<00:03:48.050> ramp<00:03:48.320> pretty<00:03:48.830> much<00:03:48.980> and

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
so yeah extends one ramp pretty much and

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.420 
so yeah extends one ramp pretty much and
when<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.420> target<00:03:50.660> open<00:03:51.200> once<00:03:51.680> again<00:03:51.890> sensed

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
when the target open once again sensed

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.240 
when the target open once again sensed
and<00:03:52.670> that<00:03:52.940> allows<00:03:53.360> you<00:03:53.540> to<00:03:53.570> do<00:03:53.660> for<00:03:53.989> you<00:03:54.050> jack
