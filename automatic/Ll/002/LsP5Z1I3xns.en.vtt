00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.330
 offers you to test legal tons 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.960
 riverside then a very nice guitar 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.810
 acoustic with which we have only one 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.099
 want to start is to play a floor 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.230
 but here the ground is ringing 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:33.129
 super good so it's a guitar he 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.640
 are very full frequencies we have 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.130
 a lot of bath the most rev example 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.670
 very very important and treble 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.810
 the treble well defined so so it goes 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.190
 to be really a guitar on which 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.990
 we will be able to play several styles 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.920
 acoustic but that's still 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.920
 mainly played in rhythmic 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.840
 we have very interesting for 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.340
 play this stuff with bass 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.130
 well full which allows to accompany a 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.380
 singer obviously cares we can 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.670
 do other things then everything depends 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.510
 the size of the pick, but in 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.510
 solo it works very well 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.250
 in a pretty blues style it works 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.250
 very well 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.480
 1 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.600
 this riverside is also very nice 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.600
 to play with your finger in the ArdÃ¨che 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.140
 my 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.670
 so it's a guitar that's 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.470
 particularly interesting for 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.640
 accompany a singer for his companion 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.590
 and when we're singers only 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.330
 with a guitar because as I 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.620
 wanted to said previously it's a 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.110
 instrument that there is a lot of serious 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.780
 which will allow you to cover a 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.180
 very wide spectrum also with treble 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.829
 well defined and very present 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.780
 so an instrument really very 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.959
 interesting for to play leaves to 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.959
 meet again
