00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
did is sorting from town hall 8 because

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.700 
did is sorting from town hall 8 because
as<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.120> know<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.450> many<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.930> us<00:00:46.410> guys

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
as you as I know that many of us guys

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.860 
as you as I know that many of us guys
that<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.160> are<00:00:47.309> town<00:00:47.550> hall<00:00:47.789> 8<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.180> above<00:00:48.270> so

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that we are town hall 8 and above so

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.080 
that we are town hall 8 and above so
it's<00:00:49.469> better<00:00:49.680> than<00:00:49.950> doing<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.370> at<00:00:50.579> Town<00:00:50.850> Hall<00:00:50.879> 9

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
it's better than doing it at Town Hall 9

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.240 
it's better than doing it at Town Hall 9
because<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.750> guess<00:00:51.989> there<00:00:52.170> are<00:00:52.289> not<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:53.190> many

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
because I guess there are not that many

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.910 
because I guess there are not that many
that<00:00:53.879> start<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.660> has<00:00:54.899> done<00:00:55.140> whole<00:00:55.379> nine<00:00:55.620> or

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
that start that has done whole nine or

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.430 
that start that has done whole nine or
ten<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.879> I'm<00:00:57.180> glad<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.840> they<00:00:57.989> did<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.230> from

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
ten so I'm glad that they did it from

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.799 
ten so I'm glad that they did it from
town<00:00:58.680> hall<00:00:58.710> 8<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.430> this<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> fit<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
town hall 8 so this is the fit the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.680 
town hall 8 so this is the fit the
poison<00:01:01.320> spill<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.980> make<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> toxic<00:01:03.239> cloud<00:01:03.449> that

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
poison spill so make a toxic cloud that

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.050 
poison spill so make a toxic cloud that
that<00:01:04.320> slows<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.979> drains<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> health<00:01:05.820> of

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
that slows and drains the health of

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.510 
that slows and drains the health of
defending<00:01:06.689> troops<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> picture

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
defending troops so this is the picture

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.880 
defending troops so this is the picture
as<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.810> think<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.650> really

full so if you didn't like like as you
all<00:01:45.689> know<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.259> train<00:01:46.530> troops<00:01:46.890> while<00:01:47.220> we

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
all know we can train troops while we

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.210 
all know we can train troops while we
attack<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.710> they<00:01:50.189> are

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
attack and for this so that they are

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.520 
attack and for this so that they are
ready<00:01:50.340> when<00:01:50.790> we<00:01:50.939> come<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.990> went<00:01:52.229> so

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
ready when we come to it with it went so

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.800 
ready when we come to it with it went so
that<00:01:52.740> they<00:01:52.920> are<00:01:52.950> ready<00:01:53.040> when<00:01:53.579> we<00:01:53.790> spent<00:01:54.509> some

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
that they are ready when we spent some

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.319 
that they are ready when we spent some
the<00:01:55.439> others<00:01:55.740> will<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.280> already<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.969> think

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the others will be already so I think

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.270 
the others will be already so I think
now<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:57.810> will<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.560> same<00:01:58.799> thing<00:01:59.040> for

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
now we will have the same thing for
