00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.380
Hi, my name is Sophia! And she, over there, is my
mom. She is a homemaid, and works

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.620
for a family taking care of the children.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.640
My name is Rosilene, I am 28 years old, I am a housemaid.

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.949
My mother's dream was to have an apartment
only for us, so that I could grow with

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.960
no worries, but since she is a homemaid she thought it was impossible to buy one

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.910
My dream was to stop paying rent, it could be in China but I would want it ... the thing

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.500
was to not pay rent anymore. Then I focused on that and I ran after it. I had many negative

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.370
answers because of my profession. They used to ask:

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.320
- Do you work in a formal contract?
- Yes, I do.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.539
- What do you do?
By the time I sad I was a homemaid ... You know?

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.240
And then, I used to tell that my husband was self employed ... I realized that all this

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.520
was a big difficulty.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.519
But one day this story began to change.

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.260
It happened when I was walking with the the boy who I take care of,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.240
I saw a store of MRV and I met the broker who helped me.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.720
I had no hope. I got the information and I said:

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.520
Oh, I give up,
that's not for me.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.979
- Why? 
- I am a homemaid...
She said: - No, why that? What a discrimination!

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.679
Then she brought me here, 
and showed it to me. - Here is where the building

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.780
is going to be built. She presented MRV, took me to the showroom apartment. She showed me

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.380
the apartment... Then I got really excited. I focused on paying the part of

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.820
MRV and my husband payed the part of the rent and home expenses. I ran after it,

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.322
worked on Sundays, and I could afford it.
It was worth it! I'm right here,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.100
in a place that belongs to me, thanks to God.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.160
My mother worked hard and one day finally

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.299
the apartment was ready.
It was a normal day, I was at my work, cooking

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:04.240
the lunch, around 11 AM my phone
rang. It was MRV, asking

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.680
if I wanted to schedule a time for me to get the keys of my apartment. I could not believe.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.900
My God! And I was with that big belly ....

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.420
I realize that every time I remember this I cry...

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.780
It was too much emotion. He said:
- What day that I can schedule it for you?

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.350
I said: No, there is no need to schedule
it. Is it possible to pick it up today?

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.940
Then I went to get my keys with the outfit
I was wearing at work. I didn't even have lunch.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.090
I cried a lot. That was too much joy for me.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.280
From there I started to prepare everything for her. It was all about her, the cradle... her little things...

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.980
after that I could go peacefully to the birth hospital, knowing that I was going to get home

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.690
and she would have her place.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.270
When I left the birth hospital to get to know our home, I was wondering ....

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.680
Will I like it there?

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.700
As soon as I came in, I did not like... I loved it!

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.400
How beautiful was our apartment... and about my room?
It is so beautiful that I think I will not even miss

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.820
my mom's belly.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.620
When I was a child, I loved dolls. She is going to have

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.780
what I didn't have.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.700
which is a lot of dolls to play with.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.140
I'll decorate her room full of dolls,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.380
and the most beautiful place at home, for me, is her room.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.040
Getting home, getting the keys and 
entering into your own home, knowing that it belongs to you?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.320
I will speak the truth, only those who had it for the first time knows how to describe it.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.849
Sometimes I get speechless.
My husband says this and it is true, she didn't

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.549
even get to live in a renting home. I get
to that window over there and think

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.340
this is mine, it's too good ... Wow,
It is indescribable, you have no words to describe it.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.520
I feel like a winner ...

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.840
I'm proud of myself...

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.420
This one in the lap of my mother is me.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.420
When I grow up, I will buy an apartment

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:00.120
for me and for my dolls, just like mom
did. And when I learn to talk I will tell

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.739
my mom that she is the best mother
ever and I'm very proud of her, and

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.790
that our home is the best home in the world.
