the<00:05:19.670> web<00:05:19.820> as<00:05:20.000> well<00:05:20.030> a<00:05:20.390> lot<00:05:20.930> more<00:05:21.140> people<00:05:21.440> than

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
the web as well a lot more people than

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.750 
the web as well a lot more people than
just<00:05:21.650> in<00:05:21.920> the<00:05:21.980> Grand<00:05:22.190> Junction<00:05:22.280> area<00:05:22.610> or

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
just in the Grand Junction area or

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.160 
just in the Grand Junction area or
having<00:05:23.060> this<00:05:23.150> happen<00:05:23.330> to<00:05:23.540> them<00:05:23.660> as<00:05:23.780> well<00:05:23.810> it

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
having this happen to them as well it

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.310 
having this happen to them as well it
seems<00:05:24.710> cool<00:05:25.040> problem<00:05:25.940> being<00:05:26.150> is<00:05:26.390> when<00:05:27.110> someone

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
seems cool problem being is when someone

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.720 
seems cool problem being is when someone
comes<00:05:27.530> to<00:05:27.620> appraise<00:05:28.010> the<00:05:28.160> house<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:28.550> sees

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
comes to appraise the house and sees

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.880 
comes to appraise the house and sees
that<00:05:28.760> all<00:05:29.060> that's<00:05:29.270> wrong<00:05:29.480> your<00:05:30.110> price<00:05:30.560> drops

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
that all that's wrong your price drops

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.560 
that all that's wrong your price drops
down<00:05:31.040> to<00:05:31.100> what<00:05:31.280> it<00:05:31.370> technically<00:05:31.820> is<00:05:31.940> so<00:05:32.480> it

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
down to what it technically is so it

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.910 
down to what it technically is so it
doesn't<00:05:32.810> help<00:05:32.930> you<00:05:33.050> in<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.170> long<00:05:33.200> haul<00:05:33.530> all

doesn't help you in the long haul all
that<00:05:33.980> does<00:05:34.520> is<00:05:34.730> it<00:05:34.820> helps<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.480> national

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
that does is it helps the national

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.690 
that does is it helps the national
boards<00:05:36.440> so<00:05:36.830> that<00:05:36.950> when<00:05:37.070> they<00:05:37.190> send<00:05:37.490> I<00:05:37.550> will

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
boards so that when they send I will

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.330 
boards so that when they send I will
info<00:05:37.970> in<00:05:38.150> to<00:05:38.660> say<00:05:38.900> that<00:05:39.140> oh<00:05:39.320> we<00:05:39.800> aren't<00:05:39.980> coming
