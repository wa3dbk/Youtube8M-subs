00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.119
 hello to all guys and real found today 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.650
 as you can see we are in the company of 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.199
 ashan snaith 7 of huawei device 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.330
 really interesting I was given 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.460
 today from matteo to go and do this 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.020
 unboxing and in the coming days one 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.329
 full review of this terminal 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.649
 I have to say that I really like it 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.370
 a lot we are going to open the box is 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.160
 immediately we find on the left side 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.020
 the box set in the box 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.350
 with the pin to go to open 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.210
 carts of the device and the various of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.160
 instructions that nobody generally goes to 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.270
 read because we already know everything about 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.910
 how to use a device 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.360
 android on the right side instead like 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.800
 you can see we find the device 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.049
 device quite big 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.850
 dimensions are considerable we have 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.659
 6 inch display 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.590
 I must say however that it is used to the 6 plus la 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.369
 size is not so much 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.590
 striking as you can see 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.760
 they are practically identical slightly 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.600
 wider this huawei nate seven 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.860
 let's set aside a moment 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.770
 device nor to see what is there 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.090
 inside the box we find a well 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.430
 these were the films that were there 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.250
 on the device we find give in the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.240
 right side of the box in this one 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.030
 little box that with USB charger dinners 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.140
 then included from the wall by two amps then 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.630
 quick charge for huawei mail seven 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.340
 earplugs of good workmanship of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.340
 huawei was the same as there were also 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.850
 in di 7 and then we obviously find the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.180
 micro usb usb cable for charging 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.280
 of our device but let's go to 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.869
 put all these aside for a moment 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.090
 tins we go to pick up the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.950
 device I tell you right away that i 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.740
 materials are premium materials we have 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.319
 an aluminum body on the back and 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.110
 also the edges on the left side 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:18.510
 we find the two micro sd and microsd slots 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.239
 kolab down and micro sim the one in 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.980
 high not nano but microsim on the part in 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.010
 high we find a microphone for the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.470
 noise suppression and jack for le 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.470
 headphones on the bottom we find a 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.989
 other microphone and the micro usb socket for 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.190
 recharge on the right button side 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.750
 power and rock volume behind we find the 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.120
 fingerprint sensor 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.130
 in addition to the camera and the LED flash 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.840
 fingerprint sensor I have to 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.940
 say lot was a lot and it works 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.549
 a hundred times better than the iPhone 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.620
 and 200 times better than that of the samsung 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.120
 a really comfortable thing that I have 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.079
 recorded my hearing exactly in 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.820
 this position 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.560
 in fact, as you can see here in 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.970
 unlock it easily but if I for 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.060
 example I put my finger 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.280
 on the contrary, it will still be able to read 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.780
 my finger and how you see it unlocking it 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.790
 so we will have no problem with 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.130
 reposition the finger in it 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.660
 identical position the same 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.500
 position with respect to which the valley s 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.090
 in the actual registration 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.000
 so something different from the iphone for 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.850
 example the display is a 6 inch like 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.890
 I said and this was a little unboxing 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.359
 fast or even introduced some 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.910
 nice feature since i'm 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.320
 trying for a few days we find ourselves 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.480
 then in the next few days for one 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.670
 full review of this huawei 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.530
 might 7 if you have any kind of 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.930
 ask about the device you want to make me 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.489
 then for a full review, do it 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.380
