00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:19.339 
leaks coming out of the cylinder head as

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:20.639 
leaks coming out of the cylinder head as
you<00:00:19.579> see<00:00:19.759> right<00:00:19.789> there

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:20.649 
you see right there

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:25.859 
you see right there
I'm<00:00:21.649> just<00:00:22.069> affecting<00:00:22.640> pages<00:00:23.890> if<00:00:24.890> there<00:00:25.189> are

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
I'm just affecting pages if there are

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.040 
I'm just affecting pages if there are
any<00:00:26.869> signs<00:00:27.109> of<00:00:27.229> lead<00:00:27.409> called<00:00:27.739> a<00:00:28.809> base<00:00:29.809> call

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
any signs of lead called a base call

any signs of lead called a base call
hotline<00:00:30.380> see<00:00:30.619> what's<00:00:30.769> going<00:00:30.979> on<00:00:31.069> made<00:00:31.609> for

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:31.819 
hotline see what's going on made for

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:33.599 
hotline see what's going on made for
reflection<00:00:32.239> of<00:00:32.329> its<00:00:32.450> owner<00:00:32.660> head<00:00:32.870> but<00:00:33.109> uh

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:33.609 
reflection of its owner head but uh

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.799 
reflection of its owner head but uh
guess<00:00:34.609> so<00:00:34.789> there's<00:00:35.059> a<00:00:35.090> few<00:00:35.269> of<00:00:35.390> them<00:00:35.510> out<00:00:35.629> there

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
guess so there's a few of them out there

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.450 
guess so there's a few of them out there
is<00:00:35.989> actually<00:00:36.500> leaking<00:00:36.620> oil<00:00:36.920> inside<00:00:37.250> the

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
is actually leaking oil inside the

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.069 
is actually leaking oil inside the
valley<00:00:38.359> of<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:38.600> engine

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
valley of the engine

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.349 
valley of the engine
what<00:00:40.039> would<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.219> Sparkletts<00:00:40.579> are<00:00:40.730> at<00:00:40.850> causing

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:41.359 
what would the Sparkletts are at causing

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.919 
what would the Sparkletts are at causing
this<00:00:41.449> fires<00:00:41.719> and<00:00:41.929> stuff<00:00:42.109> like<00:00:42.199> that<00:00:43.929> so

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
this fires and stuff like that so

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.540 
this fires and stuff like that so
they're<00:00:45.350> they<00:00:45.890> want<00:00:46.070> us<00:00:46.160> to<00:00:46.190> put<00:00:46.429> Loctite<00:00:47.230> and

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
they're they want us to put Loctite and

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.770 
they're they want us to put Loctite and
this<00:00:49.550> new<00:00:49.730> plug<00:00:50.149> which<00:00:50.690> is<00:00:50.719> this<00:00:51.079> right<00:00:51.320> here

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.099 

and<00:00:56.780> goes<00:00:57.019> right<00:00:57.199> over<00:00:57.440> top<00:00:57.859> of<00:00:58.039> the<00:00:59.109> freeze

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
and goes right over top of the freeze

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.410 
and goes right over top of the freeze
plug<00:01:00.409> inside<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:01.339> sounder<00:01:02.030> head<00:01:02.179> as<00:01:02.359> a

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
plug inside the sounder head as a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.849 
plug inside the sounder head as a
seasoned<00:01:02.870> pitch<00:01:03.109> right<00:01:03.350> there<00:01:03.499> as<00:01:03.649> you<00:01:03.710> can

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
seasoned pitch right there as you can

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.399 
seasoned pitch right there as you can
see<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:04.250> in<00:01:04.370> the<00:01:04.460> picture<00:01:04.729> so<00:01:05.390> here's<00:01:06.259> the

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
see it in the picture so here's the

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:15.410 
see it in the picture so here's the
vehicle

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.370 

okay<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:17.220> here's<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.380> high-pressure

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
okay so it's here's the high-pressure

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.000 
okay so it's here's the high-pressure
pump<00:01:21.800> right<00:01:22.800> there<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.479> inside<00:01:25.320> there's

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
pump right there and then inside there's

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.469 
pump right there and then inside there's
Purell<00:01:26.520> right<00:01:27.510> there<00:01:29.119> that's<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.390> that

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
Purell right there that's the one that

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.190 
Purell right there that's the one that
keeps<00:01:30.780> leaking<00:01:31.080> or<00:01:31.590> supposedly<00:01:32.400> leaking<00:01:32.880> um<00:01:33.200> I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
keeps leaking or supposedly leaking um I

haven't seen one yet so I put some

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.990 
haven't seen one yet so I put some
Loctite<00:01:37.110> 290<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.009> there<00:01:38.220> let<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.759> sit<00:01:38.970> for

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
Loctite 290 on there let it sit for

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.880 
Loctite 290 on there let it sit for
about<00:01:39.150> ten<00:01:39.420> minutes<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.440> put<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> heavy
