 In a pan, put all our ingredients and mix well. Add flour until our mixture peels off the walls 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.440
 On a floured bench we knead well and let it rest for 30 minutes covered with a towel 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:30.620
 Cut the dough and make it in balls about the size of our handful. We open them in size from a cup of tea and spread them with melted butter 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:18.600
 We lay our cards on top of each other, for the first card we will need 5 of the smallest cards. For the remaining 3 we will need 4 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:03:22.280
 Open the first sheet (the process is on the video) and put it on the buttered baking pan. We take care of its edges to protrude. Butter and add the second sheet 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:04:02.340
 Put the filling of our taste and butter. Place the 3 sheets, but butter and put the last one 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:39.580
 On the last sheet, we butter well the edges and turn them to create a whorl 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:56.020
 Butter all the surface and sprinkle it with water. We cut into the shape that our pieces want to have and bake at 200 degrees for about 1 hour
