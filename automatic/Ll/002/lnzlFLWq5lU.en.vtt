below for you to that tutorial so the
very<00:01:14.159> first<00:01:14.340> tip<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.850> I'll<00:01:14.939> talk<00:01:15.119> about<00:01:15.150> is

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
very first tip that I'll talk about is

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.929 
very first tip that I'll talk about is
contouring<00:01:16.619> your<00:01:16.799> mouth<00:01:17.070> believe<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.759> or<00:01:17.820> not

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
contouring your mouth believe it or not

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.510 
contouring your mouth believe it or not
this<00:01:18.240> adds<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.750> lot<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.290> dimension<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.130> your

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
this adds a lot of dimension to your

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.429 
this adds a lot of dimension to your
lips<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.570> not<00:01:21.720> something<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.290> would

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
lips but it's not something that I would

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.050 
lips but it's not something that I would
recommend<00:01:22.560> doing<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.610> an<00:01:23.729> everyday

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
