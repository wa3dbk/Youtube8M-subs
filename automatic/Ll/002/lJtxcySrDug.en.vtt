00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.890 
I just had an impression made today I
consulted<00:00:23.730> with<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.090> with<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900

consulted with the with the
prosthodontist<00:00:25.769> sore<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.369> think<00:00:26.760> that's<00:00:26.880> why

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
prosthodontist sore I think that's why

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.150 
prosthodontist sore I think that's why
you<00:00:27.119> use<00:00:27.180> anyway<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:30.410> at<00:00:31.410> thirty<00:00:31.769> nine<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
you use anyway so at thirty nine and a

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.639 
you use anyway so at thirty nine and a
half<00:00:32.189> years<00:00:32.309> old<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.969> really<00:00:33.649> hard

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
half years old it's a really hard

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.920 
half years old it's a really hard
decision<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.160> make<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.640> seems<00:00:35.880> kind<00:00:36.870> of

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
decision to make it seems kind of

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.470 
decision to make it seems kind of
extreme<00:00:37.489> especially<00:00:38.489> since<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.940> know<00:00:39.059> you

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
extreme especially since you know you

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.869 
extreme especially since you know you
look<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:39.750> my<00:00:39.899> teeth<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:40.800> don't<00:00:41.040> well

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
actually they do it pretty jacked up you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.020

as<00:01:32.369> well<00:01:32.610> get<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.850> over<00:01:33.000> with<00:01:33.299> now<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:35.509> that's

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
as well get it over with now so that's

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.690 
as well get it over with now so that's
pretty<00:01:37.409> much<00:01:37.500> where<00:01:37.799> I'm<00:01:37.979> at<00:01:38.130> right<00:01:38.159> now<00:01:38.369> it's

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
pretty much where I'm at right now it's

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.410 
pretty much where I'm at right now it's
like<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.270> said<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:40.530> little<00:01:40.740> hard<00:01:41.420> it's

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
like I said it's a little hard it's

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.569 
like I said it's a little hard it's
definitely<00:01:43.079> hard<00:01:46.310> didn't<00:01:47.310> make<00:01:47.430> this

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
definitely hard didn't make this

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.020 
definitely hard didn't make this
decision<00:01:47.939> lightly<00:01:48.119> believe<00:01:48.750> me<00:01:48.899> it's<00:01:50.030> it's

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
decision lightly believe me it's it's

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.660 
decision lightly believe me it's it's
not<00:01:51.950> cheap<00:01:52.950> either<00:01:53.810> but<00:01:54.860> it'll<00:01:55.860> hopefully

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
not cheap either but it'll hopefully

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.219 
not cheap either but it'll hopefully
work<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.570> best<00:01:57.719> I've<00:01:57.960> spent<00:01:58.140> the
