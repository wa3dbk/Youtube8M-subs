 let's do is direct us from the part 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.910
 top left on the block 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.420
 give you about this sea that this is very 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.540
 important since mavericks will be 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:40.260
 available to update from 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:42.750
 snow leopard which is 10.7 10.8 and 10.6 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.170
 we are talking snow leopard lion and 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.180
 ride it myself if the second thing we have 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.700
 what to do 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.370
 go again to the apple in the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.920
 second option what is update 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.430
 of software and see that you are going to send us 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.850
 directly to the mac appstore 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:06.000
 here we have mavericks os-10 here 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.420
 we have the information of the new ones that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.320
 has as maps has calendars with 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.860
 Location 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.420
 to navigate from safari with twitter and 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.940
 the famous tags or labels if this is 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.300
 as the versions as the versions 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:30.600
 previous ones that we give in the 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:34.240
 update will host a file 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.080
 in the applications part and after 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.940
 we have to extract that file 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.539
 this is a totally live recording 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.940
 this means that there is no issue what 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.190
 I'm going to do like that then let's hope 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.670
 that comes out in the best way and that 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:55.790
 you can upgrade to mavericks or 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.050
 s10 we give you in free update 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.050
 our apps 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.500
 here he will ask us for the safest 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.899
 haiti our apple is right I 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.799
 what I'm going to do is type what 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.799
 my password 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.770
 let's wait for the answer 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.140
 and password is correct 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.620
 and it has to be this way we will appear this 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.350
 small illustration that means that 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.109
 the update is already being updated 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.030
 weight 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:36.730
 5.9 gigabytes this may take a 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.340
 considerable time depending much the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.879
 internet connection that we have mine 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.420
 it's very poor is at 3 megabytes per megabyte 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.730
 second then it will take a little 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.159
 I'm going to pause this video so that 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.260
 we have to wait all this time and 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:57.099
 When I finish downloading I will continue 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.859
 recording and we are going to give continuity to 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:03.069
 this tutorial good maqueros already came 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:06.639
 the night we finished downloading 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:10.719
 our update of mavericks or s10 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:12.969
 version 9 and before updating our 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:18.040
 system I will show you how 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:21.459
 endorse our dmg of links from 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.620
 installer mavericks ok what 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.689
 we have to do is go to the 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:31.150
 finder ' applications search icon 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:34.049
 install mavericks let's click 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.860
 right show package content 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.160
 content 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.760
 be the support and here we have our 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.520
 native installer if I give command and 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.400
 to show us the information 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.210
 let's see what will show us 5.29 gigas 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.570
 what I'm going to do at this moment is 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:59.500
 copy and paste on my desk so that 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.740
 later I show them how to do 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.200
 an installation from scratch but before 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.160
 to achieve this we need to support 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.550
 our information as music photos 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.720
 videos and documents in general and a 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:20.739
 Once we have the support of 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:24.130
 our information we can format 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.520
 our mac and install from scratch or 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.950
 natively matrix what advantage has 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.560
 this will work better 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.420
 way this time and in this video 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.860
 tutorial we're just going to update 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.510
 to know our computer I what 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.940
 What I'm going to do is acquire 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.680
 a hard drive on which I'm going to do the 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.310
 backup as I had told them of my 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.670
 music photos and videos and good once 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.420
 I finished that 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:57.390
 I'm going to do another tutorial on how 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:05:02.160
 install mavericks from scratch we're going to 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:04.410
 hope that our dmg is copied and 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.440
 Later we will give in 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.920
 continue let's pause and then you 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.650
 I'm going to show mavericks already installed 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.470
 good since we have backed our 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.320
 dmg or installer the only thing that we have left 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.660
 to do is update our mac to 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.510
 mavericks how are we going to do we're going 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:30.000
 to give in continue to accept again 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.040
 select the disk or drive where 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.980
 we want to install it 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.540
 we give in install 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.700
 our password 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.830
 and good here is preparing the 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.880
 installation this may take a few 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:47.790
 good minutes here already finished doing 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.460
 the preparation of the installation and in a 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.960
 couple of seconds is going to restart 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.150
 Now we are returning maqueros 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.910
 back we have our list ready 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:00.000
 update of mac or that 10.9 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:03.060
 mavericks as we see it on screen and 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.160
 As a good thing, I tell you that they median 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.430
 Requested my icloud data again 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.820
 this within the system does not precede the 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.710
 installation some things that I have noticed 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.650
 is that not all applications are 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.290
 pulling for mavericks other changes that 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.560
 I have seen is that in the center of 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:25.860
 notifications we already have there are months 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.820
 integrated in the dock we already found what 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.590
 which are ibooks maps and the image both 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.320
 of the dock like the desktop are more 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:37.380
 sharp in what is finder 'already 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.870
 we found our labels 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.440
 and in what is the a chip so that 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.990
 let's see the icons of ay live follow 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.810
 being the same but in the appstore 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:52.770
 we have an update I suggest 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:56.280
 that we do it and from my part 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:59.190
 it's all my name add this is mauer 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.500
 pro in the next tutorial I 'm going to 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:05.090
 teach how to install mavericks from 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:07.890
 a usb or external hard drive from scratch 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:10.500
 and in the next tutorial I'm going to 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.750
 teach more about mavericks the first 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.230
 impressions and significant changes 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:19.760
 that we have had with this update 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.760
 until the next chau machine
