welcome to Dara Golf TV introducing the
new<00:00:09.179> night<00:00:09.750> method<00:00:10.469> concept<00:00:11.010> putter

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.010 

so<00:00:22.640> what<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:22.820> guys<00:00:23.000> are<00:00:23.029> naked<00:00:23.449> done<00:00:23.840> with

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
so what the guys are naked done with

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.600 
so what the guys are naked done with
this<00:00:24.110> putter<00:00:24.410> is<00:00:24.650> they<00:00:24.800> created<00:00:25.220> a<00:00:25.340> concept

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
this putter is they created a concept

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.940 
this putter is they created a concept
that<00:00:26.210> it's<00:00:26.869> basically<00:00:27.410> trying<00:00:27.560> to<00:00:27.680> suit

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
that it's basically trying to suit

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.529 
that it's basically trying to suit
everybody<00:00:28.220> so<00:00:28.580> we've<00:00:28.730> got<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:29.119> the

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
everybody so we've got the the

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.979 
everybody so we've got the the
traditional<00:00:29.779> face<00:00:30.529> on<00:00:30.770> the<00:00:30.860> frontier

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
traditional face on the frontier

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:34.630 
traditional face on the frontier
incorporating<00:00:32.989> mallet<00:00:33.410> shape<00:00:33.800> design<00:00:34.309> really

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
incorporating mallet shape design really

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.549 
incorporating mallet shape design really
which<00:00:34.879> helps<00:00:35.270> to<00:00:35.330> put<00:00:35.629> it<00:00:35.750> to<00:00:35.840> perform<00:00:36.230> like<00:00:36.530> a

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
which helps to put it to perform like a

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.560 
which helps to put it to perform like a
mallet<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.579> whole<00:00:37.700> idea<00:00:37.730> behind<00:00:38.030> a<00:00:38.300> mallet

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
mallet so the whole idea behind a mallet

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.939 
mallet so the whole idea behind a mallet
putter<00:00:38.750> is<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.080> fact<00:00:39.290> that<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.530> club<00:00:39.769> isn't

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
putter is the fact that the club isn't

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.040 
putter is the fact that the club isn't
gonna<00:00:40.129> be<00:00:40.280> twisting<00:00:40.940> through<00:00:41.150> impact<00:00:41.629> area

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
gonna be twisting through impact area

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.960 
gonna be twisting through impact area
it's<00:00:42.650> gonna<00:00:42.830> create<00:00:43.129> a<00:00:43.190> much<00:00:43.430> more<00:00:43.640> stable

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
it's gonna create a much more stable

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.640 
it's gonna create a much more stable
movement<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:44.720> therefore<00:00:44.960> get<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.140> ball<00:00:45.320> ball

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
movement and therefore get the ball ball

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.799 
movement and therefore get the ball ball
rolling<00:00:46.100> better<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:47.000> with<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:47.269> traditional

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
rolling better so with the traditional

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.410 
rolling better so with the traditional
look<00:00:48.019> in<00:00:48.230> front<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:49.129> mallet<00:00:49.460> shape<00:00:49.730> back<00:00:50.030> it's

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
look in front the mallet shape back it's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.630 
look in front the mallet shape back it's
something<00:00:50.900> to<00:00:51.019> try<00:00:51.230> and<00:00:51.260> suit<00:00:51.559> everybody<00:00:51.830> but

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
something to try and suit everybody but

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.340 
something to try and suit everybody but
it<00:00:52.699> doesn't<00:00:53.059> look<00:00:53.330> traditional<00:00:53.629> at<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.170> show

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
it doesn't look traditional at so show

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.320 
it doesn't look traditional at so show
it's<00:00:54.500> quite<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.710> unique<00:00:54.769> concept<00:00:55.549> but<00:00:56.210> it

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
it's quite a unique concept but it

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.320 
it's quite a unique concept but it
definitely<00:00:56.540> works<00:01:00.820> so<00:01:01.820> I'm<00:01:01.879> gonna<00:01:02.000> look<00:01:02.119> at

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
definitely works so I'm gonna look at

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.939 
definitely works so I'm gonna look at
the<00:01:02.420> looks<00:01:02.720> of<00:01:02.869> this<00:01:02.960> putters<00:01:03.500> I<00:01:03.650> put<00:01:03.860> it

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
the looks of this putters I put it

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.430 
the looks of this putters I put it
behind<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.339> ball<00:01:04.519> here<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.449> two-tone<00:01:06.080> red

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
behind the ball here the two-tone red

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.140 
behind the ball here the two-tone red
black<00:01:06.799> finish<00:01:07.280> it's<00:01:07.490> not<00:01:07.700> gonna<00:01:07.820> be<00:01:08.000> to

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
black finish it's not gonna be to

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.390 
black finish it's not gonna be to
everybody's<00:01:08.659> taste<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:09.320> as<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:09.979> put<00:01:10.190> it<00:01:10.280> behind

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
everybody's taste so as I put it behind

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.310 
everybody's taste so as I put it behind
the<00:01:10.640> ball<00:01:10.820> there<00:01:11.090> I'm<00:01:11.360> not<00:01:11.570> particularly<00:01:11.960> fond

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
the ball there I'm not particularly fond

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.960 
the ball there I'm not particularly fond
of<00:01:12.440> it<00:01:12.590> but<00:01:12.799> it's<00:01:12.920> not<00:01:13.010> it's<00:01:13.430> not<00:01:13.640> disastrous

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
of it but it's not it's not disastrous

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.580 
of it but it's not it's not disastrous
that's<00:01:14.450> for<00:01:14.600> sure<00:01:14.750> but<00:01:14.840> it<00:01:14.960> does<00:01:15.140> help<00:01:15.409> your

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
that's for sure but it does help your

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.010 
that's for sure but it does help your
lineup<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.360> fact<00:01:17.600> that<00:01:17.659> we've<00:01:17.810> got<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
lineup so the fact that we've got the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.690 
lineup so the fact that we've got the
white<00:01:18.229> line<00:01:18.500> and<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:18.740> top<00:01:19.010> there<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.430> really

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
white line and the top there it really

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.130 
white line and the top there it really
gives<00:01:19.970> you<00:01:20.119> confidence<00:01:20.420> you're<00:01:20.900> gonna<00:01:20.990> get

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
gives you confidence you're gonna get

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.840 
gives you confidence you're gonna get
the<00:01:21.260> ball<00:01:21.439> rolling<00:01:21.920> now<00:01:22.070> what<00:01:22.549> they've<00:01:22.700> also

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
the ball rolling now what they've also

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.609 
the ball rolling now what they've also
done<00:01:23.090> it<00:01:23.210> incorporate<00:01:23.720> a<00:01:23.750> lot<00:01:23.990> of<00:01:24.049> technology

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
done it incorporate a lot of technology

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.080 
done it incorporate a lot of technology
into<00:01:24.770> this<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.100> we've<00:01:25.220> got<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.460> poly<00:01:25.700> metal

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
into this so we've got the poly metal

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.929 
into this so we've got the poly metal
facing<00:01:26.600> sir<00:01:26.929> and<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:28.039> grooves<00:01:28.399> in<00:01:28.670> that

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
facing sir and the grooves in that

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.249 
facing sir and the grooves in that
basically<00:01:29.359> help<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:29.810> get<00:01:29.929> the<00:01:30.049> ball<00:01:30.079> rolling

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
basically help to get the ball rolling

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.389 
basically help to get the ball rolling
quicker<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.729> feel<00:01:32.090> off<00:01:32.359> the<00:01:32.509> putter<00:01:32.689> face

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
quicker so the feel off the putter face

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.919 
quicker so the feel off the putter face
is<00:01:34.399> actually<00:01:34.640> quite<00:01:35.060> solid<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:35.719> it<00:01:35.780> makes

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
is actually quite solid and it makes

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.870 
is actually quite solid and it makes
quite<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.229> nice<00:01:36.679> unique<00:01:37.130> click<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:37.759> you're

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
quite a nice unique click so you're

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.859 
quite a nice unique click so you're
definitely<00:01:37.999> getting<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:38.509> feeling<00:01:38.749> that

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
definitely getting the feeling that

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.139 
definitely getting the feeling that
you're<00:01:39.079> rolling<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.770> ball<00:01:40.009> in<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.850> place

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
you're rolling the ball in the place

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.669 
you're rolling the ball in the place
that<00:01:41.179> you<00:01:41.509> wanted<00:01:41.869> it<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.140> go<00:01:42.259> in<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.439> first

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
that you wanted it to go in the first

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.340 
that you wanted it to go in the first
place<00:01:43.179> so<00:01:44.179> I've<00:01:44.270> tried<00:01:44.600> that<00:01:44.810> put<00:01:44.990> saw<00:01:45.109> a<00:01:45.140> lot

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
place so I've tried that put saw a lot

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.289 
place so I've tried that put saw a lot
today<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:45.679> I<00:01:45.829> like<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.369> way<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.759> forms<00:01:47.149> I<00:01:47.240> do

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
today and I like the way the forms I do

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.459 
today and I like the way the forms I do
like<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.749> way<00:01:47.869> it<00:01:47.960> gets<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.259> ball<00:01:48.409> rolling

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
like the way it gets the ball rolling
