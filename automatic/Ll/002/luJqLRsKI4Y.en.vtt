00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
this is really just the most basic fish

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.819 
this is really just the most basic fish
bass<00:00:19.579> really<00:00:19.970> that<00:00:20.210> we're<00:00:20.329> working<00:00:20.419> with<00:00:20.829> but

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:21.829 
bass really that we're working with but

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:23.650 
bass really that we're working with but
it<00:00:21.950> makes<00:00:22.130> a<00:00:22.250> kind<00:00:22.430> of<00:00:22.460> a<00:00:22.550> fun<00:00:22.759> little<00:00:22.790> toy<00:00:23.210> so

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
it makes a kind of a fun little toy so

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.229 
it makes a kind of a fun little toy so
we're<00:00:24.529> going<00:00:24.619> to<00:00:24.710> start<00:00:25.130> off<00:00:25.279> with<00:00:25.640> a<00:00:25.939> basic

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:26.239 
we're going to start off with a basic

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.900 
we're going to start off with a basic
square<00:00:26.869> piece<00:00:27.140> of<00:00:27.169> origami<00:00:27.649> paper<00:00:27.890> you<00:00:28.790> can

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
square piece of origami paper you can

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.700 
square piece of origami paper you can
use<00:00:29.000> any<00:00:29.270> paper<00:00:29.509> I<00:00:29.899> think<00:00:29.960> these<00:00:30.259> kinds<00:00:30.649> of

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
use any paper I think these kinds of

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.049 
use any paper I think these kinds of
projects<00:00:31.040> tend<00:00:31.220> to<00:00:31.309> work<00:00:31.430> really<00:00:31.669> good<00:00:31.820> too

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
projects tend to work really good too

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.639 
projects tend to work really good too
with<00:00:32.270> printer<00:00:32.599> paper<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:33.050> stuff<00:00:33.260> because<00:00:33.500> the

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
with printer paper and stuff because the

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.140 
with printer paper and stuff because the
folds<00:00:33.950> aren't<00:00:34.130> that<00:00:34.219> complicated<00:00:34.489> and<00:00:35.030> you

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
folds aren't that complicated and you

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.100 
folds aren't that complicated and you
can<00:00:35.300> still<00:00:35.540> kind<00:00:35.750> of<00:00:35.780> make<00:00:35.960> everything

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
can still kind of make everything

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.080 
can still kind of make everything
without<00:00:36.530> too<00:00:36.830> much<00:00:36.950> trouble<00:00:37.190> even<00:00:37.760> though<00:00:38.000> the

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
without too much trouble even though the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.300 
without too much trouble even though the
paper<00:00:38.270> might<00:00:38.540> be<00:00:38.570> thicker<00:00:39.040> I'm<00:00:40.040> going<00:00:40.190> to<00:00:40.250> be

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
paper might be thicker I'm going to be

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.400 
paper might be thicker I'm going to be
using<00:00:40.460> standard<00:00:41.090> paper<00:00:41.300> size<00:00:41.480> 15<00:00:42.200> by<00:00:42.350> 15

little orange fish and I want to start

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.950 
little orange fish and I want to start
with<00:00:52.490> the<00:00:52.670> color<00:00:52.880> side<00:00:52.940> facing<00:00:53.540> up<00:00:53.660> I<00:00:53.780> just

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
with the color side facing up I just

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.479 
with the color side facing up I just
want<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:54.200> go<00:00:54.260> ahead<00:00:54.380> and<00:00:54.500> fold<00:00:54.770> everything<00:00:55.250> in

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
want to go ahead and fold everything in

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.340 
want to go ahead and fold everything in
half<00:00:55.700> here<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:56.180> that<00:00:56.720> I<00:00:56.780> can<00:00:56.840> get<00:00:57.079> a<00:00:57.110> nice

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
half here so that I can get a nice

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.460 
half here so that I can get a nice
crease<00:00:57.829> right<00:00:58.010> in<00:00:58.130> the<00:00:58.190> middle<00:00:59.200> fold<00:01:00.200> it<00:01:00.350> into

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
crease right in the middle fold it into

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.479 
crease right in the middle fold it into
a<00:01:00.590> big<00:01:00.829> triangle<00:01:01.960> open<00:01:02.960> it<00:01:03.050> up<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.100> then<00:01:04.250> flip

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
a big triangle open it up and then flip

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.770 
a big triangle open it up and then flip
it<00:01:04.579> over<00:01:04.699> so<00:01:04.970> we're<00:01:05.059> looking<00:01:05.299> at<00:01:05.390> that<00:01:05.570> white

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
it over so we're looking at that white

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.440 
it over so we're looking at that white
side<00:01:06.049> and<00:01:06.409> I'm<00:01:06.530> gonna<00:01:06.650> take<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.670> outer<00:01:08.030> edge

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
side and I'm gonna take the outer edge

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
side and I'm gonna take the outer edge
here<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.320> fold<00:01:09.530> it<00:01:09.650> in<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.100> center<00:01:11.470> line

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
here and fold it in to the center line

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.530 
here and fold it in to the center line
up<00:01:12.650> that<00:01:13.130> edge<00:01:13.370> to<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.850> center<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:14.330> then

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
up that edge to the center and then

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.460 
up that edge to the center and then
smooth<00:01:15.080> out<00:01:15.550> to<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.670> side<00:01:16.940> from<00:01:17.270> there<00:01:17.540> do<00:01:18.320> the

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
smooth out to the side from there do the

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:26.770 
smooth out to the side from there do the
same<00:01:18.680> thing<00:01:18.890> on<00:01:19.010> this<00:01:19.159> side<00:01:19.220> too<00:01:19.760> so<00:01:25.750> get<00:01:26.750> a

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
same thing on this side too so get a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.500 
same thing on this side too so get a
nice<00:01:26.930> kite<00:01:27.290> shape<00:01:27.610> flip<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:28.700> over<00:01:28.760> go<00:01:29.479> ahead

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
nice kite shape flip it over go ahead

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.210 
nice kite shape flip it over go ahead
and<00:01:29.690> take<00:01:29.870> the<00:01:30.020> bottom<00:01:30.200> tip<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:30.830> fold<00:01:31.040> it

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
and take the bottom tip and fold it

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.450 
and take the bottom tip and fold it
right<00:01:31.400> up<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.729> top<00:01:32.030> just<00:01:32.979> be<00:01:33.979> careful<00:01:34.340> when

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
right up to the top just be careful when

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.039 
right up to the top just be careful when
you<00:01:34.549> fold<00:01:34.760> this<00:01:35.030> down<00:01:35.299> at<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:35.630> bottom<00:01:35.780> that

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
you fold this down at the bottom that

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.800 
you fold this down at the bottom that
you<00:01:36.140> don't<00:01:36.320> accidentally<00:01:36.790> tear<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.150> tug<00:01:38.540> into

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.740 
do is put a little pressure on this
outer<00:01:47.900> edge<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:48.350> just<00:01:48.590> push<00:01:48.830> in<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.750> we're

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
outer edge and just push in and we're

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.719 
outer edge and just push in and we're
going<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.960> create<00:01:51.229> a<00:01:51.320> new<00:01:51.710> triangular<00:01:52.490> shape

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
going to create a new triangular shape

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.609 
going to create a new triangular shape
here<00:01:52.970> as<00:01:53.060> we<00:01:53.180> do<00:01:53.330> this<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.900> can<00:01:53.990> start<00:01:54.380> up<00:01:54.500> here

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
here as we do this you can start up here

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.410 
here as we do this you can start up here
at<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.830> top<00:01:55.040> fold<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.670> outer<00:01:55.909> edge<00:01:56.180> right

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
at the top fold the outer edge right

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.090 
at the top fold the outer edge right
into<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.930> center<00:01:57.229> try<00:01:57.409> to<00:01:57.470> get<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.650> nice<00:01:57.860> little

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
into the center try to get a nice little

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.359 
into the center try to get a nice little
point<00:01:58.340> there<00:01:58.490> at<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.790> top<00:01:59.560> start<00:02:00.560> up<00:02:00.650> as<00:02:00.950> that

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
point there at the top start up as that

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.460 
point there at the top start up as that
and<00:02:01.729> work<00:02:01.970> your<00:02:02.150> way<00:02:02.299> along<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:02.900> kind<00:02:03.200> of<00:02:03.229> turn

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
and work your way along you kind of turn

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.190 
and work your way along you kind of turn
it<00:02:03.590> around<00:02:03.650> as<00:02:03.979> we<00:02:04.100> move<00:02:04.630> smooth<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:05.780> all<00:02:05.930> the

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
it around as we move smooth it all the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.480 
it around as we move smooth it all the
way<00:02:06.290> out<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:06.439> you<00:02:06.710> should<00:02:06.950> be<00:02:07.100> able<00:02:07.159> to<00:02:07.280> get<00:02:07.460> a

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
way out and you should be able to get a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.110 
way out and you should be able to get a
nice<00:02:07.790> smooth<00:02:08.799> triangle<00:02:09.799> shape<00:02:10.039> from<00:02:10.789> top<00:02:11.090> to

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
nice smooth triangle shape from top to

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.659 
nice smooth triangle shape from top to
bottom<00:02:11.650> I'm<00:02:12.650> gonna<00:02:12.829> do<00:02:12.919> the<00:02:13.069> same<00:02:13.249> thing<00:02:13.310> with

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:13.669 
bottom I'm gonna do the same thing with

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.309 
bottom I'm gonna do the same thing with
this<00:02:13.849> side<00:02:13.909> to<00:02:14.299> again<00:02:14.510> just<00:02:14.689> opening<00:02:15.079> up<00:02:15.139> this

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
this side to again just opening up this

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.509 
this side to again just opening up this
whole<00:02:15.379> section<00:02:15.919> and<00:02:16.040> bringing<00:02:16.340> everything

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
whole section and bringing everything

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.089 
whole section and bringing everything
over<00:02:16.969> start<00:02:17.719> down<00:02:17.930> here<00:02:18.169> at<00:02:18.260> this<00:02:18.469> bottom<00:02:18.889> part

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
over start down here at this bottom part

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.089 
over start down here at this bottom part
trying<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.519> make<00:02:19.669> a<00:02:19.700> nice<00:02:19.969> little<00:02:20.799> tip<00:02:21.799> that

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
trying to make a nice little tip that

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.809 
trying to make a nice little tip that
lined<00:02:25.099> up<00:02:26.859> smooth<00:02:27.859> everything<00:02:28.159> out<00:02:28.370> towards

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
lined up smooth everything out towards

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.769 
lined up smooth everything out towards
the<00:02:28.969> top<00:02:30.819> so<00:02:31.819> we<00:02:31.909> get<00:02:32.060> something<00:02:32.299> that<00:02:32.599> looks

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:32.779 
the top so we get something that looks

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:36.369 
the top so we get something that looks
like<00:02:32.959> this<00:02:33.579> and<00:02:34.579> that's<00:02:35.450> like<00:02:35.629> a<00:02:35.659> basic<00:02:35.959> sort

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
like this and that's like a basic sort

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.769 
like this and that's like a basic sort
of<00:02:36.439> fish<00:02:36.650> design<00:02:37.159> there<00:02:37.400> now<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.209> next<00:02:38.689> thing

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:38.779 
of fish design there now the next thing

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.470 
of fish design there now the next thing
that<00:02:38.930> we're<00:02:39.019> gonna<00:02:39.079> do<00:02:39.409> is<00:02:39.650> just<00:02:39.829> take<00:02:40.480> the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
that we're gonna do is just take the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.959 
that we're gonna do is just take the
sides<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.200> make<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.349> little<00:02:42.559> tail<00:02:42.859> and<00:02:43.249> you<00:02:43.849> can

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:43.969 
sides and make a little tail and you can

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:45.580 
sides and make a little tail and you can
kind<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.209> choose<00:02:44.389> this<00:02:44.569> arbitrarily<00:02:45.139> we<00:02:45.439> would

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
kind of choose this arbitrarily we would

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.140 
kind of choose this arbitrarily we would
just<00:02:45.829> want<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.069> kind<00:02:46.249> of<00:02:46.279> fold<00:02:46.519> it<00:02:46.669> up<00:02:46.849> and

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
just want to kind of fold it up and

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.599 
just want to kind of fold it up and
create<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.559> can<00:02:48.739> kind<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.099> think<00:02:49.159> about

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
create you can kind of think about

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.399 
create you can kind of think about
creating<00:02:50.090> like<00:02:50.239> a<00:02:50.269> right<00:02:50.540> angle<00:02:50.870> up<00:02:50.989> here<00:02:51.230> with

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
creating like a right angle up here with

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.339 
creating like a right angle up here with
the<00:02:51.650> fish<00:02:52.459> tail<00:02:53.090> if<00:02:53.299> you<00:02:53.419> want<00:02:53.599> to<00:02:53.779> doesn't

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
the fish tail if you want to doesn't

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.349 
the fish tail if you want to doesn't
have<00:02:54.379> to<00:02:54.680> be<00:02:54.769> perfect<00:02:55.129> but<00:02:55.309> get<00:02:55.909> that<00:02:55.939> first

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
have to be perfect but get that first

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.539 
have to be perfect but get that first
flat<00:02:56.719> folded<00:02:57.200> over<00:02:57.469> turn<00:02:57.950> everything<00:02:58.249> over

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
flat folded over turn everything over

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.580 
flat folded over turn everything over
we're<00:02:59.450> going<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.599> just<00:02:59.840> fold<00:03:00.079> this<00:03:00.260> guy<00:03:00.529> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
we're going to just fold this guy the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.409 
we're going to just fold this guy the
opposite<00:03:01.370> way<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.699> the<00:03:01.819> easiest<00:03:02.059> way<00:03:02.209> to<00:03:02.239> make

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:02.419 
opposite way and the easiest way to make

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.819 
opposite way and the easiest way to make
sure<00:03:02.480> you're<00:03:02.719> kind<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:02.989> doing<00:03:03.349> that<00:03:03.379> the<00:03:03.620> same

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
sure you're kind of doing that the same

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.830 
sure you're kind of doing that the same
is<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.609> sort<00:03:04.819> of<00:03:04.879> make<00:03:05.059> sure<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.599> get<00:03:05.779> a

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
is to sort of make sure that you get a

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.619 
is to sort of make sure that you get a
nice<00:03:06.109> center<00:03:06.859> point<00:03:07.400> here<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.939> that<00:03:08.419> these

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
nice center point here and that these

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.530 
nice center point here and that these
two<00:03:08.989> peaks<00:03:09.379> match<00:03:09.889> up<00:03:10.189> kind<00:03:10.639> of<00:03:10.819> and<00:03:11.120> then

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
two peaks match up kind of and then

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.449 
two peaks match up kind of and then
you'll<00:03:11.689> know<00:03:11.900> you've<00:03:12.469> kind<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.769> folded<00:03:13.159> it<00:03:13.249> out

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
you'll know you've kind of folded it out

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.019 
you'll know you've kind of folded it out
at<00:03:13.639> about<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.999> same<00:03:14.209> angle<00:03:15.699> and<00:03:16.699> that<00:03:16.760> just

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:17.029 
at about the same angle and that just

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.699 
at about the same angle and that just
gives<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.419> a<00:03:17.449> basic<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:17.959> little<00:03:18.169> fish<00:03:18.409> there

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
gives you a basic a little fish there

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.640 
gives you a basic a little fish there
and<00:03:19.129> then<00:03:19.579> if<00:03:19.969> you<00:03:20.329> take<00:03:20.900> what<00:03:21.199> you've<00:03:21.379> got

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
and then if you take what you've got

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.670 
and then if you take what you've got
here<00:03:22.159> and<00:03:22.569> full<00:03:23.569> you<00:03:23.930> can<00:03:24.049> kind<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.319> control

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
here and full you can kind of control

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.209 
here and full you can kind of control
the<00:03:27.760> top<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:28.969> bottom<00:03:29.629> part<00:03:29.839> here<00:03:30.079> just<00:03:30.349> moving
