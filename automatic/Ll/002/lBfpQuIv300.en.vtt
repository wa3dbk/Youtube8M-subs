anything like that that is pretty cool
to<00:02:28.490> know<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:29.630> don't<00:02:29.780> have<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:30.020> worry<00:02:30.230> at<00:02:30.380> least

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620

and four shots every target is going
down<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.610> muscle<00:02:34.790> velocity<00:02:35.450> which<00:02:35.810> means

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
down to the muscle velocity which means

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.350 
down to the muscle velocity which means
how<00:02:36.590> fast<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.190> bullets<00:02:37.459> are<00:02:37.550> traveling<00:02:38.030> when

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
how fast the bullets are traveling when

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.410 
how fast the bullets are traveling when
they<00:02:38.630> are<00:02:38.780> fired<00:02:39.050> from<00:02:39.170> your<00:02:39.500> barrel<00:02:40.269> so<00:02:41.269> the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
they are fired from your barrel so the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.140 
they are fired from your barrel so the
bullet<00:02:41.629> speed<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:42.280> 550<00:02:43.280> meters<00:02:43.549> per<00:02:43.790> second<00:02:44.060> is

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
bullet speed of 550 meters per second is

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.220 
bullet speed of 550 meters per second is

pretty much the average of
survival's<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:46.159> just<00:02:46.340> in<00:02:46.459> between

somewhere<00:02:47.150> there<00:02:47.360> if<00:02:47.510> you're<00:02:47.629> used<00:02:47.840> to

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
somewhere there if you're used to

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.030 
somewhere there if you're used to
assault<00:02:48.230> weapons<00:02:48.530> you're<00:02:48.650> used<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:48.890> this

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
assault weapons you're used to this

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.360 
assault weapons you're used to this
weapon<00:02:49.340> if<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.299> if<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.569> see<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:51.080> mvs<00:02:51.950> this

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
weapon if you if you see this mvs this

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.309 
weapon if you if you see this mvs this
means<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.790> is<00:02:52.819> a<00:02:52.940> muscle<00:02:53.299> velocity<00:02:53.810> if<00:02:53.989> it's

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
means it is a muscle velocity if it's

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.780 
means it is a muscle velocity if it's
silence<00:02:55.010> which<00:02:55.250> means<00:02:55.459> if<00:02:55.549> you<00:02:55.640> have<00:02:55.730> a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
silence which means if you have a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.910 
silence which means if you have a
silencer<00:02:56.239> this<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.540> 310<00:02:57.230> meters<00:02:57.500> per<00:02:57.620> second

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
silencer this is 310 meters per second

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.490 
silencer this is 310 meters per second
which<00:02:58.010> means<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.489> shoots<00:02:58.700> less<00:02:59.420> far

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
which means that it shoots less far

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.979 
which means that it shoots less far
so<00:03:00.860> just<00:03:01.430> cake<00:03:02.180> like<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:02.599> if<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.840> have<00:03:02.959> a

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
so just cake like that if you have a

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.900 
so just cake like that if you have a
silencer<00:03:03.349> on<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.590> as<00:03:03.709> well<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.489> damage<00:03:04.640> will

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
silencer on it as well the damage will

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.180 
silencer on it as well the damage will
not<00:03:04.940> drop<00:03:05.299> be<00:03:06.019> aware<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.890> damage

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
not drop be aware of that the damage

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.830 
not drop be aware of that the damage
will<00:03:07.370> not<00:03:07.519> drop<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.090> accuracy<00:03:08.420> will<00:03:08.660> not

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
will not drop and the accuracy will not

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.539 
will not drop and the accuracy will not
drop<00:03:09.049> if<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.349> have<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.500> silencer<00:03:09.830> just<00:03:10.220> the

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
drop if you have a silencer just the

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.400 
drop if you have a silencer just the
speed<00:03:10.849> of<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.120> bullet<00:03:11.269> so<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:11.959> don't<00:03:12.230> you

seconds<00:03:22.280> it<00:03:22.400> is<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:23.030> fast<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:23.900> actually

I<00:03:26.390> still<00:03:26.900> recommend<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:27.349> to<00:03:27.470> reload<00:03:27.769> just<00:03:28.489> as

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
I still recommend you to reload just as

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.900 
I still recommend you to reload just as
soon<00:03:29.090> as<00:03:29.239> possible<00:03:30.310> now<00:03:31.310> having<00:03:31.609> a<00:03:31.670> look<00:03:31.819> at

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
soon as possible now having a look at

soon as possible now having a look at
this<00:03:32.060> spreadsheet<00:03:32.359> you<00:03:32.720> can<00:03:32.930> clearly<00:03:33.470> see

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
this spreadsheet you can clearly see

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.530 
this spreadsheet you can clearly see
that<00:03:34.099> the<00:03:34.280> bullets<00:03:34.670> are<00:03:34.849> going<00:03:35.120> from<00:03:35.359> the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
that the bullets are going from the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.530 
that the bullets are going from the
middle<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.140> right<00:03:36.760> top<00:03:37.760> hand<00:03:37.970> corner<00:03:38.390> and

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
middle to the right top hand corner and

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.069 
middle to the right top hand corner and
it<00:03:39.530> is<00:03:39.680> kind<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.280> clear<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.209> always<00:03:41.780> if<00:03:41.989> you

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
it is kind of clear that always if you

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.500 
it is kind of clear that always if you
shoot<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:42.890> have<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.040> recoil<00:03:43.579> to<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.879> right<00:03:44.060> top

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
shoot you have a recoil to the right top

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.069 
shoot you have a recoil to the right top
so<00:03:45.319> there's<00:03:45.650> no<00:03:45.950> other<00:03:46.220> recalls<00:03:46.760> up<00:03:47.060> else<00:03:47.690> than

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
so there's no other recalls up else than

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.390 
so there's no other recalls up else than
this<00:03:48.290> what<00:03:48.650> does<00:03:48.739> that<00:03:48.799> mean

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
this what does that mean

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.640 
this what does that mean
if<00:03:49.730> you<00:03:49.910> shoot<00:03:50.180> rapid<00:03:50.599> fire<00:03:50.840> you<00:03:51.109> bullets<00:03:51.470> will

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
if you shoot rapid fire you bullets will

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.550 
if you shoot rapid fire you bullets will
go<00:03:52.010> eventually<00:03:52.669> to<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:52.970> right<00:03:53.150> top<00:03:53.389> hat<00:03:53.599> hand

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
go eventually to the right top hat hand

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.920 
go eventually to the right top hat hand
corner<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.130> if<00:03:55.819> you<00:03:55.940> shoot<00:03:56.150> even<00:03:56.269> faster<00:03:56.810> you

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
corner and if you shoot even faster you

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.569 
corner and if you shoot even faster you
have<00:03:57.049> no<00:03:57.200> control<00:03:57.560> whatsoever<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:58.190> your

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
have no control whatsoever and your

00:03:58.579 --> 00:03:59.949 
have no control whatsoever and your
bullets<00:03:58.880> just<00:03:59.060> go<00:03:59.180> everywhere<00:03:59.690> in<00:03:59.810> that

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
bullets just go everywhere in that

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.300 
bullets just go everywhere in that
direction<00:04:00.190> so<00:04:01.190> my<00:04:01.430> tip<00:04:01.849> is<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:03.230> tap<00:04:03.470> fire<00:04:03.769> every

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
direction so my tip is to tap fire every

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.420 
direction so my tip is to tap fire every
single<00:04:04.700> shot<00:04:04.940> so<00:04:05.329> your<00:04:05.769> scope<00:04:06.769> is<00:04:06.980> always

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
single shot so your scope is always

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.520 
single shot so your scope is always
coming<00:04:07.819> down<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.599> its<00:04:08.750> natural<00:04:09.019> position

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
coming down to its natural position

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.979 
coming down to its natural position
which<00:04:10.069> means<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.430> if<00:04:10.579> you<00:04:10.609> shoot<00:04:10.880> once<00:04:11.180> let

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
which means that if you shoot once let

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.559 
which means that if you shoot once let
it<00:04:12.109> just<00:04:12.319> move<00:04:12.560> back<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.790> way<00:04:13.970> it<00:04:14.150> is<00:04:14.299> on

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
it just move back to the way it is on

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.080 
it just move back to the way it is on
default<00:04:15.079> and<00:04:15.260> then<00:04:15.980> shoot<00:04:16.280> again<00:04:16.579> it's<00:04:16.760> just<00:04:16.880> a

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
default and then shoot again it's just a

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.479 
default and then shoot again it's just a
split<00:04:17.389> second<00:04:17.870> but<00:04:17.989> it's<00:04:18.139> very<00:04:18.500> fine-tuning

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
split second but it's very fine-tuning

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.900 
split second but it's very fine-tuning
if<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:19.760> do<00:04:19.970> just<00:04:20.150> that<00:04:20.620> your<00:04:21.620> screen<00:04:22.580> will<00:04:22.760> not

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
if you do just that your screen will not

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.400 
if you do just that your screen will not
go<00:04:23.120> everywhere<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:23.690> your<00:04:23.900> bullets<00:04:24.169> will<00:04:24.200> not

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
go everywhere and your bullets will not

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.170 
go everywhere and your bullets will not
just<00:04:24.650> spread<00:04:24.919> everywhere<00:04:25.280> you<00:04:25.610> will<00:04:25.760> hit

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
just spread everywhere you will hit

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.560 
just spread everywhere you will hit
wherever<00:04:26.780> you<00:04:26.960> want<00:04:27.200> to<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.770> is<00:04:27.830> it<00:04:28.520> is<00:04:29.030> very

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
wherever you want to it is it is very

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.900 
wherever you want to it is it is very
noticeable<00:04:29.780> if<00:04:30.260> you<00:04:30.349> do<00:04:30.500> that<00:04:30.680> that<00:04:30.950> your<00:04:31.669> aim

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
noticeable if you do that that your aim

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.210 
noticeable if you do that that your aim
increases<00:04:32.660> drastically<00:04:32.990> but<00:04:33.710> if<00:04:33.860> you<00:04:33.979> just

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
increases drastically but if you just

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.060 
increases drastically but if you just
shoot<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.240> little<00:04:35.599> bit<00:04:35.750> too<00:04:36.050> fast<00:04:36.410> and<00:04:36.680> it's<00:04:36.830> all

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
shoot a little bit too fast and it's all

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.800 
shoot a little bit too fast and it's all
about<00:04:37.310> timing<00:04:37.700> your<00:04:38.150> bullets<00:04:38.570> are<00:04:38.750> just

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
about timing your bullets are just

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.430 
about timing your bullets are just
everywhere<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:39.889> you<00:04:39.979> cannot<00:04:40.220> hit<00:04:40.400> anything

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
everywhere and you cannot hit anything

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.700 
everywhere and you cannot hit anything
now<00:04:42.440> moving<00:04:42.650> on<00:04:42.860> to<00:04:42.889> my<00:04:43.010> loadout<00:04:43.430> I<00:04:43.760> use<00:04:44.300> the

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
now moving on to my loadout I use the

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.839 
now moving on to my loadout I use the
holographic<00:04:45.710> sight<00:04:45.949> times<00:04:46.190> one<00:04:46.520> plus<00:04:46.729> a

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
holographic sight times one plus a

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.150 
holographic sight times one plus a
magnifier<00:04:47.419> times<00:04:47.720> two<00:04:48.020> I<00:04:48.260> used<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:48.949> have<00:04:49.130> a

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
magnifier times two I used to have a

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.909 
magnifier times two I used to have a
barrel<00:04:49.550> and<00:04:49.699> I<00:04:50.210> use<00:04:50.539> the<00:04:50.870> foregrip<00:04:51.380> for<00:04:51.590> extra

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
barrel and I use the foregrip for extra

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.029 
barrel and I use the foregrip for extra
stability<00:04:52.130> now<00:04:53.090> what<00:04:53.390> these<00:04:53.659> things<00:04:54.110> do<00:04:54.440> is<00:04:54.680> it

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
stability now what these things do is it

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.830 
stability now what these things do is it
is<00:04:55.310> so<00:04:55.580> simple<00:04:55.849> and<00:04:56.120> it's<00:04:56.240> so<00:04:56.419> good<00:04:56.630> at<00:04:56.750> the

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
is so simple and it's so good at the

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.670 
is so simple and it's so good at the
same<00:04:57.020> time

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
same time

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.960 
same time
first<00:04:58.680> up<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:58.950> used<00:04:59.220> two<00:04:59.370> times<00:04:59.640> one

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
first up I used two times one

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.640 
first up I used two times one
holographic<00:05:00.600> side<00:05:00.780> plus<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.050> times<00:05:01.410> to

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
holographic side plus the times to

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.560 
holographic side plus the times to
magnify<00:05:02.010> because<00:05:02.460> I<00:05:02.550> can<00:05:02.700> adopt<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.300> arrange

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
magnify because I can adopt to arrange

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.350 
magnify because I can adopt to arrange
situations<00:05:04.350> I<00:05:04.530> can<00:05:04.920> adopt<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.360> close-range

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
situations I can adopt to close-range

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.970 
situations I can adopt to close-range
situations<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.230> at<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.410> shotgun<00:05:07.710> by<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.860> way

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
situations and at the shotgun by the way

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.550 
situations and at the shotgun by the way
which<00:05:08.160> is<00:05:08.190> even<00:05:09.150> closer<00:05:09.390> on<00:05:09.600> range<00:05:09.840> you<00:05:10.410> can

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
which is even closer on range you can

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.830 
which is even closer on range you can
see<00:05:10.770> me<00:05:10.890> always<00:05:11.100> changing<00:05:11.730> between<00:05:12.030> x<00:05:12.270> 1<00:05:12.360> x<00:05:12.660> 2

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
see me always changing between x 1 x 2

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.870 
see me always changing between x 1 x 2
magnification<00:05:13.830> so<00:05:14.010> i<00:05:14.040> can<00:05:14.370> actually<00:05:14.610> adopt

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
magnification so i can actually adopt

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.540 
magnification so i can actually adopt
any<00:05:15.180> situation<00:05:15.780> i<00:05:15.870> want<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:16.230> it<00:05:16.650> is<00:05:16.740> so<00:05:16.890> awesome

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
any situation i want to it is so awesome

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.870 
any situation i want to it is so awesome
to<00:05:17.790> be<00:05:17.820> into<00:05:18.750> everything<00:05:19.680> if<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:20.280> have<00:05:20.310> just

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
to be into everything if you have just

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.030 
to be into everything if you have just
the<00:05:21.120> time<00:05:21.510> 6<00:05:21.870> scope<00:05:22.230> which<00:05:22.470> i<00:05:22.620> really<00:05:22.770> dislike

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
the time 6 scope which i really dislike

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.390 
the time 6 scope which i really dislike
then<00:05:23.910> you<00:05:24.090> are<00:05:24.210> willie<00:05:24.510> and<00:05:24.780> just<00:05:25.130> you<00:05:26.130> just

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
then you are willie and just you just

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.240 
then you are willie and just you just
restraint<00:05:26.970> you<00:05:27.150> want<00:05:27.360> certain<00:05:27.660> situation<00:05:28.250> now

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
restraint you want certain situation now

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.190 
restraint you want certain situation now
the<00:05:29.310> heavy<00:05:29.610> barrel<00:05:29.850> increases<00:05:30.540> the<00:05:30.750> recall

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
the heavy barrel increases the recall

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.320 
the heavy barrel increases the recall
but<00:05:31.560> also<00:05:32.070> increases<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.640> damage<00:05:33.000> on

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
but also increases the damage on

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.940 
but also increases the damage on
distance<00:05:33.780> which<00:05:33.960> means<00:05:34.170> that<00:05:34.290> the<00:05:34.380> dark<00:05:34.680> drop

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
distance which means that the dark drop

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.250 
distance which means that the dark drop
of<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.730> damage<00:05:36.090> loss<00:05:36.330> or<00:05:36.570> in<00:05:36.720> distance<00:05:37.140> is

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
of the damage loss or in distance is

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.220 
of the damage loss or in distance is
less<00:05:37.470> so<00:05:37.740> you<00:05:37.770> kill<00:05:38.160> actually<00:05:38.520> in<00:05:38.610> less<00:05:38.790> shots

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
less so you kill actually in less shots

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.090 
less so you kill actually in less shots
now<00:05:40.230> to<00:05:40.290> counter<00:05:41.100> the<00:05:41.250> increase<00:05:41.850> of<00:05:42.890> recoil<00:05:43.890> I

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
now to counter the increase of recoil I

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.920 
now to counter the increase of recoil I
have<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.430> foregrip<00:05:44.790> which<00:05:45.000> reduce<00:05:45.660> which

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
have the foregrip which reduce which

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.650 
have the foregrip which reduce which
increases<00:05:46.860> the<00:05:46.980> stability<00:05:47.190> as<00:05:47.670> well<00:05:47.910> so<00:05:48.420> it

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
increases the stability as well so it

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.930 
increases the stability as well so it
just<00:05:48.900> evens<00:05:49.200> out<00:05:49.290> and<00:05:49.650> I<00:05:49.710> just<00:05:49.770> better<00:05:50.190> damage

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
just evens out and I just better damage

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.330 
just evens out and I just better damage
on<00:05:51.210> ranges<00:05:51.630> so<00:05:52.410> that<00:05:52.680> should<00:05:52.860> wrap<00:05:53.010> up<00:05:53.190> the

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.740 
on ranges so that should wrap up the
video<00:05:53.460> I<00:05:53.610> hope<00:05:53.820> I<00:05:53.940> could<00:05:54.060> help<00:05:54.120> you<00:05:54.390> understand

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750
