say<00:02:05.700> hey<00:02:05.910> I've<00:02:06.060> put<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> lot<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.570> stuff<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.930> your

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
say hey I've put a lot of stuff in your

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.510 
say hey I've put a lot of stuff in your
room<00:02:07.130> thrown<00:02:08.130> away<00:02:08.250> whatever<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.820> want<00:02:09.090> but

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
room thrown away whatever you want but

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.460 
room thrown away whatever you want but
chances<00:02:11.520> are<00:02:11.670> she<00:02:12.000> doesn't<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.600> as<00:02:12.930> she

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
chances are she doesn't have as she

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.470 
chances are she doesn't have as she
hasn't<00:02:13.620> accumulated<00:02:14.220> 20<00:02:14.700> years<00:02:14.970> worth<00:02:15.360> of

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
hasn't accumulated 20 years worth of

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.140 
hasn't accumulated 20 years worth of
teaching<00:02:15.810> materials<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.920> she<00:02:16.980> doesn't<00:02:17.550> have<00:02:17.850> a

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
teaching materials so she doesn't have a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.510 
teaching materials so she doesn't have a
whole<00:02:18.390> lot<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.690> start<00:02:18.990> with<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.830> there<00:02:20.370> was<00:02:20.460> a

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
whole lot to start with so there was a

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.950 
whole lot to start with so there was a
better<00:02:20.700> chance<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.060> she<00:02:21.390> will<00:02:21.510> find<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.930> use

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
better chance that she will find a use

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.380 
better chance that she will find a use
for<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.470> than<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.400> will<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:26.490> also<00:02:26.850> the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
for this than I will so and also the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.800 
for this than I will so and also the
desk<00:02:27.630> are<00:02:29.930> pretty<00:02:30.930> dusty<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.560> dirty<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.810> I'm

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.390 
desk are pretty dusty and dirty and I'm
going<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.140> be<00:02:34.230> resourceful<00:02:34.530> on<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.130> end

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
going to be resourceful on that end

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.570 
going to be resourceful on that end
because<00:02:36.170> I'm<00:02:37.170> looping<00:02:37.590> up<00:02:37.740> with<00:02:37.920> my<00:02:38.040> children

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
because I'm looping up with my children

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.730
