00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.639 
not going to put at all or a bottom on
it<00:01:41.970> probably<00:01:42.630> going<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> put<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.170> tank<00:01:43.409> right

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
it probably going to put the tank right

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.100 
it probably going to put the tank right
on<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> top<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> wood<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.720> obviously

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
on the top of the wood so obviously

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.899 
on the top of the wood so obviously
these<00:01:46.350> are<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.530> four<00:01:46.799> legs<00:01:47.040> when<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:47.640> put<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
these are the four legs when we put the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.030 
these are the four legs when we put the
legs<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.270> inside<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.990> they're<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
legs on the inside and they're going to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.480 
legs on the inside and they're going to
be<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.220> long<00:01:50.490> ways<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.119> way

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
be going long ways that way

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.240 
be going long ways that way
so<00:01:53.490> I'm<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.060> go<00:01:54.180> ahead<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.479> drill<00:01:54.750> this

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
so I'm going to go ahead and drill this

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.679 
so I'm going to go ahead and drill this
I'm<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.520> would<00:01:56.850> recommend<00:01:57.329> pre

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
I'm going to I would recommend pre

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.920 
I'm going to I would recommend pre
drilling<00:01:57.990> all<00:01:58.229> your<00:01:58.409> holes<00:01:59.000> I've<00:02:00.000> made<00:02:00.240> stands

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
drilling all your holes I've made stands

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.070 
drilling all your holes I've made stands
without<00:02:01.770> pre-drilling<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.360> cracks<00:02:03.720> wood

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
without pre-drilling and it cracks wood

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.749 
without pre-drilling and it cracks wood
especially<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:04.920> you're<00:02:05.070> using<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.369> cheaper

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
especially if you're using a cheaper

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.540 
especially if you're using a cheaper
lumber<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:07.079> highly<00:02:07.799> recommend<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.280> for<00:02:08.399> making

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
lumber I highly recommend it for making

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.919 
lumber I highly recommend it for making
a<00:02:08.640> stand<00:02:08.849> just<00:02:08.940> pre-drill<00:02:09.479> your<00:02:09.509> holes<00:02:09.660> it

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
a stand just pre-drill your holes it

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.290 
a stand just pre-drill your holes it
takes<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.170> little<00:02:11.099> bit<00:02:11.190> longer<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:11.790> it's

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
takes a little bit longer but it's

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.000 
takes a little bit longer but it's
definitely<00:02:12.750> worth<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.319> long<00:02:13.530> way<00:02:13.709> so<00:02:13.950> I'm

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
definitely worth it in a long way so I'm

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.000 
definitely worth it in a long way so I'm
going<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.190> go<00:02:14.250> ahead<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:15.260> screw<00:02:16.260> these<00:02:16.440> this

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
going to go ahead and screw these this

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.330 
going to go ahead and screw these this
and<00:02:17.310> I'll<00:02:18.090> go<00:02:18.330> ahead<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.870> put<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.709> legs<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.099> as

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
and I'll go ahead and put the legs on as

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.000 
and I'll go ahead and put the legs on as
well<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.700> I'll<00:02:20.819> be<00:02:20.910> right<00:02:21.030> back

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010
