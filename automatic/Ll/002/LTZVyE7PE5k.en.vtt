to those points

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.630 
to those points
I<00:00:36.360> really<00:00:37.050> feel<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.860> know<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.219> essence

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
I really feel like we know the essence

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.850 
I really feel like we know the essence
of<00:00:38.820> who<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.030> annoy<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.629> that's<00:00:40.200> when<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.590> start

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
of who you annoy is that's when we start

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.530 
of who you annoy is that's when we start
to<00:00:41.010> design<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.610> actually<00:00:41.969> put<00:00:42.149> pencil<00:00:42.510> to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
to design we actually put pencil to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.660 
to design we actually put pencil to
paper<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:43.200> think<00:00:43.350> they<00:00:43.890> were<00:00:43.950> looking<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.430> for

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
paper I think they were looking a for

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.990 
paper I think they were looking a for
consistency<00:00:45.559> there<00:00:46.559> were<00:00:46.680> many<00:00:47.340> many<00:00:47.550> oranges

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
consistency there were many many oranges

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.920 
consistency there were many many oranges
and<00:00:49.640> many<00:00:50.640> many<00:00:50.820> marks<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.390> think<00:00:51.600> there<00:00:51.780> was

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
and many many marks I think there was

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.740 
and many many marks I think there was
just<00:00:51.960> over<00:00:52.530> time<00:00:52.770> there<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.640> many<00:00:54.420> marks

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
just over time there in many marks

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.420 
just over time there in many marks
utilized<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.500> whether<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.010> men's<00:00:56.190> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
utilized and whether it's the men's and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.690 
utilized and whether it's the men's and
women's

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
women's

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.110 
women's
war<00:00:59.010> but<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.160> really<00:01:00.310> varied<00:01:00.670> sport<00:01:01.000> to

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
war but that really varied sport to

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.360 
war but that really varied sport to
sport<00:01:01.150> so<00:01:01.750> I<00:01:01.960> think<00:01:02.320> they<00:01:02.560> were<00:01:02.620> after<00:01:02.860> looking

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
sport so I think they were after looking

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.130 
sport so I think they were after looking
like<00:01:03.550> one<00:01:03.760> school<00:01:04.090> they<00:01:04.449> like<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.809> feel<00:01:04.989> like

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
like one school they like to feel like

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.470 
like one school they like to feel like
they're<00:01:05.290> up<00:01:05.440> one<00:01:05.710> school<00:01:06.070> and<00:01:06.340> have<00:01:06.790> you<00:01:07.330> know

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
they're up one school and have you know

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.700 
they're up one school and have you know
one<00:01:08.380> color<00:01:08.890> palette<00:01:09.340> I<00:01:09.490> think<00:01:10.410> it's<00:01:11.410> hard<00:01:11.650> to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
one color palette I think it's hard to

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.120 
one color palette I think it's hard to
look<00:01:11.890> like<00:01:12.040> a<00:01:12.070> disparate<00:01:12.550> organization<00:01:14.130> from

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
look like a disparate organization from

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.290 
look like a disparate organization from
their<00:01:15.280> perspective<00:01:15.729> they<00:01:15.760> want<00:01:16.120> to<00:01:16.180> be

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
their perspective they want to be

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.170 
their perspective they want to be
Illinois<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:16.990> then<00:01:17.650> that's<00:01:17.920> orange<00:01:18.640> a<00:01:18.670> navy<00:01:18.880> I

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
Illinois and then that's orange a navy I

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.600 
Illinois and then that's orange a navy I
think<00:01:19.870> one<00:01:19.990> of<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.170> main<00:01:20.350> things<00:01:21.190> were<00:01:21.310> very

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
think one of the main things were very

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.150 
think one of the main things were very
proud<00:01:21.940> of<00:01:22.000> in<00:01:22.930> this<00:01:23.140> project<00:01:23.380> when<00:01:23.860> you<00:01:23.950> look

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
proud of in this project when you look

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.190 
proud of in this project when you look
at<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.580> all<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:25.240> student<00:01:25.660> athletes<00:01:25.990> together
