00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
i shadow duo is Kuala Lumpur and this is

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.540 
i shadow duo is Kuala Lumpur and this is
just<00:04:20.660> a<00:04:20.900> shimmery<00:04:21.320> pink<00:04:21.620> color<00:04:21.920> on<00:04:22.130> this<00:04:22.340> side

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
just a shimmery pink color on this side

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.810 
just a shimmery pink color on this side
and<00:04:22.760> then<00:04:23.090> a<00:04:23.300> very<00:04:23.720> sparkly<00:04:24.410> purple<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.130> the

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
and then a very sparkly purple and the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.060 
and then a very sparkly purple and the
sparkle<00:04:26.360> doesn't<00:04:26.870> really<00:04:27.050> show<00:04:27.350> up<00:04:27.560> on<00:04:27.740> camera

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
sparkle doesn't really show up on camera

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.030 
sparkle doesn't really show up on camera
too<00:04:28.370> well<00:04:28.580> but<00:04:28.790> it<00:04:28.880> is<00:04:29.090> quite<00:04:29.600> sparkly<00:04:30.350> so<00:04:31.010> I

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
too well but it is quite sparkly so I

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.070 
too well but it is quite sparkly so I
have<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.580> two<00:04:31.610> colours<00:04:32.090> swatched<00:04:32.480> here<00:04:32.840> on<00:04:32.960> my

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
have the two colours swatched here on my

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.590 
have the two colours swatched here on my
hand<00:04:33.380> there<00:04:33.890> is<00:04:33.920> the<00:04:34.340> light<00:04:34.610> pink<00:04:35.000> shimmery

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
hand there is the light pink shimmery

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.460 
hand there is the light pink shimmery
color<00:04:35.960> and<00:04:36.320> then<00:04:36.800> there<00:04:37.100> is<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:38.440> purple<00:04:39.440> color

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
color and then there is the purple color

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.200 
color and then there is the purple color
even<00:04:39.980> though<00:04:40.010> it's<00:04:40.250> kind<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:40.610> showing<00:04:40.880> up<00:04:41.090> a

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
even though it's kind of showing up a

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.470 
even though it's kind of showing up a
bit<00:04:41.420> brown<00:04:41.870> but<00:04:42.620> I<00:04:42.650> guess<00:04:42.950> it<00:04:43.130> does<00:04:43.400> kind<00:04:44.330> of

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
bit brown but I guess it does kind of

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.710 
bit brown but I guess it does kind of
have<00:04:44.710> some<00:04:45.710> brownish<00:04:46.370> undertones<00:04:47.030> to<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.540> it's

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
have some brownish undertones to it it's

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.290 
have some brownish undertones to it it's
not<00:04:47.930> a<00:04:48.200> bright<00:04:48.800> purple<00:04:49.160> by<00:04:49.490> any<00:04:49.760> means

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
not a bright purple by any means

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.040 
not a bright purple by any means
next<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.960> have<00:04:51.160> Sugarland<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.580> this<00:04:53.300> one<00:04:53.510> has<00:04:53.780> a

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
next I have Sugarland and this one has a

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.010 
next I have Sugarland and this one has a
shimmery<00:04:54.470> gold<00:04:54.830> color<00:04:55.130> and<00:04:55.490> then<00:04:55.790> a<00:04:56.060> shimmery

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
shimmery gold color and then a shimmery

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.170 
shimmery gold color and then a shimmery
lavender<00:04:58.010> color<00:04:58.220> it's<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.490> very<00:04:58.670> light

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
lavender color it's a very light

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.900 
lavender color it's a very light
lavender<00:05:00.140> so<00:05:00.560> here<00:05:01.100> are<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.520> two<00:05:01.700> colors

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
lavender so here are the two colors

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:02.650 
lavender so here are the two colors
swatched

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
swatched

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.540 
swatched
and<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:02.930> gold<00:05:03.170> color<00:05:03.470> really<00:05:03.860> isn't<00:05:04.340> going<00:05:04.460> to

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
and the gold color really isn't going to

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.790 
and the gold color really isn't going to
show<00:05:04.580> up<00:05:04.910> just<00:05:05.090> because<00:05:05.570> it<00:05:05.870> is<00:05:06.020> very<00:05:06.350> flesh

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
show up just because it is very flesh

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.250 
show up just because it is very flesh
toned<00:05:07.190> so<00:05:07.610> when<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:08.420> put<00:05:08.600> it<00:05:08.690> on<00:05:08.750> your<00:05:08.960> skin<00:05:09.200> it

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
toned so when you put it on your skin it

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.710 
toned so when you put it on your skin it
just<00:05:09.410> kind<00:05:09.740> of<00:05:09.800> looks<00:05:10.010> like<00:05:10.130> shimmer<00:05:10.640> so<00:05:11.480> that

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
just kind of looks like shimmer so that

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.180 
just kind of looks like shimmer so that
isn't<00:05:12.050> really<00:05:12.410> going<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.590> show<00:05:12.770> up<00:05:12.950> too<00:05:13.160> well

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
isn't really going to show up too well

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.420 
isn't really going to show up too well
but<00:05:13.640> the<00:05:14.150> purple<00:05:14.570> color<00:05:14.780> is<00:05:15.110> very<00:05:15.410> frosty<00:05:15.890> when

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
but the purple color is very frosty when

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.340 
but the purple color is very frosty when
you<00:05:16.520> put<00:05:16.700> it<00:05:16.790> on<00:05:16.880> and<00:05:17.210> it<00:05:17.630> has<00:05:17.810> some<00:05:18.110> gold

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
you put it on and it has some gold

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.820 
you put it on and it has some gold
reflux<00:05:18.920> in<00:05:19.190> it<00:05:19.370> so<00:05:19.640> now<00:05:19.910> I<00:05:20.360> have<00:05:20.810> Silk<00:05:21.500> Road

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
which has a shimmery light peachy pink

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.840

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850

and this eye shadow has chunks of

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.760 
and this eye shadow has chunks of
glitter<00:05:32.240> in<00:05:32.510> it<00:05:32.600> and<00:05:32.750> I<00:05:32.870> normally<00:05:33.380> would<00:05:33.590> not

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
glitter in it and I normally would not

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.400 
glitter in it and I normally would not
go<00:05:34.040> for<00:05:34.280> something<00:05:34.460> with<00:05:34.790> chunky<00:05:35.510> glitter<00:05:35.750> but

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
go for something with chunky glitter but

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.080 
go for something with chunky glitter but
I<00:05:36.440> just<00:05:36.740> really<00:05:37.040> like<00:05:37.220> these<00:05:37.370> colors<00:05:37.700> so

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
I just really like these colors so

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.000 
I just really like these colors so
that's<00:05:38.330> why<00:05:38.570> I<00:05:38.630> picked<00:05:38.930> this<00:05:39.080> up<00:05:39.320> and<00:05:39.590> they're

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
that's why I picked this up and they're

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.550 
that's why I picked this up and they're
just<00:05:40.040> great<00:05:40.550> natural<00:05:41.270> colors<00:05:41.630> and<00:05:41.780> the<00:05:42.200> chunky

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
just great natural colors and the chunky

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.860 
just great natural colors and the chunky
glitter<00:05:42.830> really<00:05:43.550> doesn't<00:05:44.210> look<00:05:44.420> like<00:05:44.660> you

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
glitter really doesn't look like you

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.810 
glitter really doesn't look like you
just<00:05:44.900> put<00:05:45.350> glitter<00:05:45.680> all<00:05:45.830> over<00:05:46.070> your<00:05:46.430> face<00:05:46.610> it

just put glitter all over your face it

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.970 
just put glitter all over your face it
just<00:05:47.000> leaves<00:05:47.210> like<00:05:47.660> a<00:05:47.690> nice<00:05:47.990> sparkle<00:05:48.680> across

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
just leaves like a nice sparkle across

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.670 
just leaves like a nice sparkle across
your<00:05:49.190> eyes<00:05:49.340> so<00:05:50.060> that<00:05:50.450> is<00:05:50.660> what<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:51.200> light

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
your eyes so that is what the light

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.490 
your eyes so that is what the light
peachy<00:05:52.220> pink<00:05:52.490> color<00:05:52.580> looks<00:05:53.060> like<00:05:53.240> because<00:05:53.500> I'm

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
peachy pink color looks like because I'm

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.220 
peachy pink color looks like because I'm
