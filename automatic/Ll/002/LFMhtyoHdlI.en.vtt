this pellet ruined us some cool things
here's<00:00:12.119> the<00:00:12.270> clean<00:00:12.539> sound<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.049> amp

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.480 

you'll<00:00:16.470> hear<00:00:16.740> we're<00:00:16.859> gonna<00:00:16.980> kick<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.250> pedal

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
you'll hear we're gonna kick the pedal

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.640 
you'll hear we're gonna kick the pedal
in<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:17.910> how<00:00:18.060> much<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.449> really<00:00:18.810> adds<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.320> lot<00:00:19.350> of

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
in just how much it really adds a lot of

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:55.000 
in just how much it really adds a lot of
gain

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.940 

it's<00:00:56.010> got<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.340> little<00:00:57.020> crunch<00:00:58.020> switch<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.800> it

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
it's got this little crunch switch on it

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:11.359 
it's got this little crunch switch on it
and<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.760> really<00:01:00.149> seems<00:01:00.450> to<00:01:09.950> we<00:01:10.950> engage<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
and this really seems to we engage the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.920 
and this really seems to we engage the
crunch<00:01:11.670> you'll<00:01:11.880> hear<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.330> lot<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.720> highs<00:01:12.900> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
crunch you'll hear a lot of highs and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:34.149 
crunch you'll hear a lot of highs and
lows<00:01:13.229> really<00:01:13.710> added

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:50.499 

the<00:01:35.159> tone<00:01:35.490> knob<00:01:35.850> has<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.539> really<00:01:37.020> amazing<00:01:37.500> sweep

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.849 

some<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.600> those<00:01:51.659> sounds<00:01:51.990> are<00:01:52.049> too<00:01:52.229> dark<00:01:52.469> too

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
some of those sounds are too dark too

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.289 
some of those sounds are too dark too
brittle<00:01:53.070> depending<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:53.880> amplifier<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
brittle depending on the amplifier you

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.840 
brittle depending on the amplifier you
had<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:54.990> becomes<00:01:55.320> really<00:01:55.649> useful<00:01:56.219> when

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
had and that becomes really useful when

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.490 
had and that becomes really useful when
you<00:01:56.969> have<00:01:57.000> something<00:01:57.509> that's<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:58.110> first

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you have something that's that first

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.499 
you have something that's that first
full<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.280> we've<00:01:59.399> got<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.700> set<00:01:59.939> about<00:02:00.149> ten

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
full so we've got it set about ten

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.110 
full so we've got it set about ten
o'clock<00:02:00.539> here
