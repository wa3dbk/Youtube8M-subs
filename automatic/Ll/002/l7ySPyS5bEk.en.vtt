00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
formula definitely has to be good but

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.730 
formula definitely has to be good but
it's<00:01:15.180> really<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.570> brush<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.170> found<00:01:16.530> if

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
it's really the brush that I found if

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.640

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.640 
the brush works I'm good but if it
doesn't<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.909> disaster<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:22.200> one<00:01:22.409> has

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
doesn't it's a disaster so this one has

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.969 
doesn't it's a disaster so this one has
a<00:01:22.920> very<00:01:23.220> nice<00:01:23.430> brush<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.270> plastic<00:01:25.140> though<00:01:25.409> so

a very nice brush it's plastic though so

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.520 
a very nice brush it's plastic though so
it<00:01:26.159> means<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.729> very<00:01:27.060> resilient<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
it means it's very resilient it's not a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.230 
it means it's very resilient it's not a
brush<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.100> know<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.610> regular<00:01:30.000> brush
