00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello here is Peter and that's mine 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.150
 astron songbook t100 after watching it 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.519
 already unpacked in the first 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.160
 get an impression and also a few 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.769
 I wanted to try out games 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.929
 again the integrated office 2013 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.240
 show that comes on here telling you 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.160
 gets the full version of the latest 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.720
 office 2013 version 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.570
 you just have to stop with the code 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.580
 activate the enclosed is in the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.550
 packaging and then you stop in the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.380
 change 2013 probably 2013 powerpoint 2010 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.530
 onenote 2007 as in the full version 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.690
 usually costs 120 euros I think 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.290
 in the home and student version and the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.180
 You can then stop here 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.460
 Of course, installing is practical 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.210
 because you already have this blog here 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.100
 and that offers to work with 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.930
 this with this keyboard and the mouse 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.600
 is not really intoxicating now 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.219
 because I also stop the special gestures 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.140
 at the side if you are so rheins 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.460
 will see that maybe then 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.680
 the special guests also directly 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.110
 supported and the problem is that that 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.240
 not always works and especially 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.490
 The mouse buttons below the downtown 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.840
 integrated are not always responsive 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.479
 and then that's a bit 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.680
 strange it should be a patch 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.060
 knows where the mouse's reaction stops 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.759
 So a little bit improved 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.650
 windows patch especially at play but 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.220
 this is especially in combination 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.710
 with the size not optimally solved find 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.450
 At least I could have felt hardware 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.290
 the stop here are the mouse buttons 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.060
 others probably would 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.400
 been a little bit better or this multi 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.710
 touch gestures you stop here with the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.049
 did not work with the function 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.259
 necessarily have to be open yes 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.409
 can be that the maximum in so 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.390
 an angle so it is pleasant to 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.060
 Of course you can work as you like 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.399
 you want to create 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.340
 then imagine it would be me 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.649
 maybe a little better 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.960
 But then it would be the danger 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.450
 that the device gives way back so 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.259
 the focus is already here maximum 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.700
 put on the border where the tablet 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.640
 can not handle it yourself 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.650
 that is here and then it would have 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.959
 already too much what I noticed 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.209
 That equipment is relatively easy 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.340
 move that is not in that 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.569
 here at the feet are so 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.870
 gummed by the keyboard but the 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:30.140
 back the stand here where the 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.690
 wiwo the tablet then logged in 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.890
 state on the table are just 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.930
 not noticed it does not help me if 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.410
 her feet are good when I do that 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.410
 on the spot 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.630
 then that's just a bit 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.849
 set up and the feet are not 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.459
 good and that naturally leads to that 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.500
 that's not really stable here 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.299
 So you can do it relatively easily 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.130
 leite move here on my table 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.989
 maybe I gumminoppen two 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.079
 just wanted there at this point 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.109
 I stand the two posts out yes 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.590
 come work to the office that's right 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.630
 Great 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.609
 So let's take as an example there 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.280
 Everyone knows starts super fast 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.170
 of course on the internal ssd 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.060
 you install the race so far here 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.319
 and that's just the usual stuff 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.720
 The ones you make here are a few 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.430
 slides full scene and edges document 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.010
 open it now if the mouse or the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.690
 keyboard used security 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.269
 decide because there are still those here 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.220
 additional function that you just the 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.079
 mouse or keyboard uses and the 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.389
 Symbols then stop for a man 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.590
 for example the mouse becomes a symbol 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.090
 much smaller 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.850
 because you can stop here much better 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.290
 Act with the moz take stop here 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.600
 the touch-control then becomes the 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.660
 symbols are bigger and you can 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.250
 then simply operate it with your finger 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.900
 that's practically here, of course 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.830
 that is hidden here so you have 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.630
 more of the display and if you are here then 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.790
 certain elements then need to be 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.690
 they hold the general functions 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.210
 which one knows so well of von 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.000
 Judging what is just to do with it so 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.910
 very practical, of course, where 2013 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.520
 there you can take a pdf document 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.170
 make or 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.700
 inputs and so on and of course to 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.440
 Example also draw something 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.810
 surprisingly, really good 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.850
 I think the display works that way 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.960
 display responds really quickly so you 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.220
 has no delay 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.310
 Take yourself for example now like that 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.220
 then a capacitive pen to do that 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.130
 you can do it relatively well with it 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.900
 of course work then completely 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.000
 normal with the one with the input over with 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.740
 not finger the mouse with weather 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.570
 taken and there you can haid the things 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.060
 import export notes 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.800
 to mark 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.700
 that's pretty handy powerpoint 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.140
 Everyone knows of course and everyone had to 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.740
 I will continue to mention that 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:01.000
 works well with the size of 10 1 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:04.030
 inch on with the resolution of 1366 x 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.370
 768 pixeln on 10,1 zeug one must oneself 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.860
 That may be a bit like arranging now 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.660
 be small for some if you are special 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.419
 Here is the keyboard takes the is 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.610
 not so big longer texts as already 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.020
 previously mentioned the other videos 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.520
 I would not write that now 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.770
 to surf the internet, it is a 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.270
 optimal because the problem at 108 point 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.950
 one is still that the keyboard 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.960
 not always come out by itself so 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.550
 you have to somehow now the browser 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.110
 or so then sometimes you have to 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.360
 keyboard is still out manually and that is 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.010
 Of course not the case 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.580
 same as the search I'm looking for in here 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.840
 windows 8 points take time 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.330
 Barak was never 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.940
 So you are trained relatively well then 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.800
 you get along well with the keyboard 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.690
 and can work here quite normally 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.760
 the advantage is of course that you have 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.790
 here the windows button always to the side 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.669
 has and you can old the brightness 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.260
 reduce it quickly by doing the same 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.270
 as with the fn buttons 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.340
 on a notebook depending on that 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.590
 individually set up the same applies 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.450
 of course for the volume or if 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.620
 you want to turn off the touchpad then 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.170
 that does not work very well 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.820
 Practical is in the case what I always 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.050
 I have activated because I prefer the 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.910
 use touchscreen 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:17.140
 I prefer the handle to the touchscreen 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:19.060
 as to that very very bad one 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.880
 very very bad patent implementation in 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.220
 In the case , that was basically so far 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.100
 for me to work on the go very much 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.750
 In practice, maybe one would 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.820
 wish bigger keyboard or 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.540
 maybe a 11.6 inch model of the 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.580
 transformer t 140 will give something like that 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.250
 with the trail processor performance is 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.110
 absolutely perfect for office tasks 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.990
 easy game and so on is the 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.040
 performance absolutely sufficient so 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.990
 really great for working 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.340
 a nice device especially for 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.140
 on the way the display brightness could 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.190
 be a little bit higher but it does 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.570
 is enough if you go now 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.250
 then sitting in the blazing sun 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.990
 you see on other devices than that 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.020
 is already solved really well so for 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.840
 370 euro with keyboard dock with office 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.880
 2013 and in this form factor with eight 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.620
 hours of running is that right 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.820
 Well, I think you can 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.860
 I also stop one, for example 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.710
 USB mouse then like that or off 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.930
 stop working on the go as well so that 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.180
 is already a really good is so 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.920
 far the further impression more videos 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:22.210
 will follow if I have something else 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:25.120
 Otherwise, ask questions under the video 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.280
 and then like licon and follow for 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.670
 continue - thanks for watching until the 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.670
 next time
