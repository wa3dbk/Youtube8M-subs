00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.650
 Y 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.400
 the great teacher damiÃ¡n lemos for classes 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.010
 of chess dot net and in this video 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.939
 we are going to comment on a game that was played 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.690
 recently between the current champion of 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.420
 world magnus carlsen against bill gates 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.550
 let's see a game that lasts less 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.870
 of 10 plays and probably there 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.420
 lasted less than a minute 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.850
 and well if you come to do it is fast and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.699
 some mistakes 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.290
 it's interesting and bill gates was going with 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:55.980
 white and play 4 and magnus play 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.920
 the game defense witch with horses 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.739
 6 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.610
 this defense is interesting especially 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.870
 to play fast games 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.390
 because Black gets a very bad attack 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.000
 very early and here white 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.060
 defend with bishop of 3 that is a 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.040
 play a little unnatural not for 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.380
 example here marinus could have 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.390
 tried horse 4 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.399
 to try and get the pair of 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.740
 bishops of tickets if white 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:30.009
 they play in the movie 5 we have 6 with 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.530
 blacks threatening the bishop and also 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.810
 threatening the pawn of 4 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.200
 so White should go back to 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.200
 of 3 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.240
 horse efe 6 play black 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.659
 no horses in six the white ones eat 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.479
 Steam 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.240
 and that's what we were talking about, not black 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.200
 they already start the aggression they want to play 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.569
 with bishop 04 probably damages 5 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.960
 this reminds me many lines of the 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:05.869
 Scandinavian and they are going to ship long 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.520
 horse the c3 the white ones playing 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:13.470
 quite natural daam h5 castling and now 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.110
 if he pretends 4 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.080
 Usually when we are nailed we tend 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.370
 to play file 2 that I think was the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.370
 best move in this position 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.510
 to protect well 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.510
 what is our pawn structure 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.760
 in the game white plays with h3 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.030
 and here 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.420
 manu for let's say for the quick victory 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.560
 with horse of 5 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.860
 I personally believe that bishop by efe 3 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.860
 the best 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.520
 since as we can see the pawns of 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.150
 White is very very weak 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.670
 they can only be defended by pieces and 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.940
 can not be defended by pawns this 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.680
 facing an end is very very bad and the 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.070
 blacks have a very very structure 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.070
 healthy 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.510
 Calle 5 is a move that seeks more 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.159
 complications but 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.040
 Black is also sacrificing 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:19.579
 one piece then White accepts 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.120
 with width by axis 4 the horse efe by 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.909
 axis 4 and now there is a simple threat of 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.549
 the black one that was made by efe 3 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:32.269
 followed by damages 2 mate in the game 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:34.930
 bill gates takes with horse by 5 and 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.409
 good something lady h 2 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.620
 get killed or this is what happened but 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.840
 curiously not if white played 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.700
 tower 1 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.740
 that beyond be good at 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.570
 play is also unique 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.750
 we see that Black's attack does not 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:57.590
 it works if horse by efe 3 lady by 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:00.170
 efe 3 damage two we play king f1 and 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.150
 see how the king of white is 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.210
 escapes by 2 and even by 1 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.520
 It would be safe and not only that but 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.580
 White also has threats 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.600
 as a lady for time 7 and the axis horse 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.030
 4 hanging too 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.859
 it would have been interesting what was happening 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:24.569
 if bill gates played tower 1 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:27.990
 but what I do know is not that for example 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:29.969
 if Black continues with the check or with 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.789
 natural plays not of what would have 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:35.550
 this lightning match 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:38.129
 here so much lady to see 7 that you can 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.030
 consider the same the film 5 check 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.030
 it's easier 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.020
 I think White would win in the 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.420
 short term but good a game 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.379
 interesting 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:55.819
 I hope it was something useful 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:58.280
 interesting and good I'll be 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.939
 watching surely in future videos 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.939
 Thank you
