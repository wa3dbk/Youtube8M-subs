too<00:01:42.250> much<00:01:42.400> regrowth<00:01:42.910> there<00:01:43.119> so<00:01:43.300> you<00:01:43.420> take<00:01:43.630> the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
too much regrowth there so you take the

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.260

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.320 
pretty decent for a drugstore product my
favorite<00:03:31.220> would've<00:03:31.490> been<00:03:31.640> max<00:03:31.970> fights

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
favorite would've been max fights

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.500 
favorite would've been max fights
because<00:03:32.540> 10<00:03:33.470> tip<00:03:33.740> is<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:33.890> lot<00:03:34.250> finer<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:35.120> I<00:03:35.209> find

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
because 10 tip is a lot finer and I find

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.800 
because 10 tip is a lot finer and I find
it<00:03:35.690> can<00:03:35.900> mimic<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.970> hair<00:03:37.970> bristles<00:03:38.450> a<00:03:38.630> lot

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
it can mimic the hair bristles a lot

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.550 
it can mimic the hair bristles a lot
better<00:03:39.019> but<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.650> looks<00:03:39.830> more<00:03:40.040> like<00:03:40.310> your<00:03:40.940> hair

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
better but it looks more like your hair

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.540 
better but it looks more like your hair
this<00:03:42.560> does<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:42.800> very<00:03:43.100> similar<00:03:43.370> job<00:03:44.860> so<00:03:45.860> very

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
this does a very similar job so very

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.580 
this does a very similar job so very
lightly<00:03:46.880> on<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.450> inside<00:03:47.780> are<00:03:48.019> more<00:03:48.200> heavy<00:03:48.470> on

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
lightly on the inside are more heavy on

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.310 
lightly on the inside are more heavy on
the<00:03:48.739> outside<00:03:49.130> so<00:03:49.550> next<00:03:49.850> I'm<00:03:50.120> using<00:03:50.180> this<00:03:50.780> brow

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
the outside so next I'm using this brow

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.290 
the outside so next I'm using this brow

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
that on there pretty tiny so you might

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.370 
that on there pretty tiny so you might

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
want to use your long-handled makeup

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.860 
want to use your long-handled makeup
brushes<00:04:00.620> instead<00:04:01.160> but<00:04:01.700> for<00:04:01.910> me<00:04:02.060> I<00:04:02.300> find<00:04:02.660> these

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
brushes instead but for me I find these

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.050 
brushes instead but for me I find these
five<00:04:03.110> don't<00:04:03.590> tend<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.130> use<00:04:04.250> this<00:04:04.400> really<00:04:04.850> much

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
five don't tend to use this really much

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.699 
five don't tend to use this really much
because<00:04:05.450> I've<00:04:05.570> already<00:04:05.660> got<00:04:06.049> the<00:04:06.200> brow<00:04:06.410> gel

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
because I've already got the brow gel

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.650 
because I've already got the brow gel
that<00:04:07.130> I<00:04:07.220> use<00:04:07.459> so<00:04:07.610> I<00:04:07.670> can<00:04:07.910> just<00:04:08.060> put<00:04:08.269> that<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.540> one

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
that I use so I can just put that to one

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.920 
that I use so I can just put that to one
side<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.350> then<00:04:10.190> with<00:04:10.400> this<00:04:10.670> I<00:04:11.030> always<00:04:11.600> make

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
side and then with this I always make

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.390 
side and then with this I always make
sure<00:04:11.959> when<00:04:12.290> I<00:04:12.380> put<00:04:12.410> it<00:04:12.680> back<00:04:12.709> in<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.040> case<00:04:13.250> I

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
sure when I put it back in the case I

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.680 
sure when I put it back in the case I
put<00:04:13.580> it<00:04:13.670> back<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.910> same<00:04:14.090> way<00:04:14.150> around<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:14.660> I

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
put it back the same way around so I

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.390 
put it back the same way around so I
know<00:04:14.810> which<00:04:15.019> side<00:04:15.049> I<00:04:15.320> use<00:04:15.590> for<00:04:15.799> the<00:04:15.890> gel<00:04:16.100> which

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
know which side I use for the gel which

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.729 
know which side I use for the gel which
SIU's<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.030> powder<00:04:17.269> you<00:04:18.019> start<00:04:18.260> mixing<00:04:18.440> it

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
SIU's to the powder you start mixing it

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.370 
SIU's to the powder you start mixing it
around<00:04:18.830> it<00:04:19.160> can<00:04:19.310> get<00:04:19.519> pretty<00:04:19.790> messy<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:21.109> this

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
around it can get pretty messy so this

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.020 
around it can get pretty messy so this
one's<00:04:21.590> always<00:04:21.830> on<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.190> gel<00:04:22.400> side<00:04:22.580> and<00:04:22.820> I<00:04:22.850> go

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
one's always on the gel side and I go

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.090 
one's always on the gel side and I go
straight<00:04:23.270> for<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.479> gel<00:04:23.780> sorry<00:04:24.229> I<00:04:24.470> go<00:04:24.830> straight

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
straight for the gel sorry I go straight

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.610 
straight for the gel sorry I go straight
for<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.310> gel<00:04:25.550> first<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:26.210> then<00:04:27.080> I<00:04:27.110> just<00:04:27.320> kind

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
for the gel first and then I just kind

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.650 
for the gel first and then I just kind
of<00:04:27.710> fill<00:04:27.950> in<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.340> middle<00:04:28.520> area<00:04:29.060> which<00:04:29.479> are

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
of fill in the middle area which are

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.340 
of fill in the middle area which are
pretty<00:04:29.900> lightly<00:04:30.290> done<00:04:30.680> before<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:32.570> again<00:04:32.720> I

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
pretty lightly done before and again I

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.400 
pretty lightly done before and again I
try<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:34.010> mimic<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:35.330> direction<00:04:35.960> of<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.229> hair

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
try and mimic the direction of the hair

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.710 
try and mimic the direction of the hair
so<00:04:36.710> I<00:04:36.740> just<00:04:36.979> go<00:04:37.220> and<00:04:37.850> this<00:04:38.060> Smarties<00:04:38.600> are

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
so I just go and this Smarties are

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.100 
so I just go and this Smarties are
actually<00:04:39.140> the<00:04:39.200> same<00:04:39.260> way<00:04:39.530> my<00:04:39.740> hairs<00:04:39.979> are<00:04:40.130> going

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.540 

and<00:04:45.110> I'm<00:04:45.260> always<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.560> bit<00:04:45.920> more<00:04:46.130> generous

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
and I'm always a bit more generous

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.130 
and I'm always a bit more generous
towards<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:46.970> tailor<00:04:47.210> and<00:04:47.450> don't<00:04:47.720> have<00:04:47.960> much

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
towards the tailor and don't have much

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.530 
towards the tailor and don't have much
hair<00:04:48.440> there<00:04:48.830> anyway<00:04:49.220> so<00:04:49.580> I<00:04:49.820> need<00:04:50.360> to

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
hair there anyway so I need to

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.480 
hair there anyway so I need to
compensate<00:04:51.110> by<00:04:51.590> being<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:51.860> bit<00:04:52.070> more<00:04:52.280> heavy

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
compensate by being a bit more heavy

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.050 
compensate by being a bit more heavy
with<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:53.140> brow<00:04:54.140> gel<00:04:54.440> on<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:55.400> other<00:04:55.610> end<00:04:55.880> of
