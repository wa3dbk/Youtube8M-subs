strategies<00:01:00.420> once<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.870> zombies<00:01:01.260> start

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
strategies once you see zombies start

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.619 
strategies once you see zombies start
coming<00:01:02.039> over<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.309> truck<00:01:02.640> right<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:02.879> you

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
coming over that truck right here you

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.850 
coming over that truck right here you
want<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> come<00:01:03.989> back<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.470> start

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
want to come back here and start

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.969 
want to come back here and start
wheeling<00:01:05.369> them<00:01:05.670> around<00:01:06.049> like<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:07.860> a

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
wheeling them around like this it's a

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.260 
wheeling them around like this it's a
really<00:01:08.220> difficult<00:01:08.430> strategy<00:01:08.909> because<00:01:09.090> you're

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
really difficult strategy because you're

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.920 
really difficult strategy because you're
really<00:01:09.750> confined<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.650> guys<00:01:10.799> can<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.930> once

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
really confined as you guys can see once

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.219 
really confined as you guys can see once
you<00:01:13.020> get<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> hang<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:14.750> like<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.080> see

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you get the hang of it like as you see

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.539 
you get the hang of it like as you see
I'm<00:01:16.350> doing<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.740> sometime<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.220> could<00:01:17.340> wield

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
I'm doing it sometime you could wield

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.980 
I'm doing it sometime you could wield
them<00:01:17.700> around<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:17.970> truck<00:01:18.360> over<00:01:18.600> there<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.900> go

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
them around that truck over there and go

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.310 
them around that truck over there and go
up<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.170> mound<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:21.630> thing<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.080> about<00:01:22.110> this

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
up the mound the thing I like about this

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
up the mound the thing I like about this
executioner<00:01:23.100> or<00:01:23.280> voice<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.820> justice<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.330> you

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
executioner or voice of justice is you

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.600 
executioner or voice of justice is you
can<00:01:24.720> use<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> type<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.590> panic<00:01:26.100> weapon<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
can use it as a type of panic weapon and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.149 
can use it as a type of panic weapon and

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
I think one time I got a little stuck in

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.720 
I think one time I got a little stuck in
here<00:02:54.440> because<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.620> didn't<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:55.920> jog<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.430> needed

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.340 
here because I didn't have jog I needed
a<00:02:56.790> gun<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.209> box<00:02:57.360> sometimes<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:57.989> located

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350

far<00:03:17.370> i<00:03:17.400> got<00:03:17.670> with<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:20.209> but<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.299> is<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.420> really

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
far i got with this but it is a really

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.930 
far i got with this but it is a really
good<00:03:22.019> strategy<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.860> can<00:03:23.040> also<00:03:23.190> also<00:03:23.519> do<00:03:23.820> this

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
good strategy you can also also do this

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.250 
good strategy you can also also do this
for<00:03:24.090> transit<00:03:24.510> guys<00:03:24.660> I'm<00:03:24.870> not<00:03:24.989> just<00:03:25.200> saying

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
for transit guys I'm not just saying

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.590 
for transit guys I'm not just saying
it's<00:03:25.440> only<00:03:25.590> first<00:03:25.799> town<00:03:26.250> if<00:03:27.150> you're<00:03:27.360> doing

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
it's only first town if you're doing

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.300 
it's only first town if you're doing
transit<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:28.230> once<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:28.590> get<00:03:28.739> all<00:03:28.860> settled<00:03:28.890> you

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
transit and once you get all settled you

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.070 
transit and once you get all settled you
got<00:03:29.430> your<00:03:29.549> perks<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.000> want<00:03:30.209> come<00:03:30.780> over

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
got your perks that you want come over

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.490 
got your perks that you want come over
here<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.530> area<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:32.040> do<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:33.500> think

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
here to this area and do this I think

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.509 
here to this area and do this I think
that's<00:03:34.650> going<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.830> work<00:03:34.890> i'm<00:03:35.160> going<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.370> start

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
that's going to work i'm going to start

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.900 
that's going to work i'm going to start
trying<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.910> do<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.950> because<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.190> mean<00:03:38.670> this<00:03:38.790> is

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
trying to do that because I mean this is

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.569 
trying to do that because I mean this is
a<00:03:38.970> really<00:03:39.269> good<00:03:39.390> strategy<00:03:39.840> right<00:03:39.959> here<00:03:40.519> it's<00:03:41.519> a

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
a really good strategy right here it's a

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.680 
a really good strategy right here it's a
little<00:03:41.760> difficult<00:03:42.060> as<00:03:42.329> you<00:03:42.390> guys<00:03:42.510> can<00:03:42.630> see

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
little difficult as you guys can see

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.880 
little difficult as you guys can see
because<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.970> confined<00:03:44.970> space<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:46.590> really

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
because of the confined space you really

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.930 
because of the confined space you really
need<00:03:46.980> juggernaut<00:03:47.459> because<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:47.670> do<00:03:47.790> thats

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
need juggernaut because you do thats

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.110 
need juggernaut because you do thats
lacked<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.360> little<00:03:48.390> bit<00:03:49.220> but<00:03:50.220> i<00:03:50.250> haven't<00:03:50.970> lost

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
lacked a little bit but i haven't lost

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.430 
lacked a little bit but i haven't lost
any<00:03:51.390> quick<00:03:51.630> revised<00:03:51.959> while<00:03:52.140> doing<00:03:52.260> this

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
any quick revised while doing this

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.710 
any quick revised while doing this
strategy<00:03:52.890> guys<00:03:53.070> all<00:03:53.820> my<00:03:54.120> quick<00:03:54.299> revives<00:03:54.570> are

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
strategy guys all my quick revives are

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.270 
strategy guys all my quick revives are
lost<00:03:54.930> because<00:03:55.140> i<00:03:55.440> was<00:03:55.620> trying<00:03:55.860> out<00:03:55.980> this<00:03:56.130> other

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
lost because i was trying out this other

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.300 
lost because i was trying out this other
strategy<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:56.970> didn't<00:03:57.390> work<00:03:57.890> but<00:03:58.890> man<00:03:59.100> this

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
strategy that didn't work but man this

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.760 
strategy that didn't work but man this
is<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.489> really<00:03:59.790> good<00:03:59.910> one

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.100 

yeah<00:04:04.430> I<00:04:04.460> like<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.790> air<00:04:04.910> of<00:04:05.060> those<00:04:05.180> walkers<00:04:08.110> so

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
yeah I like the air of those walkers so

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.770 
yeah I like the air of those walkers so
that<00:04:09.430> most<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.550> the<00:04:10.640> wave<00:04:10.820> is<00:04:11.030> gone<00:04:11.210> most<00:04:11.660> of

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
that most of the wave is gone most of

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.320 
that most of the wave is gone most of
the<00:04:11.870> train<00:04:12.350> i<00:04:12.380> had<00:04:12.620> running<00:04:12.920> is<00:04:13.040> gone<00:04:13.330> this

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
the train i had running is gone this

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.120 
the train i had running is gone this
pistol<00:04:14.720> is<00:04:14.870> unbelievably<00:04:15.530> good<00:04:15.740> i<00:04:15.800> don't<00:04:16.040> know

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
pistol is unbelievably good i don't know

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.229 
pistol is unbelievably good i don't know
what<00:04:16.310> they<00:04:16.430> were<00:04:16.489> thinking<00:04:16.670> when<00:04:16.970> they<00:04:17.000> made

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
what they were thinking when they made

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.120 
what they were thinking when they made
it<00:04:17.420> but<00:04:18.320> i<00:04:18.380> like<00:04:18.590> it<00:04:18.620> i<00:04:21.010> think<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.100> most

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
it but i like it i think the most

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.470 
it but i like it i think the most
important<00:04:22.700> part<00:04:22.880> of<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.030> strategy<00:04:23.240> is

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
important part of the strategy is

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.720 
important part of the strategy is
looking<00:04:23.870> for<00:04:24.020> holes<00:04:24.230> and<00:04:24.550> timing<00:04:25.550> everything

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
looking for holes and timing everything

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.610 
looking for holes and timing everything
and<00:04:26.060> if<00:04:26.750> you<00:04:26.840> realize<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:27.170> don't<00:04:27.290> have<00:04:27.440> any

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
and if you realize you don't have any

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.100 
and if you realize you don't have any
holes<00:04:27.880> like<00:04:28.880> I<00:04:29.030> just<00:04:29.270> right<00:04:29.750> there<00:04:29.870> I<00:04:29.900> didn't

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
holes like I just right there I didn't

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.750 
holes like I just right there I didn't
have<00:04:30.260> one<00:04:30.470> you<00:04:30.830> just<00:04:30.980> use<00:04:31.160> this<00:04:31.280> pistol<00:04:31.670> to

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
have one you just use this pistol to

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.040 
have one you just use this pistol to
clear<00:04:31.940> out<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.090> zombie<00:04:32.450> or<00:04:32.570> if<00:04:32.690> you<00:04:32.750> have<00:04:32.810> a<00:04:32.870> ray

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
clear out a zombie or if you have a ray

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.450 
clear out a zombie or if you have a ray
gun<00:04:33.140> use<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.680> ray<00:04:33.830> gun<00:04:34.010> to<00:04:34.100> clear<00:04:34.280> out<00:04:34.430> a

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
gun use the ray gun to clear out a

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.270 
gun use the ray gun to clear out a
zombie<00:04:34.880> so<00:04:35.000> you<00:04:35.090> can<00:04:35.210> run<00:04:35.390> it<00:04:35.920> it's<00:04:36.920> really

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
zombie so you can run it it's really

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.050 
zombie so you can run it it's really
useful<00:04:37.550> guys<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:40.220> only<00:04:40.400> thing<00:04:40.580> bad<00:04:40.700> about<00:04:40.880> the

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
useful guys the only thing bad about the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.140 
useful guys the only thing bad about the
strategy<00:04:41.480> is<00:04:41.510> there<00:04:41.870> are<00:04:42.080> no<00:04:42.740> wall<00:04:43.100> guns<00:04:43.370> worth

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
strategy is there are no wall guns worth

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.900 
strategy is there are no wall guns worth
using<00:04:44.570> the<00:04:45.560> only<00:04:45.710> wall<00:04:45.890> gun<00:04:46.070> is<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.550> Olympia

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
using the only wall gun is the Olympia

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.180 
using the only wall gun is the Olympia
right<00:04:47.060> there<00:04:47.470> so<00:04:48.470> there's<00:04:48.650> really<00:04:48.710> no<00:04:48.950> wall

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
right there so there's really no wall

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.590 
right there so there's really no wall
gun<00:04:49.370> you<00:04:49.460> could<00:04:49.580> just<00:04:49.640> keep<00:04:49.820> taking<00:04:50.030> ammo<00:04:50.360> from

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
gun you could just keep taking ammo from

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.300 
gun you could just keep taking ammo from
unless<00:04:51.440> you<00:04:51.560> want<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:51.770> pack<00:04:51.920> a<00:04:51.950> punch<00:04:52.190> the

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
unless you want to pack a punch the

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.650 
unless you want to pack a punch the
Olympian<00:04:52.670> try<00:04:52.850> that<00:04:53.090> I<00:04:53.240> don't<00:04:53.420> know<00:04:53.480> maybe

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
Olympian try that I don't know maybe

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.990 
Olympian try that I don't know maybe
that<00:04:53.870> would<00:04:54.020> be<00:04:54.050> a<00:04:54.140> good<00:04:54.260> strategy<00:04:54.760> hey<00:04:55.760> guys

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
that would be a good strategy hey guys

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.310 
that would be a good strategy hey guys
this<00:04:56.210> is<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.450> strategy<00:04:56.660> i<00:04:56.900> hope<00:04:57.140> you<00:04:57.230> guys

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
this is the strategy i hope you guys

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.730 
this is the strategy i hope you guys
