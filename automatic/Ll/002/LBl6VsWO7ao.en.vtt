always<00:01:39.840> forget<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.409> always<00:01:40.950> carry<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.310> separate

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
always forget I always carry a separate

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.240 
always forget I always carry a separate
compact<00:01:42.090> around<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:42.540> me<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:43.409> why<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.890> do

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
compact around with me but why do I do

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.920 
compact around with me but why do I do
when<00:01:44.399> that's<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.850> secure<00:01:45.299> because<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
when that's in that secure because the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.670 
when that's in that secure because the
zip<00:01:46.140> actually<00:01:46.799> Clips<00:01:47.790> under<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.780> that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
zip actually Clips under like that that

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.510 
zip actually Clips under like that that
it<00:01:50.460> opens<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.840> kind<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.740> slight

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
it opens up you kind of have to a slight

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.160 
it opens up you kind of have to a slight
maneuver<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.240> open<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.630> which<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.840> always<00:01:54.960> think

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
maneuver to open it which I always think

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.840

is<00:01:55.290> good<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.710> someone<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.100> street<00:01:56.369> can't<00:01:56.579> just

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
is good to someone the street can't just

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.660 
is good to someone the street can't just
open<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.329> up<00:01:57.450> wherever<00:01:58.229> they<00:01:58.469> please<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.070> I

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
open it up wherever they please and I

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.459 
open it up wherever they please and I
will<00:01:59.909> just<00:02:00.090> say<00:02:00.270> as<00:02:00.420> well<00:02:00.600> actually<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.350> this

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
will just say as well actually that this

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.469 
will just say as well actually that this
is<00:02:01.590> actually<00:02:01.950> touchable<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.090> could<00:02:03.299> just

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
is actually touchable so you could just

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.969 
is actually touchable so you could just
wear<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.899> really<00:02:04.200> little<00:02:04.320> mini<00:02:04.770> bag

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
wear it like a really little mini bag

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:05.510 
wear it like a really little mini bag
like<00:02:05.280> that

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
like that

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.459 
like that
I<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> strap<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.750> part<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> whole

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
I think the strap is part of the whole

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.230 
I think the strap is part of the whole
appeal<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.340> why<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.520> love<00:02:08.789> with<00:02:08.970> that

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
appeal and it's why I love with that

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.120 
appeal and it's why I love with that
so<00:02:09.480> I<00:02:09.510> would<00:02:09.750> never<00:02:09.900> take<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.590> off<00:02:10.770> if<00:02:11.010> you

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
so I would never take it off if you

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.410 
so I would never take it off if you
wanted<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.670> could<00:02:11.820> take<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.090> strap<00:02:12.270> off

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
wanted to you could take the strap off

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.960 
wanted to you could take the strap off
