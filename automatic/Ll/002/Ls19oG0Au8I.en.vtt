00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
is also different as you can see as I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.049 
is also different as you can see as I
said<00:00:51.690> as<00:00:51.870> well<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.160> awful<00:00:53.730> driving

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
said as well and this is a awful driving

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.119 
said as well and this is a awful driving
there<00:00:54.239> crashing<00:00:54.660> all<00:00:54.750> over<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.989> place<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.980> ice

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
there crashing all over the place as ice

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
as you can see and as I have said this

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.170 
as you can see and as I have said this
is<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> sprint<00:00:59.250> race<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.609> basically<00:00:59.940> what<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
is a sprint race and basically what a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.630 
is a sprint race and basically what a
sprint<00:01:00.510> races<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.050> basically<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.100> puts<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.460> in

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
basically you just have to have a race

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.440 
basically you just have to have a race
but<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> difference<00:01:11.369> between<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.880> circuit

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
but the difference between a circuit

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.390 
but the difference between a circuit
race<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> spring<00:01:13.080> race<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.159> is

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
race and a spring race is that it is

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.700 
race and a spring race is that it is
only<00:01:14.670> like<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> two<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.630> half<00:01:15.750> miles<00:01:16.170> long<00:01:16.290> so

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
only like a two and a half miles long so

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.200 
only like a two and a half miles long so
literally<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> race<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.700> last<00:01:17.939> and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
literally the race can last and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.450 
literally the race can last and
literally<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.900> two<00:01:19.200> minutes<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:20.220> if<00:01:20.340> you're

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
literally like two minutes and if you're

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.649 
literally like two minutes and if you're
quick<00:01:20.700> off<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.850> market<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.330> even<00:01:21.450> be

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
quick off the market you can even be

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.030 
quick off the market you can even be
like<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> minute<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.290> half<00:01:22.320> race<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:22.890> as<00:01:22.950> you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
like a minute and a half race so as you
