 near his house allegedly drowned 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.790
 it is not clear how long he had been 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.649
 in the water after getting away from home 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.660
 despite many efforts to 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.910
 resuscitate was declared dead in the

 hospital henri medio in valencia according to 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.110
 the sheriff's department the water is 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.660
 an element known to hold a 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.129
 deadly fascination for children who 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.230
 They are living with the disease suffering to 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.989
 through according to the national association of 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.449
 autism accidental drowning 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.989
 represents 91% of total deaths 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:53.100
 in the USA in children with minor autism 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.100
 of 14 years 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.020
 yes, unfortunately, they are very 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.910
 frequent these cases and to talk to us 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.130
 we have alternate theme ricardo 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.110
 spokesman for the American Red Cross how 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.820
 you were familiar a few days ago welcome 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.100
 the first thing that occurs to me to ask you 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.380
 and is that a little bit this question has been 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.510
 turned myth and you are going to tell us if it is like that 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.600
 or you can not swim after eating 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.520
 something is looking if it is a myth and you are not 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.470
 100% checked but has a part 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.300
 medical logic when you're when 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.430
 you finish eating the digestive system 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.830
 start working if you put to work 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.680
 the muscular system the blood fluid 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.390
 you have to arrive to do both 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.560
 functions will go out of control and will 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.539
 say what you have to work first the 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.490
 digestive system the muscular system and 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.740
 many times when being in movement 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.420
 also one is stirring the food 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.160
 as if it were the blender you can not 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.380
 give an option that the person can 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.940
 throw up and if it's inside the water that 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.310
 same myth can cause a drowning 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.649
 plus the water intake so it's better to 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.539
 recommends that if you are finished eating 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.100
 at least a lapse of about 15 30 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.020
 minutes for the system to be reversed 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.850
 make part of your work and then you can 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.980
 put to work the muscular hey is 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.500
 true the figure what 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.230
 that children between 1 and 4 years in the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.180
 most common death by drowning if the 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.190
 number is correct and what happens is that 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.660
 for some reason that we can not 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.730
 explain the water to them 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.140
 then the movement of the water plus the 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.790
 brightness that sometimes generates if the pool 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.190
 it's very clean is something that is attractive 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.020
 for them also passed three times with 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.300
 my children in pools borrowed from 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.250
 family and that simply in question 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.170
 of seconds it disappears and when we give 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.550
 accounts to the water when this happens that 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.260
 what you have to do that comes first 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.310
 that we have to attend to when a child 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.410
 when we see that a child is 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.090
 drowning ok the first thing is to have 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.950
 something by hand that helps us to be able 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.080
 rescue people pools 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.150
 they have to have a rod with which 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.880
 you can catch the person or the same 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.310
 the same one that you use to clean it you can 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.500
 use you also have to have a Albanian 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.720
 and lifesavers that you can throw so that 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.160
 the person gets hold of him and even 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.200
 you can tie a rope and you can 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.000
 climbing is the last option is to throw yourself 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.830
 you to the water to rescue the person but 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.720
 you have to be sure that accesses 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.940
 to the person from the back but 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.500
 from the front and that usually when 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.480
 it's the last option that you just 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.050
 mention always has problems the 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.310
 person 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.620
 time to rescue because you can also 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.120
 drown everything from the test if I 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.170
 you were big you come face to face 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.820
 me and I will record from you 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.410
 Of course I'm going, I'm going to win from you and 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.270
 I'm going to sink it showed health and what 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.860
 you saved me but you stay down 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.510
 Now let's remember to keep the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.400
 pools mainly our houses 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.340
 with the necessary security measures 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.260
 let's make it a railing let's make a door 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.930
 security that is not accessible to 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.340
 children and railing space 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.170
 be agreements that they can not pass 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.210
 in the middle of that and also because 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.830
 let's take swimming lessons and take 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.270
 our children to those classes that the cross 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.980
 red also the children always art 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.530
 good lady you know how important 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.300
 are the precautionary measures always 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.310
 always have a lifeline on the 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.140
 pool if you have it at home or 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.000
 At least if it takes the child to swim it is 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.100
 indispensable also the telephone of the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.780
 American red cross so they do not happen 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.780
 these things thank you very much Ricardo
