00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.119

 five places fifth occupies the so-called 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.170
 Diamond dust easter egg became this 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.809
 for the first year 2008 in on 12 january in 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.570
 blizzard faces two days before 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.090
 junichi masuda namely tweeted that 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.070
 one day in this easter egg in 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.020
 would find his game and it is 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.570
 this so called diamond dust the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.090
 data the thing is incidentally that is 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.039
 feature also included in bomont xy 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.559
 you should have her birthday 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.300
 make you on the way to the construction site 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.760
 there would also be instead of the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.760
 normal snow will see the diamond dust 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.549
 square number four 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.660
 fourth place is occupied by an easter egg from the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.000
 crystal edition 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.640
 you have to go to prisma city in 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.250
 the prisma city villa is doing something 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.770
 the following is out of here and except for the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 roof terrace go up the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.340
 roof terrace in crystal is exclusive 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.530
 and only looks exactly like this out of here 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.960
 The stairs are a tiny one 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.790
 gang where he with 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.770
 lira, the heroine of christan 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.440
 can go and can then take the stairs 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.510
 address it is located there 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.760
 a graffiti and can you one 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.040
 Add a toaster has all the benefits 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.630
 but not even though it falls to me 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.630
 spontaneously so what 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.500
 Place number three has this easter egg 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.900
 it deserves to be in 3rd place 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.180
 effect in the so-called labbadia on where 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.660
 almost every myth or easter 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.430
 egg somehow starts and yes you go 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.370
 then north of la mamma mia and there 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.950
 is a fighter with whom we speak 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.080
 and this one has an easter egg 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.450
 created like no other 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.120
 Because she says she wishes 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.910
 a pink pokémon that a floral pattern 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.870
 lie and comes in tantow ten 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.340
 years later the pokémon somnia the 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.200
 description of me is so accurate 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.360
 you can just say that it is 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.810
 only to hum can act on the 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.430
 location 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.170
 and probably to any one 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.330
 his time simply from the 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.640
 Sketchbooks has been discarded in 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.400
 The first generation is then ten 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.980
 years later has decided but in 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.690
 Spore Universe take up space three 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:39.410
 for the collector easter egg 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:41.810
 square number two square two is one 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.850
 easter egg and a myth at the same time and 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.260
 he has been quite persistent about the 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.620
 years away 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.650
 the truck easter egg get along yellow 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.750
 is really legendary especially since he said one 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.740
 has that under this can be video 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.960
 should be located 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.930
 Of course, the whole thing is far -fetched 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.790
 completely invented because you can do this 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.920
 you could not move the truck away 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.900
 use strength everywhere, even if no 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.390
 strong field nearby was why 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.300
 this rumor had yet hardened and 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.440
 very important nintendo actually wanted 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.930
 that is more than decoration 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.459
 matter rest but had far too late noticed 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.350
 that the sentence long way too far to the right 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.790
 and that's why they have that 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.620
 could not see what that did 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.900
 Of course, the rumor had been confirmed 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.240
 By the way, there is this truck too 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.820
 in fire red and leafy green and there 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.200
 you can find one more south 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.360
 lover biscuit this one can the 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.060
 Game history is not included and therefore 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.320
 is that even something useful the harbor 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.840
 to explore closer 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.520
 but the country easter egg has become 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.020
 medial way but very persistent 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.270
 kept and therefore a very 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.680
 deserved place number two for the 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.680
 truck easter egg 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.320
 place number one 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:03.139
 my personal space one is the one 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:05.960
 dreamworks riester yes that you can find in 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.789
 devon corporation and love 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.220
 researcher said that to a device 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.560
 work the dreams of the pokémon 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.880
 but you can really visualize 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.639
 he does not move forward 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.530
 two generations later in the 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.470
 fifth generation was the pokémon 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.030
 dream world introduced and that 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.979
 interesting at this easter eggs 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.660
 actually that's with the bob and sony 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.810
 what has to do what, of course, again 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.280
 also an easter egg is and another 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.830
 of course in the sixth 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.500
 generation here this pouring corner 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.509
 is mentioned and what else about it 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.699
 very interesting is that we in the 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:44.300
 sixth generation makes you one 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:46.820
