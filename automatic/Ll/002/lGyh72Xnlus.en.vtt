to<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.959> do<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.080> externally<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.129> think

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
to have to do that externally I think

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.370 
to have to do that externally I think
the<00:02:11.970> only<00:02:12.000> thing<00:02:12.270> I've<00:02:12.690> found

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
have to justify a purchase and that's

entry-level machine if I'd have bought

that entry-level Mac Pro I would have

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
been missing out on some of the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.420 
been missing out on some of the
performance<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.560> six<00:04:13.830> core<00:04:14.070> machine

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
performance that the six core machine

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.570 
performance that the six core machine
delivers<00:04:14.810> so<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.840> decided<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.739> go<00:04:16.950> right<00:04:17.430> down

delivers so I decided to go right down
the<00:04:17.730> middle<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.150> actually<00:04:18.959> buy<00:04:19.260> the

the middle and actually buy the

when it comes to performance I've been

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
the mac pro and I think it was a very

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.690 
the mac pro and I think it was a very
wise<00:05:30.660> investment<00:05:31.350> so<00:05:31.770> thanks<00:05:32.010> very<00:05:32.100> much<00:05:32.310> for
