00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.010
 one of the many beautiful things 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.650
 dobeleit rome is the possibility presets 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.879
 So pretending to save and also 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.440
 specifications to load 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.480
 that means you do yours 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.369
 image editing ready to use saves the 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.859
 in a folder and then on one 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.929
 apply another photo or you have one 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.179
 so that also the possibility own 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:28.960
 to load defaults from the internet and 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:31.269
 to buy as the vst film specifications 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.630
 which you then apply to his photos 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.700
 can 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.260
 that is beautiful but sometimes 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.660
 There is also a presets one 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.059
 just too intense happens to me 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.039
 that's very often because a preset 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.289
 just not for the current photo 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.850
 I just made work 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.770
 but actually for another 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.449
 that means you look at it often 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.000
 maybe a photo of problems with that 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.039
 the original picture takes out here 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.570
 reset i'm using the guilt camp 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.210
 at presets we in the course too 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.670
 use and then think about it 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.670
 go already in the preview 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.199
 there can already be a direction 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.910
 I would like to work in but that is 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.990
 Much too intense when I am 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.130
 the now so used 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.450
 of course I could do that right now 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.700
 development modules on the right 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.650
 side one regulator after the other 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.310
 take back and try somehow 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.960
 the effect that I have here in this preset 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.659
 originally built again too 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.970
 undo and a bit 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.710
 less intense and for that 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.200
 there is now this beautiful plugin 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.850
 the feat that I discovered recently 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.369
 I want to show it 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.159
 if you do not play the part first 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.770
 Just installed here on file 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.420
 additional module options of the spring and then 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.040
 you get your specifications here again 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.360
 folder in which you set your 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.790
 we have saved here 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.340
 shoot camp at folder and take the 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.960
 Same as before and that will 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.469
 just as we are not quite normal 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.579
 in adobe lightroom users here 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.990
 applied and then there is this 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.210
 wonderful rule with which I have the 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.700
 opacity of this plugin simply 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.680
 can change and this private thus 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.229
 can not apply to 100% but 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.549
 just a little less if you exactly 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.170
 look on the right side in the 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.700
 development module, you see it too 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.280
 I change the opacity of this 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.080
 all the controls in this preset 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.280
 were changed 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.390
 change accordingly that means it 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.370
 is actually this 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.430
 less applied and a little bit 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.230
 set easier than before 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.999
 a nice opportunity is here too 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.590
 even that I have individual parts of the 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.879
 simply switch off the development model 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.349
 or can turn on 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.120
 that means I can say for example 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.280
 i would like to be at the exposure 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.230
 lights deep on black clarity 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.359
 dynamics saturation and so on as on 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.980
 the basic settings do not change anything 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.049
 I just want everything else 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.849
 I set this preset 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.680
 I'll just take over this one 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.299
 disable basic setting and that 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.700
 is the basic settings will not 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:57.329
 more applied but only the rest of 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:00.030
 this preset beautiful practical 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.699
 small lightroom plugin as I think 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.769
 the link for download is under the 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:06.209
 video the plugin is available as a free 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.739
 trial version, however, with a few 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.109
 restrictions in the costs 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.299
 full version 10 euro and is the coal 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.430
 absolutely worth it will drive you crazy 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.629
 a lot of time and, above all, annoying and nervous 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.629
 spare in the future
