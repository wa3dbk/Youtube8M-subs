00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
and I think he's a good shooter I think

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.840 
and I think he's a good shooter I think
he<00:01:11.820> only<00:01:11.970> made<00:01:12.150> 13<00:01:13.159> yeah<00:01:14.159> he<00:01:14.250> was<00:01:14.340> 14<00:01:14.640> when<00:01:14.729> I

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
he only made 13 yeah he was 14 when I

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.120 
he only made 13 yeah he was 14 when I
only<00:01:14.970> shot<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.659> he<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.500> he<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.740> score

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.820 

I'm<00:01:23.850> always<00:01:24.120> worried<00:01:24.660> you<00:01:25.410> know<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.650> just

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
I'm always worried you know it's just

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.290 
I'm always worried you know it's just
the<00:01:25.980> nature<00:01:26.010> of<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> business<00:01:26.580> kind<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.060> thing

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
the nature of the business kind of thing

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.900 
the nature of the business kind of thing
but<00:01:27.680> i'm<00:01:28.680> also<00:01:28.920> very<00:01:29.070> confident<00:01:29.730> i<00:01:29.820> know

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
but i'm also very confident i know

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.820 
but i'm also very confident i know
that's<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.300> oxymoron<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.380> that's<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.620> correct

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
that's a oxymoron if that's a correct

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.490 
that's a oxymoron if that's a correct
way<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.100> use<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.490> term<00:01:32.730> but<00:01:32.970> i<00:01:33.810> want<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.410> make

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
way to use that term but i want to make

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.560 
way to use that term but i want to make
sure<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.950> cover<00:01:35.130> every<00:01:35.490> base<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:36.000> want<00:01:36.510> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
sure that we cover every base I want to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.180 
sure that we cover every base I want to
make<00:01:36.690> sure<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:37.080> touch<00:01:37.440> on<00:01:37.650> everything<00:01:37.830> we

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
make sure that we touch on everything we

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.760 
make sure that we touch on everything we
need<00:01:38.370> to<00:01:38.400> touch<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.910> in<00:01:39.290> preparation<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.620> then

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
need to touch on in preparation and then

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.710 
need to touch on in preparation and then
you<00:01:41.220> lay<00:01:41.400> awake<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.030> still<00:01:42.210> think<00:01:42.540> if

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
you lay awake and I can still think if

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.260 
you lay awake and I can still think if
you've<00:01:42.840> done<00:01:42.960> everything<00:01:43.260> but<00:01:44.250> came<00:01:44.850> time<00:01:45.090> we

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
you've done everything but came time we

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.670 
you've done everything but came time we
came<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.510> felt<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.200> our<00:01:46.350> kids<00:01:46.500> were

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
came I felt like that our kids were

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.230 
came I felt like that our kids were
confident<00:01:47.160> we<00:01:47.310> try<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.550> give<00:01:47.730> them<00:01:47.760> confidence

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
confident we try to give them confidence

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.510 
confident we try to give them confidence
during<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.690> course<00:01:48.900> of<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.200> pregame<00:01:50.190> stuff

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
during the course of the pregame stuff

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520 
during the course of the pregame stuff
and<00:01:50.940> and<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.660> think<00:01:51.690> we<00:01:52.020> played<00:01:52.230> that<00:01:52.410> way

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
and and I think we played that way

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:01.400 
and and I think we played that way
tonight<00:01:57.020> yeah<00:01:59.420> very<00:02:00.420> pleased<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.230> we

tonight yeah very pleased you know we

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.430 
tonight yeah very pleased you know we

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
had more offensive rebounds I mean we

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.200 
had more offensive rebounds I mean we
had<00:02:04.530> more<00:02:04.680> points<00:02:05.100> off<00:02:05.280> offensive<00:02:05.520> rebounds

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.780 
had more points off offensive rebounds
and<00:02:06.300> they<00:02:06.420> did<00:02:06.600> at<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.810> half<00:02:07.020> even<00:02:07.410> but<00:02:07.790> you

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
and they did at the half even but you

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.910 
and they did at the half even but you
know<00:02:08.910> they're<00:02:09.060> going<00:02:09.240> to<00:02:09.300> get<00:02:09.450> some<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.930> you

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
know they're going to get some and you

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.290 
know they're going to get some and you
know<00:02:11.010> Brad's<00:02:11.280> teams<00:02:11.580> not<00:02:11.790> going<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.030> shoot<00:02:12.150> it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
know Brad's teams not going to shoot it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.820 
know Brad's teams not going to shoot it
like<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:12.690> mean<00:02:12.840> they<00:02:12.960> missed<00:02:13.200> quite<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.590> few

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
like that I mean they missed quite a few

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.260 
like that I mean they missed quite a few
shots<00:02:14.010> they<00:02:14.280> had<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.460> lot<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.640> opportunities<00:02:15.240> to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
shots they had a lot of opportunities to

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.170 
shots they had a lot of opportunities to
get<00:02:15.450> second<00:02:15.900> shots<00:02:16.080> but<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:17.700> didn't<00:02:17.940> shoot<00:02:18.060> it

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
get second shots but we didn't shoot it

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.840 
get second shots but we didn't shoot it
great<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.570> second<00:02:18.900> half<00:02:19.020> ourselves<00:02:19.620> and

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
great in the second half ourselves and

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.240 
great in the second half ourselves and
but<00:02:20.850> i<00:02:20.880> think<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.330> backboards<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.960> me<00:02:22.250> you

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
but i think the backboards to me you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.890 
but i think the backboards to me you
can't<00:02:23.520> say<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:23.910> one<00:02:24.150> area<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.660> more

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
can't say that one area is more

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.810 
can't say that one area is more
important<00:02:25.380> by<00:02:25.709> far<00:02:25.740> than<00:02:26.250> everything<00:02:26.640> but<00:02:26.790> i

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
important by far than everything but i

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.270 
important by far than everything but i
happen<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.240> like<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.470> rebounding<00:02:28.470> this<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> key

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
happen to like the rebounding this a key

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.280 
happen to like the rebounding this a key
thing<00:02:29.550> for<00:02:29.580> me<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.150> i<00:02:30.480> think<00:02:30.870> we<00:02:30.990> did<00:02:31.140> some

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
thing for me and i think we did some

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.990 
thing for me and i think we did some
good<00:02:31.410> things<00:02:31.470> their<00:02:34.190> place<00:02:35.190> for<00:02:35.489> fur<00:02:35.640> let<00:02:35.850> me

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
good things their place for fur let me
