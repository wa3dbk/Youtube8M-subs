00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.360
 The phone or let it was doing in 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.240
 Someone number only says that one day the shoulder around the problem 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.920
 Yes 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.650
 What is there 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.510
 So whether here. 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.200
 Oh 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.200
 Contains 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.510
 Well, don't set it up 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.539
 You should go to the camera for a while 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.539
 Poop 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.550
 So patients to check around And then still want a Kuruwake I hip hurts 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.550
 Right 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.220
 I'd say anything 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.500
 It gets caught here 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.890
 I'm here 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.700
 Oh dear 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.700
 You will be fascinated 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.690
 Coffee changes, yes, where did you go? 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.270
 I think where it is good 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.170
 How this friendship and just backache hurt 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.240
 Sitting down 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.700
 I do not want to hurt if I do not really 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.350
 I think it will hurt with time 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.350
 Let's sit down 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:29.730
 Also not there is an abnormality of the rom in a in a state in which sitting is that with house sitting this Empress 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:34.010
 I'm thinking this too 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.010
 Yes, I think and here comes a little more done 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.149
 Even if it is twisted , I think it is a voice 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.370
 When it stops 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:48.450
 In the form of 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:51.560
 First of all do up to this point because the pain and there will I this is first amendment tends to improve 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.820
 It and the patient is not to commit even Tteyuu Let's 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.520
 See you please wants toward the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:02.229
 And it has caught a look at the root agent 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.229
 Look in supine position and get stuck here 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.659
 Where is yes with such attacks 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.060
 It is good again and again 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.060
 There is also a house on what to do with this 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.660
 I don't know where there are many and where 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.580
 It doesn't make sense even if it is natural. 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.580
 And because moving it's not hip problem 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.250
 Where it has shone 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.310
 It is common number 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.480
 I'm common 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.690
 Here 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.420
 I'm here I Case No. 2 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.270
 this is 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.050
 Common common ridge 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.130
 I think you know look 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.780
 There is something different here. 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.430
 I hope to the plate to do ok who has stopped somewhere to say twisted place This is it 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.790
 It is the left side 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.790
 Here 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.740
 It's not a sense because it looks 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.400
 It is the eyes of the data seen but my 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:29.310
 If you stop here, it 's a line here 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.800
 Moreover, it says the Do's right-to-left is 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.490
 Next to it is not seen in the data on the clinical 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.490
 I do not like this 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.010
 Yes lumbar spine this 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.260
 No. 4 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.640
 3 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.180
 2 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.980
 1 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.480
 Week 21 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.850
 During ~ 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.360
 9 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.140
 8 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.140
 It is the seventh 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.320
 I understand 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.320
 understood 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:14.239
 So in the process of twisting 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.019
 This is seen in Omukae Tteyuu It is indigo this if bread at what number in number in what number hand number 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.220
 That's why 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:22.710
 It's have seen that it 's such a s # 7 Once you twist so far 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:30.539
 So if this improves, there is a possibility that it will change earlier 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:33.660
 This is a so-called "accumulated data" which is used only by the noise of this and this 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.480
 You can understand that you can do this because you can store this data 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.150
 I do not know this right now 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:42.449
 If just this or this is really specific that either corner of the story 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.580
 That's why there were various scenes 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:49.590
 Intends that 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:53.300
 There is accumulation of various data just to understand this, and it is this that only defeat like this 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.300
 It is not coming is known for it 's such a Do it here 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.890
 basic 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:08.240
 It is a state that once or basic is moving since the teaching practice 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:11.930
 In addition to the pump after such can not be that it is a basic step further in 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.500
 And try whether the healed try to check 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.940
 Oh it is the limit value is to say 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.940
 If you try to do it fundamentally efficiently 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:25.160
 First of all 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:27.169
 I will toward the middle It is the version in mind say whether popping 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.460
 It is 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.830
 Egi plate here also Oite 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.569
 Here the Hey or 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.390
 I would also want Nde who lateral bending 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.690
 But I am want to say that there is no here no farmers 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.690
 Yup 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:48.360
 As a little easy-to-understand guess I can see the Tteyuu 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:50.490
 Maybe the 7th one is the movable range of the waist 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.960
 I have and said, tightly Re' 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.960
 Let's start from the group
