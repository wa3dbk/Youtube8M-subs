00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 at the point fr model I have the pleasure of 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.040
 introduce you to the new crossover 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.240
 peugeot 2008 for myself I love his 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.610
 silhouette I like his style 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.440
 dynamic and elegant so that you 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.940
 can appreciate for yourself 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:37.380
 we will go around his 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:40.399
 bodywork i have to answer now 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.399
 on the inside 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:05.710
 for the body then he is already a good 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.930
 god because I like it is that he 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.860
 was accessible and simple and if we want 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.960
 turn up the volume 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.180
 but that's exactly it's enough 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:21.299
 to remove that part then it's 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:25.500
 very fast in 2 clicks 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.500
 I discovered a big street 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.329
 in this car I also like his roof 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.530
 glazed with a protective flap when 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.670
 there is a lot of sun we can 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.929
 sure open it brings a lot of 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.759
 clarity to the cockpit 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.619
 I really like the touch screen and already there 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.229
 is of a large size and it is 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.920
 very intuitive so quickly we can 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:03.390
 find all the useful functions to the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.909
 navigation useful to comfort so we 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.909
 find everything absolutely easy 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.980
 so we can see a look at the 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.000
 traffic 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.920
 so there all the national 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.180
 surrounding anguished his way where that 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.470
 not roll we can leave on the 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.750
 wide navigation against the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.660
 navigation what I like a lot is 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.209
 the way in which we can follow the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.670
 vehicle is spotted 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.980
 where we want to go very very 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.410
 very very easy so we can decrease 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.420
 of course or enlarge the map 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.520
 So here I am where all the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.170
 the surrounding cities which is good 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.690
 we can move everything 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.870
 in absolutely very easy way we 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.310
 can see our dice discover our 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.310
 situations really it's great 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.210
 and then his driving is very pleasant 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.569
 we are in the seat 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.530
 we envelope 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.600
 doubly sat us 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.790
 so here I drive the equipped model 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.160
 of a mode it is a model hdi which is 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.760
 equipped with a 115- day engine and 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.959
 can know 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.959
 there is a good acceleration 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.660
 of course as everything is still there from 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.920
 novelties is excellent 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.560
 means it's a pleasure to 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.120
 drive this car 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.430
 as well on the roads 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.430
 departmental roads on highways 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.660
 so the driver at hand he 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.260
 has all the orders for them 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.530
 his comfort and our order useful to 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.530
 the driving 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.870
 there we can approach with confidence 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.350
 the turns even the tightest 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.350
 or crooked 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.979
 the 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.590
 that's what's good so the crossover 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.560
 midnight with his wardrobe of 16 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.380
 cents and gets out of the way 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.350
 to engage in 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:16.640
 cross roads with surfaces 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:20.210
 more or less difficult so there we can 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.340
 engage in different terrains that 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.870
 it's mud that's a lot of 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.350
 dents of hollow there is no problem 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.350
 it goes
