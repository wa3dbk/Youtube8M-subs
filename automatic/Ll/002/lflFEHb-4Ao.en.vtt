discovered on Cydia known as status hug

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.220 
discovered on Cydia known as status hug
too<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.460> what<00:00:09.150> it<00:00:09.240> does<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.630> moves<00:00:10.019> your

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230

volume<00:00:10.650> HUD<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.010> typically<00:00:11.370> appears<00:00:11.790> is

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
volume HUD that typically appears is

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.549 
volume HUD that typically appears is
that<00:00:12.150> annoying<00:00:12.450> ugly<00:00:12.960> square<00:00:13.259> in<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.410> middle

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
that annoying ugly square in the middle

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.410 
that annoying ugly square in the middle
of<00:00:13.769> your<00:00:13.950> screen<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.700> your<00:00:14.820> status<00:00:15.179> bar

of your screen to your status bar

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.510 
of your screen to your status bar
instead<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.470> you'll<00:00:16.619> notice<00:00:16.770> when<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.130> adjust

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
instead so you'll notice when I adjust

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.790 
instead so you'll notice when I adjust
my<00:00:17.580> valium<00:00:18.060> now<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.420> no<00:00:18.480> longer<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.260> ugly

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
my valium now I no longer have that ugly

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.650 
my valium now I no longer have that ugly
volume<00:00:20.250> hood<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.730> would<00:00:20.939> typically<00:00:21.330> appear

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
volume hood that would typically appear

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.240 
volume hood that would typically appear
in<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.810> middle<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.109> my<00:00:22.170> screen<00:00:22.320> taking<00:00:23.070> away

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
in the middle of my screen taking away

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.250 
in the middle of my screen taking away
from<00:00:23.430> anything<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.029> I'm<00:00:24.269> looking<00:00:24.570> at<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.900> now

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
from anything that I'm looking at it now

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.679 
from anything that I'm looking at it now
instead<00:00:25.740> appears<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.279> my<00:00:26.369> status<00:00:26.730> bar<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.180> I

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
instead appears on my status bar and I

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.500 
instead appears on my status bar and I
personally<00:00:28.170> like<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.830> lot<00:00:28.890> better<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:30.480> me

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
personally like this a lot better to me

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.020 
personally like this a lot better to me
it<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:30.869> provides<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.619> very<00:00:32.099> clean<00:00:32.399> experience

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it just provides a very clean experience

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.220 
it just provides a very clean experience
when<00:00:33.270> you're<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:33.690> adjusting<00:00:34.140> your

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
when you're going to be adjusting your

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.229 
when you're going to be adjusting your
volume<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.710> your<00:00:34.739> device<00:00:35.190> especially<00:00:35.940> if

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
volume on your device especially if

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.639 
volume on your device especially if
you're<00:00:36.329> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.600> watching<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.989> video<00:00:37.170> or

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
you're going to be watching a video or

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.170 
you're going to be watching a video or
even<00:00:37.800> viewing<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.250> picture<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.760> something<00:00:38.940> like

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
even viewing a picture of something like

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.729 
even viewing a picture of something like
that<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.600> doesn't<00:00:39.629> take<00:00:40.020> away<00:00:40.140> from<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.559> by

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
that it doesn't take away from it by

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.830 
that it doesn't take away from it by
covering<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:41.820> now<00:00:42.420> there<00:00:42.629> are<00:00:42.809> some

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
covering it up now there are some

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.479 
covering it up now there are some
options<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.590> configure<00:00:43.770> from<00:00:44.190> within

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
options to configure from within

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.520 
options to configure from within
settings<00:00:44.760> such<00:00:45.210> as<00:00:45.239> turning<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.930> tweak<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.379> or

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
settings such as turning the tweak on or

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.470 
settings such as turning the tweak on or
off<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.700> option<00:00:47.910> there<00:00:48.300> as

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
off so you do have that option there as

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.389 
off so you do have that option there as
well<00:00:48.989> as<00:00:49.110> adjusting<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> styles<00:00:50.160> so

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
well as adjusting the styles so

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.040 
well as adjusting the styles so
currently<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.969> icons<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.600> appear<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:52.020> here

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
currently the icons that appear up here

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.170 
currently the icons that appear up here
are<00:00:52.320> circles<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:52.890> i<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.280> adjust<00:00:53.460> those<00:00:53.910> so

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
are circles but i can adjust those so

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.299 
are circles but i can adjust those so
that<00:00:54.210> they<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.539> squares<00:00:55.110> instead<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:56.190> we're

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
that they are squares instead so we're

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.049 
that they are squares instead so we're
going<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.489> take<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.699> look<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:59.059> it

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
going to take a look at that and it

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.849 
going to take a look at that and it
might<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.600> hard<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> tell<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.590> let<00:01:01.739> me

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
might be a little hard to tell so let me

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.009 
might be a little hard to tell so let me
zoom<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.640> option<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:03.989> have

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
zoom in for this option so here we have

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.330 
zoom in for this option so here we have
the<00:01:04.379> squares<00:01:04.880> and<00:01:06.590> hopefully<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.979> well

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the squares and hopefully this is well

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.690 
the squares and hopefully this is well
enough<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.790> focused<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.840> and

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
enough and focused for all of you and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.250 
enough and focused for all of you and
then<00:01:11.700> I'm<00:01:11.820> going<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.060> change<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.570> style<00:01:12.869> to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
then I'm going to change the style to

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:27.340 
then I'm going to change the style to
circles<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:17.900> there<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.710> circles

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.560 

another<00:01:28.189> option<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.729> have<00:01:28.760> is<00:01:28.970> also<00:01:29.360> to

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
another option you have is also to

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.719 
another option you have is also to
adjust<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.200> size<00:01:30.439> of<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.070> icons<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:31.670> appear

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
adjust the size of the icons that appear

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.850 
adjust the size of the icons that appear
up<00:01:32.060> there<00:01:32.299> someone<00:01:32.689> make<00:01:32.810> months<00:01:33.170> larger<00:01:33.680> and

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
up there someone make months larger and

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.390 
up there someone make months larger and
then<00:01:34.280> adjust<00:01:34.610> my<00:01:34.790> volume<00:01:35.060> here<00:01:36.190> so<00:01:37.190> you'll

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
then adjust my volume here so you'll

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.430 
then adjust my volume here so you'll
notice<00:01:37.759> hopefully<00:01:38.390> that<00:01:38.570> they<00:01:38.750> are<00:01:38.960> slightly

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
notice hopefully that they are slightly

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.429 
notice hopefully that they are slightly
bigger<00:01:39.770> than<00:01:39.920> they<00:01:40.130> were<00:01:40.190> before<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:42.290> can

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
bigger than they were before and you can

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.999 
bigger than they were before and you can
also<00:01:42.759> have<00:01:43.759> dismissed<00:01:44.299> delay<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:45.680> can<00:01:45.860> make

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
also have dismissed delay you can make

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.240 
also have dismissed delay you can make
it<00:01:46.159> very<00:01:46.190> slow<00:01:46.759> so<00:01:47.570> that<00:01:47.600> when<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.649> finish

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
it very slow so that when you finish

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.609 
it very slow so that when you finish
turning<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.640> volume<00:01:49.789> up<00:01:50.000> or<00:01:50.299> down<00:01:50.509> it<00:01:50.810> takes<00:01:51.259> a

while before it clears out of your
status<00:01:53.210> bar<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:54.399> those<00:01:55.399> are<00:01:55.549> really<00:01:55.759> all<00:01:56.000> of

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
status bar and those are really all of

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.880 
status bar and those are really all of
the<00:01:56.299> options<00:01:56.450> that<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:56.990> have<00:01:57.020> for<00:01:57.380> status<00:01:57.710> ID

too<00:01:58.159> but<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.670> personally<00:01:59.180> think<00:01:59.299> it's<00:01:59.509> one<00:01:59.750> that

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
too but I personally think it's one that

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.480 
too but I personally think it's one that
everyone<00:02:00.350> should<00:02:00.619> have<00:02:00.770> on<00:02:00.920> their<00:02:01.069> I<00:02:01.100> device

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
everyone should have on their I device

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.999 
everyone should have on their I device
and<00:02:01.729> one<00:02:02.149> of<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.450> best<00:02:02.869> parts<00:02:03.170> about<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:03.560> is<00:02:03.679> it

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009
