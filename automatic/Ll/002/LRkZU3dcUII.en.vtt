they've done away with the DVD drive on

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.249 
they've done away with the DVD drive on
this<00:01:34.759> morning<00:01:35.119> but<00:01:35.569> will<00:01:35.719> they<00:01:35.810> haven't<00:01:36.140> done

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
this morning but will they haven't done

this morning but will they haven't done
away<00:01:36.469> with<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.189> needs<00:01:37.369> legendary<00:01:37.969> build

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:38.209 
away with it so needs legendary build

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:40.749 
away with it so needs legendary build
quality<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.289> you'll<00:01:39.799> notice<00:01:40.189> that<00:01:40.399> it

quality so you'll notice that it

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.819 
quality so you'll notice that it
continues<00:01:41.209> to<00:01:41.329> have<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.840> isolation<00:01:42.530> design

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
continues to have the isolation design

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.499 
continues to have the isolation design
and<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.069> keyboard<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:43.670> makes<00:01:43.879> typing<00:01:44.239> a
