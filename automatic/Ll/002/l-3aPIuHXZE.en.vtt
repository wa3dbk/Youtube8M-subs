00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.400
 is always oriented along the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.119
 submission of the client 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.920
 one of them was ludwig schaffrath 65 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.810
 For years he left the vast majority 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.189
 part of his glass paintings in the Licher 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.380

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.469
 who also saw his calling in it 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.840
 not only work as an artist but 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.890
 also as a teacher to the people stained glass 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.930
 to convey 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.210
 that was very important for apprentice 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.300
 maximilian lengersdorff has stravs 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.070
 Glass art is of great importance 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.670
 namely an exemplary function for his 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.670
 join piece 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.590
 who originally came from the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.970
 world-famous glass artist ludwig 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.770
 schaffrath and this object have 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.240
 I bought myself because I like this art of 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.280
 This man is also very inspiring 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.470
 the german stained glass museum has become 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.689
 be inspired by schwaz werk and 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.549
 the artist now also a whole 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.329
 Exhibition in the halls of the former 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.220
 mill dedicated to the witnesses in this 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.260
 exhibition the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.330
 is really schaffrath universe in 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.570
 glass to be a cross section through 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.920
 entire glass of picturesque servers and 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.980
 Of course, there are some points of emphasis 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.040
 and an undeniable focus is 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.230
 the presentation of his late work with 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.160
 The swan song is swan song 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.290
 a 30-piece work before that 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.840
 never been so completely exhibited and 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.050
 So we have the great luck that we 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.220
 So 27 of these 30 work show here 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:09.630
 can schwaz conclusion work originated 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.790
 from 2002 until his death in 2011 in the 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.220
 the artist has parts of the series 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.020
 show how his life works 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.450
 his pictures refer to people who 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.070
 important to him but were also regional 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.830
 allusions like dealing with 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.930
 fossils and the motive coal 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.490
 make clear 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.260
 but not only in the Linnicher Museum, too 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.090
 in the vicinity you will find yourself 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.720
 numerous works of the glass painter 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.680
 Schaffrath is actually omnipresent 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.239
 above all things here in the 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.510
 regional space he is coming out 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.970
 Alsdorf had his studio there but 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.820
 his works can be found in japan as well 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.070
 or in other countries so it is too 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.610
 nationally known just by his 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:54.720
 international teaching activity but you 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.820
 so churches in his 260 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.070
 can actually find work 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.550
 she follows sheepfath on step and 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.170
 occurs 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.830
 if you are here for example in the 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.650
 aachener raum move as one of the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.000
 first artist of the postwar period 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.510
 Schaffrath is oriented towards modern ones 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.549
 clear lines the implementation of his 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.459
 He always has very precise concepts 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.459
 so also in the teaching workshop 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.879
 a very good artist known the very 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.360
 has stayed working different 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.110
 as cultures on glass the excessive culture 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.330
 able to see 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.180
 he has always been very correct 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.819
 he wanted to do the work 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.280
 always know exactly that it runs from 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.959
 Brian always with each other 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.120
 So there were no jumps from 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.989
 to walk a lead and always correct 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.299
 throughout for stefan othman lies in 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.450
 the clear structure in Schwaz also works 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:58.030
 create his charm made architecture 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.560
 related stained glass presented the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.299
 architecture of the building in the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.329
 foreground she did not try 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:07.599
 destroy but even tried 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:10.900
 to improve through his stained glass 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.670
 just to strengthen certain structures 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.450
 that was very good because 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.519
 I from the training of 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.669
 self-contained and also very good 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.139
 can understand 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.910
 even today are still pictures from the 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.580
 feather of the artist in stained glass 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.070
