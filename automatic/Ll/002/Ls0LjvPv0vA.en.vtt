this circumstance really so anyway so
this<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.240> major<00:02:25.720> one<00:02:26.080> which<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.950> would

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
this is the major one which I would

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.520 
this is the major one which I would
suggest<00:02:27.580> doing<00:02:27.880> learning<00:02:28.510> all<00:02:28.780> these<00:02:28.960> in<00:02:29.380> all

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
suggest doing learning all these in all

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.720 
suggest doing learning all these in all
the<00:02:29.680> different<00:02:29.950> modes<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.280> all<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.460> way<00:02:30.550> down

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
the different modes and all the way down

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.020 
the different modes and all the way down
the<00:02:30.940> neck<00:02:31.090> because<00:02:31.450> in<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.170> song<00:02:32.410> I

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
the neck because in the song I

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.180 
the neck because in the song I
harmonized<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.270> so<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:34.870> had<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.290> learn<00:02:35.590> other

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
harmonized it so I had to learn other

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.600 
harmonized it so I had to learn other
shapes<00:02:36.550> down<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.300> neck<00:02:37.510> or<00:02:38.070> up<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.250> neck<00:02:39.430> so

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
shapes down the neck or up the neck so

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.520 
shapes down the neck or up the neck so
then<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:39.820> could<00:02:40.000> harmonize<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:41.230> anyways

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
then I could harmonize it so anyways

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.140 
then I could harmonize it so anyways
this<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.160> major<00:02:42.340> one<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.820> I'll<00:02:42.970> break<00:02:43.090> it

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
this is the major one and I'll break it

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.800 
this is the major one and I'll break it
down

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.970 

a<00:02:51.520> 71<00:02:52.520> so<00:02:53.480> its<00:02:53.660> up<00:02:53.840> one<00:02:54.140> three<00:02:54.349> five<00:02:54.500> seven<00:02:54.709> one

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
a 71 so its up one three five seven one

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:03.150 
a 71 so its up one three five seven one
three<00:02:55.010> five<00:02:55.310> seven<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:55.959> two<00:02:56.959> octaves<00:02:57.380> so<00:02:57.650> it's

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.410 

one<00:03:04.160> thing<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.430> when<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:04.940> was<00:03:05.060> trying<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.330> learn

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
one thing I when I was trying to learn

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.600 
one thing I when I was trying to learn
this<00:03:05.599> is<00:03:05.780> pretty<00:03:06.080> it's<00:03:06.980> pretty<00:03:07.010> difficult<00:03:07.310> for

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
this is pretty it's pretty difficult for

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.520 
this is pretty it's pretty difficult for
me<00:03:07.700> at<00:03:07.819> first<00:03:08.030> because<00:03:08.450> I<00:03:08.870> knew<00:03:09.019> how<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.200> do<00:03:09.410> it

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
me at first because I knew how to do it

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.620 
me at first because I knew how to do it
all<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.709> way<00:03:09.860> up<00:03:10.069> just<00:03:10.910> going<00:03:11.180> down<00:03:11.390> was

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
all the way up just going down was

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.949 
all the way up just going down was
really<00:03:11.840> hard<00:03:12.050> for<00:03:12.110> me<00:03:13.450> that's<00:03:14.450> what<00:03:14.569> she<00:03:14.599> said

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
really hard for me that's what she said

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.449 
really hard for me that's what she said
um<00:03:16.239> so<00:03:17.239> anyway<00:03:17.360> so<00:03:17.599> going<00:03:18.200> up<00:03:18.410> I<00:03:18.950> practiced

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
um so anyway so going up I practiced

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:31.150 
um so anyway so going up I practiced
just<00:03:19.670> going<00:03:19.940> up<00:03:20.090> once

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.430 

so<00:03:31.820> anyways<00:03:32.360> another<00:03:32.630> thing<00:03:32.810> too<00:03:32.990> is<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:33.260> want

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
so anyways another thing too is you want

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.310 
so anyways another thing too is you want
to<00:03:33.530> mute<00:03:33.740> the<00:03:33.830> strings<00:03:34.250> with<00:03:34.400> kind<00:03:34.610> of<00:03:34.670> the

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
to mute the strings with kind of the

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.810 
to mute the strings with kind of the
bottom<00:03:36.320> half<00:03:36.500> at<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.040> bottom<00:03:37.190> part<00:03:37.610> of<00:03:37.700> your

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
bottom half at the bottom part of your

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.390 
bottom half at the bottom part of your
hand<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.300> as<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.350> go<00:03:39.500> up<00:03:39.530> because<00:03:39.860> they're

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
hand and as you go up because they're

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.620 
hand and as you go up because they're
going<00:03:40.490> to<00:03:40.580> start<00:03:40.760> ringing<00:03:41.090> when<00:03:41.270> you<00:03:41.360> pull<00:03:41.600> off

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
going to start ringing when you pull off

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.350 
going to start ringing when you pull off
naturally<00:03:42.560> with<00:03:42.800> your<00:03:43.010> with<00:03:43.640> your<00:03:43.670> finger<00:03:44.120> on

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.820 

 up<00:04:03.629> but<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.870> can<00:04:04.019> go<00:04:04.140> really<00:04:04.319> fast<00:04:04.620> of

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
 up but you can go really fast of

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.839 
 up but you can go really fast of
it<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:06.000> it's<00:04:06.540> really<00:04:06.900> cool<00:04:07.370> here's<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.430> minor

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
it so it's really cool here's a minor

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.940 
it so it's really cool here's a minor
one<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.569> it's<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.720> same<00:04:09.930> idea<00:04:10.290> one<00:04:10.620> three<00:04:10.769> five

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
one so it's the same idea one three five

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.699 
one so it's the same idea one three five
seven<00:04:11.190> one<00:04:11.489> three<00:04:11.519> five<00:04:11.819> seven<00:04:15.199> five<00:04:16.199> seven

one

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:43.409 

here's<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.220> diminished

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.869 

also<00:04:44.419> what<00:04:44.569> I'm<00:04:44.689> incorporating<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.409> is<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.919> is

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
also what I'm incorporating it is the is

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:50.379 
also what I'm incorporating it is the is
a<00:04:47.569> sequence<00:04:48.110> on<00:04:48.259> the<00:04:48.349> second<00:04:48.849> time<00:04:49.849> around<00:04:49.879> in

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
a sequence on the second time around in

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.329 
a sequence on the second time around in
the<00:04:50.749> minor<00:04:50.990> one<00:04:51.259> and<00:04:51.499> it<00:04:51.979> didn't<00:04:52.189> go<00:04:52.279> to

00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:52.339 
the minor one and it didn't go to

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:55.029 
the minor one and it didn't go to
admission<00:04:52.819> diminished<00:04:53.809> just<00:04:54.589> to<00:04:54.710> make<00:04:54.860> it<00:04:54.889> a

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
admission diminished just to make it a

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.739 
admission diminished just to make it a
little<00:04:55.159> bit<00:04:55.309> different<00:04:55.699> and<00:04:55.849> added<00:04:56.719> some

00:04:56.739 --> 00:04:56.749 
little bit different and added some

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:59.439 
little bit different and added some
extra<00:04:56.930> notes<00:04:57.819> which<00:04:58.819> would<00:04:58.999> have<00:04:59.059> been<00:04:59.120> the

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
extra notes which would have been the

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.969 
extra notes which would have been the
second<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.020> third<00:05:00.050> at<00:05:00.529> the<00:05:00.680> very<00:05:00.860> top<00:05:01.360> so

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
second and third at the very top so

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.260 
second and third at the very top so
anyway<00:05:03.979> so<00:05:04.039> here's<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.669> sequence<00:05:04.969> that<00:05:05.210> I

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
anyway so here's the sequence that I

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.999 
anyway so here's the sequence that I
have<00:05:05.449> it<00:05:05.599> in<00:05:05.719> the<00:05:05.930> second<00:05:06.199> term<00:05:06.289> arm<00:05:06.589> so<00:05:06.860> I'll

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
have it in the second term arm so I'll

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.950 
have it in the second term arm so I'll
play<00:05:07.219> the<00:05:07.339> whole<00:05:07.490> second<00:05:08.270> sequence<00:05:08.599> so<00:05:08.809> then

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
play the whole second sequence so then

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:18.869 
play the whole second sequence so then
yeah<00:05:09.559> you<00:05:09.860> can<00:05:10.009> see<00:05:10.129> how<00:05:10.249> it<00:05:10.279> flows<00:05:10.610> so
