00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.960
 good 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.960
 both teams own what is called frontline 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.209
 left 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.309
 coulson it's over 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.309
 the pair 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.810
 but the monthly programming m the majority 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.939
 if you know that's all under the guns 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.160
 we want to do to declare that this inhabitant it is clear that they 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.860
 want thirty years 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.970
 this leather part 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.280
 it turns out that 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.990
 kif-kif make the hole 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.990
 he even left that a good blood tightness 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.810
 without that, do not teach anything 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.690
 this little what the fingers thought 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.750
 about the army here because I understand you thank you for your encouragement 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.010
 and more 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.420
 it may be too big to be able to touch them with your neighbor 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.610
 we all have their minds they serve despite everything 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.730
 if all the saxophones they added 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.110
 a few more serious records for what is unfounded 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.910
 access 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.890
 but that of his little finger 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.890
 which brings us notes are rarer 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.170
 after 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.980
 in this sense there are very hard-hitting press that 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.750
 drunk and the holes in the seeds are locked in the at the exit of 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.750
 purpose his shot be cultural 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.770
 while they 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.810
 respect for his client 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.240
 a little bit everywhere insurance to the world the rise is open 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.430
 no me 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.910
 to do this 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.870
 but here too 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.190
 small support for the races 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.280
 who pays the crtc surely wishes 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.780

 below 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.799

 objectify the stronger lath 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.549
 we have a little relationship with the two most famous actors 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.789
 and fingers on the screen 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:24.589
 ap why not 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:25.529
 in the world 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.529
 for memory 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:31.979
