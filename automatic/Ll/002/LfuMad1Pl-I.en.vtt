it can be used at close range it can be

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.639 
it can be used at close range it can be
used<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.489> long<00:00:35.640> range<00:00:36.230> it's<00:00:37.230> effective<00:00:37.559> when

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
used a long range it's effective when

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.319 
used a long range it's effective when
fired<00:00:37.829> from<00:00:37.920> cover<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.940> when<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.210> on

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
fired from cover and so when it's so on

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.450 
fired from cover and so when it's so on
it<00:00:39.450> does<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> lot<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.930> damage<00:00:40.200> very<00:00:40.710> very<00:00:41.190> high

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
it does a lot of damage very very high

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.360 
it does a lot of damage very very high
damage<00:00:41.930> sniper<00:00:42.930> rifle<00:00:43.350> level<00:00:43.680> damage<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.219> let

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
damage sniper rifle level damage but let

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.360 
damage sniper rifle level damage but let
us<00:00:44.399> talk<00:00:44.640> about<00:00:44.670> mods<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.950> mean<00:00:46.950> again<00:00:47.160> you

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
us talk about mods I mean again you

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.650 
us talk about mods I mean again you
might<00:00:47.460> be<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> realm<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.879> overkill<00:00:48.329> if<00:00:48.539> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
might be in the realm of overkill if you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.299 
might be in the realm of overkill if you
use<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.289> high<00:00:49.500> caliber<00:00:49.829> barrel<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.250> if

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
use the high caliber barrel but if

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.619 
use the high caliber barrel but if
you're<00:00:50.399> using<00:00:50.520> against<00:00:50.879> an<00:00:50.969> armored<00:00:51.300> opponent

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
you're using against an armored opponent

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.450 
you're using against an armored opponent
like<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> brute<00:00:52.050> or<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.920> know<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> armored

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
like a brute or you know the armored

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.010 
like a brute or you know the armored
portion<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.329> shield<00:00:54.480> portion<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
portion or just a shield portion of a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.299 
portion or just a shield portion of a
banshee<00:00:55.170> or<00:00:55.379> whatever<00:00:55.620> more<00:00:55.949> damage<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
banshee or whatever more damage the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.290 
banshee or whatever more damage the
merrier<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.879> can't<00:00:57.030> really<00:00:57.059> go<00:00:57.270> wrong

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
merrier so you can't really go wrong

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.529 
merrier so you can't really go wrong
with<00:00:57.719> damage<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.199> mean<00:00:58.410> overkill<00:00:58.859> yeah<00:00:59.489> but<00:01:00.210> man

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
with damage I mean overkill yeah but man

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.869 
with damage I mean overkill yeah but man
anyway<00:01:01.170> choke<00:01:01.739> choke<00:01:02.160> actually<00:01:02.579> believes<00:01:02.789> it

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
anyway choke choke actually believes it

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.189 
anyway choke choke actually believes it
worthwhile<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.449> weapon<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.870> already

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
worthwhile for this weapon it's already

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.719 
worthwhile for this weapon it's already
so<00:01:04.559> accurate<00:01:05.010> when<00:01:05.100> fired<00:01:05.309> down<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.519> side

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
so accurate when fired down the side

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.000 
so accurate when fired down the side
seaming<00:01:05.939> at<00:01:06.030> long<00:01:06.210> ranges<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.860> fight<00:01:07.860> from

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
seaming at long ranges and fight from

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.080 
seaming at long ranges and fight from
cover<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.490> know<00:01:08.580> improves<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.909> even

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
cover you know improves that even

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
cover you know improves that even
further<00:01:09.240> not<00:01:09.780> really<00:01:09.960> necessary<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:11.010> might

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
further not really necessary you might

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.670 
further not really necessary you might
it<00:01:11.909> improves<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.659> doesn't<00:01:12.869> prove<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.290> by<00:01:13.650> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
it improves it it doesn't prove it by a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.999 
it improves it it doesn't prove it by a
little<00:01:13.979> bit<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:14.670> even<00:01:15.600> at<00:01:15.689> long<00:01:15.960> range<00:01:16.350> you

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
little bit but even at long range you

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.800 
little bit but even at long range you
can<00:01:17.280> easily<00:01:17.549> get<00:01:17.909> all<00:01:18.090> shots<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.450> target<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:18.720> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
can easily get all shots on target for a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.270 
can easily get all shots on target for a
body<00:01:18.990> shot<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.470> might<00:01:19.560> improve<00:01:19.799> its<00:01:19.979> damage<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
body shot and might improve its damage a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.399 
body shot and might improve its damage a
bit<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.970> headshots<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.869> weapon<00:01:22.200> isn't

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
bit for headshots but this weapon isn't

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.810 
bit for headshots but this weapon isn't
really<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.920> by<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.280> way<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.490> shoots<00:01:23.670> out<00:01:23.759> I

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
really it by the way it shoots out I

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.730 
really it by the way it shoots out I
think<00:01:23.939> six<00:01:24.299> spikes<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.810> not<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.110> even

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
think six spikes it's not really even

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.679 
think six spikes it's not really even
designed<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.670> every<00:01:26.939> single<00:01:27.119> spike<00:01:27.479> hit

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
designed to have every single spike hit

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.420 
designed to have every single spike hit
each<00:01:27.869> spike<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:28.770> much<00:01:28.920> damage<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.369> even

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
each spike just so much damage and even

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.429 
each spike just so much damage and even
if<00:01:29.640> three<00:01:30.000> spikes<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> headshot<00:01:30.990> you're

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
if three spikes in on a headshot you're

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.050 
if three spikes in on a headshot you're
going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.619> generally<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.340> shot<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> opponent

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
going to generally one shot the opponent

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.819 
going to generally one shot the opponent
so<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.390> try<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> choke<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.380> personally<00:01:34.770> I

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
so you can try a choke but personally I

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.460 
so you can try a choke but personally I
don't<00:01:34.950> feel<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.340> worthwhile<00:01:36.049> go<00:01:37.049> with<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
don't feel it's worthwhile go with the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.780 
don't feel it's worthwhile go with the
plate<00:01:37.680> attachment<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.340> want<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.670> you're

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
plate attachment if you want if you're

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.359 
plate attachment if you want if you're
into<00:01:39.000> melee<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.799> piercing<00:01:40.799> much<00:01:40.920> redder<00:01:41.189> mod

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
into melee and piercing much redder mod

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.830 
into melee and piercing much redder mod
I<00:01:41.670> mean<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.180> help<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.479> punch<00:01:42.689> through

Guardian<00:01:43.140> shields<00:01:43.470> Guardian<00:01:43.740> shields<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.130> be

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
Guardian shields Guardian shields can be

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.469 
Guardian shields Guardian shields can be
a<00:01:44.220> little<00:01:44.399> problematic<00:01:44.549> for<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.090> weapon<00:01:45.390> it

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
a little problematic for this weapon it

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.700 
a little problematic for this weapon it
doesn't<00:01:45.720> innately<00:01:45.930> pierce<00:01:46.259> them<00:01:46.439> or<00:01:46.530> anything

doesn't innately pierce them or anything

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.280 
doesn't innately pierce them or anything
but<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.820> necessarily<00:01:48.420> useful<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.079> don't

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
but not necessarily useful and I don't

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.810 
but not necessarily useful and I don't
really<00:01:49.439> think<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.829> useful<00:01:50.040> for<00:01:50.369> firing

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
really think it's useful for firing

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.950 
really think it's useful for firing
through<00:01:51.090> cover<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.450> doesn't<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> lot<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
through cover it doesn't have a lot of

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.210 
through cover it doesn't have a lot of
shots<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.470> its<00:01:52.560> really<00:01:52.710> wasting<00:01:53.159> this

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
shots and its really wasting this

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.700 
shots and its really wasting this
weapons<00:01:53.549> potential<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.030> my<00:01:54.119> opinion

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
weapons potential in my opinion

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.780 
weapons potential in my opinion
definitely<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.829> go<00:01:55.950> with<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> spare<00:01:56.460> thermal

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
definitely we go with a spare thermal

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.999 
definitely we go with a spare thermal
clip<00:01:56.939> though<00:01:57.090> one<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.840> its<00:01:57.960> choose<00:01:58.649> meat<00:01:58.799> main

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
clip though one of its choose meat main

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.730 
clip though one of its choose meat main
limitations<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.759> just<00:02:00.600> its<00:02:00.869> thermal<00:02:01.229> clip<00:02:01.560> and

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
limitations is just its thermal clip and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.950 
limitations is just its thermal clip and
its<00:02:02.250> capacity<00:02:03.350> now<00:02:04.350> i'll<00:02:04.439> be<00:02:04.500> using<00:02:04.649> that

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
its capacity now i'll be using that

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.880 
its capacity now i'll be using that
just<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.260> use<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.500> as<00:02:07.620> much<00:02:07.740> as<00:02:07.770> possible

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
just so I can use it as much as possible

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.350 
just so I can use it as much as possible
so<00:02:08.490> let's<00:02:08.640> get<00:02:08.760> to<00:02:08.820> it<00:02:10.730> one<00:02:11.730> technique<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.120> is

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
so let's get to it one technique that is

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.300 
so let's get to it one technique that is
definitely<00:02:12.840> worthwhile<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.860> charging<00:02:14.220> up

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
definitely worthwhile is charging up

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.210 
definitely worthwhile is charging up
from<00:02:14.430> behind<00:02:14.550> cover<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.570> then<00:02:15.930> firing<00:02:16.230> and

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
from behind cover and then firing and

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.440 
from behind cover and then firing and
generally<00:02:17.550> aiming<00:02:17.790> for<00:02:17.940> headshots<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.420> a

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
generally aiming for headshots it's a

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.900 
generally aiming for headshots it's a
good<00:02:18.570> idea<00:02:19.280> though<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.400> does<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.550> lot<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.730> damage

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
good idea though it does a lot of damage

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:28.130 
good idea though it does a lot of damage
on<00:02:21.090> body<00:02:21.240> shots<00:02:21.330> as<00:02:21.630> well<00:02:26.180> really<00:02:27.180> aiming<00:02:27.810> for

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
on body shots as well really aiming for

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.540 
on body shots as well really aiming for
the<00:02:28.170> mail<00:02:28.320> slot<00:02:28.530> isn't<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.100> good<00:02:29.190> idea<00:02:29.280> with

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
the mail slot isn't a good idea with

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.160 
the mail slot isn't a good idea with
this<00:02:29.610> weapon<00:02:29.790> at<00:02:30.090> least<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.360> very<00:02:30.540> long<00:02:30.750> ranges

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
this weapon at least I very long ranges

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.950 
this weapon at least I very long ranges
it's<00:02:32.070> kind<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.340> waste<00:02:32.460> of<00:02:32.610> animal<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.150> mean<00:02:33.870> as

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
it's kind of a waste of animal I mean as

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.800 
it's kind of a waste of animal I mean as
you<00:02:34.080> see<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.500> hit<00:02:34.860> maybe<00:02:35.070> with<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.640> know<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.450> kit

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
you see I hit maybe with I know I kit

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.750 
you see I hit maybe with I know I kit
but<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.080> guess<00:02:37.230> most<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.620> hit<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.460> armor

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
but I guess most of it hit the the armor

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.170 
but I guess most of it hit the the armor
so<00:02:38.850> I'm<00:02:38.910> not<00:02:39.060> really<00:02:39.240> going<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.480> bother<00:02:41.180> and

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
so I'm not really going to bother and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.150 
so I'm not really going to bother and
just<00:02:43.080> close<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.440> think<00:02:43.650> there's<00:02:43.800> ammo<00:02:44.040> up

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
just close in I think there's ammo up

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:53.690 
just close in I think there's ammo up
here<00:02:44.210> there<00:02:45.210> is<00:02:45.680> thank<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.520> can

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
here there is thank you and you can

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.720 
here there is thank you and you can
charge<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.420> then<00:02:54.660> also<00:02:54.870> use<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.110> power<00:02:58.730> it

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
charge and then also use a power it

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.950 
charge and then also use a power it
won't<00:02:59.940> interrupt<00:03:00.240> your<00:03:00.360> charge<00:03:00.570> so<00:03:00.780> something

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
won't interrupt your charge so something

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:14.380 
won't interrupt your charge so something
to<00:03:01.020> keep<00:03:01.080> in<00:03:01.170> mind

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.680 

and<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.660> can<00:03:15.989> get<00:03:16.940> shots<00:03:17.940> off<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.420> quick

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
and you can get shots off in quick

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.940 
and you can get shots off in quick
succession<00:03:21.860> there<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:23.099> actually<00:03:23.340> oh<00:03:24.709> I<00:03:25.709> might

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
succession there is actually oh I might

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.870 
succession there is actually oh I might
have<00:03:26.040> been<00:03:26.130> able<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.280> pull<00:03:26.400> off<00:03:26.520> there<00:03:26.670> but<00:03:26.790> I

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
have been able to pull off there but I

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.729 
have been able to pull off there but I
to<00:03:26.940> reload<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.959> technique<00:03:28.230> where<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.410> charge

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
to reload the technique where you charge

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.920 
to reload the technique where you charge
like<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.700> charge<00:03:30.239> us<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.450> little<00:03:30.569> bit<00:03:30.720> and

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
like that charge us a little bit and

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.449 
like that charge us a little bit and
then<00:03:31.110> quickly<00:03:31.380> tap<00:03:31.620> again<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:32.220> can<00:03:32.310> get

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
then quickly tap again and you can get

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.550 
then quickly tap again and you can get
two<00:03:32.580> shots<00:03:32.610> off<00:03:32.970> but<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.630> generally<00:03:34.050> tend<00:03:34.260> to

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
two shots off but I generally tend to

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:42.800 
two shots off but I generally tend to
charge<00:03:34.890> up<00:03:35.069> my<00:03:35.100> shots<00:03:41.150> whether<00:03:42.150> then<00:03:42.390> just<00:03:42.720> get
