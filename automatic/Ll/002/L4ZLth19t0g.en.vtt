00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.990 

so<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.439> final<00:00:01.920> experiment<00:00:02.520> that<00:00:02.610> I<00:00:02.639> want<00:00:02.879> to

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
so a final experiment that I want to

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.110 
so a final experiment that I want to
mention<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.449> you<00:00:03.480> is<00:00:03.810> our<00:00:04.350> fairness<00:00:04.920> study<00:00:05.190> and

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
mention to you is our fairness study and

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.540 
mention to you is our fairness study and
so<00:00:06.330> this<00:00:06.540> this<00:00:06.810> became<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.740> very<00:00:07.830> famous<00:00:08.160> study

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
so this this became a very famous study

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.700 
so this this became a very famous study
under<00:00:08.820> snow<00:00:08.970> many<00:00:09.420> more<00:00:09.750> because<00:00:10.110> after<00:00:10.620> we

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
under snow many more because after we

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.009 
under snow many more because after we
did<00:00:10.889> this<00:00:11.010> about<00:00:11.160> 10<00:00:11.460> years<00:00:11.610> ago<00:00:11.750> it<00:00:12.750> became

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
did this about 10 years ago it became

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.169 
did this about 10 years ago it became
very<00:00:13.500> well-known<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.519> we<00:00:14.880> did<00:00:15.059> that

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
very well-known and we did that

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.120 
very well-known and we did that
originally<00:00:15.809> with<00:00:15.929> capuchin<00:00:16.350> monkeys<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.740> I'm

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
originally with capuchin monkeys and I'm

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.830 
originally with capuchin monkeys and I'm
going<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.520> show<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.029> first<00:00:18.270> experiment

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
going to show you the first experiment

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.300 
going to show you the first experiment
that<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.050> did<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.410> has<00:00:19.560> now<00:00:19.740> been<00:00:19.980> done<00:00:20.100> with

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
that we did it has now been done with

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.130 
that we did it has now been done with
dogs<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.090> with<00:00:21.510> birds<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.289> with<00:00:22.949> chimpanzees

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
dogs and with birds and with chimpanzees

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.900 
dogs and with birds and with chimpanzees
but<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:25.500> Sarah<00:00:25.740> Brosnan<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.279> started<00:00:26.640> out<00:00:26.760> with

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
but we Sarah Brosnan we started out with

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.380 
but we Sarah Brosnan we started out with
capuchin<00:00:27.390> monkeys<00:00:28.609> so<00:00:29.609> what<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:29.910> did<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.359> we

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
capuchin monkeys so what we did is we

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.540 
capuchin monkeys so what we did is we
put<00:00:31.019> two<00:00:31.199> capuchin<00:00:31.650> monkeys<00:00:31.980> side-by-side

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
put two capuchin monkeys side-by-side

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.190 
put two capuchin monkeys side-by-side
again<00:00:32.880> these<00:00:33.030> animals<00:00:33.510> they<00:00:33.600> live<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.989> group

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
again these animals they live in a group

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.660 
again these animals they live in a group
they<00:00:34.410> know<00:00:34.530> each<00:00:34.710> other<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.130> take<00:00:35.309> them<00:00:35.430> out<00:00:35.520> of

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
they know each other we take them out of

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.049 
they know each other we take them out of
the<00:00:35.730> group<00:00:35.910> put<00:00:36.059> them<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> test<00:00:36.570> chamber<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
the group put them in a test chamber and

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.340 
the group put them in a test chamber and
there's<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.149> very<00:00:39.270> simple<00:00:39.510> task<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.110> they

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
there's a very simple task that they

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.650 
there's a very simple task that they
need<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.070> if<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.820> give<00:00:42.000> both<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.300> them

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
need to do and if you give both of them

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.440 
need to do and if you give both of them
cucumber<00:00:43.309> for<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> task<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.000> two<00:00:45.120> monkeys

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
cucumber for the task the two monkeys

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.130 
cucumber for the task the two monkeys
side-by-side

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
side-by-side

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.200 
side-by-side
they're<00:00:46.440> perfectly<00:00:46.980> willing<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.730> 25

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
they're perfectly willing to do this 25

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.029 
they're perfectly willing to do this 25
times<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.750> row<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.140> cucumber<00:00:49.680> even<00:00:49.950> though

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
times in a row so cucumber even though

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.760 
times in a row so cucumber even though
it's<00:00:50.190> really<00:00:50.730> only<00:00:51.030> water<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.600> my<00:00:51.840> opinion<00:00:52.289> but

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it's really only water in my opinion but

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.029 
it's really only water in my opinion but
cucumber<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:54.059> perfectly<00:00:54.809> fine<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.110> them<00:00:55.530> now

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
cucumber is perfectly fine for them now

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.910 
cucumber is perfectly fine for them now
if<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.370> give<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.760> partner<00:00:57.210> grapes<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:58.710> food

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
if you give the partner grapes the food

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.319 
if you give the partner grapes the food
preferences<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.520> my<00:00:59.640> capuchin<00:01:00.030> monkeys

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
preferences of my capuchin monkeys

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.180 
preferences of my capuchin monkeys
correspond<00:01:00.840> exactly<00:01:00.930> with<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.620> prices<00:01:02.039> in

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
correspond exactly with the prices in

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.729 
correspond exactly with the prices in
the<00:01:02.219> supermarket<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.530> give<00:01:04.710> them

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the supermarket and so if you give them

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.399 
the supermarket and so if you give them
grapes<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.519> far<00:01:05.700> better<00:01:05.880> food<00:01:06.260> then<00:01:07.260> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
grapes it's a far better food then you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.250 
grapes it's a far better food then you
create<00:01:07.770> inequity<00:01:08.520> between<00:01:08.670> them<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:10.080> that's

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
create inequity between them so that's

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260 
create inequity between them so that's
the<00:01:10.409> experiment<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.979> did<00:01:11.159> recently<00:01:11.880> we

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the experiment we did recently we

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.820 
the experiment we did recently we
videotaped<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.110> no<00:01:13.320> monkeys<00:01:13.680> we've

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
videotaped it with no monkeys we've

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.350 
videotaped it with no monkeys we've
never<00:01:13.950> done<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> task<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.880> thinking<00:01:15.240> that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
never done the task is thinking that

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.340 
never done the task is thinking that
maybe<00:01:15.509> they<00:01:15.720> would<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.990> stronger

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
maybe they would have a stronger

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.899 
maybe they would have a stronger
reaction<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.100> turned<00:01:17.340> out<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.759> right

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
reaction and that turned out to be right

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.539 
reaction and that turned out to be right
the<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> left<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.830> monkey<00:01:20.310> who<00:01:20.369> gets

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the one on the left is a monkey who gets

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.580 
the one on the left is a monkey who gets
cucumber<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.470> one

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
cucumber the one on the right is the one

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.350 
cucumber the one on the right is the one
who<00:01:22.680> gets<00:01:22.860> grapes<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.090> who<00:01:24.180> gets

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
who gets grapes the one who gets

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
who gets grapes the one who gets
cucumber<00:01:24.659> note<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> first<00:01:25.799> piece<00:01:26.070> of

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
cucumber note that the first piece of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.219 
cucumber note that the first piece of
cucumber<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.970> perfectly<00:01:27.570> fine<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.840> first

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
cucumber is perfectly fine the first

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.490 
cucumber is perfectly fine the first
piece<00:01:28.560> he<00:01:28.799> eats<00:01:29.630> then<00:01:30.630> sees<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> other<00:01:31.350> one

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
piece he eats then sees the other one

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.660 
piece he eats then sees the other one
getting<00:01:31.740> grape<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.250> will<00:01:32.400> see<00:01:32.549> what

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
getting grape and you will see what

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.780 
getting grape and you will see what
happens<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.560> she<00:01:34.619> gives<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.040> rock<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.430> us<00:01:35.460> that's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
happens so she gives a rock to us that's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.660 
happens so she gives a rock to us that's
the<00:01:35.939> task<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:37.009> we<00:01:38.009> give<00:01:38.189> her<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.340> piece<00:01:38.549> of

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the task and we give her a piece of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.429 
the task and we give her a piece of
cucumber<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.119> she<00:01:39.329> eats<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.200> other<00:01:40.320> one

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
cucumber and she eats it the other one

needs<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.799> give<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> rock<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.400> us<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.649> that's

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
needs to give a rock to us and that's

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.800 
needs to give a rock to us and that's
what<00:01:43.740> she<00:01:43.920> does<00:01:44.509> and<00:01:45.509> she<00:01:46.049> gets<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.500> grape<00:01:47.810> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
what she does and she gets a grape and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.469 
what she does and she gets a grape and
CETA<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> other<00:01:49.439> one<00:01:49.590> sees<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.180> she<00:01:51.180> gives<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
CETA the other one sees that she gives a

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:12.050 
CETA the other one sees that she gives a
rock<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> us<00:01:51.960> now<00:01:52.200> gets<00:01:52.619> again<00:01:52.890> cucumber

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.449 

she<00:02:13.060> tests<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.600> rock<00:02:13.780> now<00:02:14.160> against<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.250> wall

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
she tests a rock now against the wall

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.390 
she tests a rock now against the wall
she<00:02:15.910> needs<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.180> give<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.510> us

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
she needs to give it to us

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:30.030 
she needs to give it to us
and<00:02:18.400> she<00:02:18.580> gets<00:02:18.760> cucumber<00:02:19.209> again<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:29.740> this<00:02:29.980> is

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
and she gets cucumber again so this is

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.980 
and she gets cucumber again so this is
basically<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.730> Wall<00:02:30.940> Street<00:02:30.970> protest<00:02:31.810> that

philosopher even wrote us that it was

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
other guy I also got agree so we're

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.860 
other guy I also got agree so we're
getting<00:03:30.310> very<00:03:30.549> close<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.150> human<00:03:31.540> sense<00:03:31.720> of

getting very close to the human sense of

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
fairness and I think philosophers need

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.500 
fairness and I think philosophers need
to<00:03:34.030> rethink<00:03:34.360> their<00:03:34.600> philosophy<00:03:35.140> for<00:03:35.320> a<00:03:35.350> while
