00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.529
 after an explanation I will rather show you how to speak 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.980
 the argument 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.839
 bernier hercog 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.930
 I made my choice 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.569
 Nothing is less sure 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.569
 unlike to leave in charge 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.740
 she charged 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.740
 so I chose France 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.720
 you read it say 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.720
 other truck

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.430
 you choose this year 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.430
 to extend it to follow it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.290
 how I called it overbought 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.590
 So here I remember my part and I learned it 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.500

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.850
 so we have 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.100
 so 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.260
 a night document 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.890
 with a double click 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.890
 then 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.309
 but the other complaining 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.719

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.719

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.709
 with notepad 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.689
 the text 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.999
 still a pair of dead pants they are devoted to the polls 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:44.849
