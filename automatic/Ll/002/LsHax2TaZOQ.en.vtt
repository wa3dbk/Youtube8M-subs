on some other attributes he also checked

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.880 
on some other attributes he also checked
for<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.300> presence<00:02:55.390> of<00:02:55.900> fat<00:02:56.290> which<00:02:56.710> would

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
for the presence of fat which would

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.590 
for the presence of fat which would
indicate<00:02:57.100> that<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.700> bird<00:02:57.880> is<00:02:58.030> preparing<00:02:58.510> to
