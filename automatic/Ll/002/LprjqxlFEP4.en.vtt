welcome to a luck craft video about
maintenance<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.270> latex<00:00:15.750> weapons<00:00:16.400> you're

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
maintenance of latex weapons you're

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.600 
maintenance of latex weapons you're
supposed<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.910> do<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.740> silicone<00:00:19.740> base<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
supposed to do a silicone base on the

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.330 
supposed to do a silicone base on the
latex<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.270> keep<00:00:21.450> it<00:00:21.660> pliable<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.380> keep<00:00:23.220> it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
latex to keep it pliable and keep it

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.519 
latex to keep it pliable and keep it
from<00:00:23.430> drying<00:00:23.580> out<00:00:23.900> latex<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.140> natural

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
from drying out latex is a natural

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.830 
from drying out latex is a natural
rubber<00:00:25.770> so<00:00:26.310> it's<00:00:27.029> one<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.270> the<00:00:27.330> products<00:00:27.780> you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
rubber so it's one of the products you

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.700 
rubber so it's one of the products you
can<00:00:28.020> use<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.440> this<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:30.710> manufacturers

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
can use to do this the manufacturers

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.710 
can use to do this the manufacturers
like<00:00:32.340> epic<00:00:32.640> armory<00:00:32.970> and<00:00:33.059> such<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.420> their<00:00:33.600> own

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
like epic armory and such have their own

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.619 
like epic armory and such have their own
silicone<00:00:34.129> which<00:00:35.129> they<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.370> here<00:00:35.879> if<00:00:36.449> you<00:00:36.540> look

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
silicone which they do here if you look

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.600 
silicone which they do here if you look
at<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> ingredients<00:00:37.350> though<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.010> 100%

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
at the ingredients though it's just 100%

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.549 
at the ingredients though it's just 100%
silicone<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.449> you<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.720> very<00:00:39.900> easily<00:00:39.960> pick<00:00:40.440> up

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
silicone but you can very easily pick up

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.910 
silicone but you can very easily pick up
at<00:00:40.710> any<00:00:40.980> box<00:00:41.550> store<00:00:42.380> you<00:00:43.380> just<00:00:43.590> got<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.829> make

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
at any box store you just got to make

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.549 
at any box store you just got to make
sure<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.130> there's<00:00:44.460> no<00:00:44.579> acid<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:46.820> in<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
sure that there's no acid in the in the

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.620 
sure that there's no acid in the in the
silicone<00:00:49.559> formula<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:50.850> 100%<00:00:51.180> silicone

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
silicone formula that it's 100% silicone

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.319 
silicone formula that it's 100% silicone
and<00:00:52.520> one<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.700> things<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.000> want<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> make

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
and one of the things you want to make

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.680 
and one of the things you want to make
sure<00:00:54.450> of<00:00:54.630> is<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:56.040> you<00:00:56.969> know<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.540> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
sure of is that it you know that the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.790 
sure of is that it you know that the
propellant<00:00:58.260> will<00:00:58.559> also<00:00:58.980> not<00:00:59.219> wreck<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.800> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
propellant will also not wreck the the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.979 
propellant will also not wreck the the
latex<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.370> propellant<00:01:02.879> cannot<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.539> an<00:01:03.629> acid

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
latex the propellant cannot be an acid

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.070 
latex the propellant cannot be an acid
propellant<00:01:04.410> most<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.800> them<00:01:04.890> are<00:01:05.100> definitely

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
propellant most of them are definitely

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.950 
propellant most of them are definitely
co2<00:01:07.430> that's<00:01:08.430> what<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.700> get<00:01:08.910> pretty<00:01:09.810> much

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
co2 that's what you get pretty much

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.740 
co2 that's what you get pretty much
everything<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.710> we've<00:01:11.039> ever<00:01:11.220> seen<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:12.450> this

everything that we've ever seen but this

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.120 
everything that we've ever seen but this
is<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.080> three<00:01:13.410> or<00:01:13.500> four<00:01:13.530> bucks<00:01:13.890> at<00:01:14.100> a

is like three or four bucks at a
hardware<00:01:14.369> store<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.509> had<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> large<00:01:16.020> store

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
hardware store this had a large store

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:17.480 
hardware store this had a large store
you<00:01:16.500> might<00:01:16.619> pay<00:01:16.800> upwards<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.160> twenty<00:01:17.459> dollars

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you might pay upwards of twenty dollars

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.870 
you might pay upwards of twenty dollars
maybe<00:01:18.000> fifteen<00:01:18.810> bucks<00:01:19.160> but<00:01:20.160> essentially

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
maybe fifteen bucks but essentially

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.740 
maybe fifteen bucks but essentially
they're<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> same<00:01:21.270> thing

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
they're the same thing

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.580 
they're the same thing
and<00:01:22.259> we've<00:01:22.350> been<00:01:22.470> using<00:01:22.500> them<00:01:22.800> both<00:01:23.009> for<00:01:23.310> years

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
and we've been using them both for years

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.070 
and we've been using them both for years
this<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.800> a<00:01:25.830> table<00:01:26.670> talkie<00:01:27.060> blade<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.569> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
this is a table talkie blade on the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.930 
this is a table talkie blade on the
latex<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.830> is<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.340> good<00:01:29.459> shape<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:29.819> it's

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
latex here is in good shape because it's

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.690 
latex here is in good shape because it's
brand<00:01:30.149> new<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:31.080> we<00:01:31.410> just<00:01:31.590> simply<00:01:32.190> take<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.399> rag

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
brand new so we just simply take a rag

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.859 
brand new so we just simply take a rag
and<00:01:33.020> we<00:01:34.020> apply<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.950> silicone<00:01:35.399> to<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and we apply the silicone to the the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.440 
and we apply the silicone to the the
weapon<00:01:37.200> take<00:01:37.979> care<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.729> suede<00:01:39.060> handle

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
weapon take care with the suede handle

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.050 
weapon take care with the suede handle

grips formal setting manufacturer that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.020 
grips formal setting manufacturer that
you<00:01:42.929> don't<00:01:43.110> overly<00:01:43.679> get<00:01:43.950> too<00:01:44.399> much<00:01:44.550> silicone

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
you don't overly get too much silicone

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.130 
you don't overly get too much silicone
on<00:01:45.240> here<00:01:45.660> it'll<00:01:46.349> make<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.679> hard<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> grip<00:01:48.140> the

on here it'll make it hard to grip the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.650 
on here it'll make it hard to grip the
epic<00:01:50.039> armory<00:01:50.369> weapon<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.209> have<00:01:51.330> here<00:01:51.539> that

epic armory weapon we have here that
we've<00:01:51.810> had<00:01:51.929> for<00:01:52.110> years<00:01:52.369> you<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:53.550> see<00:01:53.729> what

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:53.849 
we've had for years you can see what

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:55.609 
we've had for years you can see what
happens<00:01:54.179> when<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:54.390> start<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> let<00:01:55.080> a<00:01:55.110> weapon

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
happens when you start to let a weapon

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.059 
happens when you start to let a weapon
dry<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:56.750> there<00:01:57.750> are<00:01:57.929> cracks<00:01:58.349> in<00:01:58.739> the<00:01:58.890> surface

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.389 
dry out there are cracks in the surface
of<00:01:59.459> the<00:01:59.670> latex<00:02:00.000> itself<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:01.500> some<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.979> latex<00:02:02.250> is

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
of the latex itself and some of latex is

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.010 
of the latex itself and some of latex is
actually<00:02:02.729> coming<00:02:03.060> off<00:02:03.179> again<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.630> has<00:02:03.810> gone

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
actually coming off again this has gone

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.770 
actually coming off again this has gone
through<00:02:04.200> years<00:02:04.739> of<00:02:04.920> abuse<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.450> held<00:02:06.630> up

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
through years of abuse and is held up

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.360 
through years of abuse and is held up
pretty<00:02:06.869> well<00:02:07.610> but<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:09.500> latex<00:02:10.500> was<00:02:10.739> neglected

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
pretty well but the latex was neglected

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.360 
pretty well but the latex was neglected
at<00:02:11.880> some<00:02:12.120> point<00:02:12.390> here<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:12.959> our<00:02:13.110> motor<00:02:13.950> weapon

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
at some point here in our motor weapon

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.479 
at some point here in our motor weapon
arsenal<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:16.140> latex<00:02:16.770> coating<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.340> now
