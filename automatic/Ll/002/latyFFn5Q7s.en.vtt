today at Ulta um I actually threw away

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.940 
today at Ulta um I actually threw away
the<00:00:34.530> box<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.640> I'm<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:36.750> exactly<00:00:37.320> sure<00:00:37.559> what

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the box so I'm not exactly sure what

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.680 
the box so I'm not exactly sure what
it's<00:00:38.070> called<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.910> hot<00:00:39.120> tools<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
it's called but it's a hot tools and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.979 
it's called but it's a hot tools and
it's<00:00:39.809> blue<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.520> it's<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.000> circle<00:00:42.719> it's

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
it's blue and it's like a circle it's

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.080 
it's blue and it's like a circle it's
smaller<00:00:43.260> than<00:00:43.410> an<00:00:43.680> inch<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.309> has<00:00:44.430> spirals

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
smaller than an inch and it has spirals

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.450 
smaller than an inch and it has spirals
so<00:00:45.719> basically<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.200> clamp<00:00:46.620> your<00:00:46.710> hair<00:00:47.129> and

so basically you clamp your hair and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.119 
so basically you clamp your hair and
then<00:00:47.760> your<00:00:47.969> hair<00:00:48.270> will<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.690> form<00:00:49.620> within<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
then your hair will like form within the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.760 
then your hair will like form within the
spirals<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.910> get<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.510> really<00:00:52.230> steady

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
spirals and get like a really steady

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.740 
spirals and get like a really steady
