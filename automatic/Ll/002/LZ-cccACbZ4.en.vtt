00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
all right I got here my Z Tron model 25

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.299 
all right I got here my Z Tron model 25
system<00:00:04.980> home<00:00:05.160> panel<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.759> finally<00:00:06.720> made<00:00:06.930> the

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:07.309 
system home panel I finally made the

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.040 
system home panel I finally made the
program<00:00:08.309> programming<00:00:08.880> cable<00:00:09.179> you<00:00:09.719> can<00:00:09.900> see

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
program programming cable you can see

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.930 
program programming cable you can see
here<00:00:11.210> and<00:00:12.559> took<00:00:13.559> me<00:00:13.679> about<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.190> day<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.759> half

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
here and took me about a day and a half

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.730 
here and took me about a day and a half
to<00:00:15.179> figure<00:00:15.450> out<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.690> stupid<00:00:15.960> programming<00:00:16.650> it

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
to figure out the stupid programming it

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.670 
to figure out the stupid programming it
was<00:00:16.859> really<00:00:17.100> stupid<00:00:17.750> but<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.810> got<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.500> working

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
was really stupid but I got it working

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.490 
was really stupid but I got it working
so<00:00:20.210> go<00:00:21.210> ahead<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.420> look<00:00:21.689> play<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> couple<00:00:22.320> of

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
so go ahead and look play a couple of

00:00:22.500 --> 00:01:55.980 
so go ahead and look play a couple of
times<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:22.830> you

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.789 

so<00:01:56.990> you're<00:01:57.170> going<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.409> throw<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.590> bunch<00:01:57.740> of

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
so you're going to throw a bunch of

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.289 
so you're going to throw a bunch of
tones<00:01:58.009> in<00:01:58.219> there<00:01:58.340> figure<00:01:58.759> out<00:01:58.880> how<00:01:58.969> to<00:01:59.090> do<00:01:59.210> the

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
tones in there figure out how to do the

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.340 
tones in there figure out how to do the
programming<00:01:59.780> set<00:02:00.770> up<00:02:00.920> an<00:02:01.039> alert<00:02:01.250> tone<00:02:02.049> next<00:02:03.049> up

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
programming set up an alert tone next up

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.270 
programming set up an alert tone next up
around<00:02:03.590> them<00:02:03.860> set<00:02:04.250> up<00:02:04.280> DTMF<00:02:05.149> codes<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:06.280> once

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
around them set up DTMF codes and once

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.889 
around them set up DTMF codes and once
we<00:02:07.460> figure<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:07.880> all<00:02:08.060> out<00:02:08.119> we'll<00:02:08.479> get<00:02:08.599> it<00:02:08.690> tied

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
we figure that all out we'll get it tied

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.559 
we figure that all out we'll get it tied
into<00:02:09.110> one<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.590> mobile<00:02:09.979> one<00:02:10.759> of<00:02:10.910> my

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
into one of the mobile one of my

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.470 
into one of the mobile one of my
multiple<00:02:11.810> mobile<00:02:12.440> radios<00:02:12.860> there<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.400> set<00:02:14.390> it

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
multiple mobile radios there and set it

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.170 
multiple mobile radios there and set it
up<00:02:14.540> start<00:02:15.050> toning<00:02:15.230> out<00:02:15.610> all<00:02:16.610> right<00:02:16.760> hope<00:02:17.000> you

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
up start toning out all right hope you

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.380 
up start toning out all right hope you
enjoyed<00:02:17.450> thanks<00:02:18.140> spike
