00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
damage along is Clinton peak I think

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.860 
damage along is Clinton peak I think
when<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.070> was<00:02:14.190> 14<00:02:14.610> or<00:02:14.640> 15<00:02:14.820> I<00:02:15.150> started<00:02:15.180> financial

when I was 14 or 15 I started financial

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.270 
when I was 14 or 15 I started financial
long<00:02:15.989> there<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.709> he<00:02:16.770> was<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.950> fantastic

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
long there and he was a fantastic

long there and he was a fantastic
influence<00:02:17.850> he<00:02:17.940> he<00:02:18.239> basically<00:02:18.450> taught<00:02:18.870> me<00:02:18.989> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
influence he he basically taught me the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.900 
influence he he basically taught me the
ropes<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.470> bedding<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.280> he's<00:02:20.520> always<00:02:20.700> been<00:02:20.850> a

pathway the cricket Victoria have in

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.240 
pathway the cricket Victoria have in
place<00:02:51.390> now<00:02:51.660> there's<00:02:52.080> different<00:02:52.260> chances<00:02:53.040> to

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
place now there's different chances to

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.310 
place now there's different chances to
apply<00:02:54.090> for<00:02:54.120> Victoria<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.690> Australia<00:02:55.200> so

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
apply for Victoria in Australia so

apply for Victoria in Australia so
what's<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.739> next<00:02:55.950> step<00:02:56.180> what<00:02:57.180> do<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.390> need<00:02:57.540> to

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
what's the next step what do you need to

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.509

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.110 
there's a lot of money in twenty20
cricket<00:03:04.560> but<00:03:04.890> but<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.430> get<00:03:05.580> judged<00:03:05.760> on<00:03:05.970> how

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
cricket but but you get judged on how

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.270 
cricket but but you get judged on how
you<00:03:06.180> play<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.720> longer

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
you play the longer

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.740 
you play the longer
out<00:03:07.490> of<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.640> game<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.030> think<00:03:08.209> that<00:03:08.390> someone

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
out of the game and I think that someone

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.660 
out of the game and I think that someone
like<00:03:08.840> Ricky<00:03:09.080> Ponting<00:03:09.440> is<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.950> ultimate<00:03:10.190> idol

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
like Ricky Ponting is the ultimate idol

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.270 
like Ricky Ponting is the ultimate idol
I<00:03:10.850> think<00:03:11.030> he's<00:03:11.120> played<00:03:11.330> for<00:03:11.920> 500<00:03:12.920> years<00:03:13.040> in

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
I think he's played for 500 years in

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.340 
I think he's played for 500 years in
Test<00:03:13.459> cricket<00:03:13.520> and<00:03:13.910> made<00:03:14.569> five<00:03:14.810> million<00:03:15.140> runs

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
Test cricket and made five million runs

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.260 
Test cricket and made five million runs
so<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:16.220> two<00:03:16.340> play<00:03:16.520> test<00:03:16.790> cricket<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.180> we

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
so the two play test cricket and we

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.150 
so the two play test cricket and we
judged<00:03:17.480> on<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:17.840> level<00:03:18.110> is<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.500> different

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
judged on that level is a different

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.590 
judged on that level is a different
scale<00:03:19.340> all<00:03:19.520> together<00:03:19.700> and<00:03:20.090> that's<00:03:20.480> my

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
scale all together and that's my

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.090 
scale all together and that's my
ultimate<00:03:20.660> goal<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.230> play<00:03:21.410> test<00:03:21.650> cricket<00:03:21.709> and

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100
