 Good people, I'll introduce you. 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:17.340
 the site that I created www a themed 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.900
 point with this site that I just 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.640
 type ne 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.099
 it serves to organize the materials for 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.830
 You can streamline your study here. 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.640
 You have the site where you are in the first 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.980
 page exposed the dvds that the 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.700
 commercialism all the dvd that you 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.649
 you can play and play 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.739
 to distribute among colleagues, I am 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.789
 authorizing is not a crime once 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.070
 to allow it 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.930
 here you have the right things and some 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.480
 financial mathematics topics 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:04.049
 discipline within mathematics 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.729
 has some financial issues weakens 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.500
 Do you want to know how to make a simple discount? 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.229
 for example that you become a week 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.510
 of simple rest and you will be 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.979
 thrown there in a video where he treats 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.710
 this subject already had the sound that 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.840
 sound for the list was not to do 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.939
 competition with me then you have here 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.250
 google ad you can skip or 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.759
 watch if you want what is public that the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.369
 objective and then you will see a video 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.200
 about that subject that you have 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.350
 discount interest thus 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.159
 Okay, I'll paste it and start exposing it. 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.290
 subject begins to explain mounting water 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.600
 on the website so here is math and 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.630
 because if you want to see a 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.689
 video here volume calculation by 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.820
 example or any other you only have the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.690
 job to click on top of that 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.210
 subject matter 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.290
 if you are going to be thrown there in our 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:05.190
 video on the day of revolution 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.680
 rotation around the river axis of the 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.040
 region is the site 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.830
 so here you have the one functions 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.410
 do the full course functions have 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.740
 limits you just have to click up 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.680
 derivatives have a complete mini course 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.070
 or high trigonometric derivatives 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.620
 partial statistics that also work 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.900
 anyone who has interest 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.300
 Wants to know what is average fashion wants to know 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.010
 how do you use normal distribution in 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.690
 normal table 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.360
 do you want to know anything is 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.550
 Just click you've never seen a video go 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.520
 fall there in the videos where 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.990
 I'm voting here on the side. 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:53.100
 dvd for sale by subjects like pay 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.410
 these dvds and here I 'm working out 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.739
 reinforcement exercises in students have 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.130
 impeded the exercise of integrals 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.090
 you want, for example, the exercise of 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.670
 base 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.220
 you go on a page where you have 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.800
 core area calculation exercises 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.900
 with integrals you just have to explain and 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.810
 will appear the page with many 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.709
 response to this questionnaire. 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.080
 subject matter 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.700
 and here you have suggestions of 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.400
 exercises with response 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.769
 if you still want to give 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.380
 reviewed above to access the 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.660
 videos that teaches you how to do 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.800
 exercises click here you click here 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:38.980
 and you guys are going to have a video yesterday a series 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:42.970
 is that it's not just multiple videos 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:50.409
 well, let's go to the street, you can see the south 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:53.409
 the matter is that you will I now 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:56.170
 I'll teach you a whole page of 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:58.959
 do the touch exercises and that's how it is 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.290
 Of course you have exercises and you have here too. 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:05.099
 of whole table summarizes that this 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.660
 site is daily or weekly 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.819
 being upgraded staff 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.810
 of course I only one person doing 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.849
 Everything then I have to do according to 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.209
 availability is that you have tables 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.130
 tables of normal distribution z table 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.820
 Studio for who's doing? 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.740
 statistic near here and you 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.570
 up here to access the video that 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.150
 use the table just click here 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.220
 You click here and you will have a 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.690
 video that teaches us this table and 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.630
 table is here for anyone who wants to copy 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.000
 everything to speed up the studio you because 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.010
 you will not have time doing research 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.020
 Guys, I'm trying to explain how 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.690
 it works the site that you gain time 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.180
 here home the main page 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.940
 and there you are in range and this table 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.370
 exercise that she is constantly 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.760
 growing up I'm still going to bounce 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.460
 exercises derived from functions as 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.370
 availability course people 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.610
 looking for the future of the album, right? 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.580
 You want to send a job to do I 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.669
 I make a budget, sent a price of the hours 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.680
 that I'm going to take a job or dilute 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:18.669
 It has working conditions also in 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.740
 future, but if someone wants to send 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:24.400
 a job can tell me what to do 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.710
 budget and also if you want to buy a 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.870
 dvd of course I already put here that 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.780
 the video lessons we are dvd 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.490
 they are available on youtube 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.350
 and contact can be played on 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.060
 distributed among colleagues I put 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.770
 It's clear here, I do not have any 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.840
 prejudice has no reservation 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.210
 I think that knowledge and 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.200
 more serious then trying to 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.880
 get there right? 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.860
 but meanwhile if anyone wants 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.350
 buy a dvd and play a 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.930
 dvd here is what i have this duty 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.930
 of constant - also then you go 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.880
 introduce new ones that I'm doing 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.550
 you have commanded by mode of 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.220
 watching your dvd player is the 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:08.990
 quality better than it's not personal 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:11.300
 this video then aims to clarify how 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.060
 does this site work a simple site is not 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.210
 very complicated that I'm doing more 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:21.470
 I think it helps if you find 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:23.390
 subject has subjects here you can go 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.979
 straight to wonder how it works 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.650
 There is no investment you go there and 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:30.260
 has a video of investment analysis 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.660
 Enjoy and enjoy. 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.810
 weekly that I sat down to the extent 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.470
 possible by entering new 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:41.290
 videos 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.290
 so clear linked to this site
