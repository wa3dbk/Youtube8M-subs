00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:08.410
 how about friends this time 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:12.090
 I wanted to show some different molds 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.090
 to make flowers 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.990
 this time we are going to try a mold 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.260
 try to do them I'm a little 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:28.960
 more real is unlike the other video 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:32.480
 they are a little more like medallion type in 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.820
 these and you will notice several reliefs 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.450
 Now let's do the tests in 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.450
 different cells and let's put 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.630
 some skins 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.970
 these texts recorded for example les 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.590
 serving 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.140
 to those who do these things for them and 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.390
 all that 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.370
 because of time he had already 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.750
 to heat the machine we are going to put 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.540
 bathroom 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.540
 let's put some cotton fabrics 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.640
 like the kind of shirts 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.640
 a shirt 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.479
 let's do 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.479
 tests 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.490
 and the only thing we are going to do is 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.490
 press 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.789
 we leave 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.450
 a moment a few seconds to be 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.450
 according 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.190
 this is one of the advantages that when doing 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.950
 aluminum molds 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:55.150
 they can be heated and not only are they limited 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.830
 to make engravings in the background but 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.120
 here you can already get all of 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.120
 materials that need 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.750
 in that fabric or by the same design as 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.240
 that is not appreciated very well 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.240
 let's put now one of some 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.030
 year 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.360
 let's also put some skins 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.639
 now we are going to make an approach 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.570
 let's go here 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:48.680
 in cloth it stands out pretty well 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:53.000
 this is cotton 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:57.050
 in we were able to appreciate very well 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.630
 but it tarnished if it is quite highlighted 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.620
 in skin also has enough 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.620
 definition 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.140
 this is another type of skin 

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:21.709
 imagine the amount of materials that 

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:21.709
 you can mix 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.990
 good friends, I hope you liked it
