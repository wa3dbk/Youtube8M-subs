 thank you very much not good now yes 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.450
 let's go back with the design as you 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.909
 I said in this case I have three garages 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.979
 and all three are full but in one it is 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.289
 the one that I'm going to do the trick and in this 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.569
 which is the first garage I put three 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.090
 Street cars as you can see are 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.739
 I'm going to take the first one out of 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.690
 the line you are going to do the same 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.280
 with street cars that have to 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.680
 have at least two inside the garage 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.050
 they're going to take out one of them and they're going to 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.120
 put access to anyone after they're going to 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.730
 ask your friend who is trying to 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.440
 get up if you are in playstation 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.200
 so make sure you are pressing 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.200
 triangle all the time in case of xbox 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.060
 well and all the time that you guys and good 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.190
 while your friend does that you 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.470
 they are going out on the streets and they are going to look 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.420
 a car for which you think that 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.819
 if they are going to give you good money 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.160
 guys and good me in this case to come back 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.800
 a truck to the highway and good now 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.900
 what follows study it to the maximum that 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.540
 leave us our budget that guys 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.940
 but hey there is a recommendation 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.950
 I recommend that they do not put neither color nor 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.709
 explosives since they will not give them anything 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.660
 extra and they will only lose money that 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.030
 guys, so as I say 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.250
 make sure not to paint or 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.110
 explosives but everything else 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.510
 tunnel or not good since it's not all 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.610
 turning we're going to anti prevention 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.350
 robberies and we're going to put the locator 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.720
 We'll show this message 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.000
 replace here guys let's look for the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.400
 garage where we put the cars of the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.150
 street and here important we're going to 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.890
 Replace by 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.620
 street car which stayed 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.120
 within which was not out that 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.489
 he stayed outside is in which his friend 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.230
 right now is the lawyer who is 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.909
 it was inside is why we replaced 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.310
 after that as you will see guys 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.620
 we take the car once again back 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.470
 to our garage and that 's how kids are 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.500
 totally duplicated of the vehicle very 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.810
 easy and very fast or is the cycle itself 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.549
 The truth is that it is very easy to 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.349
 only that your friend has to do is 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.439
 all the time try to get on the 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:57.400
 vehicle we simply grab 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:59.670
 the truck only from the street the 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.530
 we had the most of the metemos we put 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.079
 locator and we're going to replace it now 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.470
 you know by one of the cars on the street 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.450
 that are inside our garage not the 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.760
 that they took out the one they took out there, it's going to 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.250
 stay outside with your friend trying 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.870
 get in the car that but good guys in 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.669
