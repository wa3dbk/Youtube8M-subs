like angled downwards in order to hit

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.360 
like angled downwards in order to hit
him<00:03:53.359> and<00:03:53.510> if<00:03:53.989> I'm<00:03:54.109> you<00:03:54.590> know<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:54.980> he<00:03:55.069> knocks<00:03:55.280> me

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
him and if I'm you know and he knocks me

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.949 
him and if I'm you know and he knocks me
out<00:03:55.489> of<00:03:55.669> position<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.299> then<00:03:56.510> it<00:03:56.690> would<00:03:56.810> just

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
out of position and then it would just

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.990 
out of position and then it would just
become<00:03:57.079> a<00:03:57.200> stamina<00:03:57.500> battle<00:03:57.919> and<00:03:58.069> I<00:03:58.280> watches<00:03:58.880> in

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
become a stamina battle and I watches in

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.360 
become a stamina battle and I watches in
attack<00:03:59.480> mode<00:03:59.510> so<00:04:00.470> maybe<00:04:00.919> you<00:04:01.040> should<00:04:01.190> try<00:04:01.310> a

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
attack mode so maybe you should try a

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.099 
attack mode so maybe you should try a
