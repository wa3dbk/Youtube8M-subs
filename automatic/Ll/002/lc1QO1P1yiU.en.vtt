tough but hunting them and this kind of
open<00:01:22.469> country<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.130> insane<00:01:23.729> there's<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.719> huge

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
open country is insane there's a huge

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.809 
open country is insane there's a huge
difference<00:01:25.469> between<00:01:25.590> seeing<00:01:26.189> animals<00:01:26.609> and

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
difference between seeing animals and

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.300 
difference between seeing animals and
killing<00:01:27.329> them<00:01:27.569> my<00:01:28.289> chances<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:28.890> getting<00:01:28.950> into

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
killing them my chances for getting into

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.160 
killing them my chances for getting into
position<00:01:29.520> where<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.149> mill<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.990> thought

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
position where the mill but I thought

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.870 
position where the mill but I thought
for<00:01:31.229> sure<00:01:31.469> I<00:01:31.740> would<00:01:32.069> have<00:01:32.159> at<00:01:32.250> least<00:01:32.490> had<00:01:32.759> an

for sure I would have at least had an

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.669 
for sure I would have at least had an
opportunity<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> see<00:01:33.840> them<00:01:34.020> again<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.500> the

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.620 
ink so if I were to dump this back down
to<00:04:11.900> 16<00:04:12.350> power<00:04:12.650> this<00:04:13.160> same<00:04:13.519> eye<00:04:13.790> relief<00:04:14.180> I'm

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
to 16 power this same eye relief I'm

to 16 power this same eye relief I'm
going<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:14.900> get<00:04:15.019> some<00:04:15.200> strong<00:04:15.500> vignette
