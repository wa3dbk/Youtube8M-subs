in clever Lee's it looked pretty certain
that<00:00:29.869> they<00:00:30.050> were<00:00:30.109> very<00:00:30.980> interested<00:00:31.130> in

that they were very interested in

that they were very interested in

wearing these sort of batten birds which

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.369 
wearing these sort of batten birds which
was<00:00:33.530> a<00:00:33.559> version<00:00:34.190> of<00:00:34.610> of<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.900> elastic-sided

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
was a version of of the elastic-sided

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.860 
was a version of of the elastic-sided
boots<00:00:36.920> but<00:00:37.159> no<00:00:37.339> elastics<00:00:37.850> attached<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.690> them

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
boots but no elastics attached to them

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.990 
boots but no elastics attached to them
it<00:00:39.199> was<00:00:39.500> buttons<00:00:39.920> that<00:00:40.190> were<00:00:40.309> hand<00:00:40.640> stitched

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
it was buttons that were hand stitched

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.910 
it was buttons that were hand stitched
into<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.540> upper<00:00:41.839> these<00:00:42.199> were<00:00:42.409> pull<00:00:42.649> through

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
into the upper these were pull through

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.850 
into the upper these were pull through
the<00:00:43.100> leather<00:00:43.309> with<00:00:43.790> a<00:00:43.820> hook<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:44.680> put<00:00:45.680> into

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
the leather with a hook and put into

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.829 
the leather with a hook and put into
place<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:46.610> it<00:00:46.879> probably<00:00:47.360> was<00:00:47.510> somewhere<00:00:47.780> in

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
place and it probably was somewhere in

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.349 
place and it probably was somewhere in
the<00:00:47.930> regional<00:00:48.409> about<00:00:48.620> nine<00:00:48.920> buttons<00:00:49.489> to<00:00:50.210> each

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
the regional about nine buttons to each

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.389 
the regional about nine buttons to each
boot<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.019> it<00:00:51.079> was<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.230> pretty<00:00:51.469> labor-intensive

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
boot so it was a pretty labor-intensive

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.169 
boot so it was a pretty labor-intensive
process<00:00:53.090> to<00:00:54.079> put<00:00:54.320> these<00:00:54.980> on<00:00:55.399> and<00:00:55.910> take<00:00:56.059> them

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
process to put these on and take them

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.180 
process to put these on and take them
off<00:00:56.329> so<00:00:56.719> I<00:00:56.780> spec<00:00:57.019> someone<00:00:57.379> back<00:00:57.559> at<00:00:57.739> that<00:00:57.920> time

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
off so I spec someone back at that time

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.880 
off so I spec someone back at that time
had<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.489> sort<00:00:58.820> of<00:00:58.910> genuine<00:00:59.809> genius<00:01:00.379> idea<00:01:00.739> well

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
had a sort of genuine genius idea well

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.650 
had a sort of genuine genius idea well
why<00:01:01.070> are<00:01:01.129> we<00:01:01.219> spending<00:01:01.460> all<00:01:01.760> this<00:01:01.879> time<00:01:01.940> why

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
why are we spending all this time why

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.200 
why are we spending all this time why
don't<00:01:02.719> we<00:01:03.019> use<00:01:03.230> elastic<00:01:03.530> well<00:01:04.280> that's<00:01:04.879> pretty

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
don't we use elastic well that's pretty

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.660 
don't we use elastic well that's pretty
good<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.200> then<00:01:06.440> I<00:01:06.590> think<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.920> elastic<00:01:07.429> did

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
good so then I think the elastic did

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.270 
good so then I think the elastic did
replace<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.810> bum<00:01:08.990> because<00:01:09.410> it<00:01:09.740> was<00:01:09.860> just<00:01:10.160> a

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
replace the bum because it was just a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.580 
replace the bum because it was just a
different<00:01:10.610> world<00:01:10.759> and<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.210> different<00:01:12.050> time<00:01:12.289> and

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
different world and a different time and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.859 
different world and a different time and
it<00:01:12.710> was<00:01:12.860> much<00:01:13.039> quicker<00:01:13.310> I<00:01:13.759> think<00:01:14.539> it<00:01:14.690> had<00:01:14.840> a

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
it was much quicker I think it had a

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.330 
it was much quicker I think it had a
small<00:01:16.570> introduction<00:01:17.570> in<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.289> 1900<00:01:18.920> part<00:01:19.250> of

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
small introduction in the 1900 part of

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.130 
small introduction in the 1900 part of
the<00:01:19.429> nineteenth<00:01:19.789> century<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.330> then<00:01:20.810> I<00:01:20.959> think

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
the nineteenth century and then I think

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.719 
the nineteenth century and then I think
it<00:01:21.289> lost<00:01:21.530> its<00:01:21.800> way<00:01:21.979> as<00:01:22.190> far<00:01:22.340> as<00:01:22.520> what<00:01:22.700> I

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
it lost its way as far as what I

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.400 
it lost its way as far as what I
couldn't<00:01:23.030> meant<00:01:23.179> to<00:01:23.270> believe<00:01:23.390> until<00:01:23.660> when<00:01:24.380> I

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
couldn't meant to believe until when I

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.979 
couldn't meant to believe until when I
first<00:01:24.830> come<00:01:25.160> into<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.429> business<00:01:25.970> in<00:01:26.209> the<00:01:26.450> 60s

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:26.989 
first come into the business in the 60s

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:28.479 
first come into the business in the 60s
and<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:27.170> think<00:01:27.380> probably<00:01:27.649> it's<00:01:27.979> true<00:01:28.190> to<00:01:28.340> say

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:28.489 
and I think probably it's true to say

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:30.279 
and I think probably it's true to say
that<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.819> Beatles<00:01:29.179> probably<00:01:29.539> introduced<00:01:30.140> it

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
that the Beatles probably introduced it

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.010 
that the Beatles probably introduced it
back<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:30.770> they<00:01:30.860> were<00:01:30.920> massive<00:01:31.880> icon<00:01:32.330> and<00:01:32.569> then

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
back and they were massive icon and then

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.370 
back and they were massive icon and then
I<00:01:33.709> think<00:01:33.950> things<00:01:34.670> changed<00:01:35.539> round<00:01:35.810> for<00:01:36.229> an

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
I think things changed round for an

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.440 
I think things changed round for an
elastic<00:01:36.679> sided<00:01:37.310> Chelsea<00:01:37.700> boot<00:01:37.880> at<00:01:38.030> that<00:01:38.209> time

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
elastic sided Chelsea boot at that time

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.930 
elastic sided Chelsea boot at that time
everyone<00:01:39.319> seemed<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:39.770> want<00:01:39.950> what<00:01:40.340> they<00:01:40.489> had<00:01:40.700> I

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
everyone seemed to want what they had I

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.600 
everyone seemed to want what they had I
think<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:41.989> know<00:01:42.140> Chelsea<00:01:42.470> boots<00:01:42.830> theory<00:01:43.250> in

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
think you know Chelsea boots theory in

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.609 
think you know Chelsea boots theory in
black<00:01:44.030> would<00:01:44.450> be<00:01:44.599> war<00:01:44.810> masseuse<00:01:45.259> there<00:01:45.530> would

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
black would be war masseuse there would

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.499 
black would be war masseuse there would
be<00:01:45.649> no<00:01:45.830> problem<00:01:46.280> with<00:01:46.429> that<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:46.910> and<00:01:47.239> never

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
be no problem with that and and never

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.449 
be no problem with that and and never
normally<00:01:48.050> worn<00:01:48.229> for<00:01:48.470> casual<00:01:48.890> wear<00:01:49.069> in<00:01:49.220> every

normally worn for casual wear in every
respect<00:01:49.910> and<00:01:50.119> then<00:01:50.569> that's<00:01:50.780> when<00:01:50.959> the<00:01:51.080> Chelsea

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500

respect and then that's when the Chelsea
boot<00:01:51.679> in<00:01:51.860> brown<00:01:52.099> become<00:01:52.550> popular<00:01:53.060> because

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.640 
elastic-sided boots or boots in general
then<00:02:17.360> we<00:02:17.480> have<00:02:17.629> done<00:02:17.840> probably<00:02:18.080> for<00:02:18.379> the<00:02:18.470> last

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
then we have done probably for the last

then we have done probably for the last
ten<00:02:18.950> years<00:02:18.980> but<00:02:19.430> that's<00:02:19.940> what<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.269> normally

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
ten years but that's what I normally

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.809 
ten years but that's what I normally
find<00:02:20.989> things<00:02:21.319> have<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.590> bit<00:02:21.769> of<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.980> circle<00:02:22.430> and

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
find things have a bit of a circle and

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.040 
find things have a bit of a circle and
they<00:02:23.000> go<00:02:23.150> round<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.599> then<00:02:23.750> they<00:02:23.840> come<00:02:24.019> back

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
they go round and then they come back

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.050 
they go round and then they come back
again<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:24.650> at<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.040> moment<00:02:25.370> yes<00:02:25.490> it's<00:02:25.730> true<00:02:25.910> to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
again and at the moment yes it's true to

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.930 
again and at the moment yes it's true to
say<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:26.450> we<00:02:26.600> are<00:02:26.630> using<00:02:27.050> elastic-sided

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
say that we are using elastic-sided

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.119 
say that we are using elastic-sided
in<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.420> lot<00:02:29.659> of<00:02:29.690> different<00:02:29.930> materials<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:30.890> it's

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
in a lot of different materials so it's

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.979 
in a lot of different materials so it's
having<00:02:31.430> at<00:02:31.580> its<00:02:31.849> time<00:02:32.120> at<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.450> moment<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.840> bit

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
having at its time at the moment a bit
