00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:53.220
 and he made the image file what 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.710
 we want to unmount the image file 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.050
 then you have to mount the with diamond 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.940
 alcohol without those program things to 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.400
 create virtual images if they have 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.410
 windows 8 go to manage and in 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.630

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.550
 image mounted virtual image 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.520
 we execute as administrator in case of 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:22.000
 windows 7 vista 8 sonic riders la 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.050
 installation not the launcher the installer 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.050
 the application that yes 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.690
 we execute it as an initiator we wait for 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.470
 that opens 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.409
 and well 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.469
 and we choose the language 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.759
 I'm sick and I hear something hoarse 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:44.039
 we accept the agreement blah blah blah without 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.549
 read it and choose where I want installed 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:50.869
 I for example already have it installed like this 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.869
 what I tried to said the imparting of 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:58.500
 true already after installed we 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.349
 we'll direct you to the crack folder 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.649
 there is an image that is mounted and 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:06.959
 copy the file sonic riders the 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.720
 only file to follow we copy it 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.690
 let's go to local geo disk or where has 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.879
 installed program files we 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.010
 we will arrive after gastÃ³n and 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:21.239
 greider and there we will see the game installed 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.690
 we put paste and represents will ask us 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.060
 replace in case it does not show them 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.349
 this warning and that the base you hit and do not 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.359
 already launches the launcher 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.580
 then to play the launcher so 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.820
 He says 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.310
 and there we will see how to configure it by 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.910
 example I do not have normal as it comes from 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.410
 defect because then sometimes it will sound weird 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.600
 but sometimes I get dizzy playing in 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.060
 full screen this game so the 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.150
 minimized game as you are and you 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.360
 you can configure the keyboard to your liking 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.580
 the graphics the resolution level the 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.580
 language and so on when they have 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.040
 finished we put you in play 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.040
 and we'll see good I 'll show you that the 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.680
 game is not in beta like many tend to 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.660
 do it to sign it 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.780
 completely pool 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.780
 to lower the sound because we had 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.380
 You will see the laziness 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.810
 to show them the waste of seconds 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.239
 of life 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.819
 if we started the game you created 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.880
 a game blablabla game start 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.709
 here the death of look how they will see are 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.069
 unlocked all options 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.069
 victory 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:50.260
 is very free we have to have the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.260
 tracks 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.940
 when seeing the table 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:16.810
 racing games 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:29.180
 we can of our level of beasts of 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.689
 thousand is measured in the bar called air that 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.689
 you spend 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.269
 the turbo 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.860
 and well, that 's all because I do not 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.910
 I want to play the truth everything there is something 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.910
 disappointed until they
