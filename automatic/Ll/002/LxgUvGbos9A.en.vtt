00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.900
 hello friends today as you see we are going to do 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.230
 a pasta recipe 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:15.380
 noodles to the carbonara here we have 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:20.280
 350 grams of noodles 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:23.960
 200 grams of bacon cut into pieces 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:27.800
 100 grams of grated cheese 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.110
 an egg and four yolks this is all 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.750
 what we need to do 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.090
 our recipes 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.520
 well we put the bacon in the pan 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.130
 as you see without oil because then and 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.380
 It has its own fat and we're going to 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.120
 do let's leave all edits and 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.800
 when we have it, we will take out a paper 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.800
 absorbent and we will reserve it 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.050
 we already have the golden bacon and now what 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.530
 we take out 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.130
 and we throw it on matches really 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.630
 it looks like paper 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.630
 they remove excess fat 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.619
 and now let's bake 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.750
 let's bake the pasta and keep a 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.560
 little of the cooking water is important 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.040
 that is good for us, let's go there 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.079
 while the pasta ends 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.079
 let's beat the yolks with the egg 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.560
 now we incorporate the cheese 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.900
 and when we have well integrated by 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.900
 last we will add the vehicle 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.310
 you do not know how 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.880
 we search 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.920
 and now we will add if we see that it is 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.159
 a little bit of the broth from the 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.159
 cooking 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.520
 we already have this and we will wait for 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.160
 have been 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.110
 well here we have the pasta much more 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.420
 to get it out and drain it and now 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.750
 we directly put it in the water 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.500
 Now we do have to mix very well 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.880
 because the egg is going to make us 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.750
 but then we are going to do with the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.750
 heat of the pasta 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.630
 well we have everything well mixed and 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.740
 as you see and between a paste ready now 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.840
 directly serve the dish and eat 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.940
 this is the real pasta to the 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.880
 authentic Italian carbonara 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.530
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.530
 next 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.530
 goodbye
