and<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.450> worked<00:01:19.600> out<00:01:19.720> for<00:01:19.899> the<00:01:19.990> most<00:01:20.080> part<00:01:20.290> for

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
and it worked out for the most part for

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.740 
and it worked out for the most part for
the<00:01:21.310> entire<00:01:21.580> game<00:01:21.759> so<00:01:22.060> I<00:01:22.090> mean<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.479> was<00:01:22.540> a<00:01:22.630> good

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
the entire game so I mean it was a good

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.260 
the entire game so I mean it was a good
game<00:01:22.899> plan<00:01:23.250> bicoastal<00:01:24.250> on<00:01:24.460> coach<00:01:24.729> hope<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.210> I

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
game plan bicoastal on coach hope and I

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.029 
game plan bicoastal on coach hope and I
think<00:01:25.930> it<00:01:25.990> really<00:01:26.020> helped<00:01:27.869> no<00:01:28.869> you<00:01:28.930> know<00:01:29.289> she

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
think it really helped no you know she

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.760 
think it really helped no you know she
rocks<00:01:30.340> a<00:01:30.490> defense<00:01:30.820> coordinator<00:01:31.149> and<00:01:31.690> you<00:01:32.649> know

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
rocks a defense coordinator and you know

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
he was a triple option quarterback in

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.210 
he was a triple option quarterback in
New<00:01:35.020> Mexico<00:01:35.590> so<00:01:35.860> he<00:01:35.979> understands<00:01:36.550> that<00:01:36.819> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
New Mexico so he understands that that

thought<00:02:08.140> you<00:02:08.470> know<00:02:08.500> for<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:08.979> most<00:02:09.009> part<00:02:09.429> we

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
thought you know for the most part we

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.930 
thought you know for the most part we
eliminated<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.629> full-back<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.940> decent

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
eliminated the full-back to a decent

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.000 
eliminated the full-back to a decent
amount<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.260> was<00:02:14.440> where<00:02:14.650> two<00:02:14.739> had<00:02:14.890> to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
amount and that was where two had to

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.290 
amount and that was where two had to
start

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.680 

um<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:24.170> was<00:02:24.290> pretty<00:02:24.500> much<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.710> power<00:02:25.010> play<00:02:25.280> and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
um it was pretty much a power play and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.510 
um it was pretty much a power play and
we<00:02:26.690> ought<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:26.840> know<00:02:27.470> this<00:02:27.950> obviously<00:02:28.340> was<00:02:28.400> the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
we ought to know this obviously was the
