hi everyone Aaron here for Zolo Tech and
we're<00:00:09.630> going<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.900> take<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.080> look<00:00:10.320> at<00:00:10.440> Intel<00:00:10.860> a

glass<00:00:11.219> for<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.610> Nexus<00:00:11.940> 6<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.809> Nexus<00:00:13.200> 6<00:00:13.469> has<00:00:13.679> a

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
glass for the Nexus 6 the Nexus 6 has a

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.220 
glass for the Nexus 6 the Nexus 6 has a
really<00:00:14.070> nice<00:00:14.250> large<00:00:14.639> display<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.540> with<00:00:16.199> a

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
really nice large display in with a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.870 
really nice large display in with a
large<00:00:16.500> display<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.609> better<00:00:17.789> chance

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
large display you have a better chance

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.029 
large display you have a better chance
of<00:00:18.270> damaging<00:00:18.779> or<00:00:18.960> scratching<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:20.010> I

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
of damaging or scratching it so I

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.609 
of damaging or scratching it so I
thought<00:00:20.310> it'd<00:00:20.430> be<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.550> good<00:00:20.730> idea<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.420> see<00:00:22.380> what

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
thought it'd be a good idea to see what

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.170 
thought it'd be a good idea to see what
kind<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.980> screen<00:00:23.250> protectors<00:00:23.400> were<00:00:23.850> out<00:00:23.970> there

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
kind of screen protectors were out there

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.820 
kind of screen protectors were out there
in<00:00:24.240> telegraphs<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.080> nice<00:00:25.260> enough<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.560> send

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
in telegraphs was nice enough to send

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.040 
in telegraphs was nice enough to send
this<00:00:26.010> along<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:27.240> their<00:00:27.420> website<00:00:27.570> they're

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
this along and on their website they're

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.960 
this along and on their website they're
fairly<00:00:28.529> reasonable<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.340> from<00:00:29.580> Intelli

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
fairly reasonable it's from Intelli

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.220 
armor at Intel
armored<00:00:31.740> comm<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.489> $12.99<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.140> a

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
armored comm this is $12.99 so it's a

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.650 
armored comm this is $12.99 so it's a
tempered<00:00:34.590> glass<00:00:34.620> screen<00:00:35.130> protector<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.880> one

tempered glass screen protector and one

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.150 
tempered glass screen protector and one
thing<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.930> really<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:37.290> liked<00:00:37.530> about<00:00:37.800> these<00:00:37.980> is

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
thing I really have liked about these is

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.799 
thing I really have liked about these is
they<00:00:38.280> have<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> really<00:00:38.640> nice<00:00:38.879> smooth<00:00:39.300> feeling

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
they have a really nice smooth feeling

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.900 
they have a really nice smooth feeling
to<00:00:39.989> them<00:00:40.110> at<00:00:40.440> least<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.890> their<00:00:41.040> previous<00:00:41.520> ones

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
to them at least on their previous ones

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.819 
to them at least on their previous ones
I've<00:00:42.059> tried<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.660> let's<00:00:43.290> go<00:00:43.440> ahead<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.739> open

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
I've tried so let's go ahead and open

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.920 
I've tried so let's go ahead and open
this<00:00:44.160> up<00:00:44.489> break<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.600> seal<00:00:45.809> here<00:00:47.239> and<00:00:48.239> open<00:00:48.809> it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
this up break the seal here and open it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.779 
this up break the seal here and open it
up<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> larger<00:00:50.100> ones<00:00:50.280> are<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.489> little<00:00:50.579> more

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
up now the larger ones are a little more

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.520 
up now the larger ones are a little more
difficult<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> install<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.199> should<00:00:52.379> be<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
difficult to install so this should be a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.729 
difficult to install so this should be a
little<00:00:53.010> bit<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.280> challenge<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:54.289> here<00:00:55.289> we

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
little bit of a challenge in here we

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.470 
little bit of a challenge in here we
have<00:00:56.270> an<00:00:57.270> applicator<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.670> little<00:00:59.670> tiny<00:00:59.850> plastic

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
have an applicator a little tiny plastic

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.450 
have an applicator a little tiny plastic
applicator<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:01.260> also<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.829> an<00:01:01.920> alcohol<00:01:02.309> wipe

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
applicator I also have an alcohol wipe

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.020 
applicator I also have an alcohol wipe
or<00:01:03.300> prep<00:01:03.690> pad<00:01:04.280> microfiber<00:01:05.280> cloth<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
or prep pad microfiber cloth and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.630 
or prep pad microfiber cloth and
obviously<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.110> screen<00:01:07.439> protector<00:01:07.619> itself<00:01:08.369> so

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
obviously the screen protector itself so

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.149 
obviously the screen protector itself so
let's<00:01:08.820> move<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.420> aside<00:01:09.619> take<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.680> closer<00:01:11.010> look

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
let's move this aside take a closer look

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.160 
let's move this aside take a closer look
at<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:12.119> does<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.420> an<00:01:12.689> oleophobic<00:01:12.990> coating

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
at it it does have an oleophobic coating

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.530 
at it it does have an oleophobic coating
on<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.220> resists<00:01:14.729> fingerprints<00:01:15.240> which

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
on it so it resists fingerprints which

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.580 
on it so it resists fingerprints which
is<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:16.020> nice<00:01:17.509> definitely<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> plus<00:01:18.869> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
is really nice definitely a plus and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.670 
is really nice definitely a plus and
let's<00:01:20.220> take<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.880> out<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.360> here<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.470> is

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
let's take this out of here so this is

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.300 
let's take this out of here so this is
one<00:01:22.890> giant<00:01:23.460> sheet<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.790> glass<00:01:24.409> then<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:26.100> have

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
one giant sheet of glass then we have

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.270 
one giant sheet of glass then we have
the<00:01:26.430> instructions<00:01:27.119> inside<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:29.100> have

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the instructions inside here and we have

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.100 
the instructions inside here and we have
dirt<00:01:29.549> clean<00:01:29.970> film<00:01:30.299> now<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.689> doesn't<00:01:30.900> really

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
dirt clean film now this doesn't really

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.749 
dirt clean film now this doesn't really
fit<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.470> size<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.070> screen<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.579> looks

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
fit the size of that screen it looks

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.120 
fit the size of that screen it looks
like<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.180> see<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.350> says<00:01:34.619> there's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
like but see what it says there's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.620 
like but see what it says there's
product<00:01:35.610> reviews<00:01:35.909> they<00:01:36.060> want<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> write

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
product reviews they want you to write

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.359 
product reviews they want you to write
and<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.979> little<00:01:38.100> bit<00:01:38.280> of

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
and this is just a little bit of

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.100 
and this is just a little bit of
information<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.060> basically<00:01:39.180> says<00:01:39.659> wash<00:01:39.840> your

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
information so basically says wash your

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
screen on and then push out the bubbles

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.840 
screen on and then push out the bubbles
so<00:01:44.939> I've<00:01:45.090> done<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.420> plenty<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.869> times<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
so I've done this plenty of times and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.630 
so I've done this plenty of times and

don't<00:02:01.259> think<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> suction<00:02:02.159> cup<00:02:02.460> here

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
don't think we have a suction cup here

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.940 
don't think we have a suction cup here
but<00:02:02.939> let's<00:02:03.350> see<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> little

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
but let's see this is the little

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.730 
but let's see this is the little
applicator<00:02:05.630> we<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.899> dirt<00:02:07.079> clean<00:02:07.350> film

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
applicator we have the dirt clean film

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.810 
applicator we have the dirt clean film
we<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:08.959> we<00:02:09.959> have<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.200> screen<00:02:10.500> itself

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.120 

see<00:02:14.820> this<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:15.960> gigantic<00:02:16.620> piece<00:02:16.980> of

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
see this this is one gigantic piece of

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.320 
see this this is one gigantic piece of
glass<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:18.810> will<00:02:18.990> sit<00:02:19.290> just<00:02:19.530> like<00:02:19.710> this

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
glass and it will sit just like this

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.640 
glass and it will sit just like this
actually<00:02:21.330> not<00:02:21.990> like<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:25.050> will<00:02:25.200> sit<00:02:25.470> like

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
actually not like this it will sit like

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.380 
actually not like this it will sit like
this<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.280> we<00:02:26.400> want<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.670> make<00:02:26.790> sure<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:27.150> sits

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
this so we want to make sure it sits

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.300 
this so we want to make sure it sits
here<00:02:27.660> nicely<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:28.650> want<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.890> see<00:02:29.010> how<00:02:29.160> it

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
here nicely and just want to see how it

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.860 
here nicely and just want to see how it
sits<00:02:29.820> on<00:02:29.970> there<00:02:30.180> before<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.540> go<00:02:30.690> ahead<00:02:30.750> and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
sits on there before I go ahead and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.680 
sits on there before I go ahead and
clean<00:02:31.170> everything<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.280> obviously<00:02:33.180> alcohol

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
prep pad I'll clean this off first it's

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.550 
prep pad I'll clean this off first it's

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:58.960 
all the oil off there and everything and
we'll<00:02:49.830> hit<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.130> with<00:02:50.220> this

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.160 

and<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.090> can<00:03:00.240> see<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.480> don't<00:03:00.720> know<00:03:00.870> if<00:03:00.960> you<00:03:01.050> can

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
and you can see I don't know if you can

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.750 
and you can see I don't know if you can
see<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.560> but<00:03:01.650> there's<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.890> few<00:03:02.130> little<00:03:02.310> specks

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
see that but there's a few little specks

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.490 
see that but there's a few little specks
here<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.180> there<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:04.850> you<00:03:05.850> can<00:03:06.030> use<00:03:06.210> this<00:03:06.540> on

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
here and there and you can use this on

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.670 
here and there and you can use this on
most<00:03:08.340> displays<00:03:09.060> what<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.870> do<00:03:09.990> is<00:03:10.110> just<00:03:10.140> put

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
most displays what you do is just put

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.930 
most displays what you do is just put
this<00:03:10.830> on<00:03:11.010> here<00:03:11.570> go<00:03:12.570> pull<00:03:12.810> off<00:03:12.960> all<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.380> dust

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
this on here go pull off all the dust

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.970 
this on here go pull off all the dust
but<00:03:14.940> we'll<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.240> display<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.900> large<00:03:16.230> just

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
but we'll the display this large just

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.130 
but we'll the display this large just
have<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.280> be<00:03:17.370> really<00:03:17.820> careful<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.540> take<00:03:18.960> your

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
have to be really careful and take your

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:31.490 
have to be really careful and take your
time<00:03:19.380> with<00:03:19.440> it

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.110 

after<00:03:31.860> spending<00:03:32.100> quite<00:03:32.490> a<00:03:32.550> bit<00:03:32.670> of<00:03:32.820> time

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
after spending quite a bit of time

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.180 
after spending quite a bit of time
putting<00:03:33.690> this<00:03:33.990> screen<00:03:34.320> protector<00:03:34.530> on<00:03:34.920> it's

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
putting this screen protector on it's

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.670 
putting this screen protector on it's
finally<00:03:35.670> on<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.240> it's<00:03:37.050> really<00:03:37.500> actually

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
finally on and it's really actually

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.460 
finally on and it's really actually
pretty<00:03:37.890> nice<00:03:38.280> it's<00:03:38.730> nice<00:03:39.240> and<00:03:39.690> smooth<00:03:40.110> as<00:03:40.440> you

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
pretty nice it's nice and smooth as you

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.800 
pretty nice it's nice and smooth as you
move<00:03:40.740> your<00:03:40.770> finger<00:03:41.220> across<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.570> has<00:03:42.780> a

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
move your finger across it and it has a

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.050 
move your finger across it and it has a
nice<00:03:43.020> rounded<00:03:43.800> edge<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.460> it's<00:03:44.550> not<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.700> sharp

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
nice rounded edge to it it's not a sharp

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.790 
nice rounded edge to it it's not a sharp
edge<00:03:45.240> so<00:03:45.450> your<00:03:45.600> finger<00:03:45.900> falls<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.560> side

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
edge so your finger falls to the side

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.250 
edge so your finger falls to the side
you<00:03:47.370> don't<00:03:47.550> quite<00:03:47.790> get<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.240> rounded<00:03:48.780> edges<00:03:49.110> of

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
you don't quite get the rounded edges of

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.770 
you don't quite get the rounded edges of
the<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.950> phones<00:03:50.220> original<00:03:50.940> design<00:03:51.300> but<00:03:51.480> it

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
the the phones original design but it

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.060 
the the phones original design but it
leaves<00:03:52.020> enough<00:03:52.230> room<00:03:52.350> where<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.740> could<00:03:52.830> put<00:03:53.010> a

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
leaves enough room where you could put a

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.730 
leaves enough room where you could put a
small<00:03:53.220> case<00:03:53.580> on<00:03:53.820> this<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.360> it<00:03:55.110> should<00:03:55.380> hold<00:03:55.560> up

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
small case on this and it should hold up

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.010 
small case on this and it should hold up
pretty<00:03:55.950> well<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.880> is<00:03:57.060> really<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.480> pretty<00:03:57.810> nice

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
pretty well this is really a pretty nice

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.440 
pretty well this is really a pretty nice
screen<00:03:58.320> protector<00:03:58.770> it's<00:03:58.920> very<00:03:59.310> thin<00:03:59.700> you<00:04:00.270> can

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
screen protector it's very thin you can

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.200 
screen protector it's very thin you can
see<00:04:00.720> maybe<00:04:01.110> just<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.590> edge<00:04:01.710> right<00:04:02.040> there<00:04:02.280> but

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
see maybe just the edge right there but

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.670 
see maybe just the edge right there but
overall<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.870> doesn't<00:04:04.170> add<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.320> whole<00:04:04.560> lot<00:04:04.650> of

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
overall it doesn't add a whole lot of

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.990 
overall it doesn't add a whole lot of
weight<00:04:04.950> or<00:04:05.130> anything<00:04:05.160> like<00:04:05.610> that<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.970> just

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
weight or anything like that it just

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.090 
weight or anything like that it just
protects<00:04:06.600> your<00:04:06.780> screen<00:04:07.110> so<00:04:07.650> I'd<00:04:07.770> be<00:04:07.890> curious

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
protects your screen so I'd be curious

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.590 
protects your screen so I'd be curious
