00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.920
 yes 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.519
 Y 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.519
 ah 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.780
 in a new video and good friends in a 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.270
 boxing of this brand catcher 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.850
 the cat is the model game capture 'aces' 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.160
 and it's a capture in hdmi and good that 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.230
 capture completely in 1080p gentlemen 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.100
 It is characterized by being very compact and 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.600
 good for having a very good 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.520
 operation let's see the part of 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.520
 behind the box so they check a 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.840
 little more about us, including 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.090
 good as you can see here includes us 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.910
 what is the capturing in the guide 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.470
 Quick use a usb cable and HDMI cable 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.480
 also a cable compatible with what 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.010
 is the playstation as we can see in the 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.899
 lower part is compatible with mac and 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.760
 with windows 7 and let's proceed to 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.990
 open so they can check what 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.630
 it includes us inside 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.600
 to get this form we are going to put is 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.130
 one side and we're going to open it as they can 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.380
 see at first sight the captor is 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.760
 very very small very small we are going to 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.640
 compare it with the iphone so they can 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.220
 Check the dimensions is almost more 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.680
 small that the iphone as you can see is 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.060
 very very very light and very small but 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.320
 we are going to put you aside to be able to arrive 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.370
 a little more than that it includes us in the 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.410
 box 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.270
 let's open this part of here and good 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.070
 as you can see here it does not include what 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.620
 which is the cable that is connected from 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.750
 video 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.700
 this appears that is compatible with what 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.590
 what is the play station 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.560
 this cable here good music would do everything 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.200
 that more thoroughly in the full review here 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.470
 it includes what is an HDMI cable in 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.250
 the two ends 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.790
 and it includes a cable that is video 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.560
 component I think here is 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.440
 and you include another cable that goes 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.390
 connected from the usb to the capture 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.220
 it includes all the cables the advantage 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.420
 that we're just going to connect it and 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.100
 we can start to capture our 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.810
 favorite video game as you can see the 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.460
 capturing the truth is very very small 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.259
 and well this part we are going to proceed 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.910
 has an output of hdmi and a 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.740
 USB port to connect the 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.540
 computer in this part of here we see 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.610
 that has a bird entrance that is 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.320
 compatible with playstation and an input 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.970
 from hdmi who finds the xbox and flew 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.560
 different devices and well I think 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.180
 that he liked this little a boxing this 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.640
 capturing the brand the cat the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.200
 Ex game model capture and experience 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.209
 channel because soon we will bring 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.340
 a complete review about this 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.320
 Capturing ways to connect and more 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.209
 and we have to bring you a video test to 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.260
 can you see how it is captured and 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.840
 good as you see the game already 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.100
 captured with this capturing in addition 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.050
 of good comparisons that we will be 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.480
 doing between the game capture 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.620
 Javier left by a friend if he likes 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.450
 that its commented on the best part 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.800
 what they thought they click on the button 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.630
 I like it and they are new and neither channel clubs 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.489
 in the top part I do lack what 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.489
 come we have in a next video bay
