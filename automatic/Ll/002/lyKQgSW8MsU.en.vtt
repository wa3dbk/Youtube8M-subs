00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:09.830
 greet the pubs today I 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.830
 tell and show you how to make semi donku 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:18.390
 it is a combination of float gear together 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:23.070
 with bottom feeder gear let's begin 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:33.710
 we take the main line on which we dress 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:43.280
 100 threshold and then we need to wear 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:43.280
 on the line swivel with carabiner small 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.730
 so put on 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:08.640
 elect 5 put on the 100 threshold do as 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:15.880
 regular float gear 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:18.450
 on the sliding float dress up 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.450
 spring 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.670
 possible with a small ogruzka possible and such 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.670
 I often use exactly this 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.799
 So 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.680
 the spring is well dressed 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:53.250
 then we put on a sliding load for 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:58.259
 long casting can be worn more 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.960
 sinker and neighbor smaller mouth should 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:06.829
 be sure to let me slide 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.829
 I'll do a teardrop-shaped cruz 14 played 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:21.319
 so in practice and now we need 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:27.180
 tie the main line to this eyelet 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:31.739
 the karma of the sum of karma 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:35.040
 the main line and that's when the front sight 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:42.989
 we tie a leash with a hook and to 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:49.230
 to another and from prepared in advance the tents I 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:51.889
 tied only remains tied to 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.889
 this ear 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.150
 I will tie you to the clinic 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.190
 Be sure to wet the knot so as not to 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.870
 let the fishing line do this 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.310
 I will not 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:28.599
 so as not to tear your time as extra 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:32.370
 edge cut off have all the knot tightened up so 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.370
 look so far we have turned 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:48.069
 yet received such a construction as well, 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:51.060
 and here are two stoppers and a swivel grip 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.060
 almost ready remains to wear 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.060
 float 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:13.140
 how to dress everything and on the hooks dress 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:15.900
 any bait or bait 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.139
 I will wear 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.139
 foam ball 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:34.430
 feeder we fill bait can 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:37.730
 throwing the advantage of this gear in 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:43.610
 the fact that there is a feeder can fill 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:45.730
 prikormku and compared with normal 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.870
 float tackle we can so 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:53.290
 much further throw length 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.890
 the leash should not be too big 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:00.040
 In this case, I have four centimeters 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:03.110
 all told everything 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.800
