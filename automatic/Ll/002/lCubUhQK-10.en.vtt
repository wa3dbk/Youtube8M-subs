00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.080
 Hello everyone in this video I want to tell 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.830
 About Chinese Charges for iPhones and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.410
 ipads for example i have two 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.839
 attack from zaryadochki 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.720
 I will now briefly discuss the background and 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:24.590
 then we open them and see what 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.420
 inside man means ipad 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.009
 the original charge he lost went 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.590
 bought a Chinese one 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.690
 she worked for several months afterwards 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.460
 stopped charging but you can see that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.030
 body in a little yellowed stopped here 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:52.079
 charge went to the store with such 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:55.430
 charge buy the original here this one 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.070
 charging him sold as originally 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.609
 it cost there well I do not know whether it is two 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.129
 or three times more expensive than the same 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.460
 As if the Chinese would give him a comparison 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.780
 that's charging it, as it were felt that 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.860
 hands it is heavier that is by weight they 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:23.670
 different but now let me both of them already 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:26.869
 opened parsed let's see what in 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.869
 chinese charging 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:36.210
 let's say so without saying that she said 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.750
 chinese what do we have in general then 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.820
 minimum set of elements 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.790
 built on the principle of less 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.740
 it is better 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:51.689
 diode bridge 10 capacitor 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:56.130
 microfarad pwm controller a p 3970 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:02:02.450
 pulse rectifier transformer 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.450
 diode and capacitor on thousands of microfarads 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:11.820
 everything is more than nothing interesting to me 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:21.590
 no and now let's open the second 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:24.540
 which is supposedly original as they say 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.220
 find 10 differences 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.990
 the same thing absolutely 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.870
 the only thing that changed is this 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.570
 such an iron plate 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:39.610
 added thanks to which one feels 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:42.570
 that so the block weighs more and so in 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.570
 basically everything is the same 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.290
 capacitor for 10 microfarad 400 volts 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.010
 the same output capacitor is also 1000 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.950
 at 10 in general, the board is the same 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.340
 the only one diode bridge on top 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:06.240
 soldered and the capacitor put it here 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:09.300
 soldered on this side yes soldered 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.990
 the capacitor is soldered directly directly 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:19.570
 on the board and in principle they are absolutely 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:23.890
 identical boards are the same in general 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:28.150
 charge it burned most likely from 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.010
 overheating here as already said first 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.130
 the Chinese which she worked 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.200
 a few months but 2 by the way burned 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.200
 in just a few days and 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.900
 the problem she had was just here in the flat 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.620
 Soldering I already soldered checked works 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.800
 she blames in bad soldering here it is 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.870
 contract survey just wire hung in 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.769
 air, then there is some time content 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.580
 was then maybe so small 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:00.220
 hitting he jumped she stopped charging 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:05.380
 But in general, the whole difference is in such 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:09.690
 records which adds to the price that is 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:14.140
 price increases due to it at times 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.769
 let's say well by the way it became interesting to me 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:21.400
 control stands as said here 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:24.820
 control and p-39 70 I even dash to 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.970
 I found him in an hour and see what is behind 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:32.700
 we will open the controller now 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:35.600
 datasheet we have a microcircuit 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.590
 3970 is our 12 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.350
 cotton version that is basically 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.350
 declared current 2 amps at five volts 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.650
 this chip 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:53.540
 can provide application areas 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.700
 Beauty gets charging 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:00.560
 shells, but in general, here it is 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.750
 the simplest scheme and as we see here 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.480
 we have no optocouplers 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.390
 at the expense of which is carried out 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.960
 output voltage stabilization 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.610
 output voltage stabilization 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:16.040
 carried out by inductive coupling 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.940
 this is the secondary winding with which 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.520
 we remove the output voltage and 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.230
 auxiliary winding which from 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.420
 which is powered directly 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.240
 our chip through the diode and 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.750
 smoothing capacitor 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.040
 we see that with the output of this winding we 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.970
 the signal goes to 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:41.000
 resistive divider on chip output 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.370
 feedback feedback due to us 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.580
 and the output stabilizes 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:50.810
 voltage but in general, all I wanted 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:54.370
 say about it yourself charging 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.140
 performed quite high quality and 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.840
 unprepared 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:02.870
 if the buyer is not at hand 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:06.560
 original charging then seemingly pretty 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:09.680
 It is difficult to determine what product he 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.160
 is buying chinese or or is it 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.440
 original mode charging 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.250
 with which you can definitely 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:22.130
 determine what kind of charge you buy i 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.790
 I do not know if anyone has experience in this 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.910
 question would be nice if left 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.320
 your comment in the comments 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.910
 I hope it was interesting and useful to everyone 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.910
 thank you for your attention bye
