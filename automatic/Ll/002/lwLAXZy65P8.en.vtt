00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.239

 owl is running around a 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.860
 window or landing on the roof of a house and 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.770
 their cries announce the death of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.930
 a person consistent with this an old 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.829
 Mexican legend says that when the owl

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.240
 there are dark nights this legend has been 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.150
 deeply rooted in the imaginary 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.060
 generation from generation to generation. 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.040
 our days after what is relatively 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.869
 common for people 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.460
 when you see an owl near your 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.670
 house in bra 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.540
 the grid to scare her the next is 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.490
 black butterfly and many cultures 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.380
 polytheists in ancient times 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.840
 they believed that the black butterflies 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.640
 because of its color and conditions of the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.009
 animals that ate at night 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.320
 were associated with witches or gods 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.710
 of evil and were used by them to 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.020

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.270
 part of the previous belief 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.220
 not long ago there were people who 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.920
 when he saw one of these creatures come to 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.140
 his home interpreted the visit as a 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.009
 announcement of impending death among 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.719
 members of the family hens and roosters in 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.960
 certain sectors of popular tradition 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.950
 Spain believes that the cattle are 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.739
 sinister 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.470
 according to the studies of JosÃ© Miguel de Bar 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.270
 Shooting Basque culture 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.900
 writes to the following superstitions that 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.850
 there are the following locations in dollars 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.650
 the cock crow announces that it is something 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.870
 nasty is about to happen in the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.770
 neighborhood usually say that a neighbor 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.740
 gonna die 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.090
 in addition it is also believed that someone 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.170
 will die when you listen to a 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.450
 chicken will then sound it dry if a 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.550
 bat beats at night with its wings on 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.860
 window of the room where the patient 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.200
 find he will die that night 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.590
 will also die a patient in the same 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.290
 day if you see a white owl dogs 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.690
 if you hear a dog howling at night 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.300
 or barking at nothing is because he has 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.550
 seen a ghost plus a belief 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.920
 popular says that if a person seriously 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.680
 sick of the food for a dog and he 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.850
 accept it so it will live as long as 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.100
 that if he rejects she will die cats 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.070
 expenditures have been associated with death 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.380
 for centuries among the ancient Egyptians 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.330
 the cat was sacred to the point of many 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.209
 modified. 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.760
 When the cat died he was in mourning. 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.590
 tips your eyebrows later on 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.840
 mean age of cats was 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.060
 burned because they believed that 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.850
 were pets of witches 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.250
 which could certainly be possible but 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.560
 that did not make a cat an animal 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.630
 now beyond belief the cat really 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.090
 seems to make some sense so 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.100
 It is believed that when a cat is 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.739
 staring at a point where there is no 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.930
 nothing is because he is seeing ghost or 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:50.220
 his reaction was very strong he can 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.049
 there being horses when a demon 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.630
 horse puts his black eyes on 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.549
 a person in a funeral procession 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.170
 he is announcing the impending death 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.290
 of this person 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.330
 there were superstitions among the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.400
 ancient Babylonians when the physician 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.650
 I was going to a house to see the 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.019
 patient if he saw a hawk in the 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.330
 left side this meant that the 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.900
 patient who was visiting would 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.720
 die 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.700
 the same was said if a firefly were to pass 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.209
 above the patient from the right to the 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.090
 left 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.100
 snakes tells the legend that if a snake 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.009
 it seems a room is a sign that the 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.470
 deceased sold his soul to the devil 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.639
