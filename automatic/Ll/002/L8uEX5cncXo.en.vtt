you<00:04:04.850> have<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:05.120> remember<00:04:05.359> the<00:04:05.600> fishes<00:04:05.930> don't

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
you have to remember the fishes don't

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.750 
you have to remember the fishes don't
have<00:04:06.319> a<00:04:06.350> calendar<00:04:06.799> they<00:04:07.069> got<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.250> built-in

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
have a calendar they got a built-in

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.420 
have a calendar they got a built-in
thermostat<00:04:08.260> and<00:04:09.260> they<00:04:09.380> and<00:04:09.709> most<00:04:09.799> fishes<00:04:10.250> have

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
thermostat and they and most fishes have

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.210 
thermostat and they and most fishes have
like<00:04:10.609> a<00:04:10.790> uh<00:04:10.959> it<00:04:11.959> looks<00:04:12.139> like<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.319> temperature

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
like a uh it looks like a temperature

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.640 
like a uh it looks like a temperature
tolerance<00:04:13.760> slot<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:14.959> actually

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
tolerance slot and that actually

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.949 
tolerance slot and that actually
determines<00:04:16.070> if<00:04:16.669> it<00:04:16.820> gets<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.600> water

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
determines if it gets the water

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.440 
determines if it gets the water
temperature<00:04:18.500> gets<00:04:18.530> too<00:04:18.859> too<00:04:19.489> cold<00:04:19.820> they'll

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
temperature gets too too cold they'll

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.090 
temperature gets too too cold they'll
move<00:04:20.690> out<00:04:20.930> of<00:04:20.959> there<00:04:21.229> or<00:04:21.380> when<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:21.709> gets<00:04:21.889> too

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
move out of there or when it gets too

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.650 
move out of there or when it gets too
warm<00:04:22.130> we'll<00:04:22.580> go<00:04:22.700> out<00:04:22.820> there<00:04:23.090> where<00:04:23.270> that<00:04:23.360> water

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
warm we'll go out there where that water

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.600 
warm we'll go out there where that water
temperature<00:04:23.870> stays<00:04:24.410> in<00:04:24.620> their<00:04:24.800> slot<00:04:25.100> tool

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
temperature stays in their slot tool

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.719 
temperature stays in their slot tool
actually<00:04:26.000> stay<00:04:26.270> there<00:04:27.310> remember<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.430> snook
