hi guys my name is Elias I'm from apex

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.730 
hi guys my name is Elias I'm from apex
flies<00:00:11.910> here<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.360> Sweden<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.380> last

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
flies here in Sweden and this last

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.250 
flies here in Sweden and this last
couple<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.309> weeks<00:00:14.670> I've<00:00:15.209> gotten<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.990> lot<00:00:16.110> of

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
couple of weeks I've gotten a lot of

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.770 
couple of weeks I've gotten a lot of
questions<00:00:16.710> about<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.580> tube<00:00:17.940> flies<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.570> here

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
questions about the tube flies we here

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.350 
questions about the tube flies we here
in<00:00:18.900> Scandinavia<00:00:19.470> use<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:19.949> our<00:00:20.070> fishing<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.300> I

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
in Scandinavia use for our fishing so I

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.259 
in Scandinavia use for our fishing so I
I<00:00:21.840> thought<00:00:22.289> I'll<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:23.009> give<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> quick

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
I thought I'll just give you a quick

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.829 
I thought I'll just give you a quick
runs<00:00:25.019> through<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.560> system<00:00:26.210> basically<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.720> use

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:27.839 
runs through the system basically we use

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.429 
runs through the system basically we use
big<00:00:28.170> predatory<00:00:28.769> flies<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.289> 1215<00:00:31.289> inches

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
big predatory flies up to 1215 inches

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.440 
big predatory flies up to 1215 inches
long<00:00:31.830> sometimes<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.610> these<00:00:32.759> are<00:00:32.940> tied<00:00:33.240> on

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
long sometimes and these are tied on

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.440 
long sometimes and these are tied on
tubes<00:00:33.990> so<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.160> your<00:00:35.340> normal<00:00:35.790> salmon<00:00:36.240> fly

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
tubes so like your normal salmon fly

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.330 
tubes so like your normal salmon fly
just<00:00:36.870> about<00:00:37.500> ten<00:00:37.800> times<00:00:38.100> larger<00:00:38.400> and<00:00:40.340> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
just about ten times larger and the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.510 
just about ten times larger and the
benefits<00:00:42.300> using<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.990> is<00:00:43.320> basically<00:00:44.130> that

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
benefits using this is basically that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.960 
benefits using this is basically that
well<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.360> handle<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.870> flies<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.970> you

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
well you can handle the flies and you

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.200 
well you can handle the flies and you
won't<00:00:48.120> set<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> hook<00:00:48.630> in<00:00:48.780> your<00:00:48.900> hand<00:00:50.210> throwing

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
won't set a hook in your hand throwing

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.290 
won't set a hook in your hand throwing
down<00:00:51.450> wet<00:00:51.750> flies<00:00:52.080> into<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.770> fly<00:00:53.100> box<00:00:53.430> means<00:00:53.940> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
down wet flies into a fly box means that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.170 
down wet flies into a fly box means that
you<00:00:54.690> won't<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.200> a<00:00:55.560> lot<00:00:56.490> of<00:00:56.520> hooks<00:00:56.790> that<00:00:57.090> are

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
you won't have a lot of hooks that are

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.070 
you won't have a lot of hooks that are
rusting<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.580> another<00:00:59.580> point<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.330> that<00:01:00.600> you

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
rusting and another point is that you

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.340 
rusting and another point is that you
can<00:01:01.290> use<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:01.620> flies<00:01:01.860> so<00:01:02.460> much<00:01:02.700> longer<00:01:03.240> and<00:01:03.450> in

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
can use the flies so much longer and in

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.420 
can use the flies so much longer and in
a<00:01:04.680> way<00:01:05.990> it's<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.170> much<00:01:07.350> longer<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.770> mean<00:01:08.159> that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
a way it's so much longer I mean that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.370 
a way it's so much longer I mean that
normally<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.180> throw<00:01:09.479> away<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.689> fly<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
normally you throw away a fly with the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.150 
normally you throw away a fly with the
hook<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.770> shot<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.600> this<00:01:12.600> way<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.890> hook<00:01:14.040> is

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
hook is shot and this way if the hook is

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.980 
hook is shot and this way if the hook is
shot<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.820> changed<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.360> wire<00:01:15.600> trace

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
shot you just changed the wire trace

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.110 
shot you just changed the wire trace
swap<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.800> fly<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:18.410> you're<00:01:19.410> done

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
swap the fly and you're done

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.230 
swap the fly and you're done
another<00:01:21.120> good<00:01:21.450> point<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:23.190> you<00:01:24.090> want

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
another good point is that if you want

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.520 
another good point is that if you want
to<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.450> different<00:01:24.659> hook<00:01:24.960> sizes<00:01:25.230> you<00:01:25.500> can

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
to have different hook sizes you can

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.220 
to have different hook sizes you can
have<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.070> two<00:01:26.610> are<00:01:26.820> two<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.300> art<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.870> can<00:01:28.050> put

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
have a two are two for art you can put

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.380 
have a two are two for art you can put
on<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> stinger<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:29.640> swap<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.180> wire

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
on a stinger and you just swap the wire

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.800 
on a stinger and you just swap the wire
trace<00:01:30.870> put<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.980> fly<00:01:32.190> back<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.790> stick<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.659> hook

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
trace put the fly back on stick the hook

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.240 
trace put the fly back on stick the hook
into<00:01:33.870> the<00:01:34.200> hole<00:01:34.500> before<00:01:35.010> spine<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> hole<00:01:37.250> there

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
into the hole before spine a hole there

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.870 
into the hole before spine a hole there
we<00:01:38.400> go

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
we go

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.310 
we go
there<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:39.870> go<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.909> go<00:01:42.030> fishing<00:01:42.320> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
there we go and you can go fishing so

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.950 
there we go and you can go fishing so
the<00:01:44.010> thing<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:44.820> system<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.330> a<00:01:45.360> lot<00:01:45.600> better

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
the thing is the system is a lot better

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.310 
the thing is the system is a lot better
than<00:01:46.290> before<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:47.479> how<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:48.540> use<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.290> that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
than before and how we use it is that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.230 
than before and how we use it is that
basically<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.430> nylon<00:01:50.820> tapered

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
basically you have the nylon tapered

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.780 
basically you have the nylon tapered
leader<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:53.010> have<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> wire<00:01:53.430> trace

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
leader up here and you have a wire trace

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.070 
leader up here and you have a wire trace
with<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.120> hook<00:01:54.240> kind<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.479> air<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.930> loop

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
with the hook kind of air with the loop

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.200 
with the hook kind of air with the loop
connection<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:55.890> connected<00:01:56.850> loop<00:01:57.030> to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
connection you just connected loop to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.200 
connection you just connected loop to
loop<00:01:57.979> before<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.190> you<00:01:59.370> slide<00:01:59.640> on<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.970> fly

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
loop before that you slide on the fly

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.180 
loop before that you slide on the fly
and<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.630> slide<00:02:00.900> it<00:02:01.080> down<00:02:01.260> and<00:02:01.320> then<00:02:01.710> you're

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
and just slide it down and then you're

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.340 
and just slide it down and then you're
finished<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.640> go<00:02:02.760> fish<00:02:03.060> which<00:02:03.960> basically

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
finished to go fish which basically

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.830 
finished to go fish which basically
means<00:02:04.650> that<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:05.400> save<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:06.150> your<00:02:06.299> leader<00:02:06.600> as

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
means that you save on your leader as

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.889 
means that you save on your leader as
well<00:02:07.020> when<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.560> fly<00:02:07.860> swaps<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.899> swapping

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
well when you do fly swaps and swapping

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.690 
well when you do fly swaps and swapping
a<00:02:10.140> fly<00:02:10.379> in<00:02:10.440> just<00:02:10.799> takes<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> couple<00:02:11.340> of

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
a fly in just takes you a couple of
