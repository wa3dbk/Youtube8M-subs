00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.330
 hello, I'm simon dine muscle maker 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.800
 in this video it's about the form like 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.929
 you prepare properly for training 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.340
 The first tip I have for you 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.560
 you see that you are already somewhat 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.940
 athletic in the gym it comes 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.039
 maybe is that you even a bicycle 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.869
 Does that somehow take you to the gym 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.850
 jobs or at least relatively tight 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.680
 walking to the gym I'm doing 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.900
 quite often you have my workout bag 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.060
 I take the way home on the 1 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.050
 the other half on the other arm there 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.059
 my circle is up 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.350
 operating temperature and my fault that 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.570
 thereby sometimes even minimal 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.129
 Nevertheless , the whole thing is preheated 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.930
 important just the shoulder part warm 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.090
 just to get around your injuries 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.040
 in the shoulder belt area to prevent 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.539
 I always advise you the shoulders all 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.629
 so smear a bit 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.370
 just around the shoulder on the duration 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.140
 to prepare the following burden 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.430
 The shoulder is just that good 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.870
 like all the exercises in it, if you have one 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.579
 shoulder training mast back training 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.530
 or ambrus training the shoulder the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.390
 always plays a role because he just 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.489
 a little bit of bullets in all 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.140
 directions go forward 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.850
 once you find will also note whether it 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.799
 crack when it cracks you have to, of course 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.960
 watch that a bit more 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.659
 So it smears all sorts of things 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.729
 This is how it goes 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.650
 just such a process when banking 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.740
 that one is sometimes that such a 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.820
 bit simulated in warmup or after 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.159
 that one just happens to be so 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.689
 back exercises you look that one the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.759
 muscles get a bit warm 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.680
 Muscles and joints lubricate this 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.329
 very important to make the muscles true 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.530
 and joints lubricate me anyway 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.229
 still very important you think 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.670
 small mini shoulder workout in advance around 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.229
 just the shoulder in any case 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.299
 to get to operating temperature 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.619
 I have here a special act so as 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.869
 put the weight here at the side 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.329
 one can be any weight i 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.020
 believe between five and 35 kilo 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.890
 to adjust 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.659
 5 and 32 clock 15 clock we make 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.399
 Now just with twelve unit 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.500
 kilo dumbbell out exactly then all the time 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.479
 is certainly not upright now 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.130
 very little weight but just for me 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.630
 Alright when shoulder 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.140
 is reasonably warm you can also with 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.560
 weight up and up 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.560
 slowly back down 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.220
 upright stand position and 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.350
 body tension naturally hold up completely 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.350
 especially in the hip and trunk area 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.980
 It is very important that something is not 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.310
 working stuff is something to warm up 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.440
 sentence 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.670
 and you should always weigh less 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.040
 So for me, take twelve 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.480
 I'll say one and a half kilo for 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.610
 the warmup is all right 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.220
 otherwise I would suggest you by 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.290
 five kilos seven kilos eight kilos and the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.420
 area to first have the shoulder to 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.960
 If you are then appropriate 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.490
 you can choose pictures 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.100
 after a bit since then for the 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:02.390
 shoulder has made now first 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.830
 short again came in as if you 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.050
 then the shoulder reasonably with 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.610
 his warmed up there you can 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.650
 then a slightly larger weight 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.810
 looking but I advise you in any case 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.340
 take a relatively easy one 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.560
 weight that is a warm up set and 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:22.040
 no working set we are taking here now 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:30.470
 maybe first something around the 20 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:31.220
 kilo 22 unit kilo put us 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.200
 upright 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.640
 I'll do that a little bit off the page 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.850
 and then pull up this neck 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.670
 Trucks lifting this neck is just fine 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.910
 around the neck shoulder belt warm 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.910
 to get 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.190
 keep quiet little moment above small moment 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.739
 use the symmetrical load and 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.370
 tend to pull backwards so 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.480
 today are so extremely forward 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.920
 Ankle not so optimal yes 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.670
 tends to go backwards a bit 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.670
 pull in the neck 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.050
 so also a little comfortable 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.900
 what is there still can do is back 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.459
 go down a bit with the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:26.410
 weight i just live here now 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:30.520
 for fun, five kilo the things from the 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.080
 burden and my friend makes him so 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.790
 At the front lift I advise you that is 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.979
 already the last exercise for the format is 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.810
 because just at the front you should lie 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.070
 the shoulder already lubricated that 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.000
 That means the muscles have to be 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.620
 be preheated 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.930
 The joints must be lubricated 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.310
 so that nothing happens 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.930
 Of course, everyone can be a little friend 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.770
 also want to do with a long hand 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.200
 you can also see that you are 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.400
 Concentrated while keeping it together 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:03.880
 and thus a barbell simulated 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:08.320
 taken after one's shoulder 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.880
 Anything can be prepared 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.710
 you can do any exercise afterwards 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.139
 push it for it 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.590
 Cross the bus muscle training ops 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.970
 or whatever you can after that 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.130
 basically every training is done 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.150
 important is to ward off shoulder belt 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.330
 musculature at operating temperature 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.940
 bring joints lubricate very important 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.740
 then you can never before so go there 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.090
 My little warmup was there 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.280
 We can do it afterwards 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.280
 next video many greetings your simon
