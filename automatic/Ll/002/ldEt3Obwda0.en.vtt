00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.410
 good my beloved ones in the previous video we 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.610
 show 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.059
 for you that the bible is not 100% 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.029
 to inspire 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.279
 So, let 's go to the second part of this. 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.220
 study, reminding you that the intention 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.760
 this work is not to do you describe 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.539
 the creator but to prove to you that the 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.930
 bible is not 100% inspirational than the bible 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:38.230
 she has only the writing and 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.989
 human parts created to force with a 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.640
 religion 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.559
 proving the changes of the bible part 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.510
 new ones there 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:56.280
 the giants existed before the flood 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:59.920
 golden correct giants 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.180
 now comes the question will be that it was 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:09.840
 only Noah and his family and the animals 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:12.910
 of the ark that survived innovation 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.360
 Is it just not your family? 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.940
 only they took is his wife and his three 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.670
 children and at 3 o'clock and animals 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.490
 the rest perished all correct let's go 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.179
 pay attention is the giant already existed 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.240
 before I heard there 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.190
 so why even after the flood 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.759
 after that again because it ruined everything 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.700
 the Giants still exist're in 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.360
 number book 13 33 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.300
 if you have a bible how to check 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.000
 these mistakes made by the jerÃ³nimo priest 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.810
 and other producers mainly joÃ£o 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.369
 Ferreira de Almeida 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.690
 the giants existed before the flood 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.310
 come on 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.590
 Genesis 6 4 There were those giant days 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.149
 on land and also later when 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.819
 sons of god 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.759
 entered the daughters of men are in 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:13.000
 issue enter the ante the chances 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.270
 of men and their children 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.350
 these were the mighty men that were in the 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.880
 antiquity consumes fan of man of fame 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.190
 so it's talking about the giants here 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.180
 is not talking about dinosaurs 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.540
 when men the men of giant fans 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:36.670
 and a very tall men men 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:41.050
 only genesis 7 23 just looks so was 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:44.200
 destroyed every living being that 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.860
 was on the face of the earth from the 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.150
 man to the beast unto the reptile, and 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.690
 birds of the skies 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.500
 and were these land titles and became 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.590
 only he is not and those with him were 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.230
 over there 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.600
 only he was that everything was fine 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.750
 saying that the text at 17 there in his 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.980
 bible you see everything was destroyed 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.950
 so there are only three children left 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.260
 three minors and his wife and the animals 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:22.600
 the rest was that writing is everything 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.640
 birds reptiles perished from the sky to the 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.560
 waters of the silala but the giant with 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.840
 earth is saying that there were even the 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:35.650
 everything died, everything died 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.800
 we have there all the mess that man 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.650
 not of the total action of the douro in the planet 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.050
 according to some archaeologists and there 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.440
 lost if everything was over a year old 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:53.590
 the waters then lower these men 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:55.840
 giants could not bear to see a year fruit 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.209
 year without eating without food does not have 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:08.739
 Logic the year a saltwater with 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:10.239
 Low temperatures go there in numbers 13 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.560
 33 says 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.600
 we also saw giant sons of elop 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.239
 descendants of the giants and we were 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.140
 our eyes like a grasshopper and so 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.160
 it was also in his eyes that there 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.419
 a city 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.550
 after love that still exists 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:34.769
 giants 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.899
 so that's the problem 

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:40.389
 if the giant was all destroyed from glove 

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:43.449
 because after the flood a city 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.539
 check numerous 1333 check has not 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.329
 laziness to read reads because in 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.299
 certain point of glove there was a 

00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:55.439
 town that still had giants was more 

00:04:52.299 --> 00:05:00.969
 these giants were destroyed 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:04.179
 good not to describe here the scripture 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:06.549
 as the writer is mixed in 

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:08.979
 The Bible is like Jeremiah and we have to 

00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:12.550
 take away the precious from the view 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:15.309
 we have here an explanation for 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.989
 give it to you is what I think I did one 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:18.879
 documentary here on my channel about 

00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:20.559
 parades of fallen angels 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:23.259
 But to make this documentary 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:25.709
 I found enough information in the 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.729
 bible found in the apocryphal book 

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:32.050
 chosen by the Catholic church called 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:34.979
 book bloch day sure is just you to look for 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.669
 here you have an interest on the subject 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:40.719
 then we probably have the following 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:44.439
 after the flood 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:48.099
 these fallen angels will continue to have 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:52.899
 intercourse with other women 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:53.589
 and there the genetic question of 

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:54.789
 Ivorians 

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:57.699
 until the time came that they 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:00.219
 They disappeared is what I think 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:04.089
 What I'm trying to prove is that 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:07.209
 the priest made a mistake and a very error 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:10.719
 serious and this needs to be 

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:13.059
 carefully then by what gives the 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:16.629
 It was not only 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:18.939
 saved because if it was just no 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:21.999
 book number 13 is not your family 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:23.679
 in the number one book of numbers 3003 

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:25.959
 I was saying that after the flood in 

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:29.369
 a given city had 

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:35.860
 giant and pop cities are 

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:39.610
 fortified in the next video we go 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:45.779
 to bring you more explanations about 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:45.779
 the mistakes made by the Jerome priest
