okay<00:00:01.860> so<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.790> fire<00:00:03.000> up<00:00:03.149> these<00:00:05.240> 1989<00:00:06.240> 150

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
okay so to fire up these 1989 150

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
pushing in this button putting the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.640 
pushing in this button putting the
throttle<00:00:18.150> forward<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.080> little<00:00:19.199> bit<00:00:19.640> and<00:00:21.650> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
throttle forward a little bit and the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.150 
throttle forward a little bit and the
main<00:00:22.859> trick<00:00:23.189> from<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.789> cold<00:00:24.119> start<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:25.160> holding

main trick from a cold start is holding

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.970 
main trick from a cold start is holding
the<00:00:26.250> choke<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.880> side<00:00:27.680> for<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> count<00:00:28.920> of

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the choke to this side for a count of

the choke to this side for a count of
anywhere<00:00:29.250> from<00:00:29.310> five<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.880> ten<00:00:30.060> seconds<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
anywhere from five to ten seconds it's a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.310 
anywhere from five to ten seconds it's a
gravity-fed<00:00:31.669> system<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.300> takes<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.660> few

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
gravity-fed system so it takes a few

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.720

you don't really need to give them you

I<00:01:01.800> still<00:01:02.640> pushing<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> button<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.480> put<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
I still pushing the button and put the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.210 
I still pushing the button and put the
throttle<00:01:04.110> forward<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.589> because<00:01:04.890> even

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
throttle forward just because even

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.330 
throttle forward just because even
though<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.430> doesn't<00:01:05.580> really<00:01:05.700> need<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:07.340> give

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
though it doesn't really need it give

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.880 
though it doesn't really need it give
them<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> little<00:01:08.670> bit

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
them a little bit

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.580 
them a little bit
but<00:01:11.400> um

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
but um

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.529 
but um
these<00:01:14.219> motors<00:01:14.549> they're<00:01:14.700> good<00:01:14.909> they<00:01:15.119> smoke<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
these motors they're good they smoke a

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.179 
these motors they're good they smoke a
little<00:01:15.750> bit<00:01:15.929> they're<00:01:16.259> two<00:01:16.409> strokes<00:01:16.829> the<00:01:17.009> oil

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
little bit they're two strokes the oil

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.800 
little bit they're two strokes the oil
injectors<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:17.820> removed<00:01:18.119> off<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.450> them<00:01:18.539> so<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
injectors are removed off of them so the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.429 
injectors are removed off of them so the
fuel<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.229> mixed<00:01:20.240> just<00:01:21.240> because<00:01:21.570> it's

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
fuel is mixed just because it's

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.940 
fuel is mixed just because it's
typically<00:01:22.859> what<00:01:23.039> the<00:01:23.159> guys<00:01:23.310> do<00:01:23.609> apparently

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
typically what the guys do apparently

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.429 
typically what the guys do apparently
those<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:25.979> prone<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.369> go<00:01:26.640> bad<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.259> saves<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
those are prone to go bad and saves the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.639 
those are prone to go bad and saves the
motor<00:01:28.649> from<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:29.130> back<00:01:29.280> with<00:01:29.490> them

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
motor from going back with them

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.359 

the<00:01:31.979> gauges<00:01:32.250> light<00:01:32.759> up<00:01:32.969> at<00:01:33.780> night<00:01:34.369> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the gauges light up at night the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.730 
the gauges light up at night the
speedometer<00:01:36.110> doesn't<00:01:37.110> work<00:01:37.289> I<00:01:37.500> haven't

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
speedometer doesn't work I haven't

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.700 
speedometer doesn't work I haven't
worried<00:01:38.640> about<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.149> honest

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
worried about it be honest

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.349 
worried about it be honest
fuel<00:01:41.250> gauge<00:01:41.280> works<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.869> hundred<00:01:43.110> and

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
fuel gauge works it's a hundred and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:50.319 
fuel gauge works it's a hundred and
I<00:01:44.390> think<00:01:44.899> it's<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.079> 158<00:01:46.070> gallon<00:01:46.789> tank<00:01:47.350> so<00:01:49.329> it

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
I think it's a 158 gallon tank so it

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.550 
I think it's a 158 gallon tank so it
doesn't<00:01:50.630> look<00:01:50.719> like<00:01:50.869> there's<00:01:51.049> much<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:51.229> there

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
doesn't look like there's much in there

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.520 
doesn't look like there's much in there
but<00:01:51.770> there's<00:01:52.990> there's<00:01:53.990> more<00:01:54.229> than<00:01:54.320> you<00:01:54.409> might

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
but there's there's more than you might

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:05.330 
but there's there's more than you might
think

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.219 

and<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.940> put<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.299> gear<00:02:06.510> you<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:06.900> pull<00:02:07.110> it

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
and to put it in gear you just pull it

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.690 
and to put it in gear you just pull it
straight<00:02:07.380> back<00:02:07.710> without<00:02:08.130> pushing<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.670> that

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
straight back without pushing in that

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.440 
straight back without pushing in that
knob<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.209> push<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.479> forward

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
knob and push it forward

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:23.970 
knob and push it forward
so<00:02:12.050> it's<00:02:12.230> pretty<00:02:13.209> straightforward

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980
