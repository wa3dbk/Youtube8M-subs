00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.180
 were presented directly by 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.580
 jeanne Bucher that by a year 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.740
 testimonial for the lenovo yoga series 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.969
 includes many ways devices 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.760
 multimodal of lenovo 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.630
 we refer to the new lenovo I da 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.150
 tablet 2 with windows two different 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.010
 8 and 10 inch models a 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.230
 reaffirm what lenovo already has 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.820
 previously said that he had not 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.040
 no intention to abandon the 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.720
 industry to consumer tablets like the 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.780
 renault home operating system 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.880
 both have an ips screen then 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.190
 poses a very broad admonition 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.090
 good legibility even outdoors e 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.170
 resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.510
 apart from the screen we then have it 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.950
 spoken we see that the design is that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.480
 typical of the series in yoga tablet with 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.610
 this is in the cynical that also serves 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.670
 from stand 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.770
 and that allows you to position the tablet 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.510
 as less than three different with the 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.980
 then came a new way 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.520
 starting from this generation 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.460
 the mode and it is possible to wait for the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.740
 tablet through this connection to a 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.990
 any support for example when 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.990
 we want position in the kitchen to read 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.420
 a recipe is always allowed too 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.560
 the other three typical modes of this 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.860
 kind of pad 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.710
 this stand mode then there is the 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.320
 perfect team mode to read a 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.810
 ebook 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.390
 is the mode or closing the zipper yes 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.450
 hold it quietly 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.090
 in the palm of the hand the weight yes 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.760
 distributes towards the hand for a 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.340
 ergonomic handle 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.860
 from the design point of view we note 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.350
 that the versions with windows are 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.600
 completely lines 28 all black while 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.530
 the versions when the are gray like 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.060
 the previous generation 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.940
 there is much talk of inter-company fears 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.430
 we have a 1.3 frontal chamber here 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.900
 megapixel button to go back to 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.300
 start screen 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.370
 a display inside the frame 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.649
 friendly you go from one side to the other 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.460
 seamless and more 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.590
 low the two jpl speakers 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.900
 the ports include a microsd 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.730
 on the right side there is also a magris of 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.530
 and never that absent on the version 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.170
 Android 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.050
 this is the audio jack for headphones and 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.050
 we have a microphone on the back 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.840
 8 megapixel main camera 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.299
 the finish is different and the black finish 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.299
 with the chrome lenovo logo in the center 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:41.090
 below this door we find then 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.680
 a maitres of and a sim card slot 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.920
 for models that are provided 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.150
 connectivity or four agents 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.890
 let's take a moment to see the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.890
 system information 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.730
 the hardware platform is based on a 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:04.370
 intel atom processor az 37 45 with a 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.680
 maximum frequency of 1.86 universe a 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.959
 quad core accompanied by 2 gigabytes of 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:15.890
 ram and 32gb storage in the model from 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.239
 10 inches 3 16 gigabytes jumo of the vegetable garden 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.190
 inch 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.520
 other peculiarity of the 10 model 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:27.739
 inches and the fact of arriving already in 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:32.000
 bundled with this new cover keyboard e 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:35.510
 a mechanical keyboard then a 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.760
 hardware keyboard that is equipped with a 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.730
 magnetic mobile part that allows to 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.819
 hook it to the tablet and it can be too 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.060
 folded to protect the screen 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.970
 any risks 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.920
 other news another difference compared 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.709
 to the previous generation and now 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.569
 it recharges through a michael door by 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.030
 standard so you no longer have to carry 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.870
 with you the plug with the connector 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.430
 owner 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.430
 this 8 inch model of yoga 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.860
 tablet and two make windows from the point of 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.810
 view of the hardware platform 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.459
 functionality interfaces e 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.489
 perfectly identical only changes 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.980
 informed another difference though is that 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.150
 the taped open button will spino in 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.169
 this case is positioned laterally 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.540
 on the right side the zipper e da 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.550
 all this also allows in this 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.550
 case the man from ita eng 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.230
 robust materials on the back door 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.330
 to access the slots 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.110
 in short, a reduced version of the 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.110
 10 inch model 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.810
 but also a slightly more version 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.620
 economic because in this case it is 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.900
 without a bundled keyboard the 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.050
 price of the 8-inch model is 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.500
 only 249 euros while the price of 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:57.240
 10-inch model is 399 euros though 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.240
 also includes the keyboard
