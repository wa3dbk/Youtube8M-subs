some of these I don't know I don't know

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.470 
some of these I don't know I don't know
why<00:05:27.980> it's<00:05:28.280> so<00:05:28.370> difficult<00:05:28.460> for<00:05:28.940> me<00:05:29.150> to<00:05:29.270> film

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
why it's so difficult for me to film

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.530

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
because it's never difficult but I guess

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.120 
because it's never difficult but I guess
it's<00:05:32.750> just<00:05:32.780> when<00:05:33.050> you<00:05:33.230> are<00:05:33.590> sitting<00:05:33.830> down
