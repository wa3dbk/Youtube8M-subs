00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.190 
any future plans that I had involved
that<00:01:55.890> person<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:57.210> I'm<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.899> person

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
that person but I'm not that person

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.020 
that person but I'm not that person
anymore<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.920> therefore<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.399> future<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.820> no

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
anymore so therefore that future is no

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.170 
anymore so therefore that future is no
longer<00:02:00.299> possible<00:02:00.509> for<00:02:00.869> me<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.820> I<00:02:02.820> look<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
longer possible for me and I look in the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.670 
longer possible for me and I look in the
mirror<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.659> compare<00:02:04.020> myself<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.469> what<00:02:04.649> I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
mirror and I compare myself to what I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.520 
mirror and I compare myself to what I
used<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.719> rather<00:02:06.719> than<00:02:06.899> doing<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.380> this

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
used to be rather than doing what this

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.559 
used to be rather than doing what this
tree<00:02:07.799> does<00:02:08.039> which<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:08.970> not<00:02:09.239> make<00:02:09.390> any

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
tree does which is not make any

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.140 
tree does which is not make any
comparisons<00:02:10.170> whatsoever<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:11.150> responds

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
comparisons whatsoever it just responds

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.699 
comparisons whatsoever it just responds
it<00:02:12.270> heals<00:02:12.660> that

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
it heals that

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.130 
it heals that
and<00:02:13.890> then<00:02:14.549> it<00:02:14.670> sends<00:02:14.970> out<00:02:15.060> shoots<00:02:15.420> using<00:02:16.019> the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and then it sends out shoots using the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.960 
and then it sends out shoots using the
strength<00:02:16.409> of<00:02:16.560> its<00:02:16.680> roots<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.489> strength<00:02:17.819> of

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
strength of its roots the strength of

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.470 
strength of its roots the strength of
its<00:02:18.120> trunk

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
its trunk

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.390 
its trunk
and<00:02:18.629> all<00:02:19.079> the<00:02:19.230> systems<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.860> still<00:02:20.129> hasn't

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
and all the systems that it still hasn't

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.580 
and all the systems that it still hasn't
played<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.939> uses<00:02:21.510> them<00:02:21.659> it<00:02:22.170> takes<00:02:22.379> advantage

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
played it uses them it takes advantage

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.330 
played it uses them it takes advantage
of<00:02:23.040> them

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
of them

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.100 
of them
it<00:02:23.549> doesn't<00:02:23.970> stop<00:02:24.180> no<00:02:24.599> matter<00:02:24.780> what<00:02:24.989> the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
it doesn't stop no matter what the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.830 
it doesn't stop no matter what the
result<00:02:25.409> is<00:02:25.909> yeah<00:02:26.909> its<00:02:27.120> future<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.540> going<00:02:27.659> to<00:02:27.720> be

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
result is yeah its future is going to be

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.349 
result is yeah its future is going to be
different<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.860> what<00:02:31.069> so<00:02:32.069> do<00:02:32.129> you<00:02:32.370> no<00:02:33.180> matter

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
up okay remember this little tree and

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.089 
up okay remember this little tree and
send<00:02:55.170> up<00:02:55.319> some<00:02:55.500> little<00:02:55.739> shoots<00:02:55.950> of
