00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
speed and more propulsion you see when

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.110 
speed and more propulsion you see when
we're<00:00:13.230> working<00:00:13.349> with<00:00:13.650> beginners<00:00:13.830> they<00:00:14.549> tend

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
we're working with beginners they tend

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.300 
we're working with beginners they tend
to<00:00:15.240> do<00:00:15.420> one<00:00:15.780> or<00:00:16.170> two<00:00:16.199> things<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.920> cause<00:00:17.130> them

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
to do one or two things that cause them

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.640 
to do one or two things that cause them
to<00:00:17.430> lose<00:00:17.609> feel<00:00:17.970> for<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.300> water<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:19.170> first<00:00:19.410> one

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
to lose feel for the water the first one

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.800 
to lose feel for the water the first one
is<00:00:19.830> they're<00:00:20.310> missing<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.820> extension<00:00:21.480> part<00:00:21.630> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
is they're missing the extension part of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.590 
is they're missing the extension part of
their<00:00:21.990> stroke<00:00:22.320> from<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.279> entry<00:00:23.760> extension

catch<00:00:24.869> part<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:26.070> what<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> mean<00:00:26.369> by<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.880> if

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
catch part so what I mean by this is if

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.550

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
to enter the water and pull through

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.240

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
but in order to have great feel for the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.049 
but in order to have great feel for the
water<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:38.280> need<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.610> make<00:00:38.730> sure<00:00:38.760> you've<00:00:39.000> got

can extend straight forward underneath
the<00:01:08.939> surface<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:10.049> helps<00:01:10.409> get<00:01:10.560> rid<00:01:10.619> of

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the surface and that helps get rid of

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.469 
the surface and that helps get rid of
the<00:01:10.860> bubbles<00:01:11.010> from<00:01:11.310> your<00:01:11.430> hand<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.240> helps

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you start that feel for the water going

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.399 
you start that feel for the water going
into<00:01:14.729> your<00:01:14.880> catch<00:01:15.060> part<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> stroke<00:01:15.780> so

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
into your catch part of the stroke so

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.690 
into your catch part of the stroke so
that's<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> first<00:01:16.920> thing<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.220> second<00:01:17.670> thing

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
that's the first thing the second thing

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.249 
that's the first thing the second thing
is<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.509> want<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.750> make<00:01:18.840> sure<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.140> you're

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
is you want to make sure that you're

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.039 
is you want to make sure that you're
extending<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:20.100> armpit<00:01:20.640> depth<00:01:21.049> before

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
extending to your armpit depth before

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.260 
extending to your armpit depth before
you<00:01:22.170> start<00:01:22.439> your<00:01:22.560> catch<00:01:22.740> not<00:01:23.460> any<00:01:23.610> higher<00:01:23.790> not

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
you start your catch not any higher not

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.090 
you start your catch not any higher not
any<00:01:24.420> lower<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.500> beginners<00:01:25.860> again

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
any lower so with beginners again

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.330 
any lower so with beginners again
they'll<00:01:26.820> tend<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.299> come<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.979> extend<00:01:28.979> forward

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
they'll tend to come in extend forward

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.490 
they'll tend to come in extend forward
but<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.970> hand<00:01:30.210> will<00:01:30.360> rise<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.079> surface

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
but the hand will rise up to the surface

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.230 
but the hand will rise up to the surface
and<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.280> palm<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> hand<00:01:32.880> will<00:01:33.000> actually

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
and the palm of the hand will actually

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.270 
and the palm of the hand will actually
face<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:34.110> end<00:01:34.290> wall<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.799> don't<00:01:35.040> want<00:01:35.220> that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
face the end wall but we don't want that

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.130 
face the end wall but we don't want that
