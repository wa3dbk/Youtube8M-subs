00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.859
 how you put a stash on today I did 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.930
 went to the ikea this week and 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.859
 there I have this cupboard among other things 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.360
 purchased 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.860
 got all crazy about all that mess 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.540
 makeup in my room that I disagree 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.400
 more a room but also more a warehouse 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.020
 so i decided to have new cabinets 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.539
 buy my makeup and there is also a 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.490
 my makeup to go into mountains and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.470
 when I went everything on mountain in this cupboard 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.869
 I also immediately decided half away 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.789

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.170
