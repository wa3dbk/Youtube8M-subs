 firewood to food because they know

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.360
 use of firewood aromas are generated 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.920
 totally different temperatures and 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.470
 then it is generated as an environment 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.120

 flan of a lifetime but with a milk 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.899

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.429
 milliliters of normal milk 400 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.039
 milliliters of milk cream 400 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.700

 milliliters of coconut milk and 6 eggs 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.900
 double to 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.800
 we will not start you with the dessert 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.900
 we initially made the candy 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.940
 it is very easy caramel the measure of 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.670
 candy there is in the recipe 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.230
 half a cup of sugar for three tablespoons 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.970
 of water 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.790
 Tesla and you're going to make the candy and when 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.130
 be when it is well liquid we put it 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.810
 inside the container 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.070
 I recognize you a little advice country 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.610
 whenever they are going to be in family it is 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.460
 catch a large refractory mold 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.929
 throw all the bottom part and already 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.200
 then we make the dessert the four 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.210
 milks we bake it and leave it in the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.280
 one day refrigerator for another 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.920
 good mixing is very easy mixing 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.430
 let's take equal parts let's see 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.530
 to him the mold cited where milk comes 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.950
 condensed is the perfect measure is 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.880
 too little pot of condensed milk 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.650
 we fill the jar with condensed milk 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.240
 with the cream 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.550
 I wish I bought, I'm a friend of the 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.980
 creams because I get them in the 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.990
 East that is the cream of milk that 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.840
 Bag comes in a cream 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.330
 milk that is very thick and milk already 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.850
 Normal use lactose - free skim not 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.870
 but it's lactose because the other one is not 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.970
 of lactose dow and we take the coconut is 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.770
 important as we get milk 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.170
 in the market if we're not going to do what 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.530
 next we take the coconut we drill it 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.680
 by the three holes they have above 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.739
 we take out the liquid 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.680
 we burn it directly on over the 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.620
 fire the coconut is going to crack is going to 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.120
 touch is going to crack, we let it rest 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.569
 we start in pieces and codema in the 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.750
 blender in coconut water with coconut 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.540
 and we liquefy it and drain it on a 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.060
 sieve and that coconut milk that milk from 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.980
 Coco will use dessert as 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.230
 comes likes that likes a lot the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.780
 coconut when we throw the candy in the 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.200
 bottom of the container you can throw in 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.269
 the coconut library over and left 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.340
 also very rich I did not do it because I do not know 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.440
 to everyone because he does not like it and you see 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.440
 the feeling of the coconut 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.930
 and this is what we are going to do today 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.310
 to do here 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.310
 in these little molds 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.900
 this is similar as a mini 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.500
 as a double cream pro version of 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.230
 there is something very very crazy that to me 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.319
 I like to do in the restaurant is that 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.230
 this mixture to buendía before or I do 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:12.260
 in the morning and I put a branch of 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.670
 I really like we put a branch of 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.920
 rosemary 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.260
 where we made the mixture and will take a 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.690
 aroma and a very interesting aroma 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.540
 but we undo the mixture in the morning 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.919
 and we put the sprig of rosemary and give a 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.810
 very interesting aroma and already what 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.910
 we fill the molds and coughing and 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.430
 let's put the fridge in the oven 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.680
 water bath 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.000
 the trick when you make the big mold 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.030
 it is very easy all furnaces to 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.400
 different temperatures fight is you 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.460
 see that you are worshiping and after 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.460
 40 minutes they put the little knife if the 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.650
 knife comes out clean is already dessert 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.170
 they take it out they let it rest and they put it in 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.300
 the fridge is something very interesting with 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.670
 this dessert you are going to eat it 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.160
 freshly made I need you to put it 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.800
 hot and you eat it the next day 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.870
 you cold the same dessert you'll see it 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.390
 totally different they are as if they were 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.460
 two totally different desserts 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.550
 santiago tell us how did you do this 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.140
 Delicious, well, we started with something 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.330
 that we do not have it the ingredients list 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.760
 to make candy we take a 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.420
 half a cup of sugar for three tablespoons 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.240
 of water we make the candy nn not hit a 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.070
 that is not going to burn us and we put it 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.340
 at the source where we're going to do the 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.740
 dessert and it's very easy to mix the 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.480
 four different types of milk are 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.600
 beat with the egg 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.700
 it is put in the container we put it to 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.130
 bain- marie and when we put the 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.710
 little knife and we leave clean already there 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.260
 is the good dessert is very easy 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.320
 santiago comes from family and bakers and 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:50.050
