if I move it up into third position I

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.870 
if I move it up into third position I
get<00:03:58.360> B<00:03:58.540> flat<00:03:58.810> with<00:03:59.380> my<00:03:59.530> fourth<00:03:59.800> finger<00:03:59.980> B<00:04:00.610> flat

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
get B flat with my fourth finger B flat

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:09.960
