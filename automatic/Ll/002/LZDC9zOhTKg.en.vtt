00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.210

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:31.910

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.490

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.720
 then we will proceed to open it but 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.410
 can show you first what is the 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.310
 box 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.310
 how can you see 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.230
 and there on the back they have all the 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.590
 names of all the materials that have 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.590
 They left 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.060
 to play 1 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.660
 and here how can you see if you can see 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.170
 it says that they are around 60 hours of 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.080
 game 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.409
 so let's see what this 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.409
 edition 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.460
 and try to open it 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.920
 we are opening the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:41.000
 We took away the paper and the first thing 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.000
 we found is a book 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.620
 that can only show is a book made 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:54.500
 it's not that it does not have hard paste it's like that 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:59.670
 but if you have what is highlighted 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:03.090
 and we can see solid snake magic box 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.790
 and apparently it 's an art book where 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.069
 they appear what is part of the story 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.849
 of what is average also all 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.099

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.010
 elapsed 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.270
 until the last of 2010 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.190
 and here how can you see 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.410
 photographs of the presentations of the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.410
 previous metal that were for the play 1 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.480
 and here are promotional 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.569
 of each grant of what each goal is 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:56.079
 you can not go quickly because you do not 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.420
 can see is something something thick are if not 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.290
 I was wrong more than 100 pages as well as 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.590
 I was reading that says 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.010
 there what it brings is not seen more than all 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.640
 they are concepts and promotions of 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.640
 every metal 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.349
 and each one each one puts it and goes 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:24.590
 taking a brief history so it's 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:27.230
 he jumps very complete very nice 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.440
 and we give you something else 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.160
 interesting here are several characters 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.630
 of what would come to be 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.630
 the saga of natalia 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.150
 let's see what else it brings 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.300
 metal gear solid 3 goes in order in order 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.060
 the book from the first one that came out 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:55.330
 until the last and you can put the 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.240
 lovers of this saga is very well done 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.780
 with those who really know about these 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.480
 sagas 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.080
 so you can learn more about the story here 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.930
 is the last metal gear solid 'with of 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.159
 the patriots 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:15.340
 and well this is a good compilation 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:17.909
 before to warm up engines before 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.909
 come out new 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.550
 and here we have it, there is a 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.529
 image of the last material that is going to 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.999
 go out 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:39.409
 and there's the one in the book 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:39.409
 now let's what the egg 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.440
 says the same thing that I mentioned 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.440
 previously 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.539
 we are going to proceed to open it 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.370
 so they can see what it brings 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.840
 we give him 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.180
 I 'm going to remove the codes here 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.960
 about seeing but if it brings codes that in 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.639
 I have not seen really well for what 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.310
 they are but I think they are the games that are 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.530
 they can save in the playstation I'm going 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.540
 to read well then let's save 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.940
 these codes over here 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.200
 and here they have 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.200
 what the game 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.960
 apparently on a CD come all 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:56.770
 all the metals that can be observed 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:59.050
 all metals that have come out and in the 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:03.569
 another civilian comes only the metal gear 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.969
 solid 4 guns of the patriots 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:09.209
 and to whom 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:11.539
 that I imagine that a a letter of 

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:15.539
 discount for metal items that 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:17.159
 they have or that in some store but good 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.539
 we've only been together do not know if 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:21.779
 another country 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:25.169
 konami style store where you give one the 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:28.210
 15 percent discount when buying and 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.460
 enter the expiration date 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.970
 I'm not going to be any better because here 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.970
 there is nothing 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.590
 and here we have 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.960
 they burn it just like all 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.480
 today's manuals that do not work 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:48.840
 for nothing loaded with figures 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.840
 Well, maybe that would be all
