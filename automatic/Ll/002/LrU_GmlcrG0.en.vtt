00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.150

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:25.920
 but when it has the tail 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.920
 help to other service stations 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.939
 of some message 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.070
 why a man came to partial 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.930
 because of tell me your experience was 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.010
 normal 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.010
 and I have to transform 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.620
 for gasoline naguanagua they gave me 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.239
 I do not have many thanks 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.500
 and how many service rooms 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.250
 twitter 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.250
 in open interviews 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.500
 but that is very far until 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.790
 assured 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.790
 when you put yourself in the queue 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.909
 we have all the resources to be a 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.530
 country first world 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.549
 but unfortunately the administration 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.549
 from this lousy country 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.700
 and I tell him 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.290
 right now we are in a crisis we are in 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.450
 bad moments but we can 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.070
 get ahead with the struggle of all 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.740
 students 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.110
 always always being persistent up 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.300
 that you believe in the peaceful protest that 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.780
 I believe in peaceful protest because I 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.780
 I do not want to leave 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.570
 of valencia best 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.909
 if the pump is working 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.929
 main road 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.390
 the afternoon there was this country like this lady 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.190
 like good 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.070
 the surprise that suddenly there is no 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.060
 gasoline 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.960
 gas carrier we have nothing 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.960
 food 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.750
 have a message for the community 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.430
 it's in our country 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.599
 somehow we're going to have to leave 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:36.349
 How about your friend how are you tell me which 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.349
 it's the problem you ran out of gas 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.220
 one hour here in the collection that is without 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.040
 gasoline and now 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.750
 a love in the tail 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.750
 have you gone to other service stations 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.269
 and you think there are times 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.380
 to 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.150
 tell me have some have some 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.150
 word for the community some message 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.060
 then you call the protest 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.060
 peaceful 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.069
 certainly today is Friday, April 11 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.870
 in 2014 we are here in the branch of the 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.940
 petrol pump the station 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.910
 strange services of a new strike in 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.490
 valencia state carabobo good we 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.600
 we find in the presence of a tail 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.600
 which has a significant magnitude 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.910
 which is not justified in a country 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.040
 tanker because 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.220
 the reason for the tail is good there is no 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.090
 gasoline in all valence we have already gone to 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.190
 particularly been like in three 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.410
 gas pumps other stations 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.740
 service and nothing is achieved then 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.650
 we got here to this station that is 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.909
 full 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.879
 quality we find the 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:14.290
 mate marc as the reference with 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.340
 regarding his experience in this 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.829
 he highlighted the one that more or less when he has 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.639
 the queue in one hour and 20 minutes 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:26.270
 approximately and good is more than 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:29.090
 we live yesterday just yesterday 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.150
 the dialogue Minister Ramirez spoke of 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.889
 the energy sovereignty of the measures 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.159
 economic is a system that does not 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:41.699
 that seems to be shielded what the 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:43.949
 people live day after day in the streets 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.360
 our social struggle that with the 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.219
 concern about the problems that 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.009
 they live in our town and once again 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:51.389
 we see that government inefficiency 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.189
 oil reserves that have been said to 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.650
 they are the biggest in the world and we see 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:59.159
 like today there is no gas in the one water 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.749
 and in Valencia and San Diego, that is, 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.330
 a circumstance that we are living 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:05.789
 all the people of Carabobo on the day of 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.469
 today before the inefficiency of a government 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.750
 who could not distribute the gas 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.750
 that I can not produce the one that happened 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.069
 There are import percentages of 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.870
 gasoline and a whole disaster in which 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.069
 well we keep thinking about the 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.990
 voice of protest in the circumstances 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:23.759
 and seeing the Venezuelans and that this is 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.800
 an issue that is quite serious because 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:28.500
 affects the distribution of all 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.659
 products that are not needed for 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.229
 basic basket for good 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:37.540
 food and to be able to live well 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:40.240
 this is the gentlemen's face of scarcity 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.310
 a village a village with oil a country 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.370
 energetic that does not have to throw 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.810
 gasoline from Venezuelan cars 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.270
 draw your own conclusion 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.760
 conclusions and remember that the mother a 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.590
 project the homeland no example and we 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.000
 we are the necessary bricks in 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.000
 the construction of the country they deserve 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.110
 ah 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.110
 good
