00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
blast 2 now I'd like to state that since

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.589 
blast 2 now I'd like to state that since
my<00:00:22.150> previous<00:00:22.840> video<00:00:23.290> on<00:00:23.470> this<00:00:23.790> almost<00:00:24.790> 200

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
my previous video on this almost 200

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.889 
my previous video on this almost 200
years<00:00:26.110> ago<00:00:26.380> I<00:00:26.980> haven't<00:00:27.640> really<00:00:28.090> played<00:00:28.300> it<00:00:28.630> so

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:28.899 
years ago I haven't really played it so

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.569 
years ago I haven't really played it so
I<00:00:28.930> guess<00:00:29.349> if<00:00:29.529> you<00:00:29.649> haven't<00:00:30.009> played<00:00:30.250> it<00:00:30.430> in<00:00:30.489> a

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
I guess if you haven't played it in a

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.490 
I guess if you haven't played it in a
while<00:00:30.610> you<00:00:31.119> might<00:00:31.360> not<00:00:31.419> recognize<00:00:31.840> some<00:00:32.470> of

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
while you might not recognize some of

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.799 
while you might not recognize some of
the<00:00:32.649> changes<00:00:33.160> in<00:00:33.280> optimization<00:00:33.700> but<00:00:34.660> they<00:00:34.750> do

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
the changes in optimization but they do

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.229 
the changes in optimization but they do
have<00:00:35.110> a<00:00:35.140> full<00:00:35.440> changelog<00:00:35.890> on<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.340> website<00:00:36.910> so

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
have a full changelog on the website so

have a full changelog on the website so
if<00:00:37.390> you<00:00:37.510> feel<00:00:37.809> like<00:00:37.960> reading<00:00:38.170> through<00:00:38.469> that

if you feel like reading through that

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.620 
if you feel like reading through that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
you can I will mention most of the

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.780 
you can I will mention most of the
important<00:00:41.140> stuff<00:00:41.170> now<00:00:42.010> one<00:00:42.340> of<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.580> bigger

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
important stuff now one of the bigger

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.460 
important stuff now one of the bigger
things<00:00:43.090> for<00:00:43.300> people<00:00:43.540> who<00:00:43.780> play<00:00:44.020> this<00:00:44.230> game

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
things for people who play this game

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.290 
things for people who play this game
along<00:00:44.830> and<00:00:45.130> it<00:00:45.460> wasn't<00:00:45.700> necessarily

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
along and it wasn't necessarily

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.360 
along and it wasn't necessarily
noticeable<00:00:47.050> right<00:00:47.200> away<00:00:47.230> from<00:00:47.500> me<00:00:47.890> although

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
noticeable right away from me although

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.610 
noticeable right away from me although
again<00:00:49.120> hand<00:00:49.330> played<00:00:49.540> in<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:49.810> while<00:00:50.020> was<00:00:50.440> the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
again hand played in a while was the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.050 
again hand played in a while was the
fact<00:00:50.830> that<00:00:50.890> they've<00:00:51.100> improved<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.670> hit

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
fact that they've improved the hit

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.270 
fact that they've improved the hit
detection<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.350> it<00:00:53.560> might<00:00:53.740> just<00:00:53.950> mean<00:00:54.160> you

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
detection so it might just mean you

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.920 
detection so it might just mean you
won't<00:00:54.460> get<00:00:54.579> stuck<00:00:54.850> in<00:00:55.030> like<00:00:55.180> invisible<00:00:55.450> things

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
won't get stuck in like invisible things

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.840 
won't get stuck in like invisible things
and<00:00:56.410> hitting<00:00:56.920> enemies<00:00:57.340> becoming<00:00:57.730> easier

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
and hitting enemies becoming easier

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.850 
and hitting enemies becoming easier
picking<00:00:58.300> up<00:00:58.390> stuff<00:00:58.660> becomes<00:00:58.989> easier<00:00:59.350> there's

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
picking up stuff becomes easier there's

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.740 
picking up stuff becomes easier there's
that<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.160> other<00:01:00.310> yadda-yadda-yadda<00:01:01.000> but<00:01:01.570> one

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
that the other yadda-yadda-yadda but one

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.229 
that the other yadda-yadda-yadda but one
thing<00:01:02.050> I<00:01:02.200> did<00:01:02.320> feel<00:01:02.920> myself<00:01:03.250> is<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:03.940> fact<00:01:04.150> that

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
thing I did feel myself is the fact that

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.210 
thing I did feel myself is the fact that
they've<00:01:04.449> increased<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:05.140> speed<00:01:05.320> limitations

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
they've increased the speed limitations

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.960 
they've increased the speed limitations
which<00:01:06.790> means<00:01:07.090> now<00:01:07.420> you<00:01:07.840> can<00:01:08.380> just<00:01:08.710> zip<00:01:09.220> through

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
which means now you can just zip through

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.630 
which means now you can just zip through
the<00:01:10.240> levels<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:10.899> the<00:01:10.960> Spin<00:01:11.950> Dash<00:01:11.979> at<00:01:12.430> full

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
the levels and the Spin Dash at full

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.240 
the levels and the Spin Dash at full
speed<00:01:12.970> is<00:01:13.150> ridiculous<00:01:13.960> I<00:01:14.229> can<00:01:14.890> see<00:01:15.040> there

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
speed is ridiculous I can see there

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.160 
speed is ridiculous I can see there
being<00:01:15.400> many<00:01:15.729> ways<00:01:16.000> you<00:01:16.270> could<00:01:16.420> break<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.870> game

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
being many ways you could break the game

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.020 
being many ways you could break the game
by<00:01:17.500> doing<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.860> Spin<00:01:18.159> Dash<00:01:18.190> and<00:01:18.490> then<00:01:18.640> jumping

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
by doing the Spin Dash and then jumping

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.240 
by doing the Spin Dash and then jumping
right<00:01:19.210> away<00:01:19.510> it's<00:01:20.050> actually<00:01:20.440> a<00:01:20.470> tactic<00:01:20.950> I<00:01:21.040> use

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
right away it's actually a tactic I use

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.490 
right away it's actually a tactic I use
in<00:01:21.430> some<00:01:21.640> of<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.850> later<00:01:22.060> levels<00:01:22.360> because<00:01:23.049> it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
in some of the later levels because it

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.130 
in some of the later levels because it
just<00:01:24.100> skipped<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.729> lot<00:01:24.850> of<00:01:24.909> things<00:01:25.210> lots<00:01:25.990> of

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
just skipped a lot of things lots of

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.840 
just skipped a lot of things lots of
little<00:01:26.350> graphic<00:01:26.920> changes<00:01:27.460> have<00:01:27.670> been

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
little graphic changes have been

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.820 
little graphic changes have been
improved<00:01:28.210> for<00:01:28.540> example<00:01:28.990> all<00:01:29.260> of<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.560> shield

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
improved for example all of the shield

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.620 
improved for example all of the shield
rather<00:01:30.220> than<00:01:30.430> being<00:01:30.580> recolors<00:01:31.180> or<00:01:31.330> like<00:01:31.450> new

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
rather than being recolors or like new

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.539 
rather than being recolors or like new
sprites<00:01:32.049> and<00:01:32.290> stuff<00:01:32.500> when<00:01:33.040> I<00:01:33.070> recorded<00:01:33.490> this

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
sprites and stuff when I recorded this

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.030 
sprites and stuff when I recorded this
before<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.060> use<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:35.080> standard<00:01:35.740> dot<00:01:35.890> exe

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
before I use the the standard dot exe

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.000 
before I use the the standard dot exe
version<00:01:36.970> of<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.150> game<00:01:37.330> which<00:01:37.930> basically<00:01:38.650> in<00:01:38.890> a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
version of the game which basically in a

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.280 
version of the game which basically in a
lot<00:01:39.159> of<00:01:39.280> ways<00:01:39.430> makes<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.299> colors<00:01:40.630> kind<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:41.140> a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
lot of ways makes the colors kind of a

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.740 
lot of ways makes the colors kind of a
bit<00:01:41.470> weird<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.280> playing<00:01:42.970> in<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.150> OpenGL

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
bit weird and playing in the OpenGL

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.240 
bit weird and playing in the OpenGL
version<00:01:43.780> makes<00:01:44.260> everything<00:01:44.560> nice<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:44.799> smooth

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
version makes everything nice and smooth

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.830 
version makes everything nice and smooth
and<00:01:45.400> colorful<00:01:45.790> I<00:01:45.820> think<00:01:46.090> it's<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.510> change

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
and colorful I think it's a change

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.469 
and colorful I think it's a change
between<00:01:47.229> like<00:01:47.380> 16<00:01:48.070> and<00:01:48.400> 32-bit<00:01:48.820> I'm<00:01:49.119> not<00:01:49.270> sure

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
between like 16 and 32-bit I'm not sure

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.220 
between like 16 and 32-bit I'm not sure
though<00:01:49.780> but<00:01:50.500> one<00:01:50.710> of<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.890> biggest<00:01:51.189> changes

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
though but one of the biggest changes

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.630 
though but one of the biggest changes
people<00:01:52.500> will<00:01:52.620> probably<00:01:52.800> get<00:01:53.250> kicked<00:01:53.460> out<00:01:53.580> of

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
people will probably get kicked out of

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.360 
people will probably get kicked out of
his<00:01:53.940> last<00:01:54.900> time<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.320> said<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> didn't<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:56.010> about

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
his last time I said I didn't know about

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.310 
his last time I said I didn't know about
the<00:01:56.880> special<00:01:57.570> stages<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.170> game

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the special stages of the game

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.570 
the special stages of the game
originally<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.920> didn't<00:01:59.220> know<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.430> they<00:01:59.520> were

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
originally I didn't know what they were

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.420 
originally I didn't know what they were
I<00:02:00.210> thought<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.260> emeralds<00:02:01.800> was<00:02:02.160> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
I thought that the emeralds was the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.940 
I thought that the emeralds was the
emblem<00:02:03.240> thing<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.870> just<00:02:03.900> got<00:02:04.110> many<00:02:04.410> ago<00:02:04.650> well

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
emblem thing I just got many ago well

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.710 
emblem thing I just got many ago well
that's<00:02:05.220> actually<00:02:05.400> a<00:02:05.670> way<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.940> access<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
that's actually a way to access the

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.710 
that's actually a way to access the
special<00:02:07.110> stages<00:02:07.410> which<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.610> been<00:02:09.030> changed

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
special stages which have been changed

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.700 
special stages which have been changed
quite<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.080> bit

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
quite a bit

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.070 
quite a bit
now<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.340> special<00:02:11.910> stages<00:02:12.180> have<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:12.720> playing

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
now the special stages have you playing

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.320 
now the special stages have you playing
nights<00:02:13.680> into<00:02:13.980> dreams<00:02:14.130> or<00:02:14.880> while<00:02:15.030> collecting

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
nights into dreams or while collecting

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.530 
nights into dreams or while collecting
blue<00:02:15.840> orbs<00:02:16.290> these<00:02:17.100> are<00:02:17.280> really<00:02:17.850> enjoyable<00:02:18.300> and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
blue orbs these are really enjoyable and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.570 
blue orbs these are really enjoyable and
probably<00:02:19.440> one<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.620> my<00:02:19.770> favorite<00:02:20.130> parts<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.460> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
probably one of my favorite parts of the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.730 
probably one of my favorite parts of the
game<00:02:20.700> now<00:02:20.940> they<00:02:21.540> can<00:02:21.690> be<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> bit<00:02:22.020> difficult<00:02:22.200> but

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
game now they can be a bit difficult but

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.530 
game now they can be a bit difficult but
the<00:02:22.860> learning<00:02:23.160> curve<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.490> nice<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.270> learn

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
the learning curve is nice and you learn

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.900 
the learning curve is nice and you learn
how<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.870> maximize<00:02:25.830> what<00:02:26.130> you're<00:02:26.280> doing<00:02:26.610> in<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
how to maximize what you're doing in the

how to maximize what you're doing in the
end<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.750> course<00:02:27.780> there<00:02:28.200> are<00:02:28.350> seven<00:02:28.770> of

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
them and they grade you as well so you

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.900 
them and they grade you as well so you
can<00:02:31.110> go<00:02:31.320> back<00:02:31.470> for<00:02:31.530> high-score<00:02:32.100> runs<00:02:32.370> or<00:02:32.640> try

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
can go back for high-score runs or try

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.730 
can go back for high-score runs or try
doing<00:02:33.180> levels<00:02:33.600> as<00:02:33.720> quickly<00:02:33.930> as<00:02:34.080> possible<00:02:34.530> do

Hill<00:02:40.860> zone<00:02:41.130> has<00:02:41.370> actually<00:02:41.760> gone<00:02:41.970> through<00:02:42.000> a

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
Hill zone has actually gone through a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.810 
Hill zone has actually gone through a
few<00:02:42.480> changes<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:43.740> water<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.280> once<00:02:44.460> upon<00:02:44.790> a

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
few changes the water that once upon a

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.490 
few changes the water that once upon a
time<00:02:45.060> hurt<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.570> when<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.810> jumped<00:02:46.110> into<00:02:46.260> it

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
time hurt you when you jumped into it

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.880 
time hurt you when you jumped into it
now<00:02:46.770> has<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.490> jello<00:02:48.410> consistency<00:02:49.410> which

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
now has a jello consistency which

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.860 
now has a jello consistency which
essentially<00:02:50.580> means<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.060> if<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.420> jump<00:02:51.690> into

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
essentially means that if you jump into

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.590 
essentially means that if you jump into
it<00:02:52.140> you'll<00:02:52.680> start<00:02:53.130> slowing<00:02:53.550> down<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:54.240> then

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
it you'll start slowing down and then

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.510 
it you'll start slowing down and then
rising<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.320> top<00:02:55.350> again<00:02:55.710> although<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.280> don't

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
rising to the top again although I don't

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.220 
rising to the top again although I don't
really<00:02:56.880> think<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.150> jello<00:02:57.570> is<00:02:57.750> probably<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
really think that jello is probably the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.750 
really think that jello is probably the
best<00:02:58.500> way<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.709> describe<00:02:59.100> what's<00:02:59.400> going<00:02:59.610> on

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
best way to describe what's going on

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.060 
best way to describe what's going on
there<00:03:00.000> but<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.209> don't<00:03:00.420> really<00:03:00.570> think<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.830> can't

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
there but I don't really think I can't

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.040 
there but I don't really think I can't
really<00:03:02.250> think<00:03:02.459> of<00:03:02.670> something<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.390> say<00:03:03.630> to

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
really think of something to say to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.810 
really think of something to say to
describe<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.770> but<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.400> isn't<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.790> only

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
describe it but that isn't the only

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.570 
describe it but that isn't the only
change<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.750> techno<00:03:07.110> Hill<00:03:07.350> there's<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.800> big

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
change to techno Hill there's a big

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.090 
change to techno Hill there's a big
rearrangement<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.780> second<00:03:10.200> act<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:11.010> I

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
rearrangement of the second act and I

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.130 
rearrangement of the second act and I
don't<00:03:11.160> mean<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.550> familiar<00:03:12.180> layout<00:03:12.420> with<00:03:12.810> just<00:03:13.080> a

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
don't mean a familiar layout with just a

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.870 
don't mean a familiar layout with just a
few<00:03:13.290> changes<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.800> mean<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.100> entire<00:03:14.430> level<00:03:14.790> is

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
few changes I mean the entire level is

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.060 
few changes I mean the entire level is
completely<00:03:15.300> different<00:03:15.660> like<00:03:15.810> they're<00:03:16.380> using

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
completely different like they're using

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.340 
completely different like they're using
this<00:03:17.310> new<00:03:17.520> mechanic<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.390> completely

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
this new mechanic it is completely

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.190 
this new mechanic it is completely
different<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.489> new<00:03:20.670> jello<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.360> gimmick<00:03:21.900> all

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
different the new jello like gimmick all

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.320 
different the new jello like gimmick all
depends<00:03:22.890> on<00:03:23.010> how<00:03:23.250> high<00:03:23.520> you<00:03:23.550> jump<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.239> the

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
depends on how high you jump so the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.540 
depends on how high you jump so the
higher<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.750> jump<00:03:25.020> before<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.830> hit<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.160> jello

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
higher you jump before you hit the jello

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.900 
higher you jump before you hit the jello
the<00:03:27.390> further<00:03:27.720> down<00:03:28.050> in<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.380> jello<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.340> go<00:03:29.550> I

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
the further down in the jello you go I

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.390 
the further down in the jello you go I
was<00:03:30.660> like<00:03:30.840> being<00:03:31.230> able<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.440> say<00:03:31.590> jello<00:03:31.890> because
