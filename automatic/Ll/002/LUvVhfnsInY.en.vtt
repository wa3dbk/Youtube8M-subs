and the question specifically today is
carbonated<00:00:17.320> water<00:00:17.350> versus<00:00:18.039> regular<00:00:18.490> water<00:00:18.730> or

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
carbonated water versus regular water or

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.339 
carbonated water versus regular water or
sparkling<00:00:19.390> mineral<00:00:19.689> water

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
sparkling mineral water

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.800 
sparkling mineral water
I<00:00:20.380> know<00:00:20.829> Seltzer<00:00:21.519> has<00:00:21.759> sugar<00:00:22.089> and<00:00:22.329> stuff<00:00:22.539> but

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810

what<00:00:22.929> about<00:00:23.140> hydration<00:00:23.560> or<00:00:23.919> any<00:00:24.130> negative<00:00:24.820> to

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:24.999 
what about hydration or any negative to

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.409 
what about hydration or any negative to
drinking<00:00:25.449> sparkling<00:00:26.109> water<00:00:26.349> so<00:00:27.339> first<00:00:28.119> let's

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
drinking sparkling water so first let's

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.130 
drinking sparkling water so first let's
talk<00:00:28.539> about<00:00:28.599> it<00:00:30.149> no<00:00:31.149> there's<00:00:31.539> really<00:00:31.599> no

talk about it no there's really no
difference<00:00:32.470> in<00:00:32.940> health<00:00:34.020> benefits<00:00:35.020> or

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
difference in health benefits or

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.920 
difference in health benefits or
hydration<00:00:36.100> of<00:00:36.370> just<00:00:37.210> carbonated<00:00:37.900> water

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
hydration of just carbonated water

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.870 
hydration of just carbonated water
versus<00:00:38.500> regular<00:00:38.890> water<00:00:39.100> there<00:00:39.520> is<00:00:39.640> some

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
versus regular water there is some

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.910 
versus regular water there is some
research<00:00:40.390> that<00:00:40.450> kind<00:00:40.930> of<00:00:40.960> a<00:00:41.080> carbonation<00:00:41.710> and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
research that kind of a carbonation and

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.580 
research that kind of a carbonation and
the<00:00:42.340> fizziness<00:00:42.760> on<00:00:43.060> your<00:00:43.180> tongue<00:00:43.590> changes

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
the fizziness on your tongue changes

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.340 
the fizziness on your tongue changes
some<00:00:45.460> chemical<00:00:46.120> signaling<00:00:46.480> in<00:00:46.630> the<00:00:46.660> brain<00:00:46.990> and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
some chemical signaling in the brain and

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.340 
some chemical signaling in the brain and
taste<00:00:47.590> appetite<00:00:48.160> or<00:00:48.460> and<00:00:48.880> taste<00:00:49.810> receptors

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
taste appetite or and taste receptors

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.620 
taste appetite or and taste receptors
and<00:00:50.610> things<00:00:51.610> like<00:00:51.790> that<00:00:51.970> but<00:00:52.150> I<00:00:52.270> don't<00:00:52.420> think

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
and things like that but I don't think

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.270 
and things like that but I don't think
it's<00:00:52.810> that<00:00:52.990> big<00:00:53.170> of<00:00:53.290> a<00:00:53.350> deal<00:00:53.470> I<00:00:53.530> think<00:00:53.680> more<00:00:54.190> of

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
it's that big of a deal I think more of

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.270 
it's that big of a deal I think more of
its<00:00:54.430> kind<00:00:54.610> of<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:56.010> learned<00:00:58.170> behavior<00:00:59.170> of<00:00:59.890> you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
its kind of a learned behavior of you

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.930 
its kind of a learned behavior of you
know<00:01:00.370> you<00:01:00.430> like<00:01:00.760> things<00:01:01.060> or<00:01:01.180> you<00:01:01.270> don't<00:01:01.570> so

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
know you like things or you don't so

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.219 
know you like things or you don't so
that's<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.059> first<00:01:04.299> question<00:01:04.449> is<00:01:04.839> carbonated

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
that's the first question is carbonated

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.500 
that's the first question is carbonated
water<00:01:05.409> versus<00:01:05.980> regular<00:01:06.400> water<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:06.730> sparkling

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
water versus regular water and sparkling

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.970 
water versus regular water and sparkling
mineral<00:01:07.570> water<00:01:07.930> I<00:01:07.990> think<00:01:08.320> you<00:01:08.740> know<00:01:08.830> they're

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
mineral water I think you know they're

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.290 
mineral water I think you know they're
both<00:01:09.070> gonna<00:01:09.280> hydrate<00:01:09.640> you<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.880> same<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.120> think

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
both gonna hydrate you the same I think

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.480 
both gonna hydrate you the same I think
they<00:01:10.510> both<00:01:10.720> have<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.200> same<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:12.430> know

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
they both have the same you know

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.960 
they both have the same you know
hydration<00:01:13.210> stuff<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:15.010> options<00:01:15.610> like<00:01:15.790> that

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
hydration stuff so options like that

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.550 
hydration stuff so options like that
make<00:01:16.240> sure<00:01:16.420> you<00:01:16.540> get<00:01:16.720> you<00:01:16.930> know<00:01:17.020> unsweetened

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
make sure you get you know unsweetened

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.050 
make sure you get you know unsweetened
on<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:19.330> know<00:01:19.420> tonic<00:01:19.900> water<00:01:20.140> has<00:01:20.860> like<00:01:21.340> quinine

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
on you know tonic water has like quinine

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.570 
on you know tonic water has like quinine
which<00:01:22.270> is<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.450> sweetener<00:01:22.990> or<00:01:23.500> Quinn<00:01:24.280> on<00:01:24.430> or

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
which is a sweetener or Quinn on or

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.780 
which is a sweetener or Quinn on or
something<00:01:25.360> like<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:26.370> Seltzer<00:01:27.370> has<00:01:27.610> some

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
something like that Seltzer has some

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.219 
something like that Seltzer has some
sugar<00:01:28.000> in<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:28.420> just<00:01:28.630> make<00:01:28.810> sure<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:29.080> get

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
sugar in it so just make sure you get

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.840 
sugar in it so just make sure you get
just<00:01:29.560> straight<00:01:29.890> carbonated<00:01:30.430> water<00:01:30.460> something

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
just straight carbonated water something

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.990 
just straight carbonated water something
like<00:01:30.970> a<00:01:31.090> talking<00:01:31.600> rain<00:01:32.020> or<00:01:32.320> a<00:01:32.350> Perrier<00:01:32.799> water

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
like a talking rain or a Perrier water

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.160 
like a talking rain or a Perrier water
so<00:01:34.000> that's<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.420> first<00:01:34.690> thing<00:01:34.930> and<00:01:37.170> those

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
so that's the first thing and those

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.170 
so that's the first thing and those
actually<00:01:38.500> get<00:01:38.830> kind<00:01:39.070> of<00:01:39.130> expensive<00:01:39.670> so<00:01:39.729> if<00:01:40.060> you

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
actually get kind of expensive so if you

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.149 
actually get kind of expensive so if you
go<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.479> you<00:01:40.540> buy<00:01:40.570> like<00:01:40.870> a<00:01:40.930> $3<00:01:41.470> Perrier<00:01:41.950> water

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
go and you buy like a $3 Perrier water

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.620 
go and you buy like a $3 Perrier water
everyday<00:01:42.580> that's<00:01:42.700> pretty<00:01:42.940> expensive<00:01:43.180> so<00:01:43.360> one

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
everyday that's pretty expensive so one

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.410 
everyday that's pretty expensive so one
of<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.810> things<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.140> can<00:01:44.260> do<00:01:44.409> yourself<00:01:44.530> is<00:01:45.420> you

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
of the things you can do yourself is you

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.120 
of the things you can do yourself is you
can<00:01:46.630> go<00:01:46.900> and<00:01:47.170> buy<00:01:47.380> one<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.740> those<00:01:47.860> things

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
can go and buy one of those things

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.410 
can go and buy one of those things
that's<00:01:48.220> called<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.549> SodaStream<00:01:48.940> and<00:01:49.360> it

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
that's called a SodaStream and it

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.210 
that's called a SodaStream and it
basically<00:01:49.659> just<00:01:49.750> carbonates<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.530> water<00:01:50.740> for

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
basically just carbonates the water for

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.039 
basically just carbonates the water for
you<00:01:51.400> and<00:01:51.640> it's<00:01:52.330> actually<00:01:52.659> a<00:01:52.690> really<00:01:52.720> good

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049
