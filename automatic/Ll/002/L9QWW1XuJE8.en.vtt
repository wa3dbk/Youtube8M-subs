 headlines and relaxation control of 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.540
 substitutes was how the lion came back to the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.580
 activity to focus on what 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.920
 which will be the end of the 2012 closing 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.160
 in front of the surprise team of wolves uap 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.350
 since on the road he has left squads 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.390
 important common in necaxa the party 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.430
 one way between wolves and lion will be the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.560
 next Wednesday at 4 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.600
 populate and he back at 8 o'clock 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.590
 next Saturday night at the stadium 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.270
 Nou Camp 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.890
 the archer melitón hernández and the 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.840
 central defense oscar mascorro 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.249
 they agreed that the league 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.070
 any team plays you to death 

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:40.289
 although the lion has not received in both 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.719
 last matches both players also 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.760
 they mentioned that some 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.829
 details in the lower part since wolves 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.829
 It is a very dangerous team 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.540
 before a team like wolves with that 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.059
 very defensive system with much order 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.580
 you have to change the idea of a lion a bit 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.500
 be more cautious back maybe for the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.130
 backlash of wolves is what to be 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.719
 Attentive to the world beforehand know how 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.719
 know that the kickback kick 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.900
 this party has to face it from 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.840
 different way 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.650
 those days are going to serve to think about the 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.390
 meeting and being able to go to the town to 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.880
 look for the result the triumph that we 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.740
 know and bring home with a mail 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.720
 favorable will be fundamental the game of 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.240
 gone because something was what worked the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.140
 iu party 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.250
 we are focused on this first game 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.950
 in getting the result we want 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.320
 we do not think of anything else other than that 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.090
 and we are going to 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.340
 to make our our football the 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.420
