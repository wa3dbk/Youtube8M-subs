00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.190
 Hello everyone and how are you today 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.769
 let's make these mini hangers for the 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:12.030
 clothes of our dolls that are 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.030
 made with recycled materials 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.189
 to be our withered we are going to 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.770
 recycle these little hooks that come with 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.360
 stockings with clothes with clothes 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.990
 interior with some toys too 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:36.780
 they have these files like that pretty much 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.780
 how are these we are going to need 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.680
 we are going to need color cartons 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.020
 this for example to get him out of here from 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.300
 this monster high box can use 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.489
 cartons of boxes that have 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.940
 or they can also be common cardboard and what 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.940
 paint 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.149
 taking our cardboard we realize and 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.809
 let's make a drawing of a hanger 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.809
 with his line 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.750
 and we make a drawing more or less like that 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.340
 something like that more or less 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.640
 They can give you other forms if they want 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.350
 as well 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.960
 and then come on let's cut it 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.799
 after they cut it out we're going to 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.799
 draw it several times on another cardboard 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.860
 several times and we are going to cut them 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.210
 Y 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.340
 after drawing them and trimming them 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.020
 they will be more or less like that and mine 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.020
 They measure about 6 centimeters 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.250
 they will need two for each patch 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.130
 I'm going to cut all these little hooks 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.770
 what they have left for example but take 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.630
 a scissors and I will remove the parts 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.480
 below and above 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.180
 so that we only have the hook to 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.890
 this little so I'll leave now 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.890
 this he'll cut this part 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.220
 let's turn one of the 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.310
 underpants we're going to put on silicone 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.390
 hot 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.390
 hit the hook 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.530
 we are going to put more 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.360
 and we're going to hit him and the other one up 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.920
 and to decorate we can put a 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.920
 pretty or a ribbon 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.430
 so we have an early one, I'm going to 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:23.030
 show how to make another the other way is 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.030
 stick them together 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.459
 in this way 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.490
 and then stick the hook on top 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.830
 A) Yes 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.380
 and so our second one is ready 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.480
 parchita 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.500
 I did these two others following the same 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.960
 process 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.410
 You can also put cartons of 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.080
 different colors on each side or use 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.250
 cartons that have drawings for example 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.250
 this one has flowers and leaves 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.720
 and that's how our hangers are for 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.210
 dolls I hope you liked the 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.270
 I love them very much and see you 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.270
 next
