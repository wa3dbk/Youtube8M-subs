that and I don't like this right here
it's<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.320> little<00:02:46.489> like<00:02:47.489> plastic<00:02:48.170> fake<00:02:49.170> carbon

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
it's a little like plastic fake carbon

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.170 
it's a little like plastic fake carbon
fiber<00:02:49.890> piece<00:02:50.190> they<00:02:50.370> put<00:02:50.580> on<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.940> don't<00:02:51.090> even
