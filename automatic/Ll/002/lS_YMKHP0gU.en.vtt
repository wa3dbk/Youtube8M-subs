one shoulder blade on the ground but

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.750 
one shoulder blade on the ground but
apparently<00:03:50.770> I<00:03:51.070> don't<00:03:51.250> know<00:03:51.400> they<00:03:51.520> didn't<00:03:51.730> want

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
you to do that they're apparently they

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.110 
you to do that they're apparently they
ate<00:03:53.110> panic<00:03:53.560> as<00:03:53.709> soon<00:03:53.860> as<00:03:53.950> their<00:03:54.130> two<00:03:54.820> shoulder

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
ate panic as soon as their two shoulder

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.550 
ate panic as soon as their two shoulder
blades<00:03:55.300> or<00:03:55.570> one<00:03:55.720> too<00:03:55.870> little<00:03:56.020> instruction<00:03:56.500> the

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
blades or one too little instruction the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.230 
blades or one too little instruction the
ground<00:03:56.770> suzer<00:03:57.340> back<00:03:57.520> touches<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:57.970> ground<00:03:58.060> a

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
ground suzer back touches the ground a

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.780 
ground suzer back touches the ground a
panic

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:51.710 

I<00:04:48.500> don't<00:04:49.500> understand<00:04:50.099> I<00:04:50.400> don't<00:04:51.000> wanna<00:04:51.270> lose<00:04:51.509> at

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
I don't understand I don't wanna lose at

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.749 
I don't understand I don't wanna lose at
all<00:04:51.860> and<00:04:54.590> so<00:04:55.590> I<00:04:55.620> guess<00:04:56.070> that's<00:04:56.250> one<00:04:56.580> of<00:04:56.699> the

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 
all and so I guess that's one of the

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.520 
all and so I guess that's one of the
transitions<00:04:57.389> it's<00:04:57.539> hard<00:04:57.750> to<00:04:57.930> wrestle<00:04:58.289> they're

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
transitions it's hard to wrestle they're

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.110 
transitions it's hard to wrestle they're
going<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.770> MMA<00:04:59.099> they<00:04:59.490> gotta<00:04:59.639> learn<00:04:59.820> to<00:04:59.880> fight

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
going to MMA they gotta learn to fight

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.530 
going to MMA they gotta learn to fight
off<00:05:00.270> their<00:05:00.389> back

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.640 

the<00:05:06.540> other<00:05:06.660> interesting<00:05:06.870> thing<00:05:07.200> if<00:05:07.500> they're

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
the other interesting thing if they're

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.290 
the other interesting thing if they're
on<00:05:07.740> their<00:05:07.890> back<00:05:08.040> to<00:05:08.490> roll<00:05:08.700> over<00:05:08.730> onto<00:05:09.090> their

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
on their back to roll over onto their

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.060 
on their back to roll over onto their
stomach<00:05:09.780> as<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:09.990> defense<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.800> keep<00:05:10.950> from

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
stomach as a defense to keep from

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.190 
stomach as a defense to keep from
getting<00:05:11.220> pin<00:05:11.610> which<00:05:12.180> portion<00:05:12.570> MMA<00:05:12.900> would<00:05:13.080> be

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
getting pin which portion MMA would be

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:21.340 
getting pin which portion MMA would be
the<00:05:13.320> end<00:05:13.440> of<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.560> bench

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.890 

that's<00:05:22.350> wrestling
