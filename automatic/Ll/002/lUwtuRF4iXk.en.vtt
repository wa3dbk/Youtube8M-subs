onto<00:00:14.570> the<00:00:14.690> sv650<00:00:15.440> s<00:00:15.800> now<00:00:16.039> bear<00:00:16.189> in<00:00:16.219> mind

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
onto the sv650 s now bear in mind

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.860 
onto the sv650 s now bear in mind
there's<00:00:16.609> two<00:00:16.789> models<00:00:17.030> of<00:00:17.330> these<00:00:17.450> Bank<00:00:17.690> but

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:17.870 
there's two models of these Bank but

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.510 
there's two models of these Bank but
they<00:00:17.990> both<00:00:18.200> share<00:00:18.500> the<00:00:18.650> same<00:00:18.830> components<00:00:19.430> the

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
they both share the same components the

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.190 
they both share the same components the
only<00:00:19.760> difference<00:00:20.090> is<00:00:20.240> the<00:00:20.360> faring<00:00:20.780> of<00:00:20.930> course

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
only difference is the faring of course

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.740 
only difference is the faring of course
and<00:00:21.470> different<00:00:22.160> handlebars<00:00:22.580> so<00:00:23.539> we<00:00:23.630> have

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
and different handlebars so we have

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.630 
and different handlebars so we have
preload<00:00:24.140> only<00:00:24.410> in<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:24.590> front<00:00:24.830> and<00:00:25.070> we<00:00:25.490> only

preload only in the front and we only

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.820 
preload only in the front and we only

Suzuki you've been looking for you know
you<00:00:45.590> want<00:00:45.920> it<00:00:46.040> come<00:00:46.399> in<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:46.640> get<00:00:46.760> it<00:00:46.910> at<00:00:47.120> the

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
you want it come in and get it at the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.150 
you want it come in and get it at the
zoo<00:00:49.690> nothing<00:00:50.690> not<00:00:51.469> even<00:00:51.500> an<00:00:51.770> eighth<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:52.070> an

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
zoo nothing not even an eighth of an

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.880 
zoo nothing not even an eighth of an
inch<00:00:52.300> okay<00:00:53.300> so<00:00:53.960> with<00:00:54.110> dave<00:00:54.290> on<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.530> bike<00:00:54.680> we're

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
inch okay so with dave on the bike we're

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.000 
inch okay so with dave on the bike we're
at<00:00:54.950> 25<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:55.579> three-quarter<00:00:55.879> inches<00:00:57.010> extended

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
at 25 and three-quarter inches extended

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.260 
at 25 and three-quarter inches extended
let's<00:00:58.460> measure<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.090> SAG<00:01:00.940> twenty<00:01:01.940> four<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.239> a

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
let's measure the SAG twenty four and a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.890 
let's measure the SAG twenty four and a
half<00:01:03.909> so<00:01:04.909> we're<00:01:05.059> at<00:01:05.210> an<00:01:05.330> inch<00:01:05.510> and<00:01:05.659> a<00:01:05.690> quarter

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
half so we're at an inch and a quarter

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.500 
half so we're at an inch and a quarter
now<00:01:06.890> this<00:01:07.070> shock<00:01:07.340> is<00:01:07.369> a<00:01:07.549> gas<00:01:07.790> emulsion<00:01:08.270> shock

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
now this shock is a gas emulsion shock

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.000 
now this shock is a gas emulsion shock
so<00:01:08.659> I'd<00:01:08.750> actually<00:01:09.080> leave<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:09.409> here<00:01:09.680> if<00:01:09.830> you're

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
so I'd actually leave it here if you're

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.480 
so I'd actually leave it here if you're
a<00:01:10.040> 180<00:01:10.610> to<00:01:10.970> 200<00:01:11.630> range<00:01:11.810> on<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.979> showroom<00:01:13.340> floor

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
a 180 to 200 range on the showroom floor

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.609 
a 180 to 200 range on the showroom floor
this<00:01:13.760> bikes<00:01:13.970> going<00:01:14.150> to<00:01:14.210> work<00:01:14.360> perfect<00:01:14.900> because

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
this bikes going to work perfect because

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.649 
this bikes going to work perfect because
over<00:01:15.890> time<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.310> shock<00:01:16.580> will<00:01:16.909> soften<00:01:17.299> and

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
over time the shock will soften and

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.870 
over time the shock will soften and
these<00:01:18.229> kind<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.590> sharks<00:01:18.830> have<00:01:19.010> to<00:01:19.130> be<00:01:19.610> replaced

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
these kind of sharks have to be replaced

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:30.850 
these kind of sharks have to be replaced
about<00:01:20.180> every<00:01:20.540> 3,000<00:01:21.260> miles<00:01:23.619> okay<00:01:29.439> on<00:01:30.439> the<00:01:30.619> fork

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
about every 3,000 miles okay on the fork

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.320 
about every 3,000 miles okay on the fork
we're<00:01:31.040> just<00:01:31.189> over<00:01:31.430> three<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.759> half<00:01:31.939> inches

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
we're just over three and a half inches

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.120 
we're just over three and a half inches
so<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.570> spring<00:01:32.840> rate<00:01:33.020> that's<00:01:33.259> in<00:01:33.380> there<00:01:33.530> 407

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
so the spring rate that's in there 407

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.469 
so the spring rate that's in there 407
is<00:01:34.220> actually<00:01:34.549> really<00:01:34.700> good<00:01:34.939> for<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:35.240> weight

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
is actually really good for this weight

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.740 
is actually really good for this weight
so<00:01:36.470> if<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.220> again<00:01:37.580> if<00:01:38.119> you're<00:01:38.330> in<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.509> correct

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
so if you again if you're in the correct

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.960 
so if you again if you're in the correct
weight<00:01:39.049> range<00:01:39.259> for<00:01:39.530> this<00:01:39.619> at<00:01:39.890> about<00:01:40.159> 170<00:01:40.850> to

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
weight range for this at about 170 to

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.539 
weight range for this at about 170 to
200<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:42.200> spikes<00:01:42.470> absolutely<00:01:43.100> not<00:01:43.220> that<00:01:43.340> bad

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
200 the spikes absolutely not that bad

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.969 
200 the spikes absolutely not that bad
right<00:01:43.729> off<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.060> showroom<00:01:44.210> floor<00:01:44.450> as<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:45.049> now

right off the showroom floor as is now

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.560 
right off the showroom floor as is now
obviously<00:01:46.310> these<00:01:46.430> are<00:01:46.579> a<00:01:46.610> cult<00:01:46.880> bike<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.299> lot<00:01:47.479> of

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
obviously these are a cult bike a lot of

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.719 
obviously these are a cult bike a lot of
them<00:01:47.659> find<00:01:47.900> them<00:01:48.049> way<00:01:48.200> into<00:01:49.040> twisties<00:01:49.460> and

weight<00:02:01.369> oil<00:02:01.399> in<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.299> forks<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:02.780> start<00:02:03.049> with

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
weight oil in the forks to start with

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.700 
weight oil in the forks to start with
now<00:02:04.820> with<00:02:04.970> Haley<00:02:05.329> we'll<00:02:06.020> probably<00:02:06.200> see<00:02:06.439> a<00:02:06.470> lot

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
now with Haley we'll probably see a lot

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.839 
now with Haley we'll probably see a lot
less<00:02:06.740> sag

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.369 

yeah<00:02:12.849> we'll<00:02:13.030> basically<00:02:13.510> just<00:02:13.750> shy<00:02:13.989> of<00:02:14.110> an<00:02:14.200> inch

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
yeah we'll basically just shy of an inch

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.350 
yeah we'll basically just shy of an inch
we<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.099> great<00:02:15.370> deal<00:02:15.489> of<00:02:15.549> adjustability<00:02:16.120> on

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
we have a great deal of adjustability on

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.000 
we have a great deal of adjustability on
the<00:02:16.510> ramp<00:02:16.780> adjuster<00:02:17.290> on<00:02:17.319> this<00:02:17.590> bike<00:02:17.799> it's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
the ramp adjuster on this bike it's

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.839 
the ramp adjuster on this bike it's
really<00:02:18.340> steep

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
really steep

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.539 
really steep
so<00:02:19.330> as<00:02:19.450> we<00:02:19.629> remove<00:02:20.170> preload<00:02:20.799> it'll<00:02:21.069> soften<00:02:21.340> up

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
so as we remove preload it'll soften up

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.059 
so as we remove preload it'll soften up
a<00:02:21.670> lot<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.900> we<00:02:23.019> can<00:02:23.170> go<00:02:23.319> ahead<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.590> take<00:02:23.860> care

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
a lot so we can go ahead and take care

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.559 
a lot so we can go ahead and take care
of<00:02:24.129> it<00:02:24.280> at<00:02:24.400> this<00:02:24.549> level<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.120> good<00:02:25.269> thing<00:02:25.450> is

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
of it at this level the good thing is

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.720 
of it at this level the good thing is
with<00:02:26.080> this<00:02:26.260> particular<00:02:26.590> weight<00:02:27.010> class<00:02:27.280> as<00:02:27.579> the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
with this particular weight class as the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.759 
with this particular weight class as the
shock<00:02:27.940> ages<00:02:28.420> it's<00:02:28.870> actually<00:02:29.200> going<00:02:29.319> to<00:02:29.409> become

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
shock ages it's actually going to become

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:39.569 
shock ages it's actually going to become
more<00:02:30.099> comfortable<00:02:38.069> there<00:02:39.069> are<00:02:39.129> almost<00:02:39.340> at

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
more comfortable there are almost at

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.180 
more comfortable there are almost at
four<00:02:39.819> inches<00:02:40.000> in<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.540> forks<00:02:40.930> again<00:02:41.890> we<00:02:42.040> have

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
four inches in the forks again we have

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.670 
four inches in the forks again we have
the<00:02:42.310> adjustability<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:43.030> soften<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:43.690> up<00:02:43.930> so

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
the adjustability to soften this up so

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.210 
the adjustability to soften this up so
surprisingly<00:02:45.400> between<00:02:46.090> 130<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.989> 200<00:02:47.680> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
surprisingly between 130 to 200 the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.979 
surprisingly between 130 to 200 the
springs<00:02:48.579> that<00:02:48.670> are<00:02:48.819> on<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.120> bike<00:02:49.359> will<00:02:49.780> work

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
springs that are on this bike will work

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.289 
springs that are on this bike will work
reasonably<00:02:50.530> well<00:02:50.650> for<00:02:50.980> everyday<00:02:51.190> duty<00:02:51.730> just

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
reasonably well for everyday duty just

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.970 
reasonably well for everyday duty just
remember<00:02:52.810> if<00:02:53.319> you're<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.680> heavier<00:02:53.920> side

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
remember if you're on the heavier side

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.440 
remember if you're on the heavier side
of<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.340> spectrum<00:02:54.609> and<00:02:54.940> you're<00:02:55.030> gonna<00:02:55.150> take<00:02:55.390> it

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
of the spectrum and you're gonna take it

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.149 
of the spectrum and you're gonna take it
and<00:02:55.720> ride<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:55.870> aggressively<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.980> should

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
and ride it aggressively you should

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.569 
and ride it aggressively you should
upgrade<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.650> we<00:02:59.769> Kris<00:02:59.950> on<00:03:00.099> the<00:03:00.190> back<00:03:00.340> let's

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
upgrade it so we Kris on the back let's

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.509 
upgrade it so we Kris on the back let's
look<00:03:00.760> at<00:03:01.180> what<00:03:01.390> we<00:03:01.510> get<00:03:02.190> see<00:03:03.190> if<00:03:03.250> we've<00:03:03.370> got<00:03:03.400> a

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
look at what we get see if we've got a

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.160 
look at what we get see if we've got a
linear<00:03:03.879> spring<00:03:04.269> or<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.510> somewhat<00:03:04.930> progressive

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.520 

so<00:03:08.170> we're<00:03:08.349> at<00:03:09.299> instance<00:03:10.299> recall<00:03:10.720> oh<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:11.290> over

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
so we're at instance recall oh just over

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.599 
so we're at instance recall oh just over
an<00:03:11.620> inch<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:11.950> half<00:03:12.069> inch<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.459> three

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
an inch and a half inch and three

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.729 
an inch and a half inch and three
quarters<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.720> saw<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.049> spring<00:03:14.290> on<00:03:14.410> this<00:03:14.560> is

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
quarters so I saw this spring on this is

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.400 
quarters so I saw this spring on this is
that<00:03:14.889> really<00:03:15.400> stiff<00:03:15.700> which<00:03:16.450> is<00:03:16.630> good<00:03:16.840> as<00:03:17.079> the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
that really stiff which is good as the

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.520 
that really stiff which is good as the
all-ages<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:19.660> spring<00:03:19.959> will<00:03:20.109> support<00:03:20.380> the

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
all-ages the spring will support the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.659 
all-ages the spring will support the
back<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:20.859> bike<00:03:20.980> pretty<00:03:21.250> well<00:03:21.430> so

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
back of the bike pretty well so

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.690 
back of the bike pretty well so
surprisingly<00:03:22.239> enough<00:03:22.599> even<00:03:22.959> up<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.769> 240<00:03:24.459> the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
surprisingly enough even up to 240 the

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.750 
surprisingly enough even up to 240 the
bike<00:03:24.910> in<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.750> stock<00:03:26.169> format<00:03:26.799> for<00:03:27.549> this

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
bike in the stock format for this

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.559 
bike in the stock format for this
particular<00:03:28.060> way<00:03:28.450> it's<00:03:28.870> perfect

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.449 

however<00:03:36.260> in<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.620> front<00:03:36.920> we're<00:03:37.189> getting

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
however in the front we're getting

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.000 
however in the front we're getting
really<00:03:37.730> sure<00:03:37.909> to<00:03:38.060> travel<00:03:38.510> so<00:03:39.170> if<00:03:39.290> you're<00:03:39.439> 200

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
really sure to travel so if you're 200

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.000 
really sure to travel so if you're 200
and<00:03:40.390> you'll<00:03:41.390> definitely<00:03:41.569> be<00:03:42.170> looking<00:03:42.439> at<00:03:42.560> 15

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
and you'll definitely be looking at 15

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.520 
and you'll definitely be looking at 15
