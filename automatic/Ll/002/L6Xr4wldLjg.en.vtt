by pressing the B button which would be

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.520

attacks can often leave you wide open so

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.420 
attacks can often leave you wide open so
you<00:02:29.140> really<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.830> practice<00:02:30.010> an

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
you really have to practice an

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.580 
you really have to practice an
experiment<00:02:31.000> because<00:02:31.150> they<00:02:31.480> vary<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.560> much

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
experiment because they vary so much

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.980 
experiment because they vary so much
from<00:02:33.040> character<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.610> character<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:34.750> would

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
from character to character so I would

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.230 
from character to character so I would
say<00:02:35.170> get<00:02:35.680> into<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.950> practice<00:02:36.130> mode<00:02:36.520> see<00:02:37.060> what

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
say get into the practice mode see what

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.390 
say get into the practice mode see what
your<00:02:37.390> special<00:02:37.720> attacks<00:02:37.990> can<00:02:38.260> do<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.740> make

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
your special attacks can do and make

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.370 
your special attacks can do and make
