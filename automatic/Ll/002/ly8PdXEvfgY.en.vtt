search<00:05:58.220> calendar<00:05:58.760> it<00:05:58.880> is<00:05:59.060> basically<00:05:59.840> a<00:05:59.990> search

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
search calendar it is basically a search

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.909 
search calendar it is basically a search
engine<00:06:00.919> website<00:06:01.750> but<00:06:02.750> that<00:06:02.780> uses<00:06:03.650> a<00:06:04.600> ad<00:06:05.919> botnet

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
engine website but that uses a ad botnet

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.909 
engine website but that uses a ad botnet
that<00:06:07.750> really<00:06:08.750> really<00:06:09.020> really<00:06:09.110> is<00:06:09.560> annoying

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
that really really really is annoying

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.500 
that really really really is annoying
and<00:06:10.220> since<00:06:10.550> all<00:06:10.669> these<00:06:11.560> ads<00:06:12.560> on<00:06:13.190> your<00:06:13.510> search

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
and since all these ads on your search

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.050 
and since all these ads on your search
engine<00:06:15.110> page<00:06:15.440> so<00:06:16.310> it's<00:06:16.460> kind<00:06:16.850> of<00:06:17.000> really

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
engine page so it's kind of really

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.800 
engine page so it's kind of really
really<00:06:17.630> annoying<00:06:18.050> and<00:06:18.729> but<00:06:19.729> it's<00:06:20.000> technically

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
really annoying and but it's technically

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.159 
really annoying and but it's technically
not<00:06:20.960> a<00:06:21.169> virus<00:06:21.860> so<00:06:22.450> antivirus<00:06:23.450> software<00:06:23.900> does

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
not a virus so antivirus software does

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:29.110 
not a virus so antivirus software does
not<00:06:24.200> touch<00:06:24.860> search<00:06:25.400> conduit<00:06:26.889> so<00:06:27.889> it's<00:06:28.789> kind<00:06:29.030> of

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
not touch search conduit so it's kind of

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.540 
not touch search conduit so it's kind of
a<00:06:29.180> thin<00:06:29.479> line<00:06:29.750> between<00:06:30.440> the<00:06:30.770> virus<00:06:31.010> and<00:06:32.350> the

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
a thin line between the virus and the

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.820 
a thin line between the virus and the
the<00:06:34.550> official<00:06:35.539> or<00:06:35.690> the<00:06:35.870> correct<00:06:36.530> type

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
the official or the correct type

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.370 
the official or the correct type
software<00:06:37.660> so<00:06:38.660> it's<00:06:38.810> really<00:06:39.050> complicated

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
software so it's really complicated

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.480 
software so it's really complicated
malwarebytes<00:06:40.340> is<00:06:41.330> nice<00:06:41.600> for<00:06:41.840> that<00:06:41.870> because<00:06:42.200> it

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
malwarebytes is nice for that because it

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.210 
malwarebytes is nice for that because it
knows<00:06:43.490> more<00:06:43.970> so<00:06:44.210> it<00:06:44.300> really<00:06:45.200> detects<00:06:46.039> these

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
knows more so it really detects these

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.870 
knows more so it really detects these
things<00:06:46.490> and<00:06:46.700> will<00:06:47.450> actually<00:06:47.810> make<00:06:48.500> them

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 
things and will actually make them

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.500 
things and will actually make them
appear<00:06:49.880> as<00:06:50.090> viruses<00:06:50.750> in<00:06:50.870> its<00:06:51.020> own<00:06:51.669> little<00:06:52.669> scan

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510 
appear as viruses in its own little scan

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.680 
appear as viruses in its own little scan
and<00:06:53.900> it's<00:06:54.500> gonna<00:06:54.620> tell<00:06:54.860> you<00:06:54.950> some<00:06:55.130> malware<00:06:55.690> so

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
and it's gonna tell you some malware so

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.380 
and it's gonna tell you some malware so
