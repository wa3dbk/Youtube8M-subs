 The story of Leopold Engleitner 

00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:07.823
 Leopold Engleitner was born on July 23, 1905 in Aigen-Voglhub, Austria. 

00:00:08.051 --> 00:00:13.720
 When he resigned from belonging to the Catholic Church, religious intolerance again became known to him, 

00:00:13.855 --> 00:00:20.016
 and because all human rights were disregarded, he was met with harsh persecution on all sides. 

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:29.488
 One day a district official in Bad Ischl paid me a visit and said that I could no longer receive unemployment benefit. 

00:00:29.593 --> 00:00:34.668
 As a justification, he stated that there is no tolerance for any sect in Austria. 

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:46.531
 On October 5, 1939, a senior guard in the city of Linz came and told him the worst and most shocking news he had received in all his life. 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:57.898
 "Mr. Engleitner, I am very sorry, but in an hour and a half you will be transported by train to the concentration camp in Buchenwald. 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.844
 You can still get something to eat, because you do not know if you'll ever have a full stomach. " 

00:01:03.927 --> 00:01:12.075
 On Wednesday, October 9, 1939, Leopold Engleitner arrived at the Weimar railway station in Turin, Germany. 

00:01:12.165 --> 00:01:17.837
 Late in the evening he and other prisoners were mercilessly thrown into a prison truck. 

00:01:18.358 --> 00:01:23.983
 Then they were transported by the so-called Blood Way that led to the Buchenwald camp. 

00:01:24.092 --> 00:01:26.946
 They threatened me that they would close me with bears. 

00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:32.277
 At first I thought it was funny, convinced that they were just joking. 

00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:38.094
 Later, when I saw the bears in the box, I realized how dangerous I was. 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:49.019
 As a novice, I was assigned to a penal company and I was given a purple triangle garment that meant I was a Jehovah's Witness 

00:01:49.106 --> 00:01:54.019
 and a black dot that indicated that I was assigned to work in a quarry. 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:03.380
 At the Wewelburg railway station, where he had to pack his tools, Leopold Engleitner experienced again SS brutality on his body. 

00:02:03.947 --> 00:02:13.467
 One day, on the way home, he had to join another work unit, and because he could not keep pace, there was a small gap between him and the front. 

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:21.729
 The guard noticed, he became very angry, and brutally kicked him from the back with his boot in the underbelly between his legs. 

00:02:22.015 --> 00:02:27.136
 Leopold Engleitner doubled in pain, then collapsed without being able to move. 

00:02:31.173 --> 00:02:33.474
 I could not go any further. 

00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:35.857
 Others had to take me to the camp. 

00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:41.106
 During the evening roll-call I had to lie on the ground next to inmates. 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.609
 Later I found out that the guard crushed one testicle. 

00:02:47.815 --> 00:02:54.830
 In April 1943, Himmler stopped construction work and wanted to accelerate the closure of the concentration camp. 

00:02:54.972 --> 00:03:02.355
 For this reason, in the spring of 1943 Leopold Engleitner was deported to the Ravensbrück concentration camp. 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:09.156
 I was introduced to the medical officer of the camp. He asked me: 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.256
 "Are you still a Jehovah's Witness?" 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:13.968
 I said, "Yes, sir Hauptsturmführer" (captain)! 

00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:18.449
 "In that case, we can not fire you, do you?" - he remarked. 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:21.825
 He stared at me for some time until he finally said: 

00:03:21.885 --> 00:03:27.142
 "Let me tell you something, we are glad to get rid of such a wretched creature as you." 

00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:33.736
 In this respect, he was right because I was covered with ulcers and I weighed only 28 kilograms. 

00:03:36.698 --> 00:03:45.138
 After more than four years of the most inhuman and brutal treatment, Leopold Engleitner returned home on July 16, 1943. 

00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:51.316
 Then on April 17, 1945, Leopold Engleitner received a call to the army. 

00:03:51.624 --> 00:03:56.609
 Within six hours he had to report to the headquarters (...) in Czechoslovakia. 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.346
 Ever since I was determined not to participate in this frantic war, I had no choice but to flee to the nearby mountainous region. 

00:04:07.253 --> 00:04:12.538
 He escaped (...) to the forest on the southern slope of Leonsberg. 

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:17.389
 He was a deserter now, refusing to serve in the army because of his conscience, and everyone had the right to shoot him. 

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:22.430
 NON-FERTIVE WILL
