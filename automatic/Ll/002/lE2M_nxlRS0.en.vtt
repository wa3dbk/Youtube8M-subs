00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.040
 a positive shortcut in relation to a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.189
 structure or part of a structure 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.740
 architecturally that typologically by 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.499
 the materials used in both the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.139
 floors as in the raised walls 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:19.980
 that would correspond to principles of 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.970
 19th century this construction evidently 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.429
 was affected by the 1861 earthquake 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.859
 On top of those ruins was built a 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.980
 house that was on foot since the year 1900 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.579
 approximately until the earthquake of 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.680
 1985 with this I mean that the 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.289
 processes of alteration of the subsoil have 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.329
 been very important we are very 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.699
 happy with the results of that 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.370
 week of archaeological excavations that 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:51.270
 from the scientific point of view 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.399
 allow to base the decision that 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.250
 this place will be transformed into a center 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.620
 historical San Martinian reference 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.140
 for the most sacred city of the poster 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.030
 who was at the door 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.970
 by the way concentrated to the attention of 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.620
 many tourists so the findings of 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.869
 the construction materials are 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.690
 accompany with elements of the time 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.690
 always fragmentary as slabs of 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.729
 ceramics of metallic elements with the 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.650
 nail that serve as 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.110
 temporary diagnoses allow us 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.900
 know that they are materials of that time 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.530
 the floors that we find here is area 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.840
 of the house to finish 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.640
 from a good job he did 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.340
 a commission of historians 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.860
 architects and even archaeologists that 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.110
 called the municipality if it is an analysis 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.729
 that came to complement the whole process 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.890
 of research how was the form of 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.440
 the colonial city the streets were more 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.170
 narrow the largest apples and 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.940
 consequently in the facade line 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.280
 of the house was where it is now 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.690
 about half the street 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.030
 us from the development of this 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.740
 study of this commission we could 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.750
 pose as hypothesis that we 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.009
 We were in a transition sector 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.860
 between the gallery of the patio of the house and 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.560
 the main room and there we have detected 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.970
 these tiles cloths of these tiles 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.190
 rectangular to be able to see that 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.670
 would indicate this chronology of the 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.670
 building 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.520
 ceramic rectangular shape 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.950
 very similar to a brick but a lot 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.050
 less thick they have only about four 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.480
 centimeters thick and the size is 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.400
 very similar to a current albino 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.440
 key difference with the bricks of 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.020
 that era that looked a lot like what 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.070
 It is an adobe that we all know but that 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.070
 it was cooked for example from the 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.070
 bed sheet 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.900
 what is found belongs psychologically to 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.000
 an architectural structure that 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.250
 we can throw in 318 with which if you 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.720
 complements this data with which it has 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.980
 managed to establish whose is the 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.600
 property corresponds to the property 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.910
 it is very possible to say that it is highly 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.010
 likely to have innovation that we are 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.010
 in front of this house 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.659
 well the house has been analyzed starting 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.190
 of historical documents and I was 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:25.130
 composed of a main room 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.670
 in the front we are now a room 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.590
 main a jaguar an anteroom 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.680
 bedroom and asia l in what would be 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.050
 part of the neighbor's land towards a l 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.810
 towards the bedroom sector this 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.640
 ordered a patio that was developing 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.680
 towards the south that is towards the funds 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.140
 from this house where they surely had 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.810
 corrals of some elements of 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.410
 the infrastructure of home life 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.410
 in those years
