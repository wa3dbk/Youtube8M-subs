00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.300
 That's where Hankofen Steam Manager Richard Maierhofer seems to be 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.350
 Player-coach Thomas Prebeck wanting to tell her 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.219
 The 34-year-old will be the successor to Sepp Beller from next season 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.070
 compete 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.059
 which is known to lack the Oscar changes 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.839
 Noront also charged 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.900
 None of John Ford's time so easy 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.489
 at home old 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.979
 Aarau and Sion and more than the date led the Spree League and NTT times 

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:29.149
 invites the philosophy percent we pursue 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.969
 a the he pursues the WÃ¶rth Beige because it is very good together 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.809
 Schorling is rather very good at telling Longs years here as well 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.940
 He has traveled far and wide in Lower Bavarian football 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.100
 in a great way 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.900
 Ruthmann Tors think May Parma has a desirable candidate that will come our way 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.350
 Sammer very happy and the Maras for the successful work of Baylor Sepp 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.470
 Barth can continue Prebeck had recently often on Eislinger Bach 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.470
 stopped by to see his new team 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.650
 including on Easter Monday at the home game against SV Etzenricht 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.640
 but he got to see a better b-eleven 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.729
 not less than 8 regular players were missing due to injury the way one before 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.630
 the stately scenery of almost 600 spectators after just 60 seconds 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.659
 through this crooked thing by Etzenricht Marco Lorenz with 0 2 in arrears 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.780
 Hankofen Skeeter Marco does not look that good, though 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.439
 The wind also made its contribution to this unfortunate goal 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.549
 bespattered faces not only with puts but also on the home side 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.440
 Band especially in the further course of the game, the uncertainty was clearly felt 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.330
 The hosts were only able to win the best of their chances 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
 on Jaroslav Linhart with this header over the crossbeam 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.070
 Speaking of Lienhart the Czech will be the club after seven years in Hankofen 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.390
 after leaving the season he changes to the top field since NFC is abundant 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.720
 Zahnd 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.920
 This is followed by innovations received 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.620
 With the mushrooms percent Audi building from home so far, they're shying away from May 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.880
 A year will certainly be on us very high level 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:10.559
 Percent can play but 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:12.379
 the gamblers but the decision 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:17.049
 as soon as the bacon animals per cent a year EUR because they take it 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.559
 very much to owe 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:22.729
 and wish him all of course, all the best for the time in 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:26.399
 Zon's percent was not quite that far from Selb mushrooms too 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.189
 Has international matches at the front 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.269
 Nature, however, the only exit the remaining squad will want in the 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.499
 together and reinforce selectively 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.919
 with keeper Putz and the currently injured defender Markus Reiner here 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.239
 right in the picture you could already have two top performers for the 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.779
 tie to the club next season 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:50.829
 and how important a big squad is for a national league is what you see 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.579
 finally in the current situation 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.659
 because not least because of the personnel shortage was against 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.549
 Etzenricht nothing to bring in the end defeated the match association earned 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.489
 with 0 2 3 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.040
 nevertheless, the residue on the relegation rank is only three 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.349
 however, a possible march into the Bayernliga is possible 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.399
 Hankofen not an issue 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:15.099
 now, of course, it looks outward that we look totally mean around 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.650
 second worksheet would not be there 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.129
 but the staffing situation at the moment is all so serious that we are 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.409
 Thea from the club's side, he is not at all like her from him 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.249
 that Mahler Consumer play along 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:33.249
 may be three years to the last game 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.159
 we players come back and therefore pull 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:42.389
 10 March before there are the points in the room and our goal is the goal of the season 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.089
 May be among the top five of Dallas and that's the next 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.229
 Arno as before feasible 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.650
 The next step to this goal could already be on Saturday 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.689
 The Spielvereinigung Hankofen is playing at equal points 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.550
 Table third TSV Neustadt an der Aisch
