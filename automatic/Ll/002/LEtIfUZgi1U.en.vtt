I'm getting scarred on every time by the
by<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.750> CPU<00:01:28.229> guys<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:29.400> AI<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.420> ground

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
by the CPU guys but AI is a ground

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.590 
by the CPU guys but AI is a ground
through<00:01:31.590> ball<00:01:31.829> where<00:01:32.369> where<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> striker

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
through ball where where the striker

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.359 
through ball where where the striker

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
just runs in between my two defenders

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.440 
just runs in between my two defenders
and<00:01:35.479> walks<00:01:36.479> into<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.079> net<00:01:37.259> or<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.790> corner<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.939> I

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and walks into the net or a corner and I

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.910 
and walks into the net or a corner and I
just<00:01:39.630> get<00:01:39.780> absolutely<00:01:40.170> beasted<00:01:40.740> from<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
just get absolutely beasted from a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.490 
just get absolutely beasted from a
corner<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.210> rise<00:01:42.570> up<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> salmon

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
corner they just rise up like a salmon

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.429 
corner they just rise up like a salmon
and<00:01:43.829> not<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.759> straight<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.210> which<00:01:45.960> happens<00:01:46.320> in

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
and not get straight in which happens in

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.780 
and not get straight in which happens in
ultimate<00:01:46.740> team<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.189> I'm<00:01:47.280> guessing<00:01:47.430> that's<00:01:47.670> not

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
ultimate team so I'm guessing that's not

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.179 
ultimate team so I'm guessing that's not
the<00:01:47.909> Icefall<00:01:51.320> slump<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.670> signs<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.360> he's<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.810> a

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
the Icefall slump on signs so he's in a

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.230 
the Icefall slump on signs so he's in a
pretty<00:01:56.189> sure<00:01:56.490> yet<00:01:56.759> we're<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.060> going<00:01:57.210> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
pretty sure yet we're just going to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.010 
pretty sure yet we're just going to
accept<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.840> now<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.820> definitely<00:02:00.509> get

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
accept that now and we do definitely get

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.370 
accept that now and we do definitely get
Ferdinand<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:01.950> well<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.229> so<00:02:04.229> we've<00:02:04.350> really

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
Ferdinand as well and so we've really

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.679 
Ferdinand as well and so we've really
we've<00:02:05.040> really<00:02:05.369> strengthened<00:02:05.880> up<00:02:06.000> Frimpong

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
we've really strengthened up Frimpong

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.639 
we've really strengthened up Frimpong

pretty much the rest of the season at

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.010 
pretty much the rest of the season at
this<00:04:49.849> point<00:04:50.860> with<00:04:51.860> a<00:04:52.159> real<00:04:52.639> bad<00:04:52.909> injury<00:04:53.449> I<00:04:53.629> did

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
this point with a real bad injury I did

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.230 
this point with a real bad injury I did
he<00:04:54.409> did<00:04:54.590> get<00:04:54.710> injured<00:04:54.949> in<00:04:55.069> that<00:04:55.099> last<00:04:55.310> game<00:04:55.430> and

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
it didn't look too bad I don't think but

it didn't look too bad I don't think but
obviously<00:04:58.430> they<00:04:58.580> turn<00:04:58.789> around<00:04:58.879> and<00:04:59.060> said<00:04:59.240> four

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
obviously they turn around and said four

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.110 
obviously they turn around and said four
months<00:04:59.889> and<00:05:00.889> we<00:05:01.069> similarly<00:05:01.550> match<00:05:01.759> against
