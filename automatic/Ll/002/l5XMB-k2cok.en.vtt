smoke yes so when you minimize this you

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.869 
smoke yes so when you minimize this you
see<00:05:53.599> how<00:05:53.720> there's<00:05:53.900> two<00:05:54.220> this<00:05:55.220> will<00:05:55.460> not<00:05:55.669> show

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
this is selected left control X and then

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:01.420 
this is selected left control X and then
you're<00:06:00.319> going<00:06:00.409> to<00:06:00.470> want<00:06:00.590> to<00:06:00.680> click<00:06:00.889> the<00:06:01.099> pickup

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 
sound from the comments that someone

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:06.469 
sound from the comments that someone
else<00:07:04.470> made<00:07:04.740> but<00:07:05.280> I<00:07:05.310> like<00:07:05.639> the<00:07:05.789> sound<00:07:06.000> of<00:07:06.180> it<00:07:06.300> so

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.610 
I copied it but I'm not posting the mods

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.930 
I copied it but I'm not posting the mods
so<00:07:08.880> it's<00:07:09.030> not<00:07:09.259> technically<00:07:10.610> copyright<00:07:11.610> issues

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940 
so it's not technically copyright issues

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.050 
so it's not technically copyright issues
because<00:07:12.660> it's<00:07:13.320> private<00:07:13.560> so<00:07:13.949> then<00:07:14.789> you<00:07:14.880> take

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
because it's private so then you take

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.570 
because it's private so then you take
this<00:07:15.270> sound<00:07:15.479> file<00:07:15.780> and<00:07:16.169> you<00:07:16.590> copy<00:07:16.979> it<00:07:17.160> and<00:07:17.430> you
