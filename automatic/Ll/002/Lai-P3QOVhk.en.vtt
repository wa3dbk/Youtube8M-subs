00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.280
 very cool that they demonstrated a concept 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.579

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.460

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.909
 nothing of the kind or the novelty face 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.860

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.810

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.280

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.920
 powerful so know 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.760
 Powerful amateur is imposing this goat in the

 mobilizations are waiting for you 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.690
 tackles the battleship is from the heart in 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.660
 It's true now that building an army 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.640
 what they take is needed 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.209
 combatant who were taken from the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.190
 our world rooting for darkness and 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.720
 sent back to ask them to 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.670
 create your fortress 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.890

 again against Argentina just right 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.790
 Some people say they are the same. 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.250
 enemies but with different colors 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.230
 can be but that's what is part of lc 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.810
 n scut people who are new 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.970
 We'll have to wait for a new game. 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.180
 I've already gotten used to it comes from 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.500
 grandson of the band and now the baby 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.280
 ask weekly came something very 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.709
 interesting 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.180
 Let's go there yesterday, I do not think so. 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.299
 the day before yesterday 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.700
 The day before yesterday, if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:53.459
 the band posted on her official twitter 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:56.760
 it's a message talking about the 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:01.109
 titles or the people who are like 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.569
 talk using dx leg and internet understanding 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.489
 In order to win in the crison, I already 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.170
 I was going to say that I came to 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.730
 I meet people right there 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.560
 who was with the internet that 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.120
 visit was not my leg's fault. 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.840
 people's internet were 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.720
 weird 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.609
 was very strange when 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.830
 mentioned some said it was travel 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.919
 my name was internet and I even commented 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.100
 with the evil of the USA x take it really 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.190
 verified 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.840
 he saw in Christ what he was and that 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.150
 When I tell you a crucible and that 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.510
 also enters the way of gall and brings a 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.940
 rifle and certain emphasized in general is the band 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.389
 alban for network 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.699
 shams arya well this a good cross or 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.300
 are bans for manipulation of 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:52.020
 internet connection is coming is 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.700
 They are packed in the crucible, more details 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.820
 tomorrow the weekly ticket and that they 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.290
 brought and I was very anxious until 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.479
 I posted it there on Facebook fanpage 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.340
 no games if you do not like what 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.870
 Are you wasting your time for you? 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.320
 What a way to date, you 're making a fool of yourself. 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.270
 because I posted business here 22 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.520
 hours behind the recording victory here 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.370
 the first brush strokes 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.320
 first people to post this so 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.740
 Are you wasting your time if you did not 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.560
 enjoy a course there and do not waste time and 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.870
 here at the weekend the band brought 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.520
 begin the first paragraph that I 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.010
 I think the most important thing is 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.620
 committed to the protection of 10 thousand 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.490
 against cheaters enjoyed fruit 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.010
 of your game 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.380
 just play just this is all that 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.160
 we asked for short of their own commitment 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.370
 of honor 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.650
 Let's take action ourselves and so on. 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.240
 still it is not a thing like 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.590
 do what we like to do and 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.070
 certainly something we never go 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.720
 quantify to describe in detail 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.669
 distressing the damned must remain 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.880
 anonymous or people should remain 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:59.400
 anonymous your nefarious actions a mystery 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.050
 So is the band just brought that by saying 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.970
 so basically you look I am 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.330
 eye and do not shit 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.820
 if this is going to hurt I do not know 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.039
 The trio fled bad but it was because it was 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.780
 something much bigger was something that if you 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.750
 win if you win an episode that 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.120
 you damage the gameplay all the rest 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.780
 of people's gameplay was something 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.690
 heavier the thugs came came the 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.030
 people were banished and felt on the skin 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:30.420
 to feel on the skin 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:33.150
 What you do is if you did, it was not all 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.700
 world but many people have been 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.010
 trouxer detran also prioritized in general 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.260
 It is of all game modes but it is very 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.290
 Good thing the guys will learn how to play 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.090
 Honestly sure that they get everyone 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:49.110
 but that catches someone with visibility into 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:51.300
 I know there take some to give to the 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.820
 others realizing that they are watching 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:07:04.530
 I really think the band a band 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:08.250
 will only ban someone just chat chat chat only 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:11.280
 Talk to get enough with the 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.620
 Believe me, I hope she 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.590
 someone who uses it to be 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:20.490
 using it as a bathroom but I 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:24.120
 I think she's going to ban not just wait 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:27.060
 to see you think the band is going to 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.190
 Someone in that crucible 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.060
 I do not know of comments there and I 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.640
 Tell me guys 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.590

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.440
