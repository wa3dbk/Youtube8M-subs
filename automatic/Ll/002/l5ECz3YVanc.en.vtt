00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.290 
got a nice strong clicker it's got a
nice<00:00:45.780> full<00:00:46.320> spin<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.340> not<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> really<00:00:48.120> that

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
nice full spin it's not a really that

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.319 
nice full spin it's not a really that
you're<00:00:48.480> going<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.780> casting<00:00:49.500> but<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:51.059> it

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
you're going to be casting but it is it

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.779 
you're going to be casting but it is it
is<00:00:51.510> good<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:53.219> side<00:00:53.520> plate

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
I think these are the fast gears for the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.150 
I think these are the fast gears for the
six<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.370> three<00:00:56.640> point<00:00:56.879> two<00:00:57.149> five<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.840> one

six of the three point two five to one

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.349 
six of the three point two five to one
