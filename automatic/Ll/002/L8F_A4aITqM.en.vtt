00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.730
 techno 01net chain and welcome to 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.230
 roland garros for this 2013 edition a 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.300
 roland garros who again is a 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.099
 Technological Innovation Lab 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.809
 and we will offer you throughout 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.970
 these next few days some reports 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.320
 dedicated to these innovations and we will 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.689
 start with the techno applied to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.279
 tennis proper with ibm who 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.880
 for several years follows the players 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.880
 in real time 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.460
 and watch on the 01net techno channel 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.440
 it's the qg actually bmc there actually 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.480
 that engineers analyze all 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.129
 player data for after well 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.500
 we extract precise statistics 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.230
 yes real-time analysis and analyzes 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.420
 over time since all the last 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.309
 years and that's what allows each 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.140
 year at ibm to establish what they 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.350
 call in particular the keys of the match 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.199
 explanations ibm has collected since eight 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.129
 years 41 million points on all 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.339
 grand slam tournaments 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.720
 these criteria are keys around the 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.479
 percentage of first services earned 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.940
 back on the opposing service of 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.610
 speed of service there are in total 50 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.039
 keys and the system will choose the three 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.700
 most relevant keys according to 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:18.860
 his opponent 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.930
 we take the example of the gilles match 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.979
 simon and roger federer who was pretty 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.369
 interesting what she was in five 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.920
 sets 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.929
 the key one for gilles simon was to 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.289
 win over 48% of a fist on a 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.789
 Winning blow or a fault caused 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.039
 he is also asked to win more 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.479
 28% points on the first service 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.899
 of his opponent ie to have 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.780
 respondent finally facing federer 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.250
 and then to hold the seven in the 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.720
 length maybe to tire a little 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.759
 red and that was maybe the council 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.860
 which was distilled through him 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.630
 this key so how do you collect 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.190
 these data then these data are 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.479
 collected first of all so 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.739
 automatic with regard to the 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.179
 speed of services since we have 

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:58.009
 radar in the middle of the backdrop 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.840
 of short who will measure this speed 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.880
 which will be uploaded immediately and we 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.440
 also have markers markers 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.330
 these are two people on the edge of 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.789
 short each with a console 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.759
 digital and who will note the whole 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.989
 quality of points ace 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.090
 a direct fault a fault caused 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.780
 in which third of the service square the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.760
 ball landed 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.500
 the forehands and backhands is counted the 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.330
 number of changes then in any case we 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.800
 has the impression that under the magnifying glass of the bm 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.200
 the players are a bit like 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.090
 laboratory rats which we examine the 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.319
 less detail of behavior of rats 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.790
 in t-shirt and shorts 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.150
 and who make a good living too 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.680
 anyway 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.379
 it's true a lot more than the 4 to 10 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.150
 the dell then good ibm feed the site 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.959
 of roland garros of course with all 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.790
 your statistics 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.739
 obviously like any site he 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.689
 the prey of pirates and hackers 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.519
 jérôme and yes especially a site very in 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.959
 seen as that of roland garros then 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.299
 on this map is displayed in real time 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.680
 computer attacks against 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.579
 bfc infrastructure 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.430
 Besides, we have about 75000 to 100000 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.349
 attack a week on the site one can 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.720
 distinguish on the screen the source 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.459
 and then the destination which is one of 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.560
 three data centers in the united states that 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.609
 hosts roland's official website 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.620
 garros in cloud mode 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.569
 here is the techno channel 01net here at 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.010
 roland garros we will continue everything at 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.840
 along those next days others 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.159
 reports to follow here it is with 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.310
 we find ourselves very quickly hi to 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.310
 all
