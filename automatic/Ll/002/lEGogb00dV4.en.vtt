00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:05.320
 If you were a fan of the miners, it was the photography that stayed close because 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.460
 our tutorial today we will be teaching tactical concepts 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.460
 between the 100 blocks 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.740
 can reach all those fans of life and photography 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.970
 but to teach them about planes and frames 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.710
 so that the image you take with your camera may be much better 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.050
 quality 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.480
 There are several types of tasks and frames but these are the most 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.529
 important 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.540
 first of all we will be the panoramic plane 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.610
 the tension in this plane if you know the environment in the environment more than 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.430
 talent 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.900
 in fact the talent may be to be 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.900
 it can also be a one shot from a foreign country 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.170
 this plot mushrooms attention the talent but it was also a detail of the environment 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.330
 where was I moving 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.520
 calm down to start from scratch or to finish it 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.589
 the american 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.580
 that plane takes from the head to a height near the provinces 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.900
 when one signs to a single camera 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.010
 it is a clear that most used plane 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.080
 medium shot is a great honor that theme from the height of the head to a height 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.820
 close to the waist 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.310
 that day to take as a person and used a lot for a while 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.630
 interviews 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.580
 clear medium short this shot takes from the head up to tura 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.690
 more or less than half of the chest 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.219
 it serves to seat attention exclusively of talent 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.620
 ica and the hand of its environment 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.080
 there is also the medium-long plane that is a little more extended what plane 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.820
 half board 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.799
 want or not 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.450
 this is the does not take from the head at this height of the shoulders 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.010
 It is a very personal and very intimate close-up 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.590
 is used to register the expressions of the person's face 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.170
 Onesimus close-up 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.460
 this plane all in a hurry first face 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.910
 from the base of the chin to the top of the head 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.150
 the letter c 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.310
 this plan focuses tension on an object 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.539
 if it is to give the viewer a detail of something that would not happen 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.229
 unnoticed 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.799
 after a hand a warning I see 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.359
 and there the no of the environment
