00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.530
 my dear today i show you how 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.570
 I use my eyes as a draftsman every day 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.150
 and for that I use one first 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.610
 beveled eyeshadow brush one 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:21.369
 eyelash bit and a dark one 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.960
 eyeshadows first you have to do yours 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.449
 eyebrows with eyelashes bit 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.960
 all down would come around the top line 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.960
 to draw 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.810
 then drew with the 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.510
 peeled eyeshadow brushes and the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.390
 dark eyeshadows on the top line 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.539
 a straight line from the eyebrows 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.969
 and after that, eyebrows could be 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.780
 the dark eyeshadow also directly 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.780
 already fill 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.450
 with the eyelash bit then I would come 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.500
 the eyebrows go up around the lower one 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.500
 draw line 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.600
 that made new ones 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.730
 beveled eyeshadow pensel take 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.820
 a slightly lighter eyeshadow and 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.820
 field the front eyebrows with it too 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.590
 I take a brighter in front 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.050
 eyebrow it with your eyebrows 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.620
 look more natural and not too hard 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.620
 look 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.600
 Here I use a eyebrow 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.399
 and eyelashes go and eyebrows 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:18.489
 get a nicer one again 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:19.780
 form and more definition if you have that 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.090
 You could do that again with the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.349
 eyeshadows and the upper and 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.580
 lower line a little bit more 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.580
 draw cleaner 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.870
 on the other side did just that 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.900
 same brushed first eyebrows 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.470
 with the eyelash bit in the shape of her 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.360
 then up ahead with a lighter and 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.360
 behind with a slightly darker 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.820
 i use the eyebrow go from 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.049
 alverde in the color transparent and that 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.540
 I only take to the eyebrows 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.100
 I have already defined in the color 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.100
 given with the eyeshadow 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:39.349
 have filled both eyebrows 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:42.680
 her a pale eyeshadow no matter 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:45.229
 dull or shiny takes to one 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.750
 eyeshadow brush and kicked the 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.990
 eyeshadows below the highest point 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.880
 from your eyebrows to that 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:59.840
 for that the eyebrows are still visually 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:02.120
 something to be highlighted and that 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.220
 then you blind all with a whole 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.770
 normal blender brush with it 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.970
 really only sees the shimmer and 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.970
 no hard transitions 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.490
 Here you will see the finished look 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.000
 thanks for watching and until the 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.000
 next time
