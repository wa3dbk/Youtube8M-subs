part and it's not connected to this you

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.500 
part and it's not connected to this you
wrap<00:02:58.350> all<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.680> way<00:02:58.709> until<00:02:58.920> it's<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.370> flat<00:02:59.790> like

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
wrap all the way until it's a flat like

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.080 
wrap all the way until it's a flat like
it<00:03:00.720> needs<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.989> be<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.110> flat<00:03:01.440> line<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.880> take

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
it needs to be a flat line and you take

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.150 
it needs to be a flat line and you take
this<00:03:03.239> blue<00:03:03.510> tape<00:03:05.930> electrical<00:03:06.930> tape<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.739> known

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
this blue tape electrical tape as known

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.800 
this blue tape electrical tape as known
as

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.630 

you<00:03:15.810> wrap<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:17.360> sorta<00:03:18.360> like<00:03:18.750> this<00:03:19.560> needs<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.520> be

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
you wrap it sorta like this needs to be

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:29.330 
you wrap it sorta like this needs to be
flat<00:03:26.870> so<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.290> have<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.470> flat<00:03:28.739> straight<00:03:29.099> line

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
flat so you have a flat straight line

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.920 
flat so you have a flat straight line
now<00:03:29.519> one<00:03:30.120> player<00:03:30.630> on<00:03:30.959> this<00:03:31.650> type<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.690> tape<00:03:33.690> yard

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
now one player on this type of tape yard

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.699 
now one player on this type of tape yard
