00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
stuck in a bowling ball so I kind of had

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.110 
stuck in a bowling ball so I kind of had
to<00:00:34.030> because<00:00:34.630> i<00:00:34.840> had<00:00:34.990> a<00:00:35.020> little<00:00:35.520> cast<00:00:36.520> thing<00:00:36.910> on

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.800 
to because i had a little cast thing on
my<00:00:37.210> step<00:00:37.480> thumb<00:00:38.080> and<00:00:38.730> anyway<00:00:39.730> that<00:00:40.150> was<00:00:40.480> kind

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
my step thumb and anyway that was kind

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.490 
my step thumb and anyway that was kind
of<00:00:40.840> funny<00:00:41.050> but<00:00:41.860> i<00:00:43.080> don't<00:00:44.080> think<00:00:44.230> my

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
of funny but i don't think my

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.380 
of funny but i don't think my
handwriting<00:00:45.070> looks<00:00:45.460> super<00:00:46.120> different

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
handwriting looks super different

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.250 
handwriting looks super different
writing<00:00:47.050> my<00:00:47.080> name<00:00:47.460> if<00:00:48.460> i<00:00:48.670> did<00:00:49.510> a<00:00:49.540> full<00:00:49.810> sentence

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
writing my name if i did a full sentence

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.750 
writing my name if i did a full sentence
which<00:00:50.500> i<00:00:50.620> didn't<00:00:50.860> think<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:51.220> do<00:00:51.340> in<00:00:51.460> this<00:00:51.550> video

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
which i didn't think to do in this video

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.700 
which i didn't think to do in this video
i'm<00:00:52.120> sure<00:00:52.330> it<00:00:52.690> might<00:00:53.200> look<00:00:53.440> a<00:00:53.500> little

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
i'm sure it might look a little

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.890 
i'm sure it might look a little
different<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:55.210> now<00:00:55.390> let's<00:00:55.570> try<00:00:55.720> it<00:00:55.780> with<00:00:55.840> a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
different so now let's try it with a

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.360 
different so now let's try it with a
stick<00:00:56.140> figure<00:01:01.200> and<00:01:02.200> then<00:01:02.320> do<00:01:02.500> basic<00:01:02.920> stick

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
stick figure and then do basic stick

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.310 
stick figure and then do basic stick
there<00:01:03.580> because<00:01:03.970> i<00:01:04.000> decided<00:01:04.510> it<00:01:04.809> would<00:01:05.199> be<00:01:05.230> fun

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
there because i decided it would be fun

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.440 
there because i decided it would be fun
to<00:01:05.740> try<00:01:05.950> to<00:01:06.040> challenge<00:01:06.340> myself<00:01:06.730> a<00:01:07.060> little<00:01:07.270> bit

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
to try to challenge myself a little bit

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.410 
to try to challenge myself a little bit
with<00:01:07.570> my<00:01:07.690> other<00:01:07.810> hand<00:01:07.900> let's<00:01:08.590> see<00:01:09.120> you<00:01:10.120> can<00:01:10.270> see

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
with my other hand let's see you can see

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.540 
with my other hand let's see you can see
how<00:01:10.510> awkward<00:01:10.840> it<00:01:11.290> is<00:01:11.410> from<00:01:11.770> you<00:01:11.920> even<00:01:12.220> attempt

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
how awkward it is from you even attempt

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:24.150 
how awkward it is from you even attempt
to<00:01:12.730> hold<00:01:12.910> that<00:01:13.180> in<00:01:13.420> my<00:01:13.900> right<00:01:14.260> hand<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:24.130> that

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
to hold that in my right hand so that

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.950 
to hold that in my right hand so that
line<00:01:24.580> was<00:01:24.760> a<00:01:24.820> little<00:01:25.090> bit<00:01:25.240> of<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.390> half<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.600> little

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
line was a little bit of a half a little

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.710 
line was a little bit of a half a little
bit<00:01:27.360> doesn't<00:01:28.360> look<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.510> much<00:01:28.810> different

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
bit doesn't look that much different

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.149 
bit doesn't look that much different
maybe<00:01:31.720> he<00:01:31.870> looks<00:01:32.050> a<00:01:32.110> little<00:01:32.230> more<00:01:32.409> alien<00:01:32.950> like

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
maybe he looks a little more alien like

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.490 
maybe he looks a little more alien like
or<00:01:33.430> something<00:01:33.909> but<00:01:36.390> quite<00:01:37.390> an<00:01:37.510> item<00:01:37.659> thank<00:01:38.380> you

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
or something but quite an item thank you

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.520 
or something but quite an item thank you
there<00:01:38.830> was<00:01:39.010> much<00:01:39.250> of<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.430> difference<00:01:40.110> let's<00:01:41.110> try

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
there was much of a difference let's try

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.520 
there was much of a difference let's try
something<00:01:41.800> else<00:01:41.980> though<00:01:42.670> so<00:01:43.210> I<00:01:43.659> started

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
something else though so I started

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.430 
something else though so I started
drawing<00:01:44.740> this<00:01:44.950> I<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.790> I'm<00:01:46.479> going<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:46.840> make<00:01:47.050> it

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
drawing this I and I'm going to make it

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.480 
drawing this I and I'm going to make it
look<00:01:47.590> realistic<00:01:48.130> because<00:01:48.820> I<00:01:50.070> don't<00:01:51.070> know<00:01:51.159> I

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
look realistic because I don't know I

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.370 
look realistic because I don't know I
haven't<00:01:51.729> really<00:01:51.940> tried<00:01:52.360> realistic<00:01:53.020> things<00:01:53.229> in

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
haven't really tried realistic things in

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.340 
haven't really tried realistic things in
right<00:01:53.770> hand<00:01:54.040> so<00:01:54.900> this<00:01:55.900> could<00:01:56.080> end<00:01:56.200> up<00:01:56.290> being

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
right hand so this could end up being

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.560 
right hand so this could end up being
very<00:01:56.530> embarrassing<00:01:57.460> if<00:01:57.820> she<00:01:58.120> doesn't<00:01:58.450> go<00:01:58.540> home

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
very embarrassing if she doesn't go home

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.510 
very embarrassing if she doesn't go home
but<00:01:59.049> actually<00:01:59.710> I<00:01:59.799> don't<00:01:59.890> really<00:02:00.010> think<00:02:00.190> it

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
but actually I don't really think it

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.660 
but actually I don't really think it
would<00:02:00.610> be<00:02:00.729> embarrassing<00:02:00.850> so<00:02:01.510> let's<00:02:02.170> just<00:02:02.380> see

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.490 

I'm<00:02:06.670> speaking<00:02:07.060> about<00:02:07.450> my<00:02:07.750> left<00:02:07.960> hand<00:02:08.170> stuff<00:02:08.470> a

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
I'm speaking about my left hand stuff a

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.529 
I'm speaking about my left hand stuff a
lot<00:02:08.649> faster<00:02:09.100> than<00:02:09.190> my<00:02:09.310> right<00:02:09.459> hand<00:02:09.910> stuff<00:02:10.179> so

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
lot faster than my right hand stuff so

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.420 
lot faster than my right hand stuff so
if<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:11.530> see<00:02:11.770> that<00:02:12.310> things<00:02:12.640> aren't<00:02:12.850> very

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
if you see that things aren't very

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.759 
if you see that things aren't very
distant<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:14.810> just<00:02:15.049> because<00:02:15.260> I'm<00:02:15.379> slowing<00:02:15.680> it

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
distant it's just because I'm slowing it

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.860 
distant it's just because I'm slowing it
down<00:02:15.799> with<00:02:16.069> my<00:02:16.189> right<00:02:16.340> again<00:02:16.549> since<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.629> point

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
down with my right again since the point

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.190 
down with my right again since the point
of<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.019> challenge<00:02:18.439> is<00:02:18.530> very<00:02:19.069> good<00:02:22.930> also<00:02:23.930> if

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
of this challenge is very good also if

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.380 
of this challenge is very good also if
you<00:02:24.319> want<00:02:24.650> me<00:02:24.859> to<00:02:25.069> do<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.280> video<00:02:25.519> on<00:02:25.730> how<00:02:25.909> you're

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
you want me to do a video on how you're

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.879 
you want me to do a video on how you're
on<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:27.099> um<00:02:28.750> some<00:02:29.750> sort<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:30.019> tutorial<00:02:30.620> let<00:02:30.799> me

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:30.889 
on I um some sort of tutorial let me

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.970 
on I um some sort of tutorial let me
know<00:02:31.040> because<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.989> used<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.109> love<00:02:33.349> drawing<00:02:33.709> eyes

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
know because I used to love drawing eyes

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.069 
know because I used to love drawing eyes
so<00:02:34.549> that<00:02:34.909> would<00:02:35.359> be<00:02:35.389> one<00:02:35.659> I<00:02:35.689> would<00:02:35.810> definitely

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
so that would be one I would definitely

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.619 
so that would be one I would definitely
do<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.530> for<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:36.829> guys<00:02:36.859> but<00:02:37.819> there<00:02:38.209> are<00:02:38.359> a<00:02:38.389> lot

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
do it for you guys but there are a lot

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.390 
do it for you guys but there are a lot
of<00:02:38.659> videos<00:02:39.139> on<00:02:39.170> YouTube<00:02:39.620> about<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.280> as<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:41.810> is

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
of videos on YouTube about that as it is

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.610 
of videos on YouTube about that as it is
so<00:02:43.400> let's<00:02:44.120> awkwardly<00:02:44.629> try<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.959> draw<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.290> shape

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
so let's awkwardly try to draw the shape

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:55.899 
so let's awkwardly try to draw the shape
little<00:02:46.250> O'Neill<00:02:46.970> hope<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.329> oldest<00:02:47.689> result<00:02:54.909> if

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
little O'Neill hope the oldest result if

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.000 
little O'Neill hope the oldest result if
any<00:02:56.419> of<00:02:56.569> you<00:02:56.750> guys<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:56.959> not<00:02:57.409> tried<00:02:57.769> this

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
any of you guys have not tried this

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.770 
any of you guys have not tried this
seemed<00:02:58.280> really<00:02:58.849> because<00:02:59.150> it's<00:02:59.389> really

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
seemed really because it's really

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.179 
seemed really because it's really
fun<00:03:00.049> just<00:03:00.379> I<00:03:02.560> almost<00:03:03.560> felt<00:03:03.859> like<00:03:03.889> I<00:03:04.069> was<00:03:04.159> using

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
fun just I almost felt like I was using

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.009 
fun just I almost felt like I was using
the<00:03:04.730> other<00:03:04.879> side<00:03:05.209> of<00:03:05.239> my<00:03:05.450> brain<00:03:05.510> or<00:03:05.870> something

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
the other side of my brain or something

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:12.789 
the other side of my brain or something
to<00:03:06.319> do<00:03:06.439> this<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.739> don't<00:03:06.889> even<00:03:06.980> notice<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:12.680> was

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
to do this I don't even notice it was

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.819 
to do this I don't even notice it was
definitely<00:03:13.129> challenging<00:03:14.409> like<00:03:15.409> I<00:03:15.560> would<00:03:15.680> say

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
definitely challenging like I would say

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.349 
definitely challenging like I would say
the<00:03:15.919> biggest<00:03:16.099> challenge<00:03:16.730> of<00:03:16.909> this<00:03:17.030> entire

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
the biggest challenge of this entire

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.330 
the biggest challenge of this entire
thing<00:03:17.720> was<00:03:17.930> figuring<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.560> ha<00:03:18.709> hold<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.129> pencil

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
thing was figuring it ha hold the pencil

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.349 
thing was figuring it ha hold the pencil
and<00:03:20.290> then<00:03:22.599> fully<00:03:23.599> realized<00:03:24.139> that<00:03:24.879> my<00:03:25.879> muscles

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
and then fully realized that my muscles

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.059 
and then fully realized that my muscles
and<00:03:26.599> my<00:03:26.690> right<00:03:26.870> hand<00:03:27.109> were<00:03:27.229> a<00:03:27.260> lot<00:03:27.470> weaker<00:03:27.709> than

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
and my right hand were a lot weaker than

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.640 
and my right hand were a lot weaker than
the<00:03:28.129> muscles<00:03:28.430> in<00:03:28.519> my<00:03:28.549> left<00:03:28.760> hand<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:29.650> my

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
the muscles in my left hand and so my

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.740 
the muscles in my left hand and so my
hand<00:03:30.919> was<00:03:31.069> super<00:03:31.430> tired<00:03:31.459> like<00:03:32.209> especially<00:03:32.510> at

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
hand was super tired like especially at

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.000 
hand was super tired like especially at
this<00:03:32.840> point<00:03:33.139> right<00:03:33.229> here<00:03:33.290> I<00:03:33.500> mean<00:03:33.769> I<00:03:33.829> haven't

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
this point right here I mean I haven't

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.349 
this point right here I mean I haven't
even<00:03:34.129> done<00:03:34.310> much<00:03:34.549> yet<00:03:34.579> and<00:03:34.970> my<00:03:35.060> hand<00:03:35.269> was

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
even done much yet and my hand was

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:41.800 
even done much yet and my hand was
exhausted<00:03:36.169> so<00:03:40.150> guess<00:03:41.150> that's<00:03:41.329> one<00:03:41.510> thing<00:03:41.689> I

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
exhausted so guess that's one thing I

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.449 
exhausted so guess that's one thing I
realized<00:03:42.169> that<00:03:42.319> I<00:03:42.409> was<00:03:42.530> very<00:03:42.709> thankful<00:03:42.769> for<00:03:43.159> in

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
realized that I was very thankful for in

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.399 
realized that I was very thankful for in
this<00:03:43.579> video<00:03:43.939> that<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:44.629> know<00:03:44.750> as<00:03:44.870> we<00:03:44.989> learn<00:03:45.199> to

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
this video that you know as we learn to

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.379 
this video that you know as we learn to
write<00:03:45.650> when<00:03:46.069> we're<00:03:46.220> young<00:03:46.250> we<00:03:46.790> also<00:03:46.939> build<00:03:47.269> up

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
write when we're young we also build up

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.589 
write when we're young we also build up
muscles<00:03:47.750> in<00:03:47.900> our<00:03:47.959> dominant<00:03:48.439> hand<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:49.099> I

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
muscles in our dominant hand and I

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.569 
muscles in our dominant hand and I
didn't<00:03:50.599> realize<00:03:50.930> how<00:03:51.769> much<00:03:51.919> of<00:03:51.979> a<00:03:52.189> difference

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
didn't realize how much of a difference

00:03:52.579 --> 00:04:01.240 
didn't realize how much of a difference
that<00:03:52.790> made<00:03:52.970> until<00:03:53.319> this<00:03:54.400> video<00:04:00.069> another<00:04:01.069> thing

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
that made until this video another thing

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.830 
that made until this video another thing
i<00:04:01.310> was<00:04:01.430> thinking<00:04:01.459> of<00:04:01.909> when<00:04:02.209> I<00:04:02.739> was<00:04:03.739> doing<00:04:03.949> this

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
i was thinking of when I was doing this

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.659 
i was thinking of when I was doing this
was<00:04:05.840> that<00:04:06.109> you<00:04:06.620> know<00:04:06.709> I<00:04:06.739> actually<00:04:07.069> would

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
was that you know I actually would

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.569 
was that you know I actually would
prefer<00:04:07.699> to<00:04:08.389> draw<00:04:08.720> with<00:04:09.470> my<00:04:09.620> right<00:04:09.859> hand<00:04:09.889> rather

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
prefer to draw with my right hand rather

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.189 
prefer to draw with my right hand rather
than<00:04:10.759> trying<00:04:11.299> to<00:04:11.389> write<00:04:11.509> words<00:04:11.689> because

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
than trying to write words because

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:16.089 
than trying to write words because
drawing<00:04:12.829> for<00:04:13.280> me<00:04:13.430> was<00:04:13.699> a<00:04:13.879> lot<00:04:14.180> easier<00:04:14.449> it<00:04:15.199> just

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
drawing for me was a lot easier it just

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.300 
drawing for me was a lot easier it just
as<00:04:16.849> I<00:04:17.539> previously<00:04:18.049> said<00:04:18.440> I<00:04:18.680> just<00:04:18.829> didn't<00:04:19.190> have

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
as I previously said I just didn't have

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.219 
as I previously said I just didn't have
the<00:04:19.340> muscle<00:04:19.699> strength<00:04:20.120> in<00:04:20.299> my<00:04:20.419> hand<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:20.900> so

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
the muscle strength in my hand and so

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.519 
the muscle strength in my hand and so
that<00:04:22.210> was<00:04:23.210> one<00:04:23.450> thing<00:04:23.630> that<00:04:23.690> just<00:04:24.020> kind<00:04:24.440> of

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:24.529 
that was one thing that just kind of

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:26.760 
that was one thing that just kind of
hindered<00:04:24.919> me<00:04:25.190> from

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
hindered me from

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.879 
hindered me from
pressing<00:04:27.729> is<00:04:27.940> hard<00:04:28.210> i<00:04:28.479> guess<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:29.110> i<00:04:29.440> don't

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
pressing is hard i guess and i don't

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.219 
pressing is hard i guess and i don't
know<00:04:29.919> i<00:04:29.979> felt<00:04:30.190> like<00:04:30.280> i<00:04:30.400> had<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.610> control

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
know i felt like i had the control

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:47.939 
know i felt like i had the control
partly<00:04:32.229> down<00:04:32.410> but<00:04:33.030> yeah<00:04:44.099> so<00:04:45.099> I<00:04:46.889> don't<00:04:47.889> know

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
partly down but yeah so I don't know

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.770 
partly down but yeah so I don't know
maybe<00:04:48.129> if<00:04:48.340> I<00:04:48.460> tried<00:04:48.729> something<00:04:49.240> like<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.419> whole

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
maybe if I tried something like a whole

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.129 
maybe if I tried something like a whole
place<00:04:50.139> or<00:04:50.530> do<00:04:51.490> an<00:04:51.610> animal<00:04:52.090> learn<00:04:52.300> I<00:04:52.569> don't<00:04:53.020> have

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
place or do an animal learn I don't have

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.700 
place or do an animal learn I don't have
something<00:04:54.210> that<00:04:55.210> I<00:04:55.240> needed<00:04:55.539> to<00:04:55.690> make<00:04:56.470> sure<00:04:56.650> it

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
something that I needed to make sure it

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.850 
something that I needed to make sure it
was<00:04:56.800> very<00:04:57.039> proportionate<00:04:58.349> like<00:04:59.349> a<00:04:59.380> building

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
was very proportionate like a building

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.649 
was very proportionate like a building
with<00:05:00.130> fancy<00:05:00.520> architecture<00:05:01.090> or<00:05:01.150> something<00:05:01.509> I'm

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
with fancy architecture or something I'm

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:05.249 
with fancy architecture or something I'm
sure<00:05:01.960> that<00:05:02.729> it<00:05:03.729> would<00:05:03.909> be<00:05:04.240> really<00:05:04.599> really

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:05.259 
sure that it would be really really

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:12.140 
sure that it would be really really
challenging<00:05:05.919> you<00:05:06.490> know<00:05:07.199> but<00:05:10.770> one<00:05:11.770> thing<00:05:12.009> that

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
challenging you know but one thing that

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.670 
challenging you know but one thing that
was<00:05:13.150> hard<00:05:13.720> unless<00:05:13.930> I'm<00:05:14.229> not<00:05:14.349> gonna<00:05:14.500> lie

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
was hard unless I'm not gonna lie

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.950 
was hard unless I'm not gonna lie
because<00:05:15.130> I<00:05:15.400> mean<00:05:15.550> it's<00:05:15.669> kind<00:05:15.880> of<00:05:15.909> hard<00:05:16.150> also

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
because I mean it's kind of hard also

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.159 
because I mean it's kind of hard also
with<00:05:17.080> my<00:05:17.229> dominant<00:05:17.680> hand<00:05:17.710> uh<00:05:18.930> eyelashes<00:05:19.930> and
