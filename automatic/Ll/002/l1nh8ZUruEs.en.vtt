is there
now<00:01:09.630> these<00:01:09.750> butane<00:01:10.290> canisters<00:01:11.280> they've<00:01:11.970> got

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
now these butane canisters they've got

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.539 
now these butane canisters they've got
just<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.140> little<00:01:13.380> bit<00:01:13.500> less<00:01:13.680> calorific<00:01:14.159> value

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
just a little bit less calorific value

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.760 
just a little bit less calorific value
than<00:01:14.759> than<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.570> natural<00:01:15.900> gas<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> feed

than than your natural gas so the feed

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.550 
than than your natural gas so the feed
outputs<00:01:17.189> are<00:01:17.369> about<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> same<00:01:18.080> so<00:01:19.080> I'm<00:01:19.409> going

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
outputs are about the same so I'm going

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.580 
outputs are about the same so I'm going
to<00:01:19.619> use<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.860> cast<00:01:20.130> iron<00:01:20.900> pan<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
to use this cast iron pan here it's a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
let that warm up for a moment that takes

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.830 
let that warm up for a moment that takes
a<00:01:26.670> little<00:01:26.820> bit<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.060> heat<00:01:27.210> before<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.570> gets<00:01:27.689> hot

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
a little bit of heat before it gets hot

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.660

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
of a paler pink and then we'll turn them

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.210 
of a paler pink and then we'll turn them
over<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.170> just<00:02:29.740> cook<00:02:29.920> them<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.190> perfection

the<00:02:30.970> inside<00:02:31.270> part<00:02:31.540> should<00:02:31.750> still<00:02:31.960> be<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.110> bit

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the inside part should still be a bit

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.530 
the inside part should still be a bit
red<00:02:32.470> because<00:02:33.160> as<00:02:33.340> we<00:02:33.520> serve<00:02:33.760> them<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.360> fish

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
red because as we serve them the fish

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.970 
red because as we serve them the fish
are<00:02:34.690> still<00:02:34.870> cooking<00:02:35.260> its<00:02:35.380> own<00:02:35.530> heat<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.800> little

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980

are still cooking its own heat a little
bit<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.090> we'll<00:02:37.270> just<00:02:37.450> wait<00:02:37.600> for<00:02:37.630> them<00:02:37.900> to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
bit and so we'll just wait for them to

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.360 
bit and so we'll just wait for them to
cook<00:02:38.170> down<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.380> little<00:02:38.530> bit<00:02:38.710> before<00:02:38.890> we<00:02:39.190> turn

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
cook down a little bit before we turn

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.600 
cook down a little bit before we turn
them<00:02:39.490> over<00:02:40.980> all<00:02:41.980> right<00:02:42.070> let's<00:02:42.220> have<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.400> look<00:02:42.520> at

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
them over all right let's have a look at

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.130 
them over all right let's have a look at
the<00:02:42.670> pieces<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:43.090> fish<00:02:43.270> underneath<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:44.080> you

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
the pieces of fish underneath and you

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.870 
the pieces of fish underneath and you
can<00:02:44.260> see<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.590> they<00:02:44.650> start<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:44.950> cook<00:02:45.160> up<00:02:45.340> it's

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
can see that they start to cook up it's

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.180 
can see that they start to cook up it's
a<00:02:45.940> good<00:02:46.120> time<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.330> turn<00:02:46.660> them<00:02:46.780> over<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.980> can

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
a good time to turn them over you can

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.760 
a good time to turn them over you can
see<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.370> skin<00:02:48.760> is<00:02:48.930> becoming<00:02:49.930> quite<00:02:50.260> scorched

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
see the skin is becoming quite scorched

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.020 
see the skin is becoming quite scorched
and<00:02:50.890> crispy<00:02:51.630> like<00:02:52.630> this<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.490> fleshy<00:02:54.700> side

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
and crispy like this on the fleshy side

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.520 
and crispy like this on the fleshy side
they<00:02:55.450> cook<00:02:55.630> rather<00:02:55.840> more<00:02:56.080> quickly<00:02:56.320> than

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
they cook rather more quickly than

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.860 
they cook rather more quickly than
through<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.860> skin<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.330> about<00:02:58.540> three<00:02:58.750> or

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
through the skin and in about three or

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.300 
through the skin and in about three or
four<00:02:59.020> minutes<00:02:59.290> they<00:02:59.530> should<00:02:59.710> be<00:02:59.830> nicely<00:03:00.010> done

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
four minutes they should be nicely done

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.130 
four minutes they should be nicely done
I'm<00:03:03.310> going<00:03:03.520> to<00:03:03.610> turn<00:03:03.760> them<00:03:03.940> back<00:03:04.090> now<00:03:04.270> open<00:03:05.080> up

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
I'm going to turn them back now open up

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.420 
I'm going to turn them back now open up
the<00:03:05.200> flesh<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.530> little<00:03:05.830> bit<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.100> have<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.250> look

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
the flesh a little bit to have a look

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.100 
the flesh a little bit to have a look
inside

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.010 

okay<00:03:13.860> if<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.760> had<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:14.970> peek<00:03:15.210> in<00:03:15.360> there

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.010 

now<00:03:18.620> especially<00:03:18.980> salmon<00:03:19.670> is<00:03:19.880> they<00:03:20.000> can<00:03:20.180> pretty

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
now especially salmon is they can pretty

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.980 
now especially salmon is they can pretty
much<00:03:21.110> roll<00:03:21.560> with<00:03:21.800> not<00:03:22.640> cooked<00:03:22.880> at<00:03:22.970> all<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:23.930> it

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
much roll with not cooked at all so it

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.990 
much roll with not cooked at all so it
isn't<00:03:24.260> pretty<00:03:24.800> close<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.730> sort<00:03:25.940> of

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
isn't pretty close to that sort of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.760 
isn't pretty close to that sort of
condition<00:03:26.390> so<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.570> reckon<00:03:26.960> they're<00:03:27.530> about

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
condition so I reckon they're about

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.590 
condition so I reckon they're about
right<00:03:28.010> there<00:03:28.640> in<00:03:28.760> serving<00:03:29.150> these<00:03:29.240> up<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.570> the

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
right there in serving these up to the

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.600 
right there in serving these up to the
plate<00:03:29.930> you'll<00:03:30.500> find<00:03:30.800> it<00:03:30.950> I'll<00:03:31.100> cook<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.490> now

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
plate you'll find it I'll cook it now

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.580 
plate you'll find it I'll cook it now
and<00:03:31.790> peaking<00:03:32.060> here<00:03:32.180> by<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.570> time<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:33.020> sit

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
and peaking here by the time you sit

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.200 
and peaking here by the time you sit
down<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.890> eat<00:03:33.920> them<00:03:34.220> they'll<00:03:34.670> be<00:03:34.820> perfectly

down to eat them they'll be perfectly
done<00:03:35.480> all<00:03:36.020> right<00:03:36.080> so<00:03:36.440> let's<00:03:36.620> plate<00:03:36.920> them<00:03:37.070> up

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.060 

you<00:03:41.240> can<00:03:41.390> see<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.660> pinkness<00:03:41.930> inside<00:03:42.470> there

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:50.740 
you can see the pinkness inside there
but<00:03:43.490> that's<00:03:43.610> perfect

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.690
