00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
expansion position because I tend to

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.959 
expansion position because I tend to
only<00:00:42.690> do<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.140> pvz<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.829> don't<00:00:44.520> know<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.910> don't

to do to do goos rather than one and
only<00:02:25.500> cutting<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.980> few<00:02:26.700> amount<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.060> probes<00:02:27.330> and

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
i find this a little bit better than the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
i find this a little bit better than the
other<00:02:29.490> build<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:30.440> just<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.830> probes<00:02:32.760> I

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
other build because just the probes I

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.040 
other build because just the probes I
the<00:02:33.690> probe<00:02:34.230> Colin<00:02:34.770> Dragoon<00:02:35.130> ratio<00:02:35.550> is<00:02:36.050> good

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
the probe Colin Dragoon ratio is good

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.150 
the probe Colin Dragoon ratio is good
and<00:02:37.290> okay<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.160> doesn't<00:02:38.280> make<00:02:38.430> sense<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:38.790> the

that's<00:07:31.960> how<00:07:32.110> good<00:07:32.320> that's<00:07:32.530> all<00:07:32.710> strikeout

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.040 
that's how good that's all strikeout

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.520 
that's how good that's all strikeout
works<00:07:33.310> and<00:07:33.610> that's<00:07:34.330> kind<00:07:34.780> of<00:07:34.870> all<00:07:35.080> right<00:07:35.230> and

I'm<00:07:35.800> making<00:07:36.010> this<00:07:36.070> Tribune<00:07:36.430> go<00:07:36.640> up<00:07:36.790> so<00:07:36.970> I<00:07:37.030> can

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.210 
I'm making this Tribune go up so I can

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.120 
I'm making this Tribune go up so I can
lure<00:07:37.390> the<00:07:37.540> damage<00:07:37.870> from<00:07:37.900> the<00:07:38.110> tank<00:07:38.440> and<00:07:38.650> only
