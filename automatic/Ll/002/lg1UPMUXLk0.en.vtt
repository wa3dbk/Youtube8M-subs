00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
to the area where I set out to you know

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.180 
to the area where I set out to you know
obviously<00:05:47.849> place<00:05:48.120> and<00:05:48.360> stuff<00:05:48.830> so<00:05:49.830> yeah<00:05:50.039> I've

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
obviously place and stuff so yeah I've

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.769 
obviously place and stuff so yeah I've
tried<00:05:50.430> to<00:05:50.550> make<00:05:50.699> like<00:05:50.879> a<00:05:50.909> little<00:05:51.000> Mel<00:05:51.389> area

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:51.779 
tried to make like a little Mel area

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:54.019 
tried to make like a little Mel area
where<00:05:52.529> we<00:05:52.589> can<00:05:52.740> obviously<00:05:52.860> go<00:05:53.219> to<00:05:53.250> get<00:05:53.669> metal

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:54.029 
where we can obviously go to get metal

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.269 
where we can obviously go to get metal
and<00:05:54.210> stuff<00:05:54.389> like<00:05:54.569> that<00:05:54.839> anyway<00:05:55.259> further<00:05:55.889> down

00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:56.279 
and stuff like that anyway further down

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:59.029 
and stuff like that anyway further down
this<00:05:56.789> way<00:05:57.060> actually<00:05:57.300> I<00:05:57.839> think<00:05:58.589> it<00:05:58.710> might<00:05:58.860> be<00:05:58.889> a

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
this way actually I think it might be a

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.300 
this way actually I think it might be a
little<00:05:59.189> bit<00:05:59.370> further<00:05:59.759> down<00:06:00.120> here<00:06:00.990> okay

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
little bit further down here okay

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.339 
little bit further down here okay
maybe<00:06:02.580> not<00:06:03.029> okay<00:06:03.360> here<00:06:03.569> it<00:06:03.689> is<00:06:03.810> here's<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:04.169> low

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:06.829 
maybe not okay here it is here's the low
bay<00:06:04.529> so<00:06:04.710> we<00:06:04.800> made<00:06:05.189> okay<00:06:05.639> so<00:06:05.699> indeed<00:06:06.300> hydrating

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:06.839
