 very good I'm charlie and today throw in the 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.130
 center of Seville to convince the 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.960
 people who imitate their animals 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.240
 favorites if it could be any 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.339
 animal what would be a fox because a 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.449
 fox is an animal who he calls 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:23.269
 quite the attention is you do not see much 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:28.149
 it's pretty weird about that and they go there to 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:32.300
 the weather can imitate a fox 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:33.890
 I do not know I do not know how a fox is not going 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.120
 telling the story of the fox of 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.449
 national geographic and now I see things from 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.449
 foxes 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:53.280

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:57.230

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.230
 elephant now you have me chemistry 

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:11.580
 and a second file blade that mimic 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.580

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.560

 good me because I could not fly 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.420
 anywhere it would be a bird 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.420
 free 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.520
 good to imitate the dove the noise noise 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.520
 home 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:07.660
 very well very well and we do not 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:10.660
 they achieved that was not a human animal 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.660
 wonderful 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.370
 we are by the sound of the gallows 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.700
 her luck she 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.700
 in a delayed boat 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.000
 I stay as I am and that's it 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.320
 people count as animals you are 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.320
 a wooden pact here 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:18.750
 when the dog is now the tiger 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.080
 like them who does not do anything that does 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.080
 something 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:31.420
 but that the animal to one that is going to 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.420
 do 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.400
 this is passion 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.400
 based on a frog 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.410
 and if I could do any animal which 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.340
 would be 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:54.540
 I would be 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.540
 it's a shark 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:06.540
 you are a shark or the book is chosen 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:11.420
 what do i have 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.420
 it's an amorphous shark but at least 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.780
 in fact the field without seeing are more than 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.240
 long to prefer shot a goat 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.530
 and that nobody knows or they did not throw to the 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.530
 Goat and everyone 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.760
 what I finish want the spaces 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.760
 open in the serious
