powder<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:34.830> do<00:02:35.010> think<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.670> very

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
powder I do think this is a very

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.480 
powder I do think this is a very
versatile<00:02:36.930> brush<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:37.920> that's<00:02:38.100> just<00:02:38.250> what<00:02:38.460> I

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
versatile brush but that's just what I

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.910 
versatile brush but that's just what I
use<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.940> for<00:02:38.970> next<00:02:39.810> I'm<00:02:40.110> going<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.530> talk<00:02:40.740> about
