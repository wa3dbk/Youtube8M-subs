00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:26.070
 Now I pour water to us 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.380
 insisted swollen further I pulled one 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.279
 fourth part 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:37.739
 chickens buy one whole chicken delu 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:42.590
 in 4 parts and it turns out well so here 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:46.950
 such are the saucepans rich broth 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.559
 further and by the way we chicken with freezer 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.930
 put in the fridge so that we have 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.300
 immediately in taiwan not immediately 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.039
 fast so that nutrients are not lost 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.300
 substances 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:03.989
 so on for frying we need 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.210
 carrot one small and tomato by the way 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.299
 What about flour onions I do not like I do not like 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.740
 general onions in soups from childhood and us 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.340
 It takes two pickles as well 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.640
 what 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.020

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.250

 about 30-40 minutes 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.430

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.530
