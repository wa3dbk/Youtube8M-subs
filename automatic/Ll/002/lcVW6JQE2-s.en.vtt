00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
strength within an aluminum piece this

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.490 
strength within an aluminum piece this
is<00:01:01.859> wrong<00:01:02.069> here<00:01:02.429> on<00:01:02.579> yeah<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.179> in<00:01:03.569> 1990<00:01:04.379> they

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
there wasn't it

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.050 
there wasn't it
there<00:01:07.619> wasn't<00:01:07.799> an<00:01:08.040> aftermarket<00:01:08.399> alternative

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
there wasn't an aftermarket alternative

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.310

just<00:02:27.640> as<00:02:27.850> what<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.120> see<00:02:28.300> right<00:02:28.330> here<00:02:28.540> these

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
just as what you see right here these

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.230 
just as what you see right here these
come<00:02:29.050> with<00:02:29.080> solid<00:02:29.680> chunks<00:02:30.130> typically<00:02:31.060> what

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
come with solid chunks typically what

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.970 
come with solid chunks typically what
we'll<00:02:31.360> do<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.630> we'll<00:02:31.750> take<00:02:31.930> them<00:02:32.110> in<00:02:32.260> the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
we'll do is we'll take them in the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.440 
we'll do is we'll take them in the
machine<00:02:33.280> shop<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.730> then<00:02:34.090> we'll<00:02:34.210> cut<00:02:34.390> them

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
machine shop and then we'll cut them

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.180 
machine shop and then we'll cut them
down<00:02:34.630> what<00:02:34.870> we<00:02:34.960> call<00:02:35.170> slugs<00:02:35.710> and<00:02:36.070> then

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
down what we call slugs and then

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
down what we call slugs and then
familiar<00:02:36.520> they're<00:02:36.640> going<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.880> each<00:02:37.000> machine

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
familiar they're going to each machine

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.900 
familiar they're going to each machine
exactly<00:02:38.080> get<00:02:38.230> processed<00:02:38.740> into<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.100> sculpting

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
exactly get processed into the sculpting

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.640 
exactly get processed into the sculpting
we<00:02:40.000> call<00:02:40.210> it<00:02:40.330> absolutely<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.200> as<00:02:41.320> this<00:02:41.470> all

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
we call it absolutely and as this all

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.650 
we call it absolutely and as this all
your

it's<00:02:43.140> us<00:02:43.380> exactly<00:02:44.130> we<00:02:44.340> go<00:02:44.580> through<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:45.060> ton<00:02:45.300> of

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
it's us exactly we go through a ton of

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.940 
it's us exactly we go through a ton of
crap<00:02:45.600> we<00:02:45.780> typically<00:02:46.230> fill<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.590> thing<00:02:46.650> up

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
crap we typically fill this thing up

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.710 
crap we typically fill this thing up
about<00:02:47.370> every<00:02:47.790> three<00:02:48.060> days

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
about every three days

fully compacted
we<00:02:51.210> get<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.720> picked<00:02:51.840> up<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.440> we<00:02:52.560> recycling<00:02:53.160> we

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
we get it picked up and we recycling we

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.800 
we get it picked up and we recycling we
start<00:02:53.460> over<00:02:53.580> so<00:02:54.150> it's<00:02:54.300> one<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.600> great

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
start over so it's one of the great

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.620 
start over so it's one of the great
things<00:02:55.020> about<00:02:55.140> with<00:02:56.130> our<00:02:56.430> program<00:02:56.940> as<00:02:57.090> we<00:02:57.270> do<00:02:57.600> a

things about with our program as we do a

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:25.610 
things about with our program as we do a
lot<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.260> recycling

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
typically it is changes per model but

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.780 
typically it is changes per model but

typically<00:03:52.810> looking<00:03:52.930> at<00:03:53.230> about<00:03:53.350> just<00:03:53.590> over<00:03:53.710> a

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
typically looking at about just over a

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.870 
typically looking at about just over a
thousand<00:03:54.190> dollars<00:03:54.460> or<00:03:54.580> something<00:03:54.700> like<00:03:54.790> that

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
thousand dollars or something like that

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.900 
thousand dollars or something like that
lasting<00:03:55.540> five<00:03:55.840> times<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:57.250> amount<00:03:57.310> and

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
lasting five times the amount and

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.240 
lasting five times the amount and
durability<00:03:58.270> of<00:03:58.740> stock<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:01.620> was<00:04:02.620> in<00:04:02.710> our<00:04:02.800> juggle

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
durability of stock I was in our juggle

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:36.410 
durability of stock I was in our juggle
game<00:04:03.460> right<00:04:03.640> now

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.920 

so<00:04:37.260> this<00:04:37.500> would<00:04:37.680> be<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.600> second<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.660> last<00:04:39.690> step

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
so this would be the second to last step

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.170 
so this would be the second to last step
before<00:04:40.200> our<00:04:40.650> clutch<00:04:41.010> covers<00:04:41.340> are<00:04:41.430> finished<00:04:41.730> or

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
before our clutch covers are finished or

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.540 
before our clutch covers are finished or
clutch<00:04:42.510> covers<00:04:42.870> are<00:04:43.050> get<00:04:43.380> machined<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.100> then

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
clutch covers are get machined and then

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.010 
clutch covers are get machined and then
they'll<00:04:44.760> get<00:04:44.910> coated<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.510> then<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.780> last

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
they'll get coated and then the last

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.460 
they'll get coated and then the last
would<00:04:46.290> be<00:04:46.320> all<00:04:46.710> of<00:04:47.280> our<00:04:47.460> of<00:04:48.210> our<00:04:48.540> edging<00:04:49.050> all<00:04:49.200> of

would be all of our of our edging all of

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.710 
would be all of our of our edging all of
our<00:04:49.560> metal<00:04:49.920> edging<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.490> all<00:04:50.760> of<00:04:50.910> our<00:04:51.000> logos<00:04:51.510> and
