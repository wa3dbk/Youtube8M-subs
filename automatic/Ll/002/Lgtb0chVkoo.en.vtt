00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.620 
I mean of course for the level of
Ronaldo<00:02:05.189> anything<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:05.700> still<00:02:06.060> good<00:02:06.450> enough

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630

Ronaldo anything but still good enough
man<00:02:07.049> 86<00:02:07.560> probably<00:02:08.429> fell<00:02:08.610> around<00:02:08.789> 84<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.360> it

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
man 86 probably fell around 84 but it

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.699 
man 86 probably fell around 84 but it
was<00:02:09.599> still<00:02:09.810> good<00:02:09.929> enough<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> dribble<00:02:10.530> with

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
that's as far as pros and cons the

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.110 
that's as far as pros and cons the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
biggest positives for him he's shooting

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.690 
biggest positives for him he's shooting
his<00:02:42.480> sprint<00:02:42.749> and<00:02:43.019> his<00:02:43.230> four<00:02:43.500> skills<00:02:44.159> I<00:02:44.370> use

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
his sprint and his four skills I use

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.250 
his sprint and his four skills I use
negative<00:02:44.909> though<00:02:45.239> in<00:02:45.419> my<00:02:45.569> opinion<00:02:45.599> was<00:02:46.079> his

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
negative though in my opinion was his

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.099 
negative though in my opinion was his
free-kick<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:47.000> yeah<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.030> guess<00:02:48.239> that'll<00:02:48.959> be<00:02:49.019> it

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
free-kick so yeah I guess that'll be it

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.439 
free-kick so yeah I guess that'll be it
