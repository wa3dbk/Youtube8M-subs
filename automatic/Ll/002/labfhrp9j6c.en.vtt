00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:07.650
 greeting where he helped show videos of 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:11.540
 how to perform the process 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.790
 17.17 point 1.1 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.910
 well in this case I'll show you the steps 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.039
 on an iphone 5 s 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.990
 although all of them work 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.849
 dispositives 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.140
 it does not matter if there is power that has a certain 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.250
 point 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.780
 0 to 7.1 points so good first thing 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.500
 we have to do is download this 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.470
 art that the tool is called 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.690
 payment of 1.0 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.440
 Well after we have our kit 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.630
 now I will leave the download link in 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.580
 the description of leaving the link from the 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.340
 description of the video once 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.200
 let's have our desks only 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.940
 we are going to proceed by opening the 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.200
 complications of the executable as 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.200
 administrator in windows 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.449
 we hope that there will be once the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.960
 application we only have between 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.060
 press these symbols that is here 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.619
 since it is the beginning here this should the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.820
 second step that we have to take in 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.070
 account 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.540
 so for the tool to continue 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.100
 as I was showing here in this 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.450
 small picture that is showing you 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.520
 let's say it's going to be a small 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.950
 modification of the date and 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.920
 and turn off the automatic settings of the 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.140
 time zone 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.900
 we go to adjustments we take generate 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.899
 then generate press date and time and 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.689
 this is where we have to turn off the 1 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.130
 automatic time so you can not 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.020
 after turning off to are schedules we are going 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.210
 here where is the date that is 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.250
 that down and of m4 captors 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.810
 Well, you know, this is the date that 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.320
 they have to set the good one 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.740
 configure 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.119
 immediately the application 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.780
 automatically continue into the 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.650
 process without us having to do 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.270
 modify that 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.270
 we hope it's over 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.400
 once 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.550
 let's modify the date and the program 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.920
 of payment with a couple of minutes has 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.350
 how many seconds stopped only 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.150
 we have that in this application almost no 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.030
 in this little one and we apologize that 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.460
 is the samsung click device 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.230
 we give in continue 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.480
 there as you can see the application 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.960
 keep moving another bit and separate 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.830
 now we only have to get out of 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.940
 nikon and we hope since the tool 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.940
 finish the process 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.980
 good that you can see ending our 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.550
 kind 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.790
 or it will do a small restart 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.200
 we just wait for it to end no longer 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.670
 we have to do our steps 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.320
 the tools will finish doing the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.320
 completely soraya process 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.680
 when in truth 500 one euro 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:47.290
 well here you can see we have 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.290
 our devices with the 7.1 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.780
 here is 171 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.280
 can see acid that is 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.410
 and point 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.060
 during we have to enter can be 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.069
 have on their website to see what 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.069
 studies for system packages 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.040
 Well, now a free mind is going 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.100
 let's see what we have if properly installed 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.720
 correctly then in this case and to me 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.150
 would I relapse on the data not 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.590
 they have to be good it will not appear 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.500
 towards the first one since they have to 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.390
 expect some data as I 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.940
 I put a fall has served a little more 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.490
 short and good everything is working 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.410
 perfectly as you can see here they are 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.350
 the sources of cydia that it brings 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.630
 added 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.180
 this break is right now from lack 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.080
 so it's always good band I hope 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.300
