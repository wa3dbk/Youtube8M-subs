00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 we have already made sure that forts 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.740
 special thrill and honor family values 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.139
 because leave a new generation 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.300
 compact van simax without twin brother 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.219
 fordovtsy could not new member 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.379
 Families named grand c-max 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.890
 the prefix grant in the name is not accidental 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.320
 because he is 14 centimeters longer than his 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.689
 brother and almost 6 centimeters taller 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.359
 true visually they are about the height 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.369
 same so apparently all six 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.769
 centimeters growth height grand 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.530
 c-max fall on roof rails 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.750
 by the way it is for this rating they can 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.969
 distinguish from each other at least 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.980
 if you look at the front because like 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.480
 rely on the twins from the face they 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.110
 exactly the same 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.360
 but the stern brothers are significantly different 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.000
 due to a higher roofline have a grant 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.309
 Simmons slightly larger rear window shape 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.230
 optics has more sharply outlines 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.420
 and at the bottom of the massive covers 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.020
 trunk has a separate handle 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.820
 but that ’s not all the difference 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.660
 different ford grand c-max from its 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.270
 younger brother 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.369
 it is a rear sliding door that is very 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.500
 handy on tight parking lots of the same 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.840
 almost rectangular 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.360
 opening which makes landing much easier 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.520
 and disembarking and I will tell you in secret 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.070
 It is very convenient for our film crew 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.009
 teams so such doors in wide 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.630
 sense of the word universal thing 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.880
 the interior has not changed much 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.979
 here is the same cozy atmosphere with 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.140
 a touch of space and space 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.430
 in excess 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.570
 driver's seat is equipped with a full 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.970
 set of adjustments 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.820
 comfortable chair well profiled 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.350
 have good lateral support panel 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.040
 appliances with a pleasant white-blue 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.020
 backlit 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.100
 perfectly readable and 2-zone 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.710
 climate control 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.750
 keep a close eye on maintaining 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.240
 comfortable temperature besides plastic 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.020
 almost everywhere soft and tight panels 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.630
 fitted 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.670
 other in general are not particularly find fault with what 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.280
 Is it a little steering wheel 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.049
 overloaded with buttons and to their destination 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.630
 the first time will have to get used 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.819
 but then you can manage all 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.450
 onboard systems without taking your hands off 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.970
 bagels 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.069
 for long trips and travels in 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.680
 grand c-max provides a lot of different 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.690
 pockets and compartments and rear passengers 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.540
 roads can also use 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.549
 folding tables and of course family 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.709
 car could not do without a panoramic 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.569
 mirror in the cabin because of the small 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.700
 fidget need eye yes eye 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.739
 and not only when you go to 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.440
 family voyage well and even on the way to 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.700
 kindergarten or school 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.410
 considering that grand c-max is first 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.209
 lineup family car constructors 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.989
 tried to work in detail back 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.239
 row of seats 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:43.470
 the chair can now be moved back and forth 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.709
 and also they have backrest adjustment by 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.930
 tilt angle 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:53.489
 but then the question is, we have 5 seater 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.560
 version and the seat is only 4 where is 5 and here 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.560
 by simple manipulations on 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.560
 one two Three 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.299
 appears in the fifth cross such a system 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.160
 transformations 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.299
 especially convenient for the seven-seater version 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.639
 grand c-max 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.319
 because to get to the third row of seats 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.530
 here i need to demonstrate miracles 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.870
 balancing act just enough to fold 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.150
 middle seat and get comfortable 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.150
 passage to the gallery but in our case 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.099
 version 5 local which means that the floor 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.260
 trunk hides not two extra 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.599
 spare wheelchair 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.720
 form a rectangular cargo hold 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.880
 opening wide comfortable therefore no 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.930
 problems with loading the placement of luggage 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.290
 should not be 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.630
 but the freight capabilities are grand c-max by this 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.609
 unlimited by traditional 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.200
 rear seat transformations possible 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:51.959
 get a space of 1742 liters and how 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.989
 Marshak poems easily fit baggage 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.109
 sofa suitcase bag picture basket 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.079
 carton and of course little doggy and 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.720
 with all this stuff grand c-max can 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.729
 move very quickly because under 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.430
 the hood is turbocharged four 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:11.190
 1 and 6 liter ecoboost series 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.109
 power stand 150 horsepower 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.609
 the gearbox is mechanical here 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.400
 6-speed 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.190
 and this is the perfect combination for those who 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.139
 loves active driving style 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.050
 however, we didn’t start annealing 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.270
 for two reasons first over with us 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.199
 got completely run-in car with 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.080
 zero run 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.710
 and secondly on the day of the rubber test on 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.540
 Simok's grant was not quite in season 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.970
 so grip on slippery areas 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.900
 the roads were no better than hockey 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.780
 puck on ice 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.000
 so guided by the principle we are 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.670
 safe pedal test in gas 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.160
 had to handle extremely gently but 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.560
 even with such a slow ride managed 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.290
 draw some conclusions like all 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.630
 models of this brand rulitsya grand c-max 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.770

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.260
 slippery areas 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.270
 obedience predictability she 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.730
 few asphalt cuts 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.700
 roads and does show the driver ski for 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.530
 family compact war temper suspension 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.290
 miraculously combines itself 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.240
 sports notes with smoothness 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.010
 slight asphalt defects running this 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.170
 kompaktvena eats not even 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.960

 large side glass area 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.140
 mirrors give good visibility and this is 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.110
 turn makes it easy and safe 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.150
 maneuver in a dense stream a lot in

 smart electronics controls the light and 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.290
 janitors depending on external 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.270
