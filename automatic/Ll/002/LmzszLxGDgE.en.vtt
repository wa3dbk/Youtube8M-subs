this kind of charcoal grey pole is and

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.709 
this kind of charcoal grey pole is and
then<00:00:50.920> you've<00:00:51.069> got<00:00:51.219> a<00:00:51.249> longer<00:00:51.670> silver<00:00:52.449> pole

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719

then you've got a longer silver pole
with<00:00:53.649> a<00:00:53.679> hub<00:00:53.979> on<00:00:54.219> it<00:00:54.399> that<00:00:54.999> goes<00:00:55.149> at<00:00:55.329> the<00:00:55.420> front

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
with a hub on it that goes at the front

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.569 
with a hub on it that goes at the front
of<00:00:55.749> the<00:00:55.870> tent<00:00:56.050> so<00:00:56.620> you'll<00:00:56.949> always<00:00:57.129> know<00:00:57.249> the

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
of the tent so you'll always know the

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.669 
of the tent so you'll always know the
front<00:00:57.879> of<00:00:58.059> your<00:00:58.149> tent<00:00:58.420> because<00:00:58.719> the<00:00:58.899> tqo<00:00:59.289> logo

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679 
front of your tent because the tqo logo

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.579 
front of your tent because the tqo logo
is<00:00:59.889> printed<00:00:59.920> there<00:01:00.519> and<00:01:01.389> the<00:01:02.289> next<00:01:02.499> thing

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
is printed there and the next thing

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.020 
is printed there and the next thing
we're<00:01:02.710> gonna<00:01:02.769> do<00:01:03.010> actually<00:01:03.489> is<00:01:03.639> take<00:01:03.879> the

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
we're gonna do actually is take the

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.940 
we're gonna do actually is take the
front-to-back<00:01:04.360> Pole<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.200> connect<00:01:05.530> it<00:01:05.680> to<00:01:05.830> the

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
front-to-back Pole and connect it to the

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.830 
front-to-back Pole and connect it to the
boot<00:01:06.100> poles<00:01:06.340> I<00:01:06.610> think<00:01:06.880> it's<00:01:07.000> easiest<00:01:07.330> to<00:01:07.630> set

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
boot poles I think it's easiest to set

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.660 
boot poles I think it's easiest to set
up<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.110> skeleton<00:01:08.680> of<00:01:08.800> the<00:01:08.920> tent<00:01:09.160> first<00:01:09.370> before

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
you start clipping the tent fabric so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.430 
you start clipping the tent fabric so
you'll<00:01:12.670> see<00:01:12.910> that<00:01:13.150> this<00:01:13.360> front<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:13.870> back<00:01:14.140> pole
