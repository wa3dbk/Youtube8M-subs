00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
that can actually cause you problems so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.679 
that can actually cause you problems so
for<00:01:48.649> example<00:01:49.100> an<00:01:49.310> athlete<00:01:50.030> who<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.389> so

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
for example an athlete who is so

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.050 
for example an athlete who is so
successful<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:51.979> they<00:01:52.189> think<00:01:52.249> that<00:01:52.700> they<00:01:52.880> can

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
successful that they think that they can

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.849 
successful that they think that they can
never<00:01:53.270> make<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.509> mistake<00:01:53.929> they<00:01:54.499> may<00:01:54.679> not

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
never make a mistake they may not

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.440 
never make a mistake they may not
practice<00:01:55.039> hard<00:01:55.490> enough<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:55.939> then<00:01:56.210> when<00:01:56.329> they

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
practice hard enough so then when they

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.359 
practice hard enough so then when they
get<00:01:56.569> ready<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.929> actually<00:01:57.289> perform<00:01:57.649> they<00:01:58.219> may

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
get ready to actually perform they may

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.800 
get ready to actually perform they may
actually<00:01:58.579> start<00:01:58.909> to<00:01:58.969> make<00:01:59.060> more<00:01:59.210> mistakes<00:01:59.600> or

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
actually start to make more mistakes or

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.469 
actually start to make more mistakes or
a<00:02:00.109> business<00:02:00.590> person<00:02:00.829> who's<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:01.789> optimistic

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
a business person who's so optimistic

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.359 
a business person who's so optimistic
and<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:02.749> confident<00:02:03.259> might<00:02:03.649> actually<00:02:03.829> not<00:02:04.159> make

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
and so confident might actually not make

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.489 
and so confident might actually not make
any<00:02:04.520> contingency<00:02:05.240> plans<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:06.139> then<00:02:06.319> when

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499 
any contingency plans so then when

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:07.959 
any contingency plans so then when
something<00:02:06.709> bad<00:02:06.950> happens<00:02:07.340> in<00:02:07.459> their<00:02:07.579> business

something bad happens in their business
they're<00:02:08.479> not<00:02:08.509> actually<00:02:09.170> ready<00:02:09.410> for<00:02:09.709> it

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
they're not actually ready for it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.559 
they're not actually ready for it
because<00:02:10.009> they're<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.490> optimistic<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.450> they

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
because they're so optimistic that they

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:12.760 
because they're so optimistic that they
never<00:02:11.750> thought<00:02:11.900> anything<00:02:12.140> bad<00:02:12.440> could<00:02:12.620> happen

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
never thought anything bad could happen

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.430 
never thought anything bad could happen
to<00:02:12.980> them<00:02:13.130> or<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.490> politician<00:02:14.270> might<00:02:14.720> be<00:02:15.170> so

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
to them or a politician might be so

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.600 
to them or a politician might be so
confident<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:16.520> full<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.760> self-esteem

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
confident and so full of self-esteem

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.980 
confident and so full of self-esteem
that<00:02:17.850> they<00:02:17.940> actually<00:02:18.090> might<00:02:18.360> make<00:02:18.390> mistakes

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
that they actually might make mistakes

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.390 
that they actually might make mistakes
that<00:02:19.530> later<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:19.830> could<00:02:20.040> hurt<00:02:20.220> themselves

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
that later on could hurt themselves

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.760 
that later on could hurt themselves
personally<00:02:21.030> or<00:02:21.600> they<00:02:22.170> could<00:02:22.350> hurt<00:02:22.590> their

whole country if they make really bad

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.420 
whole country if they make really bad
mistakes<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.260> it's<00:02:25.410> interesting<00:02:25.710> in<00:02:26.100> sports

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
mistakes so it's interesting in sports

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.460 
mistakes so it's interesting in sports
psychology<00:02:26.610> positive<00:02:27.450> psychology<00:02:28.050> that

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
psychology positive psychology that

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.800 
psychology positive psychology that
these<00:02:28.650> traits<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.220> self-esteem<00:02:29.810> confidence

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
these traits like self-esteem confidence

these traits like self-esteem confidence
optimism<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.770> sounds<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.610> great<00:02:32.940> you

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
optimism that sounds so great you

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.960 
optimism that sounds so great you
actually<00:02:34.170> don't<00:02:34.350> want<00:02:34.410> too<00:02:34.860> much<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.160> but<00:02:35.880> you

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
actually don't want too much of but you

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.670 
actually don't want too much of but you
also<00:02:36.120> don't<00:02:36.330> want<00:02:36.540> too<00:02:36.690> little<00:02:36.960> of<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.410> I

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
also don't want too little of and I

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.750 
also don't want too little of and I
think<00:02:37.710> that's<00:02:38.100> what<00:02:38.310> makes<00:02:38.430> sports

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
think that's what makes sports

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.730 
think that's what makes sports
psychology<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.570> positive<00:02:40.050> psychology<00:02:40.170> so

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
psychology and positive psychology so

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.220 
psychology and positive psychology so
interesting<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.460> complexity<00:02:42.240> of<00:02:42.510> having

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
interesting is that complexity of having

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.949 
interesting is that complexity of having
enough<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:44.100> be<00:02:44.250> confident<00:02:44.700> but<00:02:45.240> not<00:02:45.420> having<00:02:45.660> so

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
enough to be confident but not having so

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.600 
enough to be confident but not having so
much<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.410> you're<00:02:46.530> overly<00:02:46.950> confident<00:02:47.400> and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
much that you're overly confident and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.240 
much that you're overly confident and
then<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.120> don't<00:02:48.300> prepare<00:02:48.510> very<00:02:48.930> well<00:02:49.250> one

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
then you don't prepare very well one

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.710 
then you don't prepare very well one
little<00:02:50.520> thing<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.880> think<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.240> fun<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.540> do

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
little thing that I think is fun to do

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.510 
little thing that I think is fun to do
when<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.500> talk<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:52.860> people<00:02:52.980> about<00:02:53.160> what<00:02:53.250> is

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
when I talk to people about what is
