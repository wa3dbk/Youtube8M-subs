00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.089
 Saadi and we are now on the ice after the last few years with the wolves 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.500
 Freiburg's references to iSuppli er in Freiburg are very successful 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.840
 iSuppli on the weekend that the stadium lash down wolves vum down and tested 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.810
 was also against the favorite theme Int favorite opponents - 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.999
 takes from Spain 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:26.039
 the beginning of the ice age ensures bright eyes in small and at 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.390
 big as playing field topic number one at the stadium festival of course the question 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.170
 what's up next season at the newly formed team's report 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.300
 For the time being it will therefore be able to achieve a relentless recovery 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.560
 difficult to say overall but I think the team with the potential 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.180
 the only players have gotten along well 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.050
 Really good for us is a difficult climb 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.050
 the so-called smart fortwo night orange is very original 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.290
 Class surprising 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.070
 the German is 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.830
 I hope that she runs positively first three dates very good 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.970
 Team is yes 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.450
 I think that is more than 600 games could be displaced under the ashes 14 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.740
 the first surprise for the claims the new cubes combining gray 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.030
 Blue and Vitos become almost a little easier 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.290
 the second surprise is the more pleasant one 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.420
 Freiburg with the second division of the belly mountain from the beginning to the forehead 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.880
 Sweat Lodge troupe makes a good turn and creates a good mood 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.880
 Blue and white groups 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.710
 the guests from Schwenningen in this initial phase only very rarely times in the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.939
 Forward gear their leading scorer therefore also rather coincidentally 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.750
 Markus Schuler in the second attempt 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.900
 an ex-Freiburger ensures only one place for the Swabian end 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.159
 but the wolves are not impressed by the payoff after one 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.770
 Quarter of an hour a case for the new first block where Kurt Meier says 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.530
 Varel sprinted 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.340
 and the latter the only remaining one from the past 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.770
 season 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.250
 Lübtheen extended 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.229
 Peter Maser I know about the bad foul in March 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.229
 thought to have fun again this kick 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.779
 shortly before the end of this entertaining first third the wolves are back in 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:24.009
 It is as usual and Dublin with the first view 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.759
 Goal scorer this time the test play the user Strotmeier the 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.949
 not overpaid in recent years, not just a Freiburg 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:31.959
 specialty 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.959
 the plague gives cause for hope 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.420
 for a shock that goes on but it also always has to be diligent 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.420
 be trained to always be able to retrieve this then 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.909
 the last third then a little balanced Schwenningen now 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.909
 more often before the wolves gate of it 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.679
 The game remains intent on a test with real derby character 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.189
 "We're rattling Patrick Boos on the Burghausener 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.959
 the Swedish goalie remains 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.559
 can after a short time 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.419
 but the 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.929
 the second third ends scoreless it sounds like coach Peter Ustorf has to stand up for 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:18.399
 The final section of what if this test does not come up with a 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.399
 small embarrassment should end 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.359
 However, the better chances were still the top division Peter Mosch 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.359
 called failed with a fine solo 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.429
 on the other side thick air because of a not given Schwenninger 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:37.079
 Treffers parts of yesterday Hans then briefly forget their good 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.929
 Nursery the custom could and missed so high sums up the 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:44.419
 Decision Minute 53 Freiburg in outnumbered 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:47.949
 can still meet 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:52.599
 He successfully secured 17 times for second division Crimmitschau 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.599
 enjoy nature with his new team 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:02.009
 Bogdan Salärs also changes the score 3 to 3 more times 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.489
 the final siren only Statistics 2 will win the opening game 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.429
 Nevertheless, the chain warns against premature euphoria 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.859
 Also, of course, because this is the first week 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.280
 On the ice is a week longer and Flat Mission the steps more 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.230
 accustomed and on the domestic ice and windows one can not yet 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.249
 Conclusion to 10 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:27.249
 the Bochum 18 that I'm not a class difference 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.510
 of course in a very early stage the new equipment the first time 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.809
 must be driven and accordingly 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:35.919
 Kauder I say 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.699
 The first euphoria brake caused this will be thrown Opel yesterday even in the test 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.690
 against the second division from Bietigheim documents the somewhat tired Freiburg 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.830
 Meter 2 to 5 but all half so wild finally have to rule the world 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.939
 to the season opener on 14 September 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:51.819
 Be top shape
