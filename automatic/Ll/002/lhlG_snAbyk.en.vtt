00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:08.620
 today in English wesley we cook for a 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.519
 liter of pumpkin juice you go to 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:15.849
 need 200 milliliters of water 200 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.000
 grams of pumpkin 200 milliliters of 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:22.119
 peach juice 200 milliliters of juice 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.369
 of pineapple and 200 milliliters of juice 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.800
 orange will of course be richer and 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.340
 all this is natural the first thing that 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.920
 let's do is bake the pumpkin this 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.949
 will take us in quick pot about 15 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.930
 minutes and in an open or normal pot 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.239
 about half an hour until 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.970
 be well blandita remember do not add or 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.440
 salt or sugar this potion alone is going to 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.440
 take 20 minutes 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.340
 now let's remove the pumpkin 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.340
 we will put it in a little dish without the water and 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.350
 We will take them to the refrigerator so that 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.350
 so be cool when we do this 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.220
 while you can pumpkin we are going to 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.200
 talk about the rest of everyone for the 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.200
 orange we bet to squeeze 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.670
 Natural orange is much better and 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.950
 much richer than the one that 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.840
 get in supermarkets in terms of the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.509
 pineapple if you have the opportunity to 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.550
 get natural pineapple better the base lic 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.860
 in your house and there you have the pineapple juice 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.960
 we have bought a boat of 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.730
 preserve of natural pineapple and let's 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.190
 use your juice 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.650
 the peach is very rich peach 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.050
 preserved in syrup this syrup this 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.460
 has sweetened that is to say it has no sugar and 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.980
 it's really very good and also 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.020
 tolerated by diabetics or 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.390
 that can not take sugar we go to 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.850
 according to very clean hands like 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.570
 whenever we cook we will cut the 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:53.659
 halves of peaches in syrup 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.270
 thus it will be easier for us to liquefy the 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.399
 let's crush the peach we have 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.740
 used a measuring jug to see 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.300
 when it reaches 200 and there stop because 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.650
 we will not need more 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.650
 Now let's do a little above 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.150
 now let's make the orange juice 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.909
 once the pumpkin is cold we are going to 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.790
 add to the boat where we have the 200 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:52.010
 milliliters of water it is important that 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.439
 be cold so that later the juice is more 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.870
 tasty since the other juices are 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:59.239
 we do in the moment and if we leave them 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.329
 cool after we lose all the 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.879
 vitamins by the way in many places 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:08.560
 they say juice instead of juice but we're 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.560
 talking exactly the same thing 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.220
 pour in a jug the juice of 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:22.000
 pumpkin and let's add the juices of 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.900
 pineapple peach and orange for a 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.090
 Express version 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.940
 you can use supermarket juices 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.040
 This mixture is great if you're from 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.099
 those who looked askance at the juice of 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.319
 pumpkin this recipe is yours is 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.510
 very rich and is completely addictive 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.890
 once you do it you will do it one and a thousand 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.890
 times 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.010
 You can add cinnamon powder to 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.490
 give a winter touch and enhance all 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.490
 the flavors 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.610
 Now let's stir the mixture with 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.650
 some rods this procedure can 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.650
 be done equally with a magic wand 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.280
 for a total effect to be a 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.250
 droplet of veritas serum in the juice 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.730
 pumpkin morning we are going to suggest 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.990
 a completely potteric presentation 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.600
 We need a bottle that we have for 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:19.530
 house well clean and dry 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:23.130
 a sticker on which we have printed 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.860
 as you see here any tag 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.500
 that suggests as pumpkin our 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.160
 pumpkin juice a jug or a funnel 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.660
 and let's start sticking the label in 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.850
 the center of our bottle 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.850
 this bottle is 200 milliliters 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.630
 so we'll move on to our jar 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.350
 meter to 200 milliliters to be able 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.350
 make the filling 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.830
 now 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.220
 delicately we are filling in with the 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.220
 bottle 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.139
 and until the next video recipes
