00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
and a why

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.070 
and a why
I<00:02:12.220> have<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.090> see<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.270> think<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.900> they've

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
I have to see I think that they've

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.410 
I have to see I think that they've
really<00:02:14.500> improved<00:02:14.710> in<00:02:15.220> their<00:02:15.370> frames<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:16.030> really

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
really improved in their frames I really

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.360 
really improved in their frames I really
like<00:02:16.600> this<00:02:16.810> new<00:02:17.080> set<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.590> still<00:02:17.920> like<00:02:18.070> my<00:02:18.100> old

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
like this new set I still like my old

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.730 
like this new set I still like my old
set<00:02:18.610> too<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:20.110> I'll<00:02:20.440> go<00:02:20.590> PI<00:02:20.770> go<00:02:20.980> between<00:02:21.130> them

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
set too so I'll go PI go between them

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.650 
set too so I'll go PI go between them
yes<00:02:23.740> I<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.520> I<00:02:24.610> updated<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.090> prescription<00:02:25.570> on

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
yes I and I updated the prescription on

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.410 
yes I and I updated the prescription on
them<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.430> depends<00:02:27.760> on<00:02:27.820> what<00:02:27.940> I'm<00:02:28.060> wearing

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
them so I it depends on what I'm wearing

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.030 
them so I it depends on what I'm wearing
I<00:02:28.690> was<00:02:28.870> gonna<00:02:28.990> wear<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.230> red<00:02:29.470> dress<00:02:29.500> for<00:02:29.890> this

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
I was gonna wear a red dress for this

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.350 
I was gonna wear a red dress for this
but<00:02:30.280> that<00:02:30.610> goes<00:02:30.790> better<00:02:30.940> with<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.210> red

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
but that goes better with the red

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.630 
but that goes better with the red
glasses<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:31.990> stuck<00:02:32.260> with<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.590> outfit<00:02:33.250> but

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
glasses so I stuck with this outfit but

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.370 
glasses so I stuck with this outfit but
keep<00:02:33.880> in<00:02:34.030> mind<00:02:34.270> they<00:02:34.480> highly<00:02:34.840> suggest<00:02:35.260> and
