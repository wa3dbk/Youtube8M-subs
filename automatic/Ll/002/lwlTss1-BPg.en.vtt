that<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.540> can't<00:00:39.840> do<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.710> from<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> inside

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
that you can't do just from the inside

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.369

out<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.570> start<00:00:42.960> from<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.350> inside

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
out you have to start from the inside

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.830 
out you have to start from the inside
out<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.190> then<00:00:44.789> work<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> little<00:00:45.480> bit<00:00:45.660> on
