so when is thought out we just reopen it
like<00:04:58.760> this<00:04:58.970> if<00:04:59.240> you<00:04:59.330> never<00:04:59.510> had<00:04:59.750> it<00:04:59.900> as<00:05:00.020> a<00:05:00.050> proof

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
like this if you never had it as a proof

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.159 
like this if you never had it as a proof
that<00:05:00.470> comes<00:05:00.650> from<00:05:00.710> Southeast<00:05:01.250> Asia<00:05:01.520> and

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
that comes from Southeast Asia and

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.480 
that comes from Southeast Asia and
basically<00:05:03.169> sometimes<00:05:03.740> it's<00:05:03.949> cracked<00:05:04.250> open

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
basically sometimes it's cracked open

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.430 
basically sometimes it's cracked open
already<00:05:04.760> and<00:05:05.150> it's<00:05:05.270> very<00:05:05.419> sulfur<00:05:05.960> so<00:05:06.199> even

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
already and it's very sulfur so even

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.290 
already and it's very sulfur so even
though<00:05:06.500> it<00:05:06.620> tastes<00:05:06.860> very<00:05:07.160> sweet<00:05:07.970> it<00:05:08.150> has<00:05:08.270> a

though it tastes very sweet it has a
high<00:05:08.510> sulfur<00:05:08.990> smell<00:05:09.139> so<00:05:10.040> we<00:05:10.160> just<00:05:10.340> crack<00:05:10.580> it

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610
