00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
you think that is it because you I don't

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.590 
you think that is it because you I don't
know<00:02:52.610> that<00:02:52.760> I've<00:02:52.850> ever<00:02:53.030> develop<00:02:53.420> more

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
know that I've ever develop more

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.390 
know that I've ever develop more
confidence<00:02:54.200> with<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.590> with<00:02:54.709> like<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.160> given

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
confidence with it with like the given

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.949 
confidence with it with like the given
it<00:02:55.520> you<00:02:55.610> know<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.850> band<00:02:56.030> as<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.209> whole<00:02:56.300> or<00:02:56.720> is<00:02:56.810> it

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
it you know the band as a whole or is it

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.600 
it you know the band as a whole or is it
just<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.260> actually<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.280> think<00:02:58.490> that

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
just that actually you you think that

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.070 
just that actually you you think that
this<00:02:58.670> is<00:02:58.820> a<00:02:58.850> lot<00:02:59.030> more<00:02:59.180> special<00:02:59.390> in<00:02:59.690> previous

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
this is a lot more special in previous

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.910 
this is a lot more special in previous
work<00:03:00.760> I'd<00:03:01.760> say<00:03:01.820> it's<00:03:02.390> a<00:03:02.600> confidence<00:03:03.320> thing<00:03:03.590> and

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
work I'd say it's a confidence thing and

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.870 
work I'd say it's a confidence thing and
the<00:03:04.220> fact<00:03:04.490> that<00:03:04.610> it<00:03:05.570> just<00:03:05.600> seems<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:06.790> don't<00:03:07.790> know

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
the fact that it just seems I don't know

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.580 
the fact that it just seems I don't know
I<00:03:07.940> think<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.450> fact<00:03:08.660> that<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.020> know<00:03:09.140> we<00:03:09.320> kind

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
I think the fact that you know we kind

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.979 
I think the fact that you know we kind
of<00:03:09.970> realized<00:03:10.970> that<00:03:11.090> we're<00:03:11.300> still<00:03:11.540> having<00:03:11.750> so

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
of realized that we're still having so

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.830 
of realized that we're still having so
