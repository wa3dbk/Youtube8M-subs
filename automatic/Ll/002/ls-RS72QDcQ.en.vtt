okay<00:05:42.910> that's<00:05:43.480> wrong<00:05:43.780> let's<00:05:44.260> try<00:05:44.410> that<00:05:44.560> again

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
okay that's wrong let's try that again

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:55.740 
okay that's wrong let's try that again
so<00:05:45.610> it's<00:05:45.820> 1<00:05:46.440> 86<00:05:47.440> x<00:05:48.570> 50<00:05:52.650> you<00:05:53.650> press<00:05:53.980> equals<00:05:54.750> C

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
so it's 1 86 x 50 you press equals C

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.660 
so it's 1 86 x 50 you press equals C
it's<00:05:56.370> 9.3<00:05:57.370> k<00:05:57.640> and<00:05:58.140> the<00:05:59.140> tickets<00:05:59.560> cost<00:05:59.830> 600

it's 9.3 k and the tickets cost 600

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.760 
it's 9.3 k and the tickets cost 600
giving<00:06:01.390> 6k<00:06:01.960> so<00:06:02.710> you<00:06:02.800> take<00:06:02.980> making<00:06:03.840> 3.3<00:06:04.840> k<00:06:05.050> each

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
giving 6k so you take making 3.3 k each

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.000 
giving 6k so you take making 3.3 k each
time<00:06:06.340> eat<00:06:06.730> for<00:06:07.090> each<00:06:07.240> a<00:06:07.390> thousand<00:06:07.870> tickets<00:06:08.010> if
