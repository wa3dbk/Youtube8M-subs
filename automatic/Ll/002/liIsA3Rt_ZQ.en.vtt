00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
pretty good deal on these I think I paid

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.040 
pretty good deal on these I think I paid
11<00:00:33.809> something<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.500> small<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.280> the

11 something for the small one and the
larger<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.200> was<00:00:37.410> about<00:00:38.480> $24<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.629> believe<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
larger one was about $24 I believe and

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.569 
larger one was about $24 I believe and
you<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.800> they're<00:00:43.800> actually<00:00:43.980> pretty<00:00:44.340> well

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
the k-bar kukri obviously this is a

the k-bar kukri obviously this is a
modern<00:00:55.680> knife<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.989> it's<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.590> very<00:00:58.920> good<00:00:59.190> and

modern knife and it's it's very good and

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.990 
modern knife and it's it's very good and
it's<00:00:59.960> definitely<00:01:00.960> well-built<00:01:01.699> but<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.820> is

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
it's definitely well-built but it is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.679 
it's definitely well-built but it is
actually<00:01:03.539> quite<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.530> bit<00:01:04.799> thinner<00:01:05.330> than<00:01:06.330> even

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
actually quite a bit thinner than even

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.890 
actually quite a bit thinner than even
this<00:01:06.869> little<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.320> new<00:01:07.439> one<00:01:07.590> I've<00:01:07.740> got<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:08.900> see

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
this little a new one I've got here see

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.929 
this little a new one I've got here see
if<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.290> remember<00:01:10.409> I'm<00:01:11.340> thinking<00:01:11.790> it's

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
if I can remember I'm thinking it's

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.770 
if I can remember I'm thinking it's
about<00:01:13.070> well<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.159> says<00:01:14.310> 0.15<00:01:15.119> inches<00:01:17.030> or<00:01:18.030> three

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
about well it says 0.15 inches or three

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.590 
about well it says 0.15 inches or three
point<00:01:19.020> nine<00:01:19.080> millimeters<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.299> know<00:01:21.420> right

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
point nine millimeters so you know right

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.179 
point nine millimeters so you know right
around<00:01:21.689> four<00:01:22.049> millimeters<00:01:22.560> thick<00:01:22.830> there<00:01:23.070> in

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
around four millimeters thick there in

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.340 
around four millimeters thick there in
the<00:01:23.250> spine<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.360> know<00:01:24.659> ever<00:01:24.869> since<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.200> got

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the spine so you know ever since I got

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.249 
the spine so you know ever since I got
this<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.710> kind<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.070> wanted<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.720> get<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
this I kind of wanted to get one of the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.380 
this I kind of wanted to get one of the
the<00:01:28.560> real<00:01:28.740> thick<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.150> more

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
the real thick you know a more

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.609 
the real thick you know a more
traditional<00:01:30.600> style<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.570> kind<00:01:34.560> of

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
traditional style and and I kind of

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.109 
traditional style and and I kind of
thought<00:01:34.890> they<00:01:35.070> were<00:01:35.130> expensive<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> never

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
thought they were expensive so I never

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.460 
thought they were expensive so I never
really<00:01:36.630> pursued<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:38.009> know<00:01:38.100> too<00:01:38.490> greatly

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
really pursued it you know too greatly

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.410 
really pursued it you know too greatly
but<00:01:40.470> these<00:01:41.130> ones<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:41.970> did<00:01:42.150> find

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
but these ones that I that I did find

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.200 
but these ones that I that I did find
here<00:01:42.720> at<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.860> antique<00:01:44.430> shop<00:01:44.460> are<00:01:44.850> actually

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
here at the antique shop are actually

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.710 
here at the antique shop are actually
you<00:01:45.780> know<00:01:45.869> they<00:01:46.259> seem<00:01:46.530> pretty<00:01:46.770> well-made<00:01:47.720> you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
you know they seem pretty well-made you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.719 
you know they seem pretty well-made you
know<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.990> small<00:01:49.290> ones<00:01:49.500> 5.1<00:01:50.220> millimeters

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
know the small ones 5.1 millimeters

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.480 
know the small ones 5.1 millimeters
thick<00:01:51.030> they're<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> spine<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
thick they're on the spine and and the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.800 
thick they're on the spine and and the
larger<00:01:53.880> one<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:55.460> 7.3<00:01:56.460> millimeters<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
larger one is 7.3 millimeters so you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.700 
larger one is 7.3 millimeters so you
know<00:01:57.899> these<00:01:58.049> are<00:01:58.110> definitely<00:01:59.270> meaty<00:02:00.270> blades

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
know these are definitely meaty blades

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.170 
know these are definitely meaty blades
now<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.890> one<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.340> kind<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.790> tried<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> do

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
now this one here I kind of tried to do

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.700 
now this one here I kind of tried to do
a<00:02:03.210> little<00:02:03.360> bit<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.659> research<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.469> kind<00:02:04.680> of

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
a little bit of research on just kind of

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.459 
a little bit of research on just kind of
see<00:02:04.950> if<00:02:05.100> there<00:02:05.310> was<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:06.479> know<00:02:06.509> much<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.320> could

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
see if there was you know much I could

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.960 
see if there was you know much I could
find<00:02:07.710> out<00:02:07.860> about<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.369> I'm<00:02:08.489> certainly<00:02:08.819> not

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
find out about it and I'm certainly not

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.180 
find out about it and I'm certainly not
an<00:02:09.149> expert<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.539> there<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.110> if<00:02:10.800> anybody<00:02:11.129> out

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
an expert on there so if anybody out

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.089

larger one here from what I can find

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.899 
larger one here from what I can find
it<00:02:57.219> seems<00:02:57.699> like<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.269> might<00:02:58.480> be<00:02:59.909> something

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
it seems like it might be something

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.309 
it seems like it might be something
possibly<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.199> was<00:03:02.379> made<00:03:03.129> and<00:03:03.370> around<00:03:03.639> the

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
possibly that was made and around the

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.770 
possibly that was made and around the
world<00:03:05.319> war<00:03:05.620> two<00:03:05.889> era<00:03:06.159> I<00:03:06.540> found<00:03:07.540> some

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
world war two era I found some

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.699 
world war two era I found some
references<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.879> some<00:03:09.879> British<00:03:10.209> designs<00:03:10.709> that

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
references to some British designs that

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.030 
references to some British designs that
have<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.639> full<00:03:12.849> tang<00:03:13.150> which<00:03:13.480> this<00:03:13.919> appears<00:03:14.919> to

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
have the full tang which this appears to

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.399 
have the full tang which this appears to
have<00:03:15.219> and<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.060> guess<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.479> more<00:03:16.689> traditional

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
have and I guess the more traditional

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.140 
have and I guess the more traditional
Guk<00:03:17.919> Reese<00:03:19.919> don't<00:03:20.919> have<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.310> full<00:03:21.699> tang<00:03:21.939> they've

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
Guk Reese don't have a full tang they've

Guk Reese don't have a full tang they've

got a partial tang and a glued on handle

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.740 
got a partial tang and a glued on handle
that<00:03:25.900> may<00:03:26.139> be<00:03:26.199> somewhat<00:03:27.069> inaccurate<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.449> feel

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
that may be somewhat inaccurate so feel

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.469 
that may be somewhat inaccurate so feel

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.210 
free to correct me if I'm wrong here but
know<00:03:31.870> whether<00:03:32.049> these<00:03:32.259> knives<00:03:32.530> are<00:03:32.829> actually

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
know whether these knives are actually

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.589 
know whether these knives are actually
quote<00:03:34.090> real<00:03:34.419> or<00:03:34.689> not<00:03:35.849> they<00:03:36.849> seem<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.269> be<00:03:37.389> very

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
quote real or not they seem to be very

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.530 
quote real or not they seem to be very
well<00:03:37.870> made<00:03:38.139> and<00:03:38.169> you<00:03:38.859> know<00:03:39.009> and<00:03:39.189> I<00:03:39.540> actually

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
well made and you know and I actually

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.499 
well made and you know and I actually
used<00:03:40.930> this<00:03:41.139> one<00:03:41.409> recently<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:42.250> chop<00:03:43.239> down<00:03:43.449> some

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:43.509 
used this one recently to chop down some

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:48.479 
used this one recently to chop down some
some<00:03:44.439> small<00:03:45.840> trees<00:03:46.840> or<00:03:47.349> weeds<00:03:47.829> I<00:03:48.129> guess<00:03:48.310> you'd

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
some small trees or weeds I guess you'd

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.640 
some small trees or weeds I guess you'd
say<00:03:48.579> large<00:03:49.180> weed<00:03:49.479> small<00:03:49.930> trees<00:03:50.229> that<00:03:50.530> were

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
say large weed small trees that were

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.789 
say large weed small trees that were
growing<00:03:50.949> up<00:03:51.129> so<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:52.359> it<00:03:52.479> did<00:03:52.689> fine<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.409> then

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
growing up so and it did fine and then

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.089 
growing up so and it did fine and then
actually<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.669> blade<00:03:54.849> is<00:03:55.060> quite<00:03:55.329> dull<00:03:56.099> one

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
actually the the blade is quite dull one

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.050 
actually the the blade is quite dull one
other<00:03:57.310> thing<00:03:57.579> I<00:03:57.669> thought<00:03:57.849> was<00:03:57.969> interesting

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
other thing I thought was interesting

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.050 
other thing I thought was interesting
about<00:03:58.599> this<00:03:58.840> larger<00:03:59.409> knife<00:03:59.769> was<00:04:00.699> that<00:04:00.849> even

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
about this larger knife was that even

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.539 
about this larger knife was that even
though<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.269> had<00:04:01.419> the<00:04:01.569> full<00:04:01.780> tang<00:04:02.079> which<00:04:02.549> could

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
though it had the full tang which could

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.649 
though it had the full tang which could
suggest<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.540> was<00:04:04.659> a<00:04:04.719> British<00:04:05.560> military<00:04:06.659> type

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
suggest it was a British military type

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.469 
suggest it was a British military type
knife<00:04:08.099> there's<00:04:09.099> absolutely<00:04:09.579> no<00:04:09.759> markings<00:04:10.299> on

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:10.479 
knife there's absolutely no markings on

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:14.069 
knife there's absolutely no markings on
it<00:04:10.689> that<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.739> that<00:04:12.069> I<00:04:12.099> can<00:04:12.250> see<00:04:12.719> and<00:04:13.719> it<00:04:13.840> seems

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
it that I that I can see and it seems

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.890 
it that I that I can see and it seems
like<00:04:14.319> a<00:04:14.349> lot<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.949> British<00:04:15.780> examples<00:04:16.780> I

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
like a lot of the British examples I

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.529 
like a lot of the British examples I
found<00:04:17.169> on<00:04:17.349> the<00:04:17.409> Internet<00:04:17.769> had<00:04:18.280> had<00:04:18.699> letters

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
found on the Internet had had letters

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.509 
found on the Internet had had letters
and<00:04:19.780> different<00:04:20.079> markings<00:04:20.739> stamped<00:04:21.219> in<00:04:21.340> them

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
and different markings stamped in them

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.089 
and different markings stamped in them
so<00:04:21.820> I<00:04:22.060> thought<00:04:22.960> that<00:04:23.139> was<00:04:23.260> kind<00:04:23.560> of<00:04:23.680> kind<00:04:23.949> of

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
so I thought that was kind of kind of

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.170 
so I thought that was kind of kind of
strange

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
strange

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.210 
strange
I'm<00:04:25.449> not<00:04:25.630> sure<00:04:25.840> I'm<00:04:26.110> not<00:04:26.680> sure<00:04:26.830> if<00:04:26.949> that<00:04:27.070> has

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
I'm not sure I'm not sure if that has

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.460 
I'm not sure I'm not sure if that has
any<00:04:27.520> significance<00:04:28.120> or<00:04:28.300> not<00:04:28.479> so<00:04:28.870> again<00:04:29.229> maybe

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
any significance or not so again maybe

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.379 
any significance or not so again maybe
somebody<00:04:29.919> out<00:04:29.979> there<00:04:30.220> seeing<00:04:30.639> this<00:04:30.789> video<00:04:31.000> can

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389

help me out with that also thought the

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.110 
help me out with that also thought the
sheath<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:35.710> came<00:04:36.100> to<00:04:36.310> larger<00:04:36.639> was<00:04:36.820> kind<00:04:37.060> of

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
sheath that came to larger was kind of

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.080 
sheath that came to larger was kind of
interesting<00:04:37.690> and<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:38.770> at<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.490> time<00:04:39.639> I<00:04:39.850> didn't

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
interesting and I at the time I didn't

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.390 
interesting and I at the time I didn't
really<00:04:40.360> realize<00:04:40.600> it<00:04:40.960> but<00:04:41.169> you<00:04:42.070> know<00:04:42.160> it<00:04:42.250> looks

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
really realize it but you know it looks

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.310 
really realize it but you know it looks
like<00:04:42.460> it's<00:04:42.759> lined<00:04:43.060> with<00:04:43.210> wood<00:04:43.660> on<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.289> inside

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
like it's lined with wood on the inside

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.020 
like it's lined with wood on the inside
and<00:04:44.889> you<00:04:45.220> know<00:04:45.310> we<00:04:45.370> wrapped<00:04:45.550> with<00:04:45.669> leather<00:04:45.880> and

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
and you know we wrapped with leather and

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.670 
and you know we wrapped with leather and
I<00:04:46.060> think<00:04:46.300> that's<00:04:46.479> actually<00:04:46.990> kind<00:04:47.259> of<00:04:47.350> a<00:04:47.470> pretty

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
I think that's actually kind of a pretty

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.950 
I think that's actually kind of a pretty
common<00:04:48.360> sheath<00:04:49.360> design<00:04:49.810> on<00:04:50.289> these<00:04:50.560> knives<00:04:51.220> and

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
common sheath design on these knives and

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.469 
common sheath design on these knives and
one<00:04:52.960> other<00:04:53.110> thing<00:04:53.440> you<00:04:53.470> can<00:04:53.740> see<00:04:53.800> the

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
one other thing you can see the

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.120 
one other thing you can see the
someone's<00:04:55.479> taking<00:04:56.350> it<00:04:56.440> in<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:56.710> out<00:04:56.800> quite<00:04:57.070> a

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
someone's taking it in and out quite a

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.939 
someone's taking it in and out quite a
few<00:04:57.220> times<00:04:57.669> because<00:04:57.970> can<00:04:58.270> see<00:04:58.449> where<00:04:58.660> the<00:04:58.949> the

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
few times because can see where the the

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.589 
few times because can see where the the
blade<00:05:00.190> is<00:05:00.430> dug<00:05:00.639> in<00:05:00.849> through<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.210> back<00:05:01.389> of<00:05:01.419> the

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 
blade is dug in through the back of the

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:03.629 
blade is dug in through the back of the
sheath<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:02.169> carved<00:05:02.889> a<00:05:02.979> nice<00:05:03.130> little<00:05:03.340> groove

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
sheath and carved a nice little groove

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.339 
sheath and carved a nice little groove
on<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:03.940> outside<00:05:03.970> there<00:05:04.570> so<00:05:04.810> it<00:05:04.930> is<00:05:04.960> a<00:05:05.110> little

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
on the outside there so it is a little

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:06.779 
on the outside there so it is a little
bit<00:05:05.470> tricky<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.889> get<00:05:06.009> it<00:05:06.099> in<00:05:06.220> there<00:05:06.340> sometimes

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
bit tricky to get it in there sometimes

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.159 
bit tricky to get it in there sometimes
but<00:05:07.289> but<00:05:08.849> you<00:05:09.849> know<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.150> it's<00:05:10.660> at<00:05:10.810> there<00:05:10.960> kind

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
but but you know it it's at there kind

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.830 
but but you know it it's at there kind
of<00:05:11.259> rough<00:05:11.410> shape<00:05:11.710> but<00:05:12.240> I'm<00:05:13.240> hoping<00:05:13.570> to<00:05:13.690> go

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
of rough shape but I'm hoping to go

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.520 
of rough shape but I'm hoping to go
ahead<00:05:14.139> and<00:05:15.120> take<00:05:16.120> him<00:05:16.270> to<00:05:16.539> a<00:05:16.570> local<00:05:16.960> knife<00:05:17.289> guy

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
ahead and take him to a local knife guy

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.150 
ahead and take him to a local knife guy
and<00:05:18.070> get<00:05:18.280> him<00:05:18.310> shined<00:05:18.669> up<00:05:18.849> and<00:05:19.090> sharpen<00:05:19.539> so

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
and get him shined up and sharpen so

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.700 
and get him shined up and sharpen so
let's<00:05:21.160> see<00:05:21.370> how<00:05:21.520> that<00:05:21.580> goes

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
let's see how that goes

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.110 
let's see how that goes
