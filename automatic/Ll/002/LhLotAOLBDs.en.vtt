00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.540
 hi i am nothing i am gay nerd i was 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.460
 calm and undefined without desire when 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.360
 suddenly I saw a news that be me already 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.030
 I was waiting for him yes sir and yes sir 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.740
 there will be new series of dragon ball will 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.500
 when I saw that news that was already 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.720
 obviously we all celebrate and that is 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.150
 I just wanted to mature but so 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.570
 maturity who has suspended until new 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.570
 notice 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.570
 and with the arrival of this new series 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.850
 Obviously I already see that they are going to start 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.430
 again the people who do not like and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.080
 He says it does not stay as headquarters of the devil 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.690
 and that is a bad example for the 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.980
 children and all those things but I do not know by 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.930
 what are these people talking about and vegueta has 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.390
 taught to leave pride aside 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.739
 Cuban that the study is very important 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.090
 I believe and he taught me to see what a 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.620
 true friend and he taught me what 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.629
 important that friendship is no longer 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.520
 feel bad when you kill more than 500 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.110
 Sometimes golden sounds taught me that 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.940
 working in a team is always better 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.570
 trump taught me to have pink hair 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.400
 it does not mean that you are an agent agent 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.199
 I say with the Lord never park the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.270
 arms for more difficult than the situation 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.310
 seem to be happy and ways that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.470
 things are wrong to get up and follow 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.770
 struggling since the real heroes 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.580
 receive death as a smile make me 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.800
 yours or play 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.350
 to any that 13 years without seeing a 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.930
 goku series truly that's something 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.610
 that no human being can withstand 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.590
 that's why shortly before his coming and 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.660
 it was announced it was sending signals 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.660
 or tell me you did not see that 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.450
 never 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.940
 that was one that in quirama a hummer 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.950
 to let us know that goku would soon be 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.320
 with us again it was not a 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.240
 shows to be an example of a person 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.060
 you agree that all your enemies 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.800
 I said the program I'm going to forgive you and 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.050
 he always ended up forgiving them 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.970
 Starting in July of this year, we will return to 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.220
 live the adventures of our great 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.320
 friend and we will do what 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.300
 we always did in past times 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.800
 we will try again to help goku 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.780
 when he asks to raise his hands 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.210
 to do the entity because I know there are 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.060
 many people who listened when 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.800
 come and listen to me all for what 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.569
 more land we need to give us 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.709

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.709
 and you were there 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.189
 and at times you wanted to lift the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.379
 lover you did not do it because then 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.450
 you thought that your friends suddenly got 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.819
 they were going to laugh at you but also good those 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.000
 children who did live the series as it should 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.000
