00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
cool because they were like these

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.470 
cool because they were like these
dragonflies<00:02:25.440> these<00:02:26.069> bugs<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:27.180> would<00:02:27.360> go

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
dragonflies these bugs that would go

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.320 
dragonflies these bugs that would go
around<00:02:27.630> hit<00:02:28.440> each<00:02:28.590> other<00:02:28.830> by<00:02:29.819> pressing<00:02:30.209> this

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
around hit each other by pressing this

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.559 
around hit each other by pressing this
lever<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.340> yeah<00:02:32.340> really<00:02:32.670> really<00:02:32.819> cool<00:02:33.239> let's

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
lever and yeah really really cool let's

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.559 
lever and yeah really really cool let's
check<00:02:33.720> out<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.989> other<00:02:34.110> one<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.120> guy<00:02:36.300> had

check out the other one so this guy had

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.870 
check out the other one so this guy had
more<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:37.020> an<00:02:37.260> orange<00:02:37.560> color<00:02:37.800> scheme<00:02:38.459> really

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
more of an orange color scheme really

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.840

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
hook and it was kind of the same build

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.080 
hook and it was kind of the same build
you<00:02:54.690> would<00:02:54.810> hold<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.110> like<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:56.090> push

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
you would hold it like this and push

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.390 
you would hold it like this and push
this<00:02:57.239> level<00:02:57.570> forward<00:02:57.810> lever<00:02:58.319> forward<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.310> it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
this level forward lever forward and it

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.460 
this level forward lever forward and it
will<00:02:59.550> have<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> function<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.660> hitting

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
will have the function of hitting

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.440 
will have the function of hitting
something<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.980> front<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:05.150> let's<00:03:06.150> take<00:03:06.420> a

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450

earlier<00:04:11.209> but<00:04:12.209> we<00:04:12.359> have<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:12.870> picture<00:04:13.350> of<00:04:13.590> all<00:04:13.859> the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
earlier but we have a picture of all the

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.029 
earlier but we have a picture of all the
sets<00:04:14.220> we<00:04:14.430> had<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:15.329> Taronga<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.500> TOA

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
sets we had the Taronga the TOA

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:22.220 
sets we had the Taronga the TOA
all<00:04:17.579> the<00:04:18.570> raw<00:04:18.780> he<00:04:19.430> see<00:04:20.430> all<00:04:20.669> of<00:04:21.299> the

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
all the raw he see all of the

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.520 
all the raw he see all of the
six<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:23.100> think<00:04:23.280> they're<00:04:23.610> about<00:04:23.730> six<00:04:24.120> rahi<00:04:24.630> or

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
six I think they're about six rahi or

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.860 
six I think they're about six rahi or
five<00:04:26.100> on<00:04:26.430> this<00:04:26.790> picture<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.570> then<00:04:27.810> I

yeah on the back of the other
instruction<00:04:42.450> booklet<00:04:42.720> we<00:04:42.810> had<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.020> bunch<00:04:43.350> of

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
instruction booklet we had a bunch of

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.010 
instruction booklet we had a bunch of
the<00:04:43.590> masks<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:44.450> there's<00:04:45.450> something<00:04:45.870> really

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
the masks and there's something really

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.370 
the masks and there's something really
interesting<00:04:46.320> guys<00:04:47.810> so<00:04:48.810> basically<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.230> was<00:04:49.290> a

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
interesting guys so basically it was a

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.350 
interesting guys so basically it was a
checkoff<00:04:49.890> list<00:04:49.980> for<00:04:50.400> all<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.610> masks<00:04:51.090> right

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
checkoff list for all the masks right

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.590 
checkoff list for all the masks right
what's<00:04:52.050> that<00:04:52.170> at<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.620> bottom<00:04:53.330> look

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
what's that at the bottom look

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.650 
what's that at the bottom look
find<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.110> power<00:04:55.290> wait<00:04:55.920> a<00:04:55.950> minute<00:04:56.490> what<00:04:57.240> I

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
find the power wait a minute what I

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.470 
find the power wait a minute what I
don't<00:04:58.620> know<00:04:58.710> what<00:04:58.920> that<00:04:59.100> is<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.670> says<00:04:59.880> mystery

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
don't know what that is it says mystery

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.990 
don't know what that is it says mystery
number<00:05:01.350> it<00:05:01.740> looks<00:05:02.010> like<00:05:02.160> that<00:05:02.310> mask<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.730> time

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
number it looks like that mask of time

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.730 
number it looks like that mask of time
but<00:05:03.270> I<00:05:03.330> didn't<00:05:03.720> think<00:05:03.840> they<00:05:04.020> released<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:04.530> mask

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
but I didn't think they released a mask

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.700 
but I didn't think they released a mask
of<00:05:04.920> time<00:05:05.100> until<00:05:05.370> 2003<00:05:06.300> so<00:05:07.020> I<00:05:07.050> really<00:05:07.320> don't<00:05:07.500> get

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
of time until 2003 so I really don't get

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.350 
of time until 2003 so I really don't get
what's<00:05:07.950> going<00:05:08.070> on<00:05:08.460> here<00:05:08.820> if<00:05:08.940> you<00:05:08.970> know<00:05:09.210> what

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
what's going on here if you know what

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.660 
what's going on here if you know what

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
that is tell me or if there was like an

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.640 
that is tell me or if there was like an
old<00:05:11.940> version<00:05:12.300> of<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.600> mask<00:05:12.810> of<00:05:12.960> time<00:05:13.260> but<00:05:13.500> yeah

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
old version of the mask of time but yeah

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.290 
old version of the mask of time but yeah
look<00:05:13.920> at<00:05:14.040> that

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
look at that

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.820 
look at that
it<00:05:15.300> sure<00:05:15.660> looks<00:05:15.900> like<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.170> mask<00:05:16.350> of<00:05:16.500> time<00:05:16.710> but

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
it sure looks like the mask of time but

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.470 
it sure looks like the mask of time but
I<00:05:16.890> didn't<00:05:17.190> think<00:05:17.310> they<00:05:17.490> released<00:05:18.000> it<00:05:18.210> for<00:05:18.390> a

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
I didn't think they released it for a

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.390 
I didn't think they released it for a
while<00:05:18.920> interesting<00:05:19.940> weird<00:05:21.290> but<00:05:22.290> yeah<00:05:22.530> that's
