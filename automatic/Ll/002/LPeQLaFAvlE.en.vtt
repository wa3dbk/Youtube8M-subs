it also cleans up my now get criticized
geez<00:04:40.099> do<00:04:40.279> it<00:04:40.339> also<00:04:40.580> in<00:04:40.819> the<00:04:40.879> same<00:04:41.059> well<00:04:41.539> if<00:04:41.689> you

00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:41.779 
geez do it also in the same well if you

were<00:04:41.869> actually<00:04:42.020> here<00:04:42.259> playing<00:04:42.559> this<00:04:42.710> thing

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:43.089 
were actually here playing this thing

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:45.730

they<00:04:44.089> all<00:04:44.270> react<00:04:44.569> differently<00:04:44.659> so<00:04:45.199> this<00:04:45.589> one

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
they all react differently so this one

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
for power cords as well and that was a

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.590 
for power cords as well and that was a
little<00:05:10.400> bit<00:05:10.580> of<00:05:10.639> delay<00:05:10.760> on<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:11.030> Jubilee<00:05:11.389> and
