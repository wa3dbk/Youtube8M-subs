00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
two on the back which work in tandem to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.640 
two on the back which work in tandem to
take<00:00:15.949> three-dimensional<00:00:16.949> photographs<00:00:21.650> but

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
take three-dimensional photographs but

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.410 
take three-dimensional photographs but
in<00:00:22.769> my<00:00:22.920> recent<00:00:23.310> review<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.939> Nintendo<00:00:24.390> 3ds

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
in my recent review of the Nintendo 3ds

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.359 
in my recent review of the Nintendo 3ds
I<00:00:25.109> kind<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.350> glossed<00:00:25.470> over<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.890> cameras<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> bit

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
I kind of glossed over the cameras a bit

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.589 
I kind of glossed over the cameras a bit
I<00:00:26.400> merely<00:00:26.580> mentioned<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.150> they're<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> bit

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
I merely mentioned that they're a bit

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.990 
I merely mentioned that they're a bit
average<00:00:28.170> but<00:00:28.529> they<00:00:28.710> work<00:00:28.890> perfectly<00:00:29.490> well<00:00:29.730> for

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
average but they work perfectly well for

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.150 
average but they work perfectly well for
the<00:00:30.060> augmented<00:00:30.570> reality<00:00:30.599> gaming<00:00:31.380> which<00:00:32.009> is

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the augmented reality gaming which is

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.680 
the augmented reality gaming which is
the<00:00:32.279> main<00:00:32.399> reason<00:00:32.579> they<00:00:32.850> exist<00:00:32.969> there<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the main reason they exist there in the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.690 
the main reason they exist there in the
first<00:00:33.870> place<00:00:33.989> but<00:00:34.710> now<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.980> want<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.520> take<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
first place but now I want to take a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.069 
first place but now I want to take a
closer<00:00:36.000> look<00:00:36.149> at<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.600> photographic

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
closer look at the photographic

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.950 
closer look at the photographic
capabilities<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.430> 3d<00:00:39.030> S<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.570> find<00:00:39.780> out

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
capabilities of the 3d S and find out

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.700 
capabilities of the 3d S and find out
exactly<00:00:40.500> how<00:00:41.480> just<00:00:42.480> ordinary<00:00:43.050> these<00:00:43.320> cameras

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
exactly how just ordinary these cameras

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.770 
exactly how just ordinary these cameras
actually<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.309> specifically<00:00:45.149> compare<00:00:45.600> them

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
actually and specifically compare them

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.069 
actually and specifically compare them
to<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.230> camera<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.980> Nintendo<00:00:47.520> DS<00:00:47.789> AI<00:00:48.120> but

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
to the camera in the Nintendo DS AI but

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.990 
to the camera in the Nintendo DS AI but
just<00:00:49.410> before<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.739> get<00:00:49.950> rolling<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:50.940> I

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
just before we get rolling on this so I

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.639 
just before we get rolling on this so I
want<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> specifically<00:00:51.930> point<00:00:52.050> out<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.440> even

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
want to specifically point out that even

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.369 
want to specifically point out that even
though<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.010> 3ds<00:00:53.340> takes<00:00:53.730> 3d<00:00:54.660> photographs<00:00:55.230> I

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
though the 3ds takes 3d photographs I

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.049 
though the 3ds takes 3d photographs I
can't<00:00:55.559> actually<00:00:55.710> show<00:00:56.129> them<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.610> here

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
can't actually show them to you here

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.700 
can't actually show them to you here
well<00:00:57.629> not<00:00:57.960> easily<00:00:58.289> without<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> lot<00:00:58.649> of

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
well not easily without a lot of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.810 
well not easily without a lot of
screwing<00:00:59.039> around<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.489> having<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> go

screwing around and you having to go

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.310
