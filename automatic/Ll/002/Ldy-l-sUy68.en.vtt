00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 and then you guys not talking in this video 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.660
 talk about four and the halo players 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.950
 low that they end up hurting your 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.950
 evolution does not confer 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.840
 first of all I must warn you that this video 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.120
 was made from the article of the thigh and 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.860
 the strong will drop soon found well 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.180
 interesting and I decided to bring the 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.310
 so that our Brazilian scenario 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.870
 only fruit of this good content link of the 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.430
 article will be written in English 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.440
 for anyone who wants to take a look then 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.480
 Come on, everybody knows what to do. 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.710
 the tall one needs to take his level to the point 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.480
 to be better than others because 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.370
 many people do not even understand who 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.230
 already has a considerable level is what 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.629
 exactly child's 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.699
 ability among the best leagues 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.350
 after spending time playing 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.330
 at lower levels with your account 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.159
 sister to see clearly 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.559
 difference between the players he 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.260
 interacts in your main diamond account 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.460
 1 and the gold silver bronze players who 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.320
 He played on his mothers. 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.479
 from there he listed four errors 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.400
 common low interest rates first 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.260
 mistake are the items of build the wealth 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.030
 relative you can be the richest man 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.979
 of the world but if you spend all your 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.690
 trying to relive the successes of 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.430
 restart will come a moment when you 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.810
 we will not have any more to apply a 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.520
 Similar concept to uol 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.979
 no matter how well you 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.229
 first item to 1 30 with profane degree 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.880
 a boot boot and if for example well 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.369
 But you have to understand the concept 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.500
 more about itu 's choices than 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.450
 people buy same item every game 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.640
 they come good player with such item 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.530
 a champion and do this throughout the game 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.060
 looking for tea item 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.130
 even if another item that is a 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.869
 I better understand that the items in the 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.060
 build is not a static thing they 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.100
 must be adapted to each game purchase 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.780
 items that are suitable in addition to your 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.399
 personal objective such as whether 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.799
 you need the system far beyond 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.990
 today killed with speed notice that 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.969
 is sunk in the enemy the uncle his 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.380
 allies bought and so on 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.600
 making the most of their 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.789
 better your chances of items directly 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.340
 effective teaching in the game and consequently 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.320
 to win second-round in the selection of 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.390
 Champions are sure that everyone here 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.170
 you are already familiar with this media 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.670
 I will not give you 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.170
 I do not have nor trust to play 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.450
 support for this account 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.310
 My god, you bathed Catarina not now. 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.350
 other side these questions really only 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.360
 very frustrating but are a result of 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.580
 wonderful benefit of the lively together 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.500
 with the pinch of before however I 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.970
 I'm referring to it, it 's not atrocious, but it's all 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.040
 the notion that the game is won or 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.840
 lost by the selection of the champions 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.880
 we know that the selection of the champions is a 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.660
 undeniable strategic element that 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.920
 influence 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.690
 inside the game but it's not much 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.250
 important in the queue mainly 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.990
 in lower areas 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.820
 the experienced player behave with the 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.340
 weak champion is much better than 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.930
 inexperienced player with champion op 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.430
 I'm not saying that I choose just because 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.680
 not only a problem but it certainly 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.520
 I will not be a determining factor for 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.960
 to win a game 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.880
 likewise you should not choose a 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.800
 champion just because you saw it would be 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.780
 strong in my experience I could observe 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.850
 more games lost due to people 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.710
 catching champ sop and not knowing how to play 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.570
 with them than the games that were 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.700
 you win that champion is 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.410
 printed in my opinion there are three 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.420
 guidelines in choosing a champion 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.430
 choose what you are good choose what 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.650
 the team needs to choose what works 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.810
 well against the gaucho team or lack 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.910
 rhythm the first rule will always be 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.920
 most importantly it does not matter if it is a 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.510
 good choice for the team and 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.130
 when the opposing team if you do not 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.380
 know how to play you'll spill the type 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.630
 Third mistake is wrong to be 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.340
 practical and mechanical 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.020
 would say that a good number of people will be 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.400
 capable of increasing links and improving 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.840
 your personal mechanics 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.520
 if I had a real every time 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.200
 someone asked the boy alone already 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.450
 would be rich inter is enough money 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.180
 to buy today implement a system 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.430
 where if you can not form 70 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.500
 mines in ten minutes and a one game cost 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.330
 against boats and can not play rankings 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.550
 there is no reason for you to lose a burden 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.380
 alone to set the most effective way to 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.970
 You can be careful and that is 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.980
 something that really should not be 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.260
 set aside a good brand for you 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.420
 take as a reference only at least 70 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.100
 mines every 10 minutes this brand but is 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.540
 very hard to get just you 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.910
 practice a little in a game 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.980
 personalized between andrÃ© east hit you 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.750
 will notice that this works wonders beyond 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.400
 of lech the rite there are other 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.010
 mechanics that the crew gives 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.690
 mainly made the boy is one of them 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.549
 another moment that gave the vertix tends 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.919
 I made several other medicines for the pharmacy. 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.090
 errors purposely getting exposed 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.010
 online support 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.510
 Nobody touched me, the problem is that 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.040
 up and down players are 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.230
 accustomed to playing with other players 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.270
 low halo than non- euro punishment 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.310
 so I kept talking about the same 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.000
 God only when they play against players 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.800
 best 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.510
 they are punished you may ask 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.850
 how to learn from these mistakes without 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.950
 possible to be recognized the truth who 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.450
 difficult but not all of these mistakes are 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.760
 obstacles to be oil that you 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.800
 is the more you climb but these mistakes 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.249
 they will be punished with this will achieve 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.959
 improve 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:52.059
 The game is why it rises from it if 

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:54.069
 become a good player is all about me 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:55.689
 particularly still have a lot of 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.829
 thing to learn to understand against 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:59.289
 Jews in the same move 

00:04:56.829 --> 00:05:01.269
 another good method is to watch 30 and do 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.249
 a parallel between what you would do and what 

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:04.689
 the extreme has often done these 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.369
 differences are a point for you 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:07.119
 have to put themselves in the shoes of 

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:08.469
 one player 

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:10.749
 try to imagine what you miss a 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:12.699
 place, see how it differs from what 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:14.559
 it does finally positioning 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.749
 halo players download df is usually 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:18.579
 very bad they often can not 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:20.769
 identify the threat before it 

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:23.259
 is in front of you that makes the defendants 

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:24.939
 extremely spaces for the code is not 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.129
 difficult to hear players saying no 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:29.559
 I can do nothing but explode because 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:31.269
 it's half a truth she'll blow up yes 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:32.199
 but you have to avoid there if you play 

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:33.969
 correctly 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.069
 the last error is the difficulty of 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.869
 finalize the game matches will be higher 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.819
 are much shorter playing than being 

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:41.529
 the reason for this is because 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:44.049
 when you have an advantage with israel 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:46.239
 good to push as hard as I could 

00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:48.399
 you lose while the lower and 

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:50.289
 says that confirming forming even 

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:51.819
 having the advantage and they give space to 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.739
 the team that is losing against the 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.169
 window of opportunity to return to 

00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:58.149
 the game they can not goals does not give 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.739
 and fernanda lei does not try to mess with 

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.360
 An enemy I solve this by giving 

00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:02.979
 instructions to my allies about what 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.779
 do because I remember that you are 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.239
 winning many times he will be lonely 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:09.429
 for arming instead of pressing milene 

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:11.769
 I'll take the tower, for example, a game. 

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:13.449
 who only fame instead force goose and try 

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:15.129
 open a space for the dragon here goes 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.139
 another tip for you to close the game 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:19.059
 purchase in pink and lens to take the 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.339
 enemy vision in vision an enemy to 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:23.949
 playing more passive will not have time to 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:26.019
 challenge goals like the dragon baron 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:28.389
 and towers always denied waiting for his team 

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:30.519
 to go after answering 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:32.379
 has vision and will have the power is this personal 

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:34.059
 I'll stay here with another bis I hope 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.529
 you have enjoyed seized and 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:38.289
 Did you not forget to chat online? 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:40.559
 enroll in the channel failed until the next 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.559
 went
