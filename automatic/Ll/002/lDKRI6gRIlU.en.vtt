00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
their brake fluid and they can't

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.890 
their brake fluid and they can't
actually<00:00:29.950> find<00:00:30.340> the<00:00:30.520> reservoir<00:00:31.029> that's

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
actually find the reservoir that's

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.450 
actually find the reservoir that's
because<00:00:32.259> it's<00:00:32.410> under<00:00:32.680> the<00:00:32.829> micro<00:00:33.130> filter

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
because it's under the micro filter

want<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.299> get<00:02:54.389> a<00:02:54.450> close-up<00:02:54.749> shot<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.439> this

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
want to get a close-up shot of this

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.500 
want to get a close-up shot of this
piece<00:02:56.010> right<00:02:56.249> over<00:02:56.310> here<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:56.939> rubber<00:02:57.209> piece

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
piece right over here this rubber piece

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.699 
piece right over here this rubber piece
because<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:57.930> can<00:02:58.139> get<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.290> little<00:02:58.409> bit

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
because this can get a little bit

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.649 
because this can get a little bit
confusing<00:02:59.189> I<00:02:59.430> think<00:02:59.459> when<00:03:00.329> you<00:03:00.450> go<00:03:00.599> to

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
confusing I think when you go to

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.929 
confusing I think when you go to
reinstall<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.319> see<00:03:02.099> how<00:03:02.189> it<00:03:02.400> sits<00:03:02.639> right<00:03:02.879> here

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
reinstall it see how it sits right here

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.959 
reinstall it see how it sits right here
it's<00:03:03.870> like<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.079> drip<00:03:04.439> channel<00:03:04.889> it<00:03:05.400> sits<00:03:05.760> right

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
it's like a drip channel it sits right

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.179 
it's like a drip channel it sits right
back<00:03:06.209> here<00:03:06.569> as<00:03:06.689> well<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.739> is<00:03:07.799> where<00:03:08.099> it

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
back here as well this is where it

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.580 
back here as well this is where it
pushes<00:03:08.579> down<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.180> then<00:03:10.139> you<00:03:10.290> have<00:03:10.319> this

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
pushes down and then you have this

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.849 
pushes down and then you have this
harness<00:03:11.359> that<00:03:12.359> kind<00:03:12.689> of<00:03:12.810> rests<00:03:13.109> right<00:03:13.260> here<00:03:13.590> so

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
harness that kind of rests right here so

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.500 
harness that kind of rests right here so
actually<00:03:14.099> you<00:03:14.459> can<00:03:14.489> just<00:03:14.819> take<00:03:15.030> this<00:03:15.209> right

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
actually you can just take this right

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.050 
actually you can just take this right
out<00:03:15.719> it<00:03:16.290> lifts<00:03:16.590> right<00:03:16.739> up<00:03:16.799> like<00:03:17.129> this<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:20.519> that

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
out it lifts right up like this and that

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.800 
out it lifts right up like this and that
that's<00:03:21.389> like<00:03:21.569> exactly<00:03:21.840> how<00:03:22.349> it<00:03:22.650> sits<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:23.810> I'm

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
that's like exactly how it sits so I'm

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.149 
that's like exactly how it sits so I'm
just<00:03:25.019> going<00:03:25.169> to<00:03:25.199> take<00:03:25.409> this<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.769> move<00:03:25.949> it<00:03:26.069> out

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
just going to take this to move it out

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.709 
just going to take this to move it out
of<00:03:26.219> the<00:03:26.340> way<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.730> lot<00:03:26.849> of<00:03:26.939> times<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.359> leave<00:03:27.569> it

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:27.719 
of the way a lot of times you leave it

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:29.750 
of the way a lot of times you leave it
in<00:03:27.870> it'll<00:03:28.500> kind<00:03:28.739> of<00:03:28.829> get<00:03:28.980> caught<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.400> jammed

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
in it'll kind of get caught and jammed

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.909 
in it'll kind of get caught and jammed
and<00:03:29.969> it<00:03:30.569> can<00:03:30.719> be<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.870> little<00:03:31.139> confusing<00:03:31.590> how<00:03:31.799> it

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
and it can be a little confusing how it

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:35.209 
and it can be a little confusing how it
goes<00:03:32.129> in<00:03:32.400> so<00:03:33.180> once<00:03:33.750> again<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.260> just<00:03:34.469> fits<00:03:35.040> on

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:35.219 
goes in so once again that just fits on

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.970 
goes in so once again that just fits on
over<00:03:35.699> just<00:03:35.939> like<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.329> and<00:03:37.319> it<00:03:37.500> is<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> drip

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
over just like this and it is a drip

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.179 
over just like this and it is a drip
channel<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.549> you<00:03:39.000> can<00:03:39.180> see<00:03:39.419> the<00:03:39.599> little<00:03:40.189> stop

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
channel and you can see the little stop

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.009 
channel and you can see the little stop
right<00:03:41.219> here<00:03:41.639> for<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.000> hood<00:03:42.209> it's<00:03:42.659> going<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.900> go

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
right here for the hood it's going to go

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.830 
right here for the hood it's going to go
underneath<00:03:43.469> that<00:03:43.889> and<00:03:44.159> then<00:03:44.969> press<00:03:45.509> right

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
underneath that and then press right

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.309 
underneath that and then press right
down<00:03:46.079> into<00:03:46.379> place<00:03:47.750> let<00:03:48.750> me<00:03:48.870> take<00:03:49.079> that<00:03:49.109> back

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
down into place let me take that back

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:56.569 
down into place let me take that back
out<00:03:51.590> that<00:03:52.590> aside<00:03:54.709> now<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:55.739> can<00:03:56.069> go<00:03:56.220> ahead<00:03:56.250> and

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
out that aside now I can go ahead and

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.729 
out that aside now I can go ahead and
lift<00:03:56.759> this<00:03:57.829> out<00:03:58.829> just<00:03:59.310> like<00:03:59.459> this<00:03:59.729> and<00:04:00.659> off<00:04:01.409> to

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
lift this out just like this and off to

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.339 
lift this out just like this and off to
the<00:04:01.889> side<00:04:02.159> this<00:04:02.669> is<00:04:02.879> actually<00:04:03.329> another<00:04:03.930> little

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
the side this is actually another little

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.140 
the side this is actually another little
water<00:04:04.560> channel<00:04:05.040> right<00:04:05.220> here<00:04:05.489> where<00:04:05.699> water<00:04:05.909> can

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
water channel right here where water can

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.330 
water channel right here where water can
go<00:04:06.329> out<00:04:06.509> through<00:04:06.810> an<00:04:06.930> opening<00:04:07.349> in<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:08.099> body

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
go out through an opening in the body

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.179 
go out through an opening in the body
and<00:04:08.579> then<00:04:08.729> drip<00:04:08.970> down<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.629> that<00:04:10.379> has<00:04:10.680> this

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
and then drip down and that has this

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.830 
and then drip down and that has this
piece<00:04:11.459> right<00:04:11.699> here<00:04:11.759> which<00:04:12.090> fits<00:04:12.419> into<00:04:12.750> the

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
piece right here which fits into the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.979 
piece right here which fits into the
hole<00:04:13.079> right<00:04:13.979> in<00:04:14.129> the<00:04:14.250> body

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.670 

and<00:04:18.030> that's<00:04:19.030> how<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.269> access<00:04:19.600> your<00:04:20.169> brake

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
and that's how you access your brake

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.719 
and that's how you access your brake
fluid<00:04:20.709> reservoir<00:04:21.509> which<00:04:22.509> is<00:04:22.539> right<00:04:22.900> here<00:04:26.729> so

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
fluid reservoir which is right here so

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.520 
fluid reservoir which is right here so
also<00:04:28.030> where<00:04:28.180> your<00:04:28.330> brake<00:04:28.569> booster<00:04:28.780> is<00:04:29.110> located

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
also where your brake booster is located

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.320 
also where your brake booster is located
there's<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.919> hole<00:04:33.400> right<00:04:33.639> there<00:04:33.699> for<00:04:34.180> that

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
there's that hole right there for that

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.610 
there's that hole right there for that
water<00:04:34.569> Channel

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.000 

so<00:04:42.220> it<00:04:42.370> does<00:04:42.550> take<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:43.780> know<00:04:43.900> it's<00:04:44.650> pretty
