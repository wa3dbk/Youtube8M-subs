tumbles and rolls that hay so the core

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.940 
tumbles and rolls that hay so the core
is<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:35.729> compressed<00:01:36.060> tight<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.320> air<00:01:37.680> can

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
is not compressed tight so that air can

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.460 
is not compressed tight so that air can
go<00:01:38.130> through<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.390> compresses<00:01:39.780> towards

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
go through it but it compresses towards

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.340 
go through it but it compresses towards
the<00:01:40.650> outside<00:01:41.780> when<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:42.930> ready<00:01:45.020> here<00:01:46.020> which

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the outside when it's ready here which

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.170 
the outside when it's ready here which
is<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.710> top<00:01:46.950> rollers<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.790> will<00:01:47.909> begin<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
is one of top rollers it will begin to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.260 
is one of top rollers it will begin to
spin<00:01:48.600> at<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.229> consistent<00:01:49.680> rate<00:01:49.950> at<00:01:50.880> which<00:01:50.909> time

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
spin at a consistent rate at which time

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.109 
spin at a consistent rate at which time
we'll<00:01:51.450> stop<00:01:51.890> we'll<00:01:52.890> engage<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.579> netting<00:01:53.939> and

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
we'll stop we'll engage the netting and

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.770 
we'll stop we'll engage the netting and
it<00:01:54.930> will<00:01:55.110> wrap<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.590> Bale<00:01:56.240> three<00:01:57.240> rounds<00:01:57.630> of

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
it will wrap the Bale three rounds of

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.830 
it will wrap the Bale three rounds of
netting<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:59.579> it<00:02:00.000> will<00:02:00.149> discharge<00:02:00.329> out

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
netting and then it will discharge out

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.010 
netting and then it will discharge out
the<00:02:00.960> side<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:02.070> we'll<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.880> baler<00:02:03.450> fired<00:02:03.750> up

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the side so we'll get the baler fired up

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.740 
the side so we'll get the baler fired up
and<00:02:04.200> give<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> demonstration
