anyway<00:01:29.700> yeah<00:01:30.420> let's<00:01:30.600> carry<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.810> sort<00:01:31.049> of

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
anyway yeah let's carry on sort of

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.289 
anyway yeah let's carry on sort of
opening<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.530> books<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.150> see

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
opening up the books so as you can see

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.149 
opening up the books so as you can see
it's<00:01:33.540> comparing<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:33.960> my<00:01:34.170> xbox<00:01:35.130> one

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it's comparing it with my xbox one

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.249 
it's comparing it with my xbox one
controller<00:01:35.369> there<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.540> respawn<00:01:36.869> logo<00:01:37.140> with

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
controller there the respawn logo with

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.990 
controller there the respawn logo with
those<00:01:37.350> dots<00:01:37.590> they're<00:01:37.799> obviously<00:01:38.310> row<00:01:38.430> tests

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
those dots they're obviously row tests

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.609 
those dots they're obviously row tests
around<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.570> didn't<00:01:40.020> think<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.290> alphabet

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
around I didn't think of this alphabet

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.350 
around I didn't think of this alphabet
first<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.189> then<00:01:41.310> I'm<00:01:41.430> actually<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.060> turns<00:01:42.240> out

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
first but then I'm actually it turns out

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.749 
first but then I'm actually it turns out
it<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:43.079> respawn<00:01:43.500> logo<00:01:43.770> rotating

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
it is just a respawn logo rotating

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.580 
it is just a respawn logo rotating
around<00:01:44.850> anyway<00:01:45.420> yeah<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.200> made<00:01:46.350> by<00:01:46.409> Mad

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
around anyway yeah this is made by Mad

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.950 
around anyway yeah this is made by Mad
Catz<00:01:46.799> as<00:01:46.950> well<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:48.180> haven't<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:48.780> kind<00:01:48.930> of

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
Catz as well so I haven't really kind of

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.230 
Catz as well so I haven't really kind of
had<00:01:49.470> much<00:01:49.619> experience<00:01:49.860> with<00:01:50.070> their<00:01:50.399> PC<00:01:51.030> tech

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
had much experience with their PC tech

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.969 
had much experience with their PC tech
before<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.229> know<00:01:52.320> there<00:01:52.530> are<00:01:52.680> arcade

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
before but you know there are arcade

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.710 
before but you know there are arcade
sticks<00:01:53.220> are<00:01:53.280> pretty<00:01:53.430> good<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> imagine<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
sticks are pretty good so I imagine the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.760 
sticks are pretty good so I imagine the
build<00:01:54.869> quality<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.560> be<00:01:55.619> pretty

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
build quality of this can be pretty

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.380 
build quality of this can be pretty
solid<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
solid so there you have it that is the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.030 
solid so there you have it that is the
mouse<00:01:57.630> itself<00:01:57.990> now<00:01:58.469> it's<00:01:58.649> got<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.829> kind<00:01:59.009> of

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
mouse itself now it's got this kind of

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.319 
mouse itself now it's got this kind of
cool<00:01:59.250> open<00:02:00.000> panel

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
cool open panel

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.719 
cool open panel
almost<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.049> if<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.229> play<00:02:01.350> titanfall<00:02:01.729> and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
almost like if you play titanfall and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.830 
almost like if you play titanfall and
you<00:02:02.790> know<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.210> jump<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.540> rodeo

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
you know that you can jump and rodeo

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
you know that you can jump and rodeo
Titans<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.740> rip<00:02:04.860> open<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.159> brain<00:02:05.310> casing<00:02:05.670> I

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
Titans and rip open the brain casing I

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.010 
Titans and rip open the brain casing I
quite<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.240> how<00:02:06.390> there's<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.659> opening<00:02:06.930> of

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
quite like how there's the opening of

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.169 
quite like how there's the opening of
the<00:02:07.079> side<00:02:07.229> with<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.439> wire<00:02:07.940> because<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.060> makes

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the side with the wire because it makes

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.249 
the side with the wire because it makes
me<00:02:09.270> think<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.690> know<00:02:09.780> someone's<00:02:10.080> jumped

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
me think that you know someone's jumped

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.540 
me think that you know someone's jumped
in<00:02:10.349> your<00:02:10.440> mouth<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.770> rodeo<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.370> ripped

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
in your mouth to rodeo it and ripped

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.040 
in your mouth to rodeo it and ripped
open<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.849> casing<00:02:12.030> started<00:02:12.720> shooting<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
open the casing started shooting in the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.900 
open the casing started shooting in the
brain<00:02:13.230> but

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
brain but

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.140 
brain but
yeah<00:02:14.330> anyway<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.100> is<00:02:16.310> pretty<00:02:16.880> much<00:02:16.970> all

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
yeah anyway so that is pretty much all

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.550 
yeah anyway so that is pretty much all
this<00:02:17.270> inside<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.570> box<00:02:17.600> you<00:02:17.930> got<00:02:18.020> there<00:02:18.230> now

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
this inside the box you got there now

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.960 
this inside the box you got there now
you<00:02:18.650> got<00:02:18.740> your<00:02:18.830> instruction<00:02:19.250> manual<00:02:19.280> but<00:02:19.790> this

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
you got your instruction manual but this

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.750 
you got your instruction manual but this
is<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.390> mouse<00:02:20.570> itself<00:02:21.370> it's<00:02:22.370> got<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.520> pretty

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
use you can program the buttons to do

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.130 
use you can program the buttons to do
what<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:35.780> want

see<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.760> kind<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:37.970> silver<00:02:38.210> ones<00:02:38.360> they<00:02:38.990> are

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
see the kind of silver ones they are

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.450 
see the kind of silver ones they are
just<00:02:39.410> off<00:02:39.500> back<00:02:39.740> and<00:02:39.890> forward<00:02:40.160> in<00:02:40.280> web

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
just off back and forward in web

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.920 
just off back and forward in web
browsers<00:02:40.850> but<00:02:41.000> obviously<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:41.420> can<00:02:41.600> program

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
browsers but obviously you can program

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.360 
browsers but obviously you can program
this<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.110> do<00:02:42.200> whatever<00:02:42.380> you<00:02:42.530> want<00:02:42.740> and<00:02:43.100> on<00:02:43.280> the

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
top there is a little kind of madness

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.070 
top there is a little kind of madness
button<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:47.120> basically<00:02:47.690> lets<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:47.990> have

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
button and that basically lets you have

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.080 
button and that basically lets you have
different<00:02:48.320> profiles<00:02:48.680> there<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.070> red<00:02:49.340> blue<00:02:50.060> and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
different profiles there is red blue and
