00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.130
 hair 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.679
 about which there were many questions 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.730
 because I can mentioned in one of 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.560
 my videos and I would like to tell 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.600
 just because it's a real matzah miracle 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.630
 why have you not tried 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.580
 and coconut and almond to moisten 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:34.340
 and for growth it is the best butter it 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.340
 golden silk butter 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.660
 Yes 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:51.000
 golden silk hair growth oil 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.000
 it's just a miracle oil 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.730
 it's just a miracle of oil because on 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.710
 in fact , if you apply it regularly 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.040
 two or three times a week you are for 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.369
 you just literally notice the growth and how 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.780
 I already said and when I do my hair 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.060
 I just see that I have this 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.060
 little hat can say hair 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:18.580
 new ones that are like head overhead 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:21.330
 constantly and it activates hair growth 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.539
 revives sleeping roots in life and 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.819
 prevents lunges lunge day i 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.990
 hair loss to strengthen the roots from 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:32.399
 hair loss 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.140
 I read and here is a very good composition 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.530
 Tsoi composition includes soybean oil 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.759
 castor oil burdock vitamin 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:46.939
 and vitamin e or or 0 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:49.549
 linolenic acid vitamin f extracts 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.939
 Aloe Rose Hip and Polymer Composite 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:57.439
 quite natural and in fact 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.869
 he can see the effect from here 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.899
 videos may notice that I have hair 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.209
 It is still that I trim them 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.720
 once every two or three months exactly tips 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:10.519
 a little bit you 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.129
 to investigate though a number of what 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.549
 it's a myth but i don't know prune so as not to 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:20.180
 there were also split ends here too 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:23.120
 on camera will it be visible to me noticeably 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.579
 as I had dyed hair was not 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.950
 very dark hair color black 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:31.280
 him somewhere now they have grown back 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.750
 I guess I donâ€™t dye black 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.549
 six months probably that's how i do it 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.629
 oil this mass would give to do two or three 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:44.780
 Once a week I expose for two hours 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:48.560
 literally three o'clock and go hats 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.870
 first i put the oil on 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.049
 comb I do do before parting 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.989
 naturally and share parting and 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.790
 wear a shower cap then wrapped 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.799
 and all 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.769
 a handkerchief then there is always a mass 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.599
 recommends using as if with hot 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.329
 towels upstairs and children hot 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.340
 towel eat i don't do it i just 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:16.400
 wear a towel or some 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:20.989
 such a package flew on the branches and I go 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.919
 around the house not really everyone is talking about 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.569
 oh my god these hair grow so fast and 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:29.190
 there are so many different series there for 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.500
 hair reinforcement is against hair loss 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.190
 there is there a heightened growth I'm very 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.710
 recommend 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.500
 and also this company has a mask which 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.590
 Unfortunately, no, but after the effect 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.130
 as if you are done lamination 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.800
 hair 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.130
 except it is very easy to comb 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.550
 the hair is very, very straight and shiny 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:54.270
 very very beautiful 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:56.310
 the only thing that is a pity that these 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.730
 there is no mask because then the natural 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.850
 see the effect you can also add 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.250
 oil and in shampoo and that will find the mummy 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.580
 i'm not here yet i can tell you but 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.990
 that's how I'll try and tell you about 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:15.120
 This, too, can be said I hope that you 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.260
 This review was helpful because 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.540
 in fact it is just a miracle miracle oil 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.820
 can be said because hair and 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.580
 getting stronger gets bigger 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.930
 I'm not longer enough for me yet 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.630
 male long hair 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.000
 I have become their example many but not 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:39.150
 very very thin so it seems that 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.500
 so here so thank you all for watching 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.360
