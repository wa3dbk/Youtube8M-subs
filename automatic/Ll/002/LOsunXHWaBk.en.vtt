roads perfect for these to test for
drifting<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.070> handling<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.119> dune

buggy<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.840> track<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.680> know<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.920> car

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
buggy on this track you know this car

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.170 
buggy on this track you know this car
isn't<00:00:26.250> particularly<00:00:26.550> great<00:00:26.730> for<00:00:26.820> drifting

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
isn't particularly great for drifting

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.670 
isn't particularly great for drifting
wasn't<00:00:27.449> really<00:00:27.599> made<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:27.990> drifting<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.560> this

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
wasn't really made for drifting and this

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.259 
wasn't really made for drifting and this
sticks<00:00:29.130> firmly<00:00:29.369> onto<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> ground

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
sticks firmly onto the ground

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.420 
sticks firmly onto the ground
therefore<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.529> pretty<00:00:31.710> much<00:00:31.800> don't<00:00:32.160> get<00:00:32.309> any

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
therefore you pretty much don't get any

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.040 
therefore you pretty much don't get any
drifting<00:00:32.759> at<00:00:32.850> all<00:00:33.059> if<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.329> unless<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.780> put<00:00:33.930> in

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
drifting at all if you unless you put in

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.080 
drifting at all if you unless you put in
like<00:00:34.230> 98<00:00:34.649> percent<00:00:34.680> effort<00:00:35.340> into<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:35.910> I

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
like 98 percent effort into that but I

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.700 
like 98 percent effort into that but I
will<00:00:36.480> be<00:00:36.570> strong<00:00:36.809> about<00:00:36.930> comparing<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
will be strong about comparing it to the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.840 
will be strong about comparing it to the
Biff<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.250> Biff<00:00:38.399> days<00:00:38.610> pretty<00:00:38.790> much

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
Biff that the Biff days pretty much

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.450 
Biff that the Biff days pretty much
eased<00:00:39.360> drift<00:00:39.899> with<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.680> very<00:00:40.829> loose<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
eased drift with it's very loose and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.400 
eased drift with it's very loose and
pretty<00:00:41.820> much<00:00:41.879> spins<00:00:42.149> about<00:00:42.270> high<00:00:42.750> speed<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.290> be

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
pretty much spins about high speed so be

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.049 
pretty much spins about high speed so be
careful<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.860> may<00:00:44.640> get<00:00:44.879> bit

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
careful of that may get bit

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.700 
careful of that may get bit
uncomfortable<00:00:45.360> high<00:00:45.989> speeds<00:00:46.289> around<00:00:46.379> sharp

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
uncomfortable high speeds around sharp

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.500 
uncomfortable high speeds around sharp
corner<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.520> you're<00:00:47.640> definitely<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:48.180> drifting

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
corner so you're definitely for drifting

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.090 
corner so you're definitely for drifting
it<00:00:48.629> deserves<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.960> point<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:49.559> handling<00:00:49.829> I

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
it deserves the point but for handling I

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.189 
it deserves the point but for handling I
definitely<00:00:50.760> say<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> dune<00:00:51.360> buggy<00:00:51.539> for

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
definitely say the dune buggy for

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.540 
definitely say the dune buggy for
handling<00:00:52.469> because<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.920> sticks<00:00:53.160> firmly<00:00:53.370> onto

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
handling because it sticks firmly onto

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.319 
handling because it sticks firmly onto
the<00:00:53.670> ground<00:00:53.820> as<00:00:53.910> we've<00:00:54.059> already<00:00:54.180> mentioned

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the ground as we've already mentioned

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.119 
the ground as we've already mentioned
there<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.199> high<00:00:55.350> speeds<00:00:55.649> around<00:00:55.920> sharp

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
there for high speeds around sharp

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.369 
there for high speeds around sharp
corners<00:00:56.489> definitely<00:00:57.270> uh<00:00:57.300> easy<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.020> maneuver

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
corners definitely uh easy to maneuver

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.930 
corners definitely uh easy to maneuver
with<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.980> car<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.579> vehicle

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
with the this car or this vehicle

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.099 
with the this car or this vehicle
instead<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> Biff<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.780> Biff<00:01:00.930> that

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
instead of the Biff that the Biff that

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.670 
instead of the Biff that the Biff that
high<00:01:01.260> speeds

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
high speeds

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.319 
high speeds
most<00:01:02.190> likely<00:01:02.340> will<00:01:02.550> lose<00:01:02.670> control<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.120> spin

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
most likely will lose control and spin

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.240 
most likely will lose control and spin
off<00:01:03.420> track<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.559> pretty<00:01:04.769> difficult<00:01:04.920> in

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
off track so it is pretty difficult in

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.859 
off track so it is pretty difficult in
that<00:01:05.309> sense<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> handling<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.810> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
that sense so the handling is a

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.899 
that sense so the handling is a
particularly<00:01:07.140> great<00:01:07.409> when<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.280> necessary

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
particularly great when it's necessary

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
particularly great when it's necessary
to<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.750> sharp<00:01:09.960> corners<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:11.010> know<00:01:11.130> if

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
to be in a sharp corners but you know if

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.380 
to be in a sharp corners but you know if
you<00:01:11.369> have<00:01:11.490> good<00:01:11.610> driving<00:01:11.939> score<00:01:12.090> what<00:01:12.210> not

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
you have good driving score what not

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.760 
you have good driving score what not
that<00:01:12.570> could<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.720> not<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.290> could<00:01:13.439> not<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that could be not that could not be the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.380 
that could be not that could not be the
case<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.189> know<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.150> general

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
case but you know just for general

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.130 
general concept of handling definitely
the<00:01:17.820> Judy<00:01:18.000> buggy<00:01:18.210> deserves<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.600> point<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:19.080> as

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the Judy buggy deserves a point there as

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.840 
the Judy buggy deserves a point there as
you<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.799> see<00:01:19.979> perfect<00:01:20.400> example<00:01:20.759> here

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
you can see perfect example here

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.789 
you can see perfect example here
spinning<00:01:21.119> off<00:01:21.299> whenever<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.259> don't<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.590> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
spinning off whenever you don't want to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.950 
spinning off whenever you don't want to
and<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.189> would<00:01:23.460> happen<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.970> shooting<00:01:24.810> buggy

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and that would happen to shooting buggy

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.600 
and that would happen to shooting buggy
but<00:01:25.140> anyway<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.590> sort<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.860> shotgun<00:01:26.070> test

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.340 
but anyway for the sort of shotgun test
generality<00:01:27.330> test<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.810> got<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> Biff<00:01:28.170> done

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
generality test we got the Biff done

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.350 
generality test we got the Biff done
with<00:01:28.439> three<00:01:28.650> shots<00:01:28.950> at<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.729> same<00:01:29.850> time<00:01:30.180> we've

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
with three shots at the same time we've

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.670 
with three shots at the same time we've
got<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> June<00:01:30.810> buggy<00:01:31.079> with<00:01:31.170> three<00:01:31.320> shots<00:01:31.560> as

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
got the June buggy with three shots as

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.740 
got the June buggy with three shots as
well<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.070> both<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.640> these<00:01:32.850> would<00:01:33.030> equal<00:01:33.390> damage

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
well so both of these would equal damage

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.200 
well so both of these would equal damage
a<00:01:34.189> durability<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.850> head-on<00:01:36.030> collision

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
a durability so if a head-on collision

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.319 
a durability so if a head-on collision
damage<00:01:36.570> turns<00:01:37.290> out<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.150> because<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
damage turns out that the because of the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.390 
damage turns out that the because of the
oval<00:01:39.479> design<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.960> buggy<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.920> Biff<00:01:41.189> that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
oval design with the buggy the Biff that

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.710 
oval design with the buggy the Biff that
took<00:01:41.520> more<00:01:41.670> damage<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.150> buggy<00:01:42.299> took<00:01:42.540> a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
took more damage to the buggy took a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.060 
took more damage to the buggy took a
point<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.320> commonly<00:01:43.560> three<00:01:43.799> two

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
point there so it's commonly three two

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.580 
point there so it's commonly three two
seems<00:01:44.939> interesting<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.470> best

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
seems interesting but for the best

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.080 
seems interesting but for the best
customization<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.189> course<00:01:47.460> hand-start<00:01:47.820> gotta

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
customization of course hand-start gotta

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.550 
customization of course hand-start gotta
be<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> Biff<00:01:48.750> door<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.229> literally

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
be for the Biff door because literally

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.929 
be for the Biff door because literally
the<00:01:49.740> buggy<00:01:49.920> has<00:01:50.070> no<00:01:50.280> customization

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
the buggy has no customization

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.319 
the buggy has no customization
whatsoever<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.610> Biff<00:01:53.939> does<00:01:54.149> go

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
whatsoever so you know the Biff does go

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.080 
whatsoever so you know the Biff does go
sorts<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.750> customization<00:01:55.409> options<00:01:56.090> freaking

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
sorts of customization options freaking

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.959 
sorts of customization options freaking
herd<00:01:58.020> changes<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.770> also<00:01:58.890> spoilers<00:01:59.640> whatever

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
herd changes and also spoilers whatever

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.219 
herd changes and also spoilers whatever
but<00:02:00.119> obviously<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.719> can<00:02:00.810> see<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.079> Jim

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
but obviously as you can see for the Jim

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.020 
but obviously as you can see for the Jim
buggy<00:02:01.560> nothing<00:02:02.159> there<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.490> for<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> fastest

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
buggy nothing there but for the fastest

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.940 
buggy nothing there but for the fastest
car<00:02:03.210> seemed<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> screen<00:02:04.770> right<00:02:04.890> now

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
car seemed like on the screen right now

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.459 
car seemed like on the screen right now
the<00:02:05.159> acceleration<00:02:05.670> was<00:02:06.090> better<00:02:06.479> for<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.079> chin

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
the acceleration was better for the chin

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.809 
the acceleration was better for the chin
buggy<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:07.920> was<00:02:08.039> not<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.220> cases<00:02:08.580> again

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
buggy but that was not the cases again

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.089 
buggy but that was not the cases again
as<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.420> said<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.810> many<00:02:09.869> times<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.349> also<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
as I said that many times is also the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.020 
as I said that many times is also the
lag<00:02:11.310> within<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> lobby

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
lag within the lobby

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.230 
lag within the lobby
so<00:02:13.330> both<00:02:14.290> these<00:02:14.470> cars<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:14.980> know<00:02:15.150> forces<00:02:16.150> each

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
so both these cars you know forces each

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.000 
so both these cars you know forces each
other<00:02:16.420> by<00:02:16.540> acceleration<00:02:16.960> however<00:02:17.410> for<00:02:17.710> top

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
other by acceleration however for top

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.440 
other by acceleration however for top
speed<00:02:18.250> definitely<00:02:18.670> for<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.850> Biff<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.240> takes

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
speed definitely for the Biff that takes

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.540 
speed definitely for the Biff that takes
off<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.840> pretty<00:02:20.050> much<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.770> Jew<00:02:20.980> buggy<00:02:21.250> cannot

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
off and pretty much the Jew buggy cannot

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.000 
off and pretty much the Jew buggy cannot
catch<00:02:21.760> up<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:22.270> top<00:02:22.960> speed<00:02:23.200> definitely<00:02:23.680> for<00:02:23.920> the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
catch up so top speed definitely for the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.860 
catch up so top speed definitely for the
Biff<00:02:24.160> de<00:02:24.370> against<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> junebug<00:02:25.510> as<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.750> can

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
Biff de against the junebug as you can

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.930 
Biff de against the junebug as you can
see<00:02:26.020> here<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.740> Biff<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.130> is<00:02:27.250> just<00:02:27.460> going<00:02:27.790> off

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
see here the Biff that is just going off

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.400 
see here the Biff that is just going off
it's<00:02:28.240> just<00:02:28.360> going<00:02:28.510> off<00:02:28.660> in<00:02:28.780> another<00:02:28.930> level<00:02:29.230> but

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
it's just going off in another level but

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.320 
it's just going off in another level but
yeah<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.730> but<00:02:30.970> for<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.150> fourth

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
yeah that is that but for the fourth

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.840 
yeah that is that but for the fourth
gear<00:02:31.540> acceleration<00:02:32.170> test<00:02:32.430> turns<00:02:33.430> out<00:02:33.640> that

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
gear acceleration test turns out that

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.320 
gear acceleration test turns out that
the<00:02:34.230> dune<00:02:35.230> buggy<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.770> think<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.670> took<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.850> Barna

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
the dune buggy I think it took a Barna

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.760 
the dune buggy I think it took a Barna
see<00:02:37.420> how<00:02:37.480> much<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.630> tooth<00:02:37.990> how<00:02:38.230> long<00:02:38.350> it<00:02:38.440> took<00:02:38.560> it

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
see how much a tooth how long it took it

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.920 
see how much a tooth how long it took it
took<00:02:39.040> eight<00:02:39.370> or<00:02:39.670> eight<00:02:40.270> point<00:02:40.540> two<00:02:40.630> five

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
took eight or eight point two five

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.390 
took eight or eight point two five
seconds<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.530> up<00:02:41.620> eight<00:02:41.800> point<00:02:42.040> two<00:02:42.130> five

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
seconds the up eight point two five

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.840 
seconds the up eight point two five
second<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.000> for<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.480> Biff<00:02:43.630> tur<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.489> or

second and for the Biff tur this is a or

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.460 
second and for the Biff tur this is a or
from<00:02:46.330> my<00:02:46.450> point<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.810> view<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:47.110> if<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.260> saw<00:02:47.410> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
from my point of view so if you saw the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.830 
from my point of view so if you saw the
top<00:02:48.220> speed<00:02:48.489> test<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:49.030> was<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.180> case<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.510> this

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
top speed test it was a case of this

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.479 
top speed test it was a case of this
right<00:02:50.050> because<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.680> Biff<00:02:50.800> that<00:02:50.980> was<00:02:51.100> slow<00:02:51.250> but

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
right because the Biff that was slow but

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.010 
right because the Biff that was slow but
in<00:02:51.820> this<00:02:52.030> case<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.480> was<00:02:52.570> faster<00:02:52.900> for

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
in this case it was faster for

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.960 
in this case it was faster for
acceleration<00:02:53.410> so<00:02:53.800> obviously<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.220> leg<00:02:54.370> was<00:02:54.610> in

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
acceleration so obviously the leg was in

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.790 
acceleration so obviously the leg was in
to<00:02:55.300> play<00:02:55.450> yet<00:02:55.630> again<00:02:55.900> for<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.200> top<00:02:56.350> speed<00:02:56.560> test

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
to play yet again for the top speed test

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.170 
to play yet again for the top speed test
but<00:02:56.950> one<00:02:57.040> point<00:02:57.160> one<00:02:57.340> three<00:02:57.520> seconds<00:02:57.880> for<00:02:58.060> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
but one point one three seconds for the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.650 
but one point one three seconds for the
June<00:02:58.780> buggy<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.200> 1.07<00:03:00.190> for<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.180> Biff<00:03:01.360> -<00:03:01.570> so

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
June buggy and 1.07 for the Biff - so

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.210 
June buggy and 1.07 for the Biff - so
there<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:01.870> have<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.080> folks<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.860> Biff<00:03:03.010> time

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
there you have it folks the Biff time

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.130 
there you have it folks the Biff time
pretty<00:03:03.370> much<00:03:03.580> takes<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.450> win<00:03:04.630> at<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.959> end

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
pretty much takes the win at the end

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.520 
pretty much takes the win at the end
there<00:03:05.350> with<00:03:05.560> 10<00:03:05.830> points<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.340> D<00:03:07.200> buggy<00:03:08.200> for

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
there with 10 points and D buggy for

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.530 
there with 10 points and D buggy for
seven<00:03:08.739> out<00:03:08.830> of<00:03:08.860> ten<00:03:09.100> so<00:03:09.310> pretty<00:03:09.550> much<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:10.150> is

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
seven out of ten so pretty much that is

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.210 
seven out of ten so pretty much that is
the<00:03:10.630> case<00:03:10.810> for<00:03:10.840> Bobo<00:03:11.350> for<00:03:11.500> these<00:03:11.590> comparisons

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
the case for Bobo for these comparisons

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.229 
the case for Bobo for these comparisons
let<00:03:12.610> me<00:03:12.670> know<00:03:12.760> which<00:03:12.880> one's<00:03:13.060> your<00:03:13.209> favorite

I'm sure a lot of you guys would choose
the<00:03:15.130> Biff<00:03:15.280> thought<00:03:15.520> over<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.730> dune<00:03:15.880> buggy

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
some of you would choose the dune buggy

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.410 
some of you would choose the dune buggy
for<00:03:18.100> better<00:03:18.250> handling<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:18.820> performance<00:03:18.940> it's

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
for better handling and performance it's

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.580 
for better handling and performance it's
not<00:03:19.540> performance<00:03:20.019> but<00:03:20.170> just<00:03:20.320> handling

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
not performance but just handling

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.590
