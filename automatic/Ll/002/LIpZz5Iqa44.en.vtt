00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
organized going off and on it spins no

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.030 
organized going off and on it spins no
matter<00:01:12.690> what<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.170> keeps<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.410> line<00:01:13.620> wait<00:01:13.890> where

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
matter what it keeps a line wait where

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.340 
matter what it keeps a line wait where
it<00:01:14.130> needs<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.400> be

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
it needs to be

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.120 
it needs to be
unfortunately<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> line<00:01:16.650> builds<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.010> in

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
unfortunately the line builds up in

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.860 
unfortunately the line builds up in
memory<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.640> definitely<00:01:18.600> see<00:01:18.840> it

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
memory and you can definitely see it

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.330 
memory and you can definitely see it
especially<00:01:19.080> when<00:01:19.440> he<00:01:19.530> cast<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.920> there

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
especially when he cast out there

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.430 
especially when he cast out there
the<00:01:20.820> gear<00:01:21.030> box<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.420> real<00:01:21.600> small<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.230> like

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
the gear box is real small on it I like

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.140 
the gear box is real small on it I like
it<00:01:22.620> it's<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.280> high<00:01:23.460> speed<00:01:23.700> one<00:01:23.850> now<00:01:24.030> they

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
it it's not a high speed one now they

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.610 
it it's not a high speed one now they
also<00:01:24.300> have<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.570> high<00:01:24.780> speed<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> think<00:01:25.260> it's

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
also have a high speed I think it's

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.580 
also have a high speed I think it's
called<00:01:25.770> an<00:01:25.950> arsenal<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:27.600> uh<00:01:27.960> I'll<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.410> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
called an arsenal and uh I'll be the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.440 
called an arsenal and uh I'll be the
next<00:01:28.680> ruler<00:01:29.040> one<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:29.580> wish<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.150> better

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
next ruler one I just wish that better

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.050 
next ruler one I just wish that better
quality<00:01:30.870> it's<00:01:31.020> got<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> nice<00:01:31.440> it's<00:01:32.370> a<00:01:32.550> graphite

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
quality it's got a nice it's a graphite

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.120 
quality it's got a nice it's a graphite
body<00:01:33.330> so<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.350> definitely<00:01:34.710> an<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.010> they're

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
body so it's definitely an is they're

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.920 
body so it's definitely an is they're
all<00:01:35.220> stainless<00:01:35.610> steel<00:01:35.640> all<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> pieces<00:01:36.720> on

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
all stainless steel all the pieces on

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.020 
all stainless steel all the pieces on
here<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.710> definitely<00:01:38.100> corrosion<00:01:38.550> resistant

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
here so definitely corrosion resistant

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.940 
here so definitely corrosion resistant
definitely<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.660> beefed<00:01:40.140> up<00:01:40.320> worm<00:01:40.560> gear<00:01:40.830> in
