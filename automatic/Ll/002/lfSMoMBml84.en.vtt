00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.750
 in black 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.210
 I am the piercer and tattoo artist of 6 light 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.390
 I love psychedelia color a lot 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.369
 symmetry and my door is traditional neo 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.329
 of realism resides and when more like 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.309
 the letters geometry illustrate I lean 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.320
 as to non-traditional work or 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.140
 traditional although I also like 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.930
 much the traditional black and I like 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.280
 much doing traditional theater 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:51.059
 is for me the best store in the country 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.739
 an excellent team treaters i naps 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.600
 learning here more than ever 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.999
 first for me it's like making a store 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.190
 that has a theme as educational 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.929
 but because it is very normal to find 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.120
 in the city people who do not have 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:07.080
 tattoos and you get to many studies 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.340
 where there is no advice there is no such thing as a 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.290
 intervention of the artist in front of what 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.600
 are you going to do then we try like 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.220
 first educate a lot of people what 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.260
 is going to be done if I in my store do not 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.880
 I never want it to be just like a 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.230
 traditional tattoo shop or 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.360
 only realism 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.580
 like I hate those borders between 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.130
 styles and the tattooists then I want 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.150
 how they want to attend two you find 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.520
 absolutely all the languages ​​subjects 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.900
 as the name and all that language is not 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.020
 more things like that I just 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.880
 hit of follower jerry like all but 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.820
 that I was educated by the sea ​​eating 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.990
 sand and eaten crabs then from 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.880
 there as is the personal taste 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.710
 just as for the whole subject of 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.900
 sea when I started tattooing I realized 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.160
 that the sailors were an important 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.700
 very great in the whole history of 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.070
 tattoo and that all that language theme 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.140
 as nautical and all that is handled and 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.970
 is picking up a lot now for a 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.800
 a lot of time I started with the topic and 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.780
 now I'm starting to see that it's like 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.520
 retaking a lot the traditional tattoo 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.710
 so I think that makes the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.600
 store also have as a validity 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.149
 different soon to what are the other 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.820
 stores that you go to a studio where it is not 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.230
 as a concept of time but that is 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.360
 a name of a store that does not have 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.000
 nothing to do with what goes on inside and 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.140
 less with the man who is behind 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.770
 then it seems to me that is a 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.550
 strength that we have 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.550
 to each plant
