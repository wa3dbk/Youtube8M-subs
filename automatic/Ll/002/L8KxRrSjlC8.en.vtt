 into a neon-colored cyber future 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.690
 War World The story is honest 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.340
 not much stupider than in 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.830
 This will be another shooting clock 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.570

 their optics do not compromise 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.250
 were made to fit omega force 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.240
 To design outfits you have little extra 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.920
 coal loosely made and the 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.700
 Worst fashion designer in the world 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.700
 show commitment 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:27.299
 You just have to move the property 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.170
 the presentation of blood reagan meets 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.580
 fully into the black the cutscenes in the 16th 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.640
 bit style are just as good as the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.190
 soundtrack and the stupid oneliner you 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.320
 can re- borrow can thank you 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.880
 in it as she said darling

 from terminator and aliens ans micro rex 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.500
 By the way, it's hard at the beginning 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.850
 thanks to level up system and with 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.860
 the coal collected on the way could 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:34.760
 make him even stronger almost as strong 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:41.239
 how eduardly that 's enough 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:43.100
 laser has nothing to do here stupid 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.110
 only that you then with your pyrexx 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.340
 can not discover so much with 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.380
 the chips you have the manageable 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.450
 big island in a short time 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.160
 you can easily reach the final in 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.500
 four to five hours because there are hardly any 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.540
 motivating next employments the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.950
 from far cry 3 known animals exist 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.269
 Although still a metal versions but you 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.920
 you can not do anything from their remnants 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.900
 make more meaningful crafting 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.019
 system is gone and our loved ones 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.190
 There are no longer any towers 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.810
 but you would probably do it anyway 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.299
 can not find anything because in blue dragon 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.709
 such a bleak eight-pampe is for 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:17.540
 Who did you ubisoft batman 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.600
 I've heard my name batman 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.820
 batman i am batman so if 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.790
 at all I would be some 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.350
 You are already on the phone conference yes 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.910
 we're already on my way, I came too late 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.910
 nothing has connected as well 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.500
 because we have completely forgotten until now 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.090
 to tell who or what actually that 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.650
 they are blue dragons 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.420
 as a kind of luminous dinos he 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.040
 fight or what we rather recommend 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.370
 the opponents can put the end of the 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.370
 history 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.740
 far cry 3 sheet reagan burns brightly as 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.170
 gag fireworks as play money it rather like that 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.940
 but can be really angry 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.260
 that's why you are not for it 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.180
 the 80s style and the humor 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.180
 in places much too well hit 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.440
 and we already have that soundtrack 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.440
 mentioned that this is the place fit 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.910
 one can music the whole fun is gone 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.230
 That can only be the winner under 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:57.850
 archenemy 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:59.960
 that is possible only he could be like that 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.610
 Coach can hide very well 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.610
 We never find him knows that 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.640
 he still had congratulations 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.640
 come but took a long time
