I'll just add those two together just

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.980 
I'll just add those two together just
the<00:00:20.279> timing<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.060> guess<00:00:21.240> they<00:00:21.270> matched<00:00:21.720> up

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the timing of it I guess they matched up

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.620 
the timing of it I guess they matched up
so<00:00:22.430> here<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.460> am<00:00:23.580> doing<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.689> front<00:00:25.380> part<00:00:26.090> of<00:00:27.090> my

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
so here I am doing the front part of my

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.659 
so here I am doing the front part of my
hair<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:29.689> kind<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.810> lightly<00:00:31.289> um<00:00:31.830> use<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
hair and I kind of lightly um use the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.000 
hair and I kind of lightly um use the
blow<00:00:32.850> dryer<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.870> straighten<00:00:34.410> my<00:00:34.559> hair<00:00:34.829> out<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
blow dryer to straighten my hair out a

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.380 
blow dryer to straighten my hair out a
little<00:00:35.250> bit<00:00:35.899> to<00:00:36.899> make<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.230> little<00:00:37.380> easier

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
little bit to make it a little easier

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.150 
little bit to make it a little easier
the<00:00:39.390> front<00:00:39.899> section<00:00:41.149> measures<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:43.160> remember

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the front section measures I remember

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.360 
the front section measures I remember
it's<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.489> nine<00:00:45.140> this<00:00:46.140> wasn't<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.649> easy<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.070> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
it's like nine this wasn't as easy as I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.490 
it's like nine this wasn't as easy as I
thought<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.579> would<00:00:47.730> be<00:00:48.000> y'all<00:00:48.320> me<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
thought it would be y'all me and the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.040 
thought it would be y'all me and the
measure<00:00:49.739> tape<00:00:50.100> was<00:00:50.340> fighting<00:00:50.760> some<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
measure tape was fighting some of the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.869 
measure tape was fighting some of the
way<00:00:52.610> but<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:54.000> think<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.660> close<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.440> ten<00:00:56.039> nine

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
way but I think it's close to ten nine

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.170 
way but I think it's close to ten nine
and<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> half<00:00:57.120> ten<00:00:57.719> inches<00:00:58.489> f<00:00:59.489> nine<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> half

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and a half ten inches f nine and a half

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.990 
and a half ten inches f nine and a half
we'll<00:01:00.719> call<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.050> nine<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> half<00:01:01.969> for<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
we'll call it nine and a half for the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.730 
we'll call it nine and a half for the
front<00:01:03.300> section<00:01:06.950> let's<00:01:07.950> go<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.369> ten<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.090> ah

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
front section let's go on to ten so ah

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.530 
front section let's go on to ten so ah
between<00:01:10.740> nine<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.100> half<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.460> 10<00:01:11.640> inches<00:01:12.000> LA

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
between nine and a half and 10 inches LA

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:21.649 
between nine and a half and 10 inches LA
for<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.450> yeah<00:01:18.450> okay<00:01:19.400> um<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.509> do

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
for that so yeah okay um what do I do

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.800 
for that so yeah okay um what do I do
next<00:01:21.810> decides<00:01:22.820> I<00:01:23.820> believe<00:01:24.509> both<00:01:25.080> sides<00:01:25.470> are

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
next decides I believe both sides are

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.330 
next decides I believe both sides are
about<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.960> same<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:28.680> measure<00:01:29.100> both

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
about the same but I do measure both

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.010 
about the same but I do measure both
sides<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:31.700> um<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.390> did<00:01:33.659> cut<00:01:34.049> my<00:01:34.079> hair<00:01:34.939> maybe

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
sides so um and I did cut my hair maybe

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.210 
sides so um and I did cut my hair maybe
oh<00:01:38.540> when<00:01:39.540> did<00:01:39.659> or<00:01:39.840> whenever<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.500> had<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.920> burn

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
oh when did or whenever I had that burn

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.210 
oh when did or whenever I had that burn
that<00:01:41.850> high<00:01:42.360> bun<00:01:42.750> maybe<00:01:43.290> was<00:01:43.530> three<00:01:43.799> weeks<00:01:43.979> ago

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
that high bun maybe was three weeks ago

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.770 
that high bun maybe was three weeks ago
I<00:01:44.729> did<00:01:45.659> try<00:01:46.020> my<00:01:46.049> hair<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:47.450> probably<00:01:48.450> took<00:01:48.659> about

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
I did try my hair I probably took about

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.480 
I did try my hair I probably took about
maybe<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.710> half<00:01:50.040> an<00:01:50.220> inch<00:01:50.399> off<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.530> um<00:01:52.530> that's

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
maybe a half an inch off so um that's

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.420 
maybe a half an inch off so um that's
probably<00:01:53.970> about<00:01:54.119> nine<00:01:54.509> inches<00:01:55.070> for<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.100> sides

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
probably about nine inches for the sides

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.929 
probably about nine inches for the sides
that's<00:01:57.299> my<00:01:57.530> left<00:01:58.530> side<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.310> think<00:01:59.549> my<00:01:59.670> both

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
that's my left side and I think my both

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.560 
that's my left side and I think my both
my<00:01:59.969> size<00:02:00.329> are<00:02:00.509> pretty<00:02:00.719> even<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.290> um<00:02:02.130> yeah<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.540> I

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
my size are pretty even but um yeah so I

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.100 
my size are pretty even but um yeah so I
did<00:02:03.990> trim<00:02:04.439> my<00:02:04.649> hair<00:02:05.180> like<00:02:06.180> i<00:02:06.360> was<00:02:06.540> saying<00:02:06.780> i

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
did trim my hair like i was saying i

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.080 
did trim my hair like i was saying i
probably<00:02:07.439> won't<00:02:07.970> trim<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.090> again<00:02:09.420> until<00:02:09.780> I

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
probably won't trim it again until I

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.550 
probably won't trim it again until I
don't<00:02:12.090> know<00:02:12.209> whenever<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.260> think

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
don't know whenever I think

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.050 
don't know whenever I think
means<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.980> probably<00:02:14.010> needs<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.610> little<00:02:14.790> more

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
means it probably needs a little more

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.120 
means it probably needs a little more
trimmed<00:02:15.420> off<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:16.050> ends<00:02:16.440> don't<00:02:16.500> really<00:02:16.980> look

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
trimmed off the ends don't really look

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.729 
trimmed off the ends don't really look
that<00:02:17.190> hot<00:02:17.610> but<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.180> just<00:02:18.750> think<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.110> needs<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.590> be

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
that hot but I just think it needs to be

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.449 
that hot but I just think it needs to be
I<00:02:19.980> need<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.340> up<00:02:20.819> my<00:02:20.880> moisture<00:02:21.450> game<00:02:22.340> for<00:02:23.340> the

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
I need to up my moisture game for the

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.550 
I need to up my moisture game for the
winter<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:23.989> steal<00:02:24.989> my<00:02:25.020> ends<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.739> little<00:02:25.890> better

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
winter and steal my ends a little better

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.040 
winter and steal my ends a little better
for<00:02:28.560> them<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.920> look<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.250> little<00:02:29.400> better<00:02:29.930> like<00:02:30.930> I

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
for them to look a little better like I

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.830 
for them to look a little better like I
said<00:02:31.319> it's<00:02:31.650> about<00:02:31.920> 99<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.940> half<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.690> my

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
said it's about 99 and a half for my

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:50.190 
said it's about 99 and a half for my
side<00:02:34.190> side<00:02:35.190> on<00:02:35.670> length<00:02:36.650> inches<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:38.280> inches

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.580
