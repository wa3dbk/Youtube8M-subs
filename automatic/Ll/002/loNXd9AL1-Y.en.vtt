00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.420
 in marktl one of the three managing directors 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.850
 we are the company fresh 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.990
 Company freshness consists of over 100 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.139
 employees 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.930
 We have been on the market for over 28 years 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.340
 may the North German gastronomy and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.070
 supply community catering 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.980
 in the vegetable area and with other fresh 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.919
 Articles our company stands for 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.640
 Quality for freshness for excellent 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:35.210
 Services six days 24 hours 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.210
 Around the clock 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.240
 Electromobility is just as sustainable 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.610
 how we work and he reflects ours 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.690
 philosophy is also very special to me 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.910
 Of course, I like it when I join 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.410
 the customer on the boot and the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.660
 really hear nothing and think there 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.690
 ufo is served that is really 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.330
 a funny feeling is regionality 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.270
 equate with porsche with quality 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.410
 with short distances with the protection of the environment 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.049
 resources 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.159
 my name is nobody worth i'm here 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.460
 in the company for the fleet 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.350
 responsible outlet every ten meters 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.450
 a thing I once a gas station must 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.670
 I look for me and go again 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.280
 I do not have that in the yard 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.710
 vision a socket I'm done 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.500
 have to say that I'm really excited 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.510
 very nice driving the volume 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.610
 You really do not hear anything and that 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.150
 equal to the acceleration is to 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.590
 again something very special 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.370
 if you can operate a vacuum cleaner 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.770
 You can also do such an electric car 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.140
 We also charge very well 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.100
 has fallen the eco mode and because 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.140
 it's just a great thing in the world 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.450
 Classic range can expand 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.980
 and thus my hobby time as well 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.020
 Of course , gasoline does not cost too 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.810
 I think I underestimate when I'm with 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.940
 a transporter 15 liters needs to 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.780
 100 kilometers of the liter is 1 euro 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.910
 50 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.550
 the electric vehicle runs for 100 kilometers 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.860
 Of course, this is not quite the case 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.540
 irrelevant I have a lot to do 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.770
 just when I'm on the hidden 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.479
 I use my hands 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.490
 logically on the boxes 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.830
 letting it be easy is up to me 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.020
 pocket pressure on the start button and can 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:13.660
 We start believing that we can do it 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.620
 set signs and many imitators 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.050
 will find 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.840
 take this topic for yourself 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.840
 and are also sustainably mobile 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.190
 nice car in any case
