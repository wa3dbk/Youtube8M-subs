00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.050 

Lavar<00:00:04.140> came<00:00:04.350> up<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.650> me<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:04.980> he's<00:00:05.190> sad<00:00:05.430> just

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
Lavar came up to me and he's sad just

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.600 
Lavar came up to me and he's sad just
make<00:00:06.210> it<00:00:06.330> comfortable<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:07.109> beautiful<00:00:07.950> it

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
make it comfortable and beautiful it

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.730 
make it comfortable and beautiful it
freaked<00:00:08.940> me<00:00:09.120> out<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.240> little<00:00:09.480> bit<00:00:09.750> because<00:00:09.990> what

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
freaked me out a little bit because what

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.120 
freaked me out a little bit because what
they<00:00:10.860> showed<00:00:11.070> me<00:00:11.280> was<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:12.030> thought<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.230> have

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
they showed me was this I thought I have

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.200 
they showed me was this I thought I have
a<00:00:14.370> big<00:00:14.610> challenge<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:15.630> front<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:16.109> me<00:00:17.000> for<00:00:18.000> me

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
a big challenge in front of me for me

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.540 
a big challenge in front of me for me
the<00:00:18.390> most<00:00:18.539> important<00:00:19.080> thing<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.590> how<00:00:20.039> can<00:00:20.340> we

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
the most important thing is how can we

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.870 
the most important thing is how can we
really<00:00:21.150> reduce<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.560> its<00:00:23.010> very<00:00:23.340> essence

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
really reduce this to its very essence

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.599 
really reduce this to its very essence
and<00:00:24.230> everything<00:00:25.230> that's<00:00:25.439> not<00:00:25.650> necessary<00:00:26.310> goes

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
and everything that's not necessary goes

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.089 
and everything that's not necessary goes
away<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.810> really<00:00:28.230> high<00:00:28.439> tech<00:00:28.830> but

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
away this is like really high tech but

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.150 
away this is like really high tech but
my<00:00:29.460> biggest<00:00:29.670> goal<00:00:30.029> was<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.449> make<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.689> look

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
my biggest goal was to make it look

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.250 
my biggest goal was to make it look
simple<00:00:32.160> when<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.210> have<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> very<00:00:33.809> big<00:00:33.989> problem

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
simple when you have a very big problem

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.389 
simple when you have a very big problem
to<00:00:34.739> solve<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.370> need<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:36.530> find<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.829> couple<00:00:38.100> of

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
to solve you need to find a couple of

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.360 
to solve you need to find a couple of
ideas<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.180> then<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:40.379> make<00:00:40.410> them<00:00:40.829> shine

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
ideas and then really make them shine

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.280 
ideas and then really make them shine
we<00:00:41.520> had<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.820> optics<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.329> was<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.989> and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
we had the optics that was like this and

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.369 
we had the optics that was like this and
then<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.590> had<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> big<00:00:44.190> board<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.390> I

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
then we had a big board like this and I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.560 
then we had a big board like this and I
couldn't<00:00:46.739> stand<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.219> idea<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.700> some<00:00:48.059> weird

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
couldn't stand the idea of some weird

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.500 
couldn't stand the idea of some weird
transition<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.739> came<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.090> idea<00:00:51.390> of

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
transition I came up with the idea of

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.110 
transition I came up with the idea of
hiding<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.500> board<00:00:52.800> behind<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> frame<00:00:53.430> so

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
hiding the board behind the frame so

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.299 
hiding the board behind the frame so
from<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.930> view<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> looks<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:55.770> here's<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
from this view it looks like here's the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.939 
from this view it looks like here's the
frame<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.030> here's<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.840> thing<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.590> it's

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
frame and here's this thing and it's

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.790 
frame and here's this thing and it's
separated<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.820> clean<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.500> board

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
separated and it's clean but the board

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
separated and it's clean but the board
actually<00:01:02.070> goes<00:01:02.430> all<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.820> way<00:01:03.300> up<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.719> this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
actually goes all the way up to this

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.850 
actually goes all the way up to this
edge<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:05.280> such<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> simple<00:01:06.360> idea<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:07.020> it

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
edge this was such a simple idea but it

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.910 
edge this was such a simple idea but it
kind<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.909> defined<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.630> product<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.470> second

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
kind of defined the product the second

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.700 
kind of defined the product the second
thing<00:01:11.189> was<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:12.060> really<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:12.780> light<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.560> of

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
thing was be really really light one of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
thing was be really really light one of
the<00:01:13.920> goals<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.430> like<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.939> needs<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.600> weigh

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the goals is like this needs to weigh

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.560 
the goals is like this needs to weigh
less<00:01:16.439> than<00:01:16.740> 65<00:01:17.250> grams<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.150> was<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.390> that's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
less than 65 grams and I was like that's

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.980 
less than 65 grams and I was like that's
it<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.110> these<00:01:19.770> were<00:01:20.100> 150<00:01:21.000> grams<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.689> ammo

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
it so these were 150 grams and ammo

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080 
it so these were 150 grams and ammo
obsessed<00:01:22.409> with<00:01:22.590> weight<00:01:22.830> by<00:01:23.130> now<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.549> always

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
obsessed with weight by now I always

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.510 
obsessed with weight by now I always
have<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> little<00:01:24.630> scale<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.770> my<00:01:25.799> desk<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.460> as

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
have a little scale on my desk and as

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.039 
have a little scale on my desk and as
soon<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:26.759> we<00:01:26.880> have<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> new<00:01:27.150> prototype<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.750> put<00:01:27.960> it

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
soon as we have a new prototype I put it

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109 
soon as we have a new prototype I put it
there<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.189> know<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.670> Christmas

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
there and you know it's like Christmas

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.670 
there and you know it's like Christmas
every<00:01:30.240> time<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> way<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.259> keeps<00:01:31.470> on

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
every time because the way it keeps on

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.460 
every time because the way it keeps on
reducing<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.460> latest<00:01:32.729> prototype<00:01:33.060> weighs<00:01:33.470> 43

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
reducing the latest prototype weighs 43

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.990 
reducing the latest prototype weighs 43
grams<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.189> Nexus<00:01:35.520> phone<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.820> actually

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
grams the Nexus phone is actually

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.510 
grams the Nexus phone is actually
heavier<00:01:36.540> than<00:01:36.720> tripathi's<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:38.189> most

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
heavier than tripathi's the most

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.270 
heavier than tripathi's the most
important<00:01:39.060> part<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.420> designing<00:01:39.780> is

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
important part of designing is

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.830 
important part of designing is
prototyping<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.439> time

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
prototyping this one was for a time

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:56.090 
prototyping this one was for a time
yeah<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.170> mean<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:53.780> after<00:01:54.780> had<00:01:54.990> done<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> design

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
yeah I mean I after had done the design

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.069 
yeah I mean I after had done the design
came<00:01:56.460> up<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> software<00:01:57.990> engineers

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
came up to one of the software engineers

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.980 
came up to one of the software engineers
have<00:01:58.649> showed<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.100> him<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.610> was<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.990> no

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
have showed it to him and it was like no

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.679 
have showed it to him and it was like no
way<00:02:01.350> now<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.159> need<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.579> program<00:02:02.819> because<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.509> want

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
way now I need to program because I want

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.660 
way now I need to program because I want
to<00:02:03.720> make<00:02:03.929> an<00:02:04.110> experience<00:02:04.619> as<00:02:04.890> beautiful<00:02:05.460> as

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
to make an experience as beautiful as

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.609 
to make an experience as beautiful as
this<00:02:05.970> it's<00:02:06.450> not<00:02:06.600> only<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.049> device<00:02:07.259> we<00:02:07.530> will

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
this it's not only the device we will

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.589 
this it's not only the device we will
charge<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.009> do<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.459> how<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.060> experience

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
charge to do this how is that experience

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.080 
charge to do this how is that experience
you<00:02:10.229> want<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.470> take<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.769> with<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.220> well<00:02:11.940> you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
you want to take it with you well you

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.360 
you want to take it with you well you
need<00:02:12.269> a<00:02:12.299> case<00:02:12.569> for<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:12.959> how<00:02:13.799> does<00:02:13.860> all<00:02:14.160> those

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
need a case for that how does all those

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.610 
need a case for that how does all those
things<00:02:14.430> come<00:02:14.910> together<00:02:15.060> we<00:02:15.690> focus<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.290> trying

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
things come together we focus on trying

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.890 
things come together we focus on trying
to<00:02:16.769> solve<00:02:17.010> problems<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.880> always<00:02:18.299> simplify

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
to solve problems and always simplify

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.259 
to solve problems and always simplify
and<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.680> then<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.160> end<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.400> can<00:02:20.790> get<00:02:21.090> to

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
and and then in the end you can get to

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.210 
and and then in the end you can get to
somewhere<00:02:21.660> but<00:02:22.019> I<00:02:22.049> think<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.470> most<00:02:22.650> important

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
somewhere but I think the most important

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.210 
somewhere but I think the most important
thing<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.549> is<00:02:23.730> just<00:02:24.000> not<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.660> feel<00:02:24.870> overwhelmed

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
thing is is just not to feel overwhelmed

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.039 
thing is is just not to feel overwhelmed
because<00:02:26.220> if<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.790> really<00:02:27.209> are<00:02:27.420> trying<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.930> do

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
because if you really are trying to do

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.539 
because if you really are trying to do
something<00:02:28.260> new<00:02:28.530> it's<00:02:28.739> gonna<00:02:29.130> be<00:02:29.310> really
