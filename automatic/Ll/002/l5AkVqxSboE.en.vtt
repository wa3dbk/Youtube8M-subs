broken<00:02:01.420> down<00:02:01.750> into<00:02:01.989> simple<00:02:02.410> categories<00:02:02.619> and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
broken down into simple categories and

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.800 
broken down into simple categories and
you<00:02:03.640> can<00:02:03.849> pretty<00:02:04.119> much<00:02:04.209> find<00:02:04.509> them<00:02:04.720> really

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
you can pretty much find them really

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.600 
you can pretty much find them really
easy<00:02:05.050> if<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.440> want<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.679> find<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.039> planet<00:02:06.399> like

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
easy if you want to find the planet like

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.130 
easy if you want to find the planet like
what<00:02:06.819> it<00:02:06.910> has<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.330> just<00:02:07.509> click<00:02:07.690> on<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:07.989> on<00:02:08.050> the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
what it has you just click on it on the

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.900 
what it has you just click on it on the
side<00:02:08.349> there<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:09.160> can<00:02:09.280> see<00:02:09.459> if<00:02:09.789> it's

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
side there and you can see if it's

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.210 
side there and you can see if it's
colonize<00:02:10.390> abaya<00:02:10.750> race<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.890> know<00:02:12.010> how

colonize abaya race and you know how

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.010 
colonize abaya race and you know how
well<00:02:12.489> your<00:02:12.700> race<00:02:12.849> may<00:02:13.060> do<00:02:13.239> if<00:02:13.420> they<00:02:13.569> colonize

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
well your race may do if they colonize

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.959 
well your race may do if they colonize
it<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.319> then<00:02:14.709> here's<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.040> diplomacy<00:02:15.550> screen

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
it and then here's the diplomacy screen

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.819 
it and then here's the diplomacy screen
is<00:02:16.299> the<00:02:16.659> place<00:02:16.959> where<00:02:17.200> you're<00:02:17.409> going<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.709> see

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
is the place where you're going to see

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.960 
is the place where you're going to see
other<00:02:17.980> races<00:02:18.430> as<00:02:18.549> they<00:02:18.819> fill<00:02:19.030> in<00:02:19.209> and

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
other races as they fill in and

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.990 
other races as they fill in and
here<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.750> text<00:02:21.050> screen<00:02:21.550> horizon<00:02:22.550> takes<00:02:22.790> an

here is the text screen horizon takes an

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.060 
here is the text screen horizon takes an
interesting<00:02:23.540> approach<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:24.200> research<00:02:24.650> in<00:02:24.980> this

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
interesting approach to research in this

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.800 
interesting approach to research in this
game<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.490> don't<00:02:25.640> research<00:02:26.150> individual

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
game you don't research individual

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.870 
game you don't research individual
technologies<00:02:27.440> but<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.040> research<00:02:28.430> different

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
technologies but you research different

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.700 
technologies but you research different
categories<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.960> can<00:02:30.110> beef<00:02:30.320> up<00:02:30.500> those

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
categories and you can beef up those

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.980 
categories and you can beef up those
categories<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.400> get<00:02:31.550> them<00:02:31.730> faster<00:02:32.210> and<00:02:32.420> then

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
categories to get them faster and then

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.410 
categories to get them faster and then
here<00:02:33.260> we<00:02:33.290> have<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.800> ship<00:02:34.100> design<00:02:34.610> screen<00:02:34.970> and

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
here we have the ship design screen and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.330 
here we have the ship design screen and
this<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:35.960> very<00:02:36.200> kind<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.560> reminiscent<00:02:37.040> of

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
this is very kind of reminiscent of

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.030 
this is very kind of reminiscent of
something<00:02:37.910> like<00:02:38.180> masters<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.870> orion<00:02:38.960> you<00:02:39.800> kind

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
something like masters of orion you kind

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.860 
something like masters of orion you kind
of<00:02:40.100> pick<00:02:40.310> what<00:02:40.700> subsystem<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.480> want<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.690> put

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
of pick what subsystem you want to put

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.900 
of pick what subsystem you want to put
in<00:02:42.050> your<00:02:42.080> limited<00:02:42.560> slots<00:02:42.830> you<00:02:43.340> have<00:02:43.550> a<00:02:43.580> certain

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
in your limited slots you have a certain

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.060 
in your limited slots you have a certain
available<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.600> cargo<00:02:45.080> space<00:02:45.110> or<00:02:45.650> spaced<00:02:45.920> that

available of cargo space or spaced that

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.100 
available of cargo space or spaced that
you<00:02:46.220> can<00:02:46.400> add<00:02:46.610> weapons<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.420> systems<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.990> your

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
you can add weapons and systems to your

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.560 
you can add weapons and systems to your
ship<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:49.130> can't<00:02:49.400> go<00:02:49.580> over<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.060> budget

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
ship and you can't go over that budget

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.650 
ship and you can't go over that budget
definitely<00:02:51.440> like<00:02:51.590> this<00:02:51.800> kind<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.040> thing<00:02:52.660> once

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
definitely like this kind of thing once

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.390 
definitely like this kind of thing once
you<00:02:53.780> got<00:02:53.990> your<00:02:54.140> ships<00:02:54.560> all<00:02:54.830> set<00:02:55.100> up<00:02:55.250> you're

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
you got your ships all set up you're

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.680 
you got your ships all set up you're
probably<00:02:55.640> going<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:55.940> want<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.209> build<00:02:56.420> some

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
probably going to want to build some

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.140 
probably going to want to build some
scouts<00:02:57.050> and<00:02:57.380> start<00:02:57.680> exploring<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.910> galaxy

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
scouts and start exploring the galaxy

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.690

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
after every turn you're going to get a

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.640 
after every turn you're going to get a
little<00:03:02.000> overview<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.959> what's<00:03:03.230> happened

I<00:03:23.450> find<00:03:23.959> them<00:03:24.140> pretty<00:03:24.380> cool<00:03:34.420> after<00:03:35.420> these

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
I find them pretty cool after these

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
some more cool animations once you

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.080 
some more cool animations once you
finish<00:03:57.830> researching<00:03:58.340> some<00:03:58.880> of<00:03:58.970> your
