00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.070 
able to see the difference you probably
won't<00:00:08.820> be<00:00:09.000> because<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.300> recorded<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:09.870> in

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
won't be because I recorded this in

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.310 
won't be because I recorded this in
weird<00:00:10.670> 29<00:00:11.670> for<00:00:11.910> actually<00:00:12.389> yeah<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:13.170> was

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
weird 29 for actually yeah it was

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.780 
weird 29 for actually yeah it was
recording<00:00:13.620> 29<00:00:13.920> frames<00:00:14.190> because<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.460> forgot<00:00:14.700> to

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
recording 29 frames because I forgot to

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.300 
recording 29 frames because I forgot to
change<00:00:14.969> 1080p<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> 720<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.529> I'll<00:00:16.920> be<00:00:17.279> I

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.560 
change 1080p to the 720 and I'll be I
rendering<00:00:17.850> low<00:00:17.970> quality<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.390> probably

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
rendering low quality so you probably

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.250 
rendering low quality so you probably
won't<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:18.840> able<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.020> tell<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.230> difference

understand differences so I'm just going
to<00:00:40.829> go<00:00:40.920> through<00:00:41.070> them<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.460> first<00:00:41.640> thing<00:00:41.700> I

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.680 
don't know how to explain it the shadow
it<00:00:53.100> may<00:00:53.250> look<00:00:53.489> different<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
shadows look different like this the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.069 
shadows look different like this the
render<00:00:56.670> distance<00:00:56.850> looks<00:00:57.360> different<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.930> you

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
render distance looks different like you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.319 
render distance looks different like you
can<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.469> detail<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:59.039> long<00:00:59.160> range<00:00:59.489> which<00:01:00.210> you

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
can see detail at long range which you

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.299 
can see detail at long range which you
count<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.660> 360<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.859> first<00:01:02.129> thing<00:01:02.219> I

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
count on the 360 and the first thing I

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.529 
count on the 360 and the first thing I
know<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.520> actually<00:01:02.789> when<00:01:02.879> he's<00:01:03.000> thermal<00:01:03.359> it

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
know is actually when he's thermal it

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.060 
know is actually when he's thermal it
was<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> lot<00:01:03.840> darker<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.379> wasn't<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> lot<00:01:05.040> of

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
was a lot darker it wasn't a lot of

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.560 
was a lot darker it wasn't a lot of
brightness<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.000> was<00:01:06.090> actually<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> lot<00:01:06.510> harder

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
brightness it was actually a lot harder

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.859 
brightness it was actually a lot harder
to<00:01:06.869> use<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.770> first<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.850> add<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.510> that's<00:01:09.750> that

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
to use at first and add that that's that

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.719 
to use at first and add that that's that
but<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.260> terms<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> console<00:01:11.100> itself<00:01:11.220> it

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
but in terms of the console itself it

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.789 
but in terms of the console itself it
looks<00:01:11.939> lovely<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:13.140> controller<00:01:13.560> is
