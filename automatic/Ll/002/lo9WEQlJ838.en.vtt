it's the jewel I think it's where we
heard<00:00:40.050> jewel<00:00:40.410> here<00:00:41.040> we<00:00:41.219> go<00:00:41.370> DN<00:00:41.879> 1<00:00:42.270> 4<00:00:43.140> 9<00:00:44.040> s<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> I

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
heard jewel here we go DN 1 4 9 s so I

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.420 
heard jewel here we go DN 1 4 9 s so I
had<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.989> make<00:00:46.200> sure<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.410> got<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.739> right<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:47.219> on

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
had to make sure I got the right one on

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.819 
had to make sure I got the right one on
eBay<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.390> I've<00:00:48.750> done<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.260> I've<00:00:49.469> got<00:00:49.680> one

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
here I think they go under several

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.979 
here I think they go under several
different<00:00:53.149> just<00:00:54.149> about<00:00:54.329> serial<00:00:54.719> focus

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
different just about serial focus

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.029 
different just about serial focus
several<00:00:55.680> different<00:00:56.070> numbers<00:00:57.710> this<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.890> also

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
several different numbers this one also

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.689 
several different numbers this one also
comes<00:00:59.250> under<00:00:59.730> G<00:01:00.660> 4<00:01:01.050> 8<00:01:01.260> 6<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:02.190> here<00:01:02.399> we<00:01:02.489> go

about see my fingers moving it there it

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.660 
about see my fingers moving it there it
does<00:01:47.430> slip<00:01:47.759> out<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.560> piece<00:01:49.860> slots

has a strobe adjustment and then what

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.219 
has a strobe adjustment and then what
you<00:02:07.530> do<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.799> set<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> pitch<00:02:08.759> by<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.509> center

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
you do you set the pitch by the center

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.460 
you do you set the pitch by the center
knob<00:02:10.440> here<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.129> runs<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.750> belts<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:12.930> him<00:02:13.140> just

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
knob here that runs a belts on him just

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.050 
knob here that runs a belts on him just
see<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:13.980> with<00:02:14.100> my<00:02:14.220> finger<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.760> end<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:14.970> my

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
see that with my finger the end of my

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.420 
see that with my finger the end of my
finger<00:02:15.120> there<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.710> can<00:02:16.860> see<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.160> moving

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
finger there and you can see that moving

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.690 
finger there and you can see that moving
and<00:02:17.970> what<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.690> does<00:02:18.960> we've<00:02:19.740> noticed<00:02:20.130> move<00:02:20.490> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
and what it does we've noticed move the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.090 
and what it does we've noticed move the
cam<00:02:21.030> which<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.840> by<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.620> point<00:02:22.920> though

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
cam which is by this point though

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.820 
cam which is by this point though
there's<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.310> cam<00:02:23.610> there<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:25.230> he<00:02:25.350> moves<00:02:25.620> that

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
there's a cam there and he moves that

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.030 
there's a cam there and he moves that
just<00:02:26.100> slightly<00:02:26.550> up<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.820> down<00:02:27.120> which

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
just slightly up and down which

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.610 
just slightly up and down which
increases<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.190> tension<00:02:29.490> so<00:02:30.450> onto<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.110> on<00:02:31.470> to

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
increases the tension so onto the on to

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.000 
increases the tension so onto the on to
the<00:02:31.770> 45<00:02:32.310> area<00:02:33.150> but<00:02:33.660> it's<00:02:33.810> slightly<00:02:34.050> slow

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
the 45 area but it's slightly slow

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.060 
the 45 area but it's slightly slow
chamfered<00:02:35.640> at<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.880> edges<00:02:36.710> when<00:02:37.710> you<00:02:37.800> switch

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
chamfered at the edges when you switch

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.540 
chamfered at the edges when you switch
from<00:02:38.100> 45<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.790> 33<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:40.590> actually<00:02:40.950> move<00:02:41.190> this

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
from 45 to 33 you actually move this

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.330 
from 45 to 33 you actually move this
little<00:02:42.090> bit<00:02:42.420> here<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.020> then<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.800> moves<00:02:44.100> this

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
little bit here and then that moves this

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.020 
little bit here and then that moves this
piece<00:02:44.610> up<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.060> down<00:02:45.560> on<00:02:46.560> here<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.910> one

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
piece up and down on here on the one

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.790 
piece up and down on here on the one
I've<00:02:48.180> got<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.630> office<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.170> 505<00:02:49.740> is

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
I've got in the office the 505 is

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.850 
I've got in the office the 505 is
sticking<00:02:50.340> slightly<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.850> I've<00:02:50.910> got<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.860> remove

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
sticking slightly and I've got to remove

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.620 
sticking slightly and I've got to remove
it<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.250> give<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.670> bit<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.820> oil<00:02:53.940> I've<00:02:54.240> done

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
it and give it a bit of oil I've done

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.060 
it and give it a bit of oil I've done
that<00:02:54.810> but<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:55.020> still<00:02:55.290> sticking<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:55.920> have

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
that but it's still sticking so I have

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.160 
that but it's still sticking so I have
to<00:02:56.160> take<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.670> have<00:02:57.000> set<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.209> turntable<00:02:57.900> off

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
to take that I have set a turntable off

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.850 
to take that I have set a turntable off
to<00:02:58.830> which<00:02:59.640> isn't<00:03:00.270> all<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:00.630> there's<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.650> bit<00:03:01.800> of

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
to which isn't all that there's a bit of

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.290 
to which isn't all that there's a bit of
a<00:03:01.890> fiddle<00:03:02.310> these<00:03:03.270> captioning<00:03:03.840> come<00:03:05.300> bubble

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
a fiddle these captioning come bubble

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.210 
a fiddle these captioning come bubble
finding<00:03:06.630> space<00:03:06.900> reading<00:03:07.230> on<00:03:07.320> them<00:03:07.470> these<00:03:07.980> days

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
finding space reading on them these days

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.110 
finding space reading on them these days
come<00:03:08.520> with<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:08.850> very<00:03:09.180> nice<00:03:10.550> turntable<00:03:11.550> and

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
come with this very nice turntable and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.840 
come with this very nice turntable and
the<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:13.170> actual<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.130> still<00:03:14.370> on<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.640> others

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
the the actual is still on the others

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.000 
the the actual is still on the others
where<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.090> spindle<00:03:15.570> is<00:03:15.660> actually<00:03:16.170> separate

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
where the spindle is actually separate

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.699 
where the spindle is actually separate
from<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.420> turntable<00:03:18.420> platter<00:03:19.019> itself<00:03:19.500> this

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
from the turntable platter itself this

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.860 
from the turntable platter itself this
one's<00:03:19.920> attached<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.330> have<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.660> release

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
one's attached so you have to release

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.670 
one's attached so you have to release
that<00:03:22.110> small<00:03:23.060> just<00:03:24.060> put<00:03:24.269> this<00:03:24.390> back<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:25.470> have

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
that small just put this back you have

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.120 
that small just put this back you have
to<00:03:25.769> release<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.220> small<00:03:27.620> stay<00:03:28.620> here<00:03:29.070> I

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
to release that small stay here I

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.530 
to release that small stay here I
suppose<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.550> would<00:03:29.640> call<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.970> with<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.239> screw

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
suppose you would call it with the screw

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.690 
suppose you would call it with the screw
at<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.750> end<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.200> then<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.920> moves<00:03:32.280> in<00:03:32.550> and

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
at the end and then that moves in and

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.270 
at the end and then that moves in and
out<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.180> I've<00:03:33.360> basically<00:03:34.290> degrease<00:03:34.980> this

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
out and I've basically degrease this

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.890 
out and I've basically degrease this
last<00:03:35.550> weekend<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.330> I<00:03:36.420> always<00:03:36.540> had<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.720> bit<00:03:36.870> of

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
last weekend and I always had a bit of

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.100 
last weekend and I always had a bit of
time<00:03:37.519> so<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:38.550> need<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.850> do<00:03:39.000> that

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
time so I need to do that

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.770 
time so I need to do that
it<00:03:40.350> runs<00:03:40.709> on<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.950> very<00:03:41.280> nice<00:03:41.459> motor<00:03:41.910> I<00:03:42.420> just

it runs on a very nice motor I just

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.180 
it runs on a very nice motor I just
gonna<00:03:42.900> turn<00:03:43.200> see<00:03:43.560> if<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.680> can<00:03:43.830> turn<00:03:43.980> her<00:03:44.160> over

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
gonna turn see if I can turn her over

for you okay so got this large loads are
here<00:03:52.530> slightly<00:03:53.519> different<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.090> other

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
here slightly different to the other

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.440 
here slightly different to the other
ones<00:03:54.510> it's<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.260> bigger<00:03:55.440> motor<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:56.160> then<00:03:56.760> the

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
ones it's a bigger motor and then the

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.750 
ones it's a bigger motor and then the
strobe<00:03:57.810> light<00:03:58.110> comes<00:03:58.530> off<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:59.190> main<00:03:59.400> block

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
strobe light comes off the main block

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.430 
strobe light comes off the main block
for<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.000> power<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.720> then<00:04:01.019> you've<00:04:01.170> got<00:04:01.320> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
for the power and then you've got the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.390 
for the power and then you've got the
usual<00:04:02.330> adjustment<00:04:03.330> here<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:04.640> lift<00:04:05.640> arm<00:04:06.000> lift

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
usual adjustment here and lift arm lift

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.070 
usual adjustment here and lift arm lift

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.680 
copper insert set of RCA plugs on eBay
these<00:04:18.750> are<00:04:18.930> so<00:04:19.080> cheap<00:04:19.380> about<00:04:19.709> pound<00:04:20.690> because

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
these are so cheap about pound because

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.850 
these are so cheap about pound because
these<00:04:22.140> ones<00:04:22.470> are<00:04:23.250> looking<00:04:23.669> a<00:04:23.789> bit<00:04:24.080> rusty

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
these ones are looking a bit rusty

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.520 
these ones are looking a bit rusty
the<00:04:26.039> connectivity<00:04:26.520> is<00:04:26.879> important<00:04:27.689> the<00:04:28.169> one<00:04:28.349> in

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
the connectivity is important the one in

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.140 
the connectivity is important the one in
the<00:04:28.620> office<00:04:28.710> I've<00:04:29.099> caught<00:04:29.340> I've<00:04:29.550> noticed<00:04:30.000> that

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
the office I've caught I've noticed that

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.290 
the office I've caught I've noticed that
the<00:04:30.300> cabling<00:04:31.199> here<00:04:31.560> is<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.710> bit<00:04:31.949> dodgy<00:04:32.490> there's

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
the cabling here is a bit dodgy there's

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.360 
the cabling here is a bit dodgy there's
a<00:04:33.389> buildup<00:04:33.750> of<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:34.259> power<00:04:34.620> surge<00:04:35.009> when<00:04:35.280> you

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
a buildup of a power surge when you

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.140 
a buildup of a power surge when you
switch<00:04:35.639> mr.<00:04:35.969> trio<00:04:36.210> on<00:04:36.509> it<00:04:37.199> hums<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:37.979> then<00:04:38.280> if<00:04:38.969> I

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
switch mr. trio on it hums and then if I

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.510 
switch mr. trio on it hums and then if I
touch<00:04:39.389> it<00:04:39.539> it<00:04:39.659> goes<00:04:39.840> away<00:04:39.919> so<00:04:40.919> what<00:04:41.039> I<00:04:41.069> do<00:04:41.189> on

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
touch it it goes away so what I do on

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.679 
touch it it goes away so what I do on
that<00:04:41.729> long<00:04:41.849> there's<00:04:42.000> always<00:04:42.120> had<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.479> volume

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:42.689 
that long there's always had the volume

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:44.839 
that long there's always had the volume
in<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.110> zero<00:04:43.500> position<00:04:43.770> before<00:04:44.159> I<00:04:44.340> switch<00:04:44.669> all

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
in the zero position before I switch all

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.070 
in the zero position before I switch all
and<00:04:45.000> then<00:04:45.090> you<00:04:45.150> don't<00:04:45.330> get<00:04:45.449> that<00:04:45.569> sudden<00:04:45.900> power

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
and then you don't get that sudden power

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.950 
and then you don't get that sudden power
surge<00:04:46.439> so<00:04:47.159> I've<00:04:47.520> got<00:04:47.699> to<00:04:47.819> do<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.300> adjustment<00:04:48.810> on

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
surge so I've got to do it adjustment on

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.469 
surge so I've got to do it adjustment on
that<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.789> thought<00:04:50.789> perhaps<00:04:50.969> it<00:04:51.240> was<00:04:51.360> the

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
that I thought perhaps it was the

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.379 
that I thought perhaps it was the
cartridge<00:04:52.080> connections<00:04:52.650> at<00:04:52.800> first<00:04:53.159> but<00:04:54.000> it

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
cartridge connections at first but it

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.899 
cartridge connections at first but it
missed<00:04:54.870> I<00:04:55.110> may<00:04:55.409> just<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:56.159> fiddle<00:04:56.520> around<00:04:56.580> and

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:56.909 
missed I may just to fiddle around and

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.980 
missed I may just to fiddle around and
work<00:04:57.090> out<00:04:57.360> where<00:04:57.599> the<00:04:57.629> noise<00:04:57.990> was<00:04:58.050> coming<00:04:58.289> from

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
work out where the noise was coming from

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.749 
work out where the noise was coming from
on<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.050> basis<00:05:01.710> so<00:05:01.860> there's<00:05:02.039> those<00:05:02.219> to<00:05:02.460> do<00:05:02.639> as

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 
on that basis so there's those to do as

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:03.170 
on that basis so there's those to do as
well

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
well

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.869 
well
and<00:05:03.469> on<00:05:04.469> that<00:05:04.680> one<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:05.069> I've<00:05:05.129> got<00:05:05.279> a<00:05:05.310> new<00:05:05.550> belt

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
it's a very small belt this is quite a

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.550 
it's a very small belt this is quite a
tight<00:05:11.279> fit<00:05:11.639> but<00:05:12.599> it's<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:12.870> right<00:05:13.050> one<00:05:13.349> but

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
tight fit but it's the right one but

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.290

it's quite a tight fit I used the one

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.320 
it's quite a tight fit I used the one
from<00:05:15.599> a<00:05:15.870> spare<00:05:16.529> one<00:05:16.770> which<00:05:17.669> was<00:05:17.849> fairly<00:05:18.060> worn

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
from a spare one which was fairly worn

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.879 
from a spare one which was fairly worn
out<00:05:18.539> and<00:05:18.779> then<00:05:18.900> I've<00:05:18.990> bought<00:05:19.229> a<00:05:19.259> new<00:05:19.379> one<00:05:19.590> so

that's got to go on as well and as I say

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.110 
that's got to go on as well and as I say
I've<00:05:22.770> got<00:05:22.889> to<00:05:23.009> fit<00:05:23.159> the<00:05:23.250> new<00:05:23.400> stylus<00:05:23.879> at<00:05:24.029> the

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.839 
glass out that was actually no you can
see<00:05:33.449> that<00:05:33.569> no<00:05:33.750> diamond<00:05:34.259> tip<00:05:34.469> at<00:05:34.620> all

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
see that no diamond tip at all

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.800 
see that no diamond tip at all
completely<00:05:35.849> worn<00:05:36.060> down<00:05:36.270> and<00:05:36.479> wonder<00:05:36.659> they<00:05:36.779> say

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
completely worn down and wonder they say

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.409 
completely worn down and wonder they say
didn't<00:05:37.139> work<00:05:37.669> all<00:05:38.669> it<00:05:38.789> wanted<00:05:39.029> was<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.240> new

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
didn't work all it wanted was a new

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.829 
didn't work all it wanted was a new
diamond<00:05:40.020> tip<00:05:40.680> stylus<00:05:41.460> a<00:05:41.669> new<00:05:42.330> barrels<00:05:42.690> and<00:05:42.810> a
