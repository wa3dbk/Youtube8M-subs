the<00:00:00.599> spreading<00:00:01.020> of<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.439> masa<00:00:01.680> his<00:00:02.580> hard<00:00:02.939> work

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
the spreading of the masa his hard work

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.590 
the spreading of the masa his hard work
and<00:00:03.449> mastering<00:00:04.080> takes<00:00:04.380> many<00:00:04.620> years<00:00:05.600> because

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
and mastering takes many years because

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.009 
and mastering takes many years because
of<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:06.960> invented<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.830> tamale<00:00:08.220> spreader<00:00:08.670> and

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
of that I invented a tamale spreader and

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.660 
of that I invented a tamale spreader and
what<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.110> masa<00:00:10.320> spreader<00:00:10.679> has<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.160> has<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.309> flat

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
what the masa spreader has it has a flat

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.320 
what the masa spreader has it has a flat
bottom<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:13.320> has<00:00:13.380> two<00:00:13.769> tracks<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.370> side<00:00:14.639> and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
bottom it has two tracks on the side and

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.109 
bottom it has two tracks on the side and
it<00:00:15.570> has<00:00:15.599> angles<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.710> side<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.670> front<00:00:17.880> side

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
it has angles on the side the front side

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.929 
it has angles on the side the front side
and<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.449> back<00:00:18.480> side<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.260> thing<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.939> it's

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and the back side of this thing and it's

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.660 
and the back side of this thing and it's
easy<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.420> use<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:22.050> takes<00:00:22.260> just<00:00:22.500> one<00:00:22.590> stroke<00:00:23.100> to

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
easy to use it takes just one stroke to

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.029 
easy to use it takes just one stroke to
get<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.000> perfect<00:00:24.269> spread<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.810> masa<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.830> with

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
get that perfect spread of masa so with

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.439 
get that perfect spread of masa so with
the<00:00:26.130> front<00:00:26.369> edge<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.789> spreader<00:00:27.180> you'll

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
the front edge of the spreader you'll

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.779 
the front edge of the spreader you'll
pick<00:00:27.689> up<00:00:27.720> masa<00:00:28.220> enough<00:00:29.220> for<00:00:29.400> two<00:00:29.550> or<00:00:29.640> three

depending on the tamales that you're
making<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.240> spread<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.840> will<00:01:10.080> do

you

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.370 

I'll<00:01:15.120> know<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.870> most<00:01:16.050> time-consuming

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
I'll know that the most time-consuming

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.530 
I'll know that the most time-consuming
part<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.220> tamale<00:01:17.550> process<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
part of the tamale process is a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.530 
part of the tamale process is a
spreading<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.140> strokes<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.270> never

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
spreading of strokes and it really never

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.600 
spreading of strokes and it really never
comes<00:01:21.870> out<00:01:22.220> work<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.520> mathletes<00:01:24.360> many<00:01:24.630> years

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
comes out work and mathletes many years

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.670 
comes out work and mathletes many years
because<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.940> attracts<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> side<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
because of that attracts on the side and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.609 
because of that attracts on the side and
it<00:01:28.920> has<00:01:28.950> angles<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.940> the<00:01:30.060> side<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:31.020> one<00:01:31.260> stroke

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
it has angles on the side the one stroke

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.340 
it has angles on the side the one stroke
to<00:01:32.190> get<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.520> perfect<00:01:32.790> spread<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.300> masa<00:01:33.510> so

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
to get that perfect spread of masa so

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.560 
to get that perfect spread of masa so
