00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.570
 on my hands until chicanchi on on land and 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.429
 So 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:10.869
 to london 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:12.639
 school criticized 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.019
 but I am to the last 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.909
 liquidated which was in the capital 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.150
 signed this loan 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.869
 and others which are under water 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.619
 seemed to agree 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.619
 opening the very beginning on the tables 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.200
 and the fact that the sources of a succession of substitutions 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.200
 lost to the Germans 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.800
 nine people

 Asian gruel 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.430
 m.a 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.410
 but also the bag 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.190
 i.e. unintentional subsistence 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.920
 the minimum 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.430
 the channel can also be worth considering 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.170
 what is the time 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.830
 but that's what happened and now 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.120
 second year 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.130
 Further 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.130
 the sixth position in this question which year 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.930
 according to Yushchenko 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.930
 he was very honest m 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.130
 we go further shishkov that he just 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.620
 but the power of the Far East 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.890
 all changes least 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.150
 note that the rabbit 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
 chubirko days sixth 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.820
 a little bit less than one and a half microns 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.820
 shortage border 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.990
 and by 2020 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.230
 shore in the past 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.620
 here is pluton 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.320
