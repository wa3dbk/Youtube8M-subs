00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:08.149
 2 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.490
 the ift actually identifies the new ones 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.280
 trains technologies how they 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.830
 will impact business and society 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.690
 and we do that in es4 accents so if 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.570
 we get technology business economics 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.239
 future digital arts and then education 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.430
 and by working we developed 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.780
 projects we develop events in 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.430
 these four axes and in fact what we 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.570
 trying to do is decompartmentalize all 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.720
 these areas so that people can 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.100
 to find each other and it's in this mix of 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.470
 innovation is actually and it's this 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.760
 side there really to be active who 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.229
 maybe was not easy to understand 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.280
 for some people did not understand 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.259
 not why as a director 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.430
 marketing of a big multinational 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.630
 what would they have found 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.750
 interesting to mix with a 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.100
 designer or a developer is actually 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.540
 today I believe that everyone 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.369
 recognizes that it is precisely in this 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.560
 mix in this decompartmentalization that that 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.450
 things are done and happening and in 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.860
 the new things we did was we 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.930
 makes a book in Basel 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.330
 lifetime what is really focused on 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.460
 industry and the 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.960
 lifesize book under the dome is a 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.270
 new initiative we announced 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.580
 jointly with balance sheet partners 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.350
 and the network the idea is that the 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.659
 deputies to the officials are not 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.510
 always aware of the challenges 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.740
 that meets and entrepreneurs is 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.990
 in fact the actors of the ecosystem 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.659
 start up and so the idea is a little 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.610
 little milk to sensitize them to these 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.409
 challenges by organizing a series of workshops 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.630
 during parliamentary sessions with 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.250
 sysmex san francisco and the city of 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.360
 Geneva is the city of San Francisco 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.520
 has developed a project called 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.369
 urban state challenge the idea it was 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.770
 to look at the transport data 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.390
 public in these two cities is actually 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.030
 possible jury forgiveness so geneva zurich 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.320
 san francisco and then think of 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.590
 do a visualization job of 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.600
 data 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.980
 it's an international chip whose 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.079
 purpose was to make people think 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.630
 on the city what impact transport 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.340
 public had on the city and 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.480
 reflect on the city of tomorrow you 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.010
 rather someone who is in the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.409
 movement and 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.180
 my journey taking because of my 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.400
 Growing up in Geneva 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.079
 i lived in hong kong i work in 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.159
 Bangkok at the site in Shanghai after at 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.220
 london before returning to geneva 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.860
 but beyond that it's because I 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.140
 think especially that we can not fall asleep 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.579
 on a business model because we 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.489
 must remain mobile because the world 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.049
 change our partners change their 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.640
 needs change and so we must be able to 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.030
 always be mobile and able to answer 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.290
 new to the changing environment 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.209
 more and more it's someone who has me 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.769
 a lot inspired jackman I really 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.790
 learned from him and that all we can 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.310
 do everything we need to do we will 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.430
 do according to people concert a 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.599
 from customers to partners and so 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.239
 this dimension of bringing value 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.500
 so added every project every thing 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.260
 what are we going to do is what is the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.319
 added value that we will bring to us 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.659
 our users us participants lift 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.750
 differs from others 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.400
 events and conferences in general of 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.659
 part of his audience that is to say that it does not 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.540
 makes it speaks to the audience very 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:30.629
 mixed is what is called this magic 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.129
 sauce is the mixture of 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.560
 participants from sectors 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:37.410
 different from industry 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.720
 different and so it's this mixture of 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.090
 these people who are doing that deliver to a 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.090
 to a specificity
