supplying a high percentage of whole
grains<00:00:52.900> I<00:00:53.880> think<00:00:54.880> it's<00:00:55.000> best<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.330> start<00:00:55.570> this

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
first of a three-stage process the first

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.800 
first of a three-stage process the first
step<00:01:00.070> is<00:01:00.190> super<00:01:00.460> easy<00:01:00.490> we<00:01:01.330> start<00:01:01.600> with<00:01:01.720> about

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
step is super easy we start with about

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.340 
step is super easy we start with about
two<00:01:02.140> cups<00:01:02.170> of<00:01:02.560> whole<00:01:02.740> wheat<00:01:02.800> flour<00:01:03.310> and<00:01:04.110> mix<00:01:05.110> in

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
two cups of whole wheat flour and mix in

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.320 
two cups of whole wheat flour and mix in
seven<00:01:05.740> ounces<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.189> water<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:06.700> 1/2<00:01:06.790> cup<00:01:07.210> of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
seven ounces of water and 1/2 cup of

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.500 
seven ounces of water and 1/2 cup of
sourdough<00:01:07.750> starter<00:01:08.230> I<00:01:08.910> like<00:01:09.910> to<00:01:10.000> dissolve<00:01:10.360> the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
sourdough starter I like to dissolve the

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.840 
sourdough starter I like to dissolve the
starter<00:01:10.870> in<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.080> water<00:01:11.320> first<00:01:14.640> before<00:01:15.640> mixing

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
starter in the water first before mixing

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.250 
starter in the water first before mixing
them<00:01:16.060> both<00:01:16.240> together<00:01:16.450> into<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.870> whole<00:01:17.020> wheat

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
them both together into the whole wheat

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.170 
them both together into the whole wheat
it's<00:01:17.920> just<00:01:18.100> easier<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:18.550> incorporate<00:01:18.700> the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
it's just easier to incorporate the

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.470 
it's just easier to incorporate the
ingredients<00:01:19.690> this<00:01:19.810> way<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.970> takes<00:01:22.210> about<00:01:22.330> a

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
ingredients this way it takes about a

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.510 
ingredients this way it takes about a
minute<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:23.110> stirring<00:01:23.800> the<00:01:23.890> starter<00:01:24.250> into<00:01:24.430> the

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
minute of stirring the starter into the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.720 
minute of stirring the starter into the
water<00:01:24.730> before<00:01:24.940> it's<00:01:25.300> fully<00:01:25.810> dissolved<00:01:26.730> but

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
water before it's fully dissolved but

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.760 
water before it's fully dissolved but
then<00:01:27.850> it's<00:01:27.970> really<00:01:28.450> easy<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:28.990> mix<00:01:29.200> in<00:01:29.380> with<00:01:29.409> the

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
then it's really easy to mix in with the

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.680 
then it's really easy to mix in with the
whole<00:01:30.220> wheat<00:01:30.460> flour<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:37.030> everything<00:01:37.240> to

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
whole wheat flour and get everything to

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:50.250 
whole wheat flour and get everything to
incorporate<00:01:38.290> well<00:01:38.500> together

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.390 

okay<00:01:51.260> that's<00:01:51.470> all<00:01:51.590> there<00:01:51.770> is<00:01:51.830> to<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:52.190> for<00:01:52.340> the

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
okay that's all there is to it for the

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.660 
okay that's all there is to it for the
first<00:01:52.430> step<00:01:53.830> now<00:01:54.830> all<00:01:54.950> we're<00:01:55.070> going<00:01:55.160> to<00:01:55.220> do<00:01:55.430> is

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
first step now all we're going to do is

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.310 
first step now all we're going to do is
cover<00:01:56.210> it<00:01:56.360> with<00:01:56.480> plastic<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:59.420> let<00:01:59.810> it<00:01:59.900> sit<00:02:00.200> out

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
next step

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.680 
next step
so<00:02:09.709> let's<00:02:09.920> see<00:02:10.070> what<00:02:10.190> we<00:02:10.280> have<00:02:10.310> here<00:02:13.570> what<00:02:14.570> we

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
so let's see what we have here what we

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.910 
so let's see what we have here what we
have<00:02:14.720> here<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.200> basically<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.650> whole-wheat

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
have here is basically a whole-wheat

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.820 
have here is basically a whole-wheat
starter<00:02:17.020> which<00:02:18.020> we're<00:02:18.170> going<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.350> transfer<00:02:18.800> to

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
starter which we're going to transfer to

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.940 
starter which we're going to transfer to
a<00:02:19.010> larger<00:02:19.459> bowl<00:02:22.959> this<00:02:23.959> will<00:02:24.140> add<00:02:24.290> more<00:02:24.500> water

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
a larger bowl this will add more water

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.130 
a larger bowl this will add more water
flour<00:02:25.400> salt<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.239> then<00:02:26.480> knead<00:02:26.690> for<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.930> while

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
flour salt and then knead for a while

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.160 
flour salt and then knead for a while
I'll<00:02:27.620> start<00:02:28.040> with<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.220> water

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
I'll start with the water

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.170 
I'll start with the water
274<00:02:30.170> grams<00:02:30.560> which<00:02:31.340> works<00:02:31.550> out<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.850> about<00:02:31.910> one

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
274 grams which works out to about one

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.260 
274 grams which works out to about one
and<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.360> quarter<00:02:32.540> cups<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.760> I'll<00:02:37.880> just<00:02:38.030> mix

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
and a quarter cups and I'll just mix

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.470 
and a quarter cups and I'll just mix
that<00:02:38.330> up<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.660> bit<00:02:39.520> then<00:02:40.520> I'll<00:02:40.640> start<00:02:41.000> adding<00:02:41.239> the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
that up a bit then I'll start adding the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.120 
that up a bit then I'll start adding the
various<00:02:41.840> flowers<00:02:45.640> 170<00:02:46.640> grams<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.239> spelt<00:02:47.690> flour

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
various flowers 170 grams of spelt flour

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.940 
various flowers 170 grams of spelt flour
which<00:02:49.130> is<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.280> kind<00:02:49.519> of<00:02:49.670> wheat<00:02:50.709> 170<00:02:51.709> grams

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
which is a kind of wheat 170 grams

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.430 
which is a kind of wheat 170 grams
translates<00:02:52.549> into<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:52.850> little<00:02:53.150> over<00:02:53.360> 1<00:02:53.660> in<00:02:53.810> 3/4

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
translates into a little over 1 in 3/4

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:03.490 
translates into a little over 1 in 3/4
cups<00:03:00.220> 85<00:03:01.220> grams<00:03:01.610> of<00:03:02.060> rye<00:03:02.570> flour<00:03:02.600> which<00:03:03.350> is<00:03:03.470> a

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
cups 85 grams of rye flour which is a

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:14.539 
cups 85 grams of rye flour which is a
little<00:03:03.799> less<00:03:03.950> than<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.190> cup

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.949 

now<00:03:15.549> this<00:03:15.700> is<00:03:15.790> where<00:03:15.940> I<00:03:15.970> add<00:03:16.150> in<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.299> salt<00:03:16.629> when

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
now this is where I add in the salt when

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.449 
now this is where I add in the salt when
it's<00:03:17.080> still<00:03:17.290> easy<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.680> mix<00:03:17.950> into<00:03:18.129> the<00:03:18.190> dough

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
it's still easy to mix into the dough

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.500 
it's still easy to mix into the dough
this<00:03:19.450> is<00:03:19.510> 13<00:03:20.500> grams<00:03:20.799> of<00:03:21.099> salt<00:03:21.430> which<00:03:22.299> is<00:03:22.330> a

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
this is 13 grams of salt which is a

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.990 
this is 13 grams of salt which is a
little<00:03:22.810> less<00:03:22.959> than<00:03:23.140> a<00:03:23.230> tablespoon<00:03:23.849> which<00:03:24.849> I

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
little less than a tablespoon which I

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.400 
little less than a tablespoon which I
guess<00:03:25.150> you'd<00:03:25.330> call<00:03:25.360> a<00:03:25.569> scant<00:03:26.080> tablespoon<00:03:28.410> okay

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
guess you'd call a scant tablespoon okay

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.009 
guess you'd call a scant tablespoon okay
and<00:03:29.620> then<00:03:29.860> finally<00:03:30.069> 250<00:03:31.060> grams<00:03:31.360> are<00:03:31.629> about<00:03:31.810> 2

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
and then finally 250 grams are about 2

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.680 
and then finally 250 grams are about 2
cups<00:03:32.349> of<00:03:32.620> unbleached<00:03:33.450> embroidered<00:03:34.450> bread

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
cups of unbleached embroidered bread

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.380 
cups of unbleached embroidered bread
flour<00:03:34.959> or<00:03:35.349> all-purpose<00:03:36.190> flour<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.879> I'm<00:03:37.209> going

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
flour or all-purpose flour and I'm going

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.910 
flour or all-purpose flour and I'm going
to<00:03:37.420> hold<00:03:37.660> back<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.870> little<00:03:37.989> of<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.410> white<00:03:38.590> flour

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
to hold back a little of the white flour

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:47.009 
to hold back a little of the white flour
for<00:03:39.849> kneading<00:03:40.209> purposes<00:03:45.540> now<00:03:46.540> when<00:03:46.660> you<00:03:46.750> start

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
for kneading purposes now when you start

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.839 
for kneading purposes now when you start
adding<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.500> white<00:03:47.650> flour<00:03:48.010> it<00:03:48.250> doesn't<00:03:48.700> take

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
adding a white flour it doesn't take

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.349 
adding a white flour it doesn't take
long<00:03:49.090> before<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:50.560> dough<00:03:50.739> starts<00:03:51.069> to<00:03:51.190> get

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
long before the dough starts to get

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.110 
long before the dough starts to get
pretty<00:03:52.359> stiff<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:53.109> at<00:03:54.099> some<00:03:54.670> point<00:03:54.910> it's<00:03:55.060> a

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
pretty stiff and at some point it's a

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.369 
pretty stiff and at some point it's a
little<00:03:55.150> too<00:03:55.450> stiff<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.780> really<00:03:56.200> work

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
little too stiff to really work

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.440 
little too stiff to really work
effectively<00:03:56.920> with<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.280> dough<00:03:57.489> whisk<00:03:57.760> and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
effectively with the dough whisk and

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.640 
effectively with the dough whisk and
that's<00:03:58.660> when<00:03:58.780> you<00:03:58.870> want<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.049> start<00:03:59.319> using<00:03:59.440> your

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
that's when you want to start using your

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.860 
that's when you want to start using your
hands<00:04:00.099> or<00:04:00.250> turn<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.790> out<00:04:00.910> onto<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.209> counter<00:04:01.569> to

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
hands or turn it out onto the counter to

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:10.199 
hands or turn it out onto the counter to
knead<00:04:02.170> by<00:04:02.349> hand<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:09.280> it's<00:04:09.459> starting<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.090> get<00:04:10.150> to

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
knead by hand so it's starting to get to

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.180 
knead by hand so it's starting to get to
that<00:04:10.359> point<00:04:10.690> where<00:04:10.900> it<00:04:11.079> really<00:04:11.560> can't<00:04:11.859> to

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
that point where it really can't to

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.789 
that point where it really can't to
knead<00:04:12.489> it<00:04:12.579> very<00:04:12.790> easily<00:04:13.030> with<00:04:13.269> the<00:04:13.569> whisk<00:04:13.799> so

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
knead it very easily with the whisk so

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.360 
knead it very easily with the whisk so
I'm<00:04:15.099> going<00:04:15.250> to<00:04:15.280> start<00:04:15.519> using<00:04:15.669> my<00:04:15.940> hands<00:04:16.450> here

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
I'm going to start using my hands here

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.730 
I'm going to start using my hands here
which<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.579> me<00:04:18.729> is<00:04:18.849> the<00:04:18.970> fun<00:04:19.209> part<00:04:19.239> anyway<00:04:22.740> now

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
which to me is the fun part anyway now

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.680 
which to me is the fun part anyway now
some<00:04:24.010> people<00:04:24.130> prefer<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.639> just<00:04:25.000> do<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.450> entire

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
some people prefer to just do the entire

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.080 
some people prefer to just do the entire
kneading<00:04:26.169> within<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.560> bowl<00:04:26.770> but<00:04:27.729> I<00:04:27.849> like<00:04:28.000> to

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
kneading within the bowl but I like to

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.060 
kneading within the bowl but I like to
turn<00:04:28.210> it<00:04:28.360> out<00:04:28.419> on<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.599> counter<00:04:28.800> there's<00:04:29.800> like

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
turn it out on the counter there's like

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.760 
turn it out on the counter there's like
everything<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:30.639> baking<00:04:30.970> there's<00:04:31.560> scads<00:04:32.560> of

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
everything and baking there's scads of

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.089 
everything and baking there's scads of
ways<00:04:33.039> of<00:04:33.310> doing<00:04:33.580> everything<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.960> they're<00:04:35.950> all

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
ways of doing everything and they're all

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.070 
ways of doing everything and they're all
right<00:04:36.599> it's<00:04:37.599> just<00:04:37.780> a<00:04:38.020> personal<00:04:38.530> preference

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
right it's just a personal preference

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.260 
right it's just a personal preference
okay<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:42.010> we're<00:04:42.130> pretty<00:04:42.250> much<00:04:42.370> done<00:04:43.060> with<00:04:43.120> a

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
okay so we're pretty much done with a

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.050 
okay so we're pretty much done with a
bowl<00:04:43.770> I'm<00:04:44.770> just<00:04:45.010> going<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.160> lightly<00:04:45.430> flour<00:04:45.729> the

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
bowl I'm just going to lightly flour the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.740 
bowl I'm just going to lightly flour the
counter<00:04:51.030> okay<00:04:52.030> I'm<00:04:52.150> going<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.330> knead<00:04:52.539> for

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
counter okay I'm going to knead for

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.020 
counter okay I'm going to knead for
about<00:04:52.919> 10<00:04:53.919> to<00:04:54.039> 12<00:04:54.250> minutes<00:04:54.610> and<00:04:54.789> I'm<00:04:54.880> actually

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
about 10 to 12 minutes and I'm actually

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.879 
about 10 to 12 minutes and I'm actually
going<00:04:55.270> to<00:04:55.330> use<00:04:55.479> a<00:04:55.510> timer<00:04:55.870> just<00:04:56.620> so<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:56.830> don't

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
going to use a timer just so I don't

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.710 
going to use a timer just so I don't
accidentally<00:04:57.430> spend<00:04:58.240> all<00:04:58.360> morning<00:04:58.539> doing<00:04:58.960> it

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
accidentally spend all morning doing it

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.210 
accidentally spend all morning doing it
we've<00:05:01.720> got<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:01.990> little<00:05:02.229> extra<00:05:02.620> flour<00:05:02.830> to<00:05:03.070> work

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
we've got a little extra flour to work

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.700 
we've got a little extra flour to work
with<00:05:03.460> so<00:05:03.700> we're<00:05:03.849> going<00:05:03.940> to<00:05:04.000> use<00:05:04.210> that

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
with so we're going to use that

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.540 
with so we're going to use that
generously<00:05:05.710> to<00:05:05.950> keep<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.250> dough<00:05:06.400> from

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
generously to keep the dough from

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:15.189 
generously to keep the dough from
sticking<00:05:06.760> too<00:05:07.180> much

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.689 

now<00:05:16.199> the<00:05:16.710> thing<00:05:16.860> about<00:05:16.889> kneading<00:05:17.460> is<00:05:17.580> you

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
now the thing about kneading is you

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.490 
now the thing about kneading is you
really<00:05:17.880> don't<00:05:18.120> have<00:05:18.419> to<00:05:18.690> work<00:05:18.990> at<00:05:19.169> it<00:05:19.199> very

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
really don't have to work at it very

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.020 
really don't have to work at it very
hard<00:05:19.800> you<00:05:20.039> just<00:05:20.099> use<00:05:20.370> your<00:05:20.400> body<00:05:20.729> weight<00:05:21.000> and

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
hard you just use your body weight and

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.360 
hard you just use your body weight and
kind<00:05:21.300> of<00:05:21.360> lean<00:05:21.539> into<00:05:21.569> it

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
kind of lean into it

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.409 
kind of lean into it
of<00:05:23.370> course<00:05:23.580> how<00:05:23.699> much<00:05:23.819> you<00:05:23.970> have<00:05:24.120> to<00:05:24.240> lean

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
of course how much you have to lean

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.439 
of course how much you have to lean
depends<00:05:24.750> on<00:05:24.900> how<00:05:24.990> stiff<00:05:25.319> the<00:05:25.500> dough<00:05:25.680> is<00:05:26.449> but

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
depends on how stiff the dough is but

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.420 
depends on how stiff the dough is but
this<00:05:27.599> is<00:05:27.750> a<00:05:27.780> this<00:05:28.620> is<00:05:28.680> a<00:05:28.770> pretty<00:05:28.949> medium

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
this is a this is a pretty medium

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.330 
this is a this is a pretty medium
stiffness<00:05:29.819> dough<00:05:30.240> it's<00:05:30.479> pretty<00:05:30.690> easy<00:05:30.870> to<00:05:31.080> work

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
stiffness dough it's pretty easy to work

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.770 
stiffness dough it's pretty easy to work
so<00:05:32.340> it<00:05:32.699> doesn't<00:05:32.970> really<00:05:33.030> take<00:05:33.360> much<00:05:33.539> effort

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
so it doesn't really take much effort

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.100 
so it doesn't really take much effort
all<00:05:34.110> I'm<00:05:34.259> doing<00:05:34.590> is<00:05:34.940> turning<00:05:35.940> it<00:05:36.180> a<00:05:36.300> half<00:05:36.960> a

all I'm doing is turning it a half a

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.219 
all I'm doing is turning it a half a

what you're going to end up with

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:53.719 
what you're going to end up with
ultimately<00:05:52.650> after<00:05:52.979> about<00:05:53.099> 10<00:05:53.400> minutes<00:05:53.430> of

this<00:05:53.880> is<00:05:54.090> a<00:05:54.120> nice<00:05:54.680> silky<00:05:55.680> smooth<00:05:56.039> dough<00:06:01.669> on

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
this is a nice silky smooth dough on

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.210 
this is a nice silky smooth dough on
this<00:06:02.819> particular<00:06:03.150> dough<00:06:03.539> is<00:06:03.750> going<00:06:03.870> to<00:06:03.990> be<00:06:04.229> a

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
this particular dough is going to be a

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:11.420 
this particular dough is going to be a
little<00:06:05.759> bit<00:06:05.880> tacky<00:06:06.150> but<00:06:06.900> not<00:06:07.110> real<00:06:07.319> sticky<00:06:10.430> so

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
little bit tacky but not real sticky so

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.050 
little bit tacky but not real sticky so
it<00:06:11.580> will<00:06:12.650> want<00:06:13.650> to<00:06:13.770> stick<00:06:14.039> to<00:06:14.190> your<00:06:14.280> hands<00:06:14.789> and

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
it will want to stick to your hands and

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.120 
it will want to stick to your hands and
there's<00:06:15.479> really<00:06:15.870> hardly<00:06:16.320> any<00:06:16.440> way<00:06:16.590> around<00:06:16.919> it

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
there's really hardly any way around it

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.959 
there's really hardly any way around it
you<00:06:17.280> just<00:06:17.490> keep<00:06:18.180> them<00:06:18.330> floured<00:06:18.780> and<00:06:19.969> don't

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
you just keep them floured and don't

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:25.219 
you just keep them floured and don't
worry<00:06:21.120> about<00:06:21.210> it<00:06:21.509> too<00:06:21.630> much<00:06:23.539> okay<00:06:24.539> after<00:06:24.690> 10<00:06:25.110> to

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
worry about it too much okay after 10 to

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:26.570 
worry about it too much okay after 10 to
12<00:06:25.469> minutes<00:06:25.740> of<00:06:25.830> kneading<00:06:26.009> the<00:06:26.280> dough<00:06:26.310> is

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
12 minutes of kneading the dough is

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.129 
12 minutes of kneading the dough is
ready<00:06:26.759> to<00:06:26.880> go<00:06:27.000> into<00:06:27.120> the<00:06:27.180> refrigerator<00:06:27.539> for<00:06:28.050> a

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
ready to go into the refrigerator for a

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:30.770 
ready to go into the refrigerator for a
long<00:06:28.349> slow<00:06:28.710> fermentation<00:06:29.009> period<00:06:29.909> now<00:06:30.659> when

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
long slow fermentation period now when

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.260 
long slow fermentation period now when
you're<00:06:30.900> done<00:06:31.050> kneading<00:06:31.500> it's<00:06:31.979> not<00:06:32.270> hugely

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
you're done kneading it's not hugely

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.640 
you're done kneading it's not hugely
different<00:06:33.690> than<00:06:33.780> when<00:06:33.900> you<00:06:34.020> started<00:06:34.050> but

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
different than when you started but

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.680 
different than when you started but
there's<00:06:34.800> a<00:06:34.860> little<00:06:35.039> bit<00:06:35.159> more<00:06:35.190> elasticity<00:06:36.180> to

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
there's a little bit more elasticity to

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.659 
there's a little bit more elasticity to
the<00:06:36.719> dough<00:06:36.990> and<00:06:37.620> it<00:06:37.979> should<00:06:38.219> be<00:06:38.400> as<00:06:38.550> I

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
the dough and it should be as I

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.089 
the dough and it should be as I
mentioned<00:06:38.699> tacky<00:06:39.690> but<00:06:39.930> not<00:06:40.110> sticky<00:06:40.560> and<00:06:40.740> I

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:41.099 
mentioned tacky but not sticky and I

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.189 
mentioned tacky but not sticky and I
think<00:06:41.370> you<00:06:41.490> can<00:06:41.639> see<00:06:41.880> that<00:06:41.909> if<00:06:42.630> i<00:06:42.780> zoom<00:06:42.810> in<00:06:43.139> a

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 
think you can see that if i zoom in a

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.290 
think you can see that if i zoom in a
little<00:06:43.319> bit<00:06:43.440> and<00:06:43.770> depress<00:06:44.669> my<00:06:44.849> hand<00:06:45.090> into<00:06:45.270> the

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
little bit and depress my hand into the

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.570 
little bit and depress my hand into the
dough<00:06:45.479> and<00:06:45.719> lift<00:06:46.020> up<00:06:46.259> it<00:06:46.919> kind<00:06:47.219> of<00:06:47.310> wants<00:06:47.520> to

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
dough and lift up it kind of wants to

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.659 
dough and lift up it kind of wants to
stick<00:06:47.969> to<00:06:48.150> it<00:06:48.270> a<00:06:48.330> little<00:06:48.449> bit<00:06:48.569> it's<00:06:49.319> tacky<00:06:49.680> but

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
stick to it a little bit it's tacky but

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.159 
stick to it a little bit it's tacky but
it<00:06:50.729> doesn't<00:06:50.969> really<00:06:51.120> stick<00:06:51.509> to<00:06:51.690> it<00:06:51.810> so<00:06:51.960> it's

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169 
it doesn't really stick to it so it's

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:59.950 
it doesn't really stick to it so it's
not<00:06:52.319> sticky<00:06:52.949> so<00:06:55.580> what<00:06:56.580> I'm<00:06:56.639> going<00:06:56.759> to<00:06:56.789> do<00:06:56.969> is

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.170 

take<00:07:00.960> that<00:07:00.990> same<00:07:01.169> large<00:07:02.009> mixing<00:07:02.699> bowl<00:07:02.759> that<00:07:03.090> we

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
take that same large mixing bowl that we

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.580 
take that same large mixing bowl that we
started<00:07:03.509> with<00:07:03.630> only<00:07:04.020> I've<00:07:04.110> cleaned<00:07:04.380> it<00:07:04.440> out

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
started with only I've cleaned it out

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.740 
started with only I've cleaned it out
and<00:07:04.860> I'm<00:07:05.430> going<00:07:05.580> to<00:07:05.610> mist<00:07:06.120> it<00:07:06.300> real<00:07:06.539> lightly

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750 
and I'm going to mist it real lightly

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.089 
and I'm going to mist it real lightly
with<00:07:07.020> a<00:07:07.050> spray<00:07:07.979> of<00:07:08.130> olive<00:07:08.940> oil<00:07:09.830> any<00:07:10.830> kind<00:07:11.069> of

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:11.099 
with a spray of olive oil any kind of

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:14.620 
with a spray of olive oil any kind of
cooking<00:07:11.400> oil<00:07:11.430> probably<00:07:12.000> pretty<00:07:12.180> much<00:07:12.419> do<00:07:12.840> and

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:14.630 
cooking oil probably pretty much do and

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.600 
cooking oil probably pretty much do and
put<00:07:15.630> the<00:07:15.719> dough<00:07:15.900> inside<00:07:16.289> and<00:07:16.590> turn<00:07:17.460> it<00:07:17.580> a

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
put the dough inside and turn it a

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.689 
put the dough inside and turn it a
little<00:07:17.639> bit<00:07:17.849> to<00:07:18.060> coat<00:07:18.270> it<00:07:18.680> and<00:07:19.680> that's<00:07:20.370> just<00:07:20.460> so

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 
little bit to coat it and that's just so

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:22.159 
little bit to coat it and that's just so
it's<00:07:20.940> easy<00:07:21.120> to<00:07:21.240> get<00:07:21.360> out<00:07:21.479> the<00:07:21.599> next<00:07:21.719> morning

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:22.169

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:23.910 
it's easy to get out the next morning
this<00:07:22.380> is<00:07:22.560> an<00:07:22.680> optional<00:07:23.099> step<00:07:23.400> but

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:23.920 
this is an optional step but

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.190 
this is an optional step but
I<00:07:24.010> always<00:07:24.310> do<00:07:24.580> this<00:07:24.780> and<00:07:25.780> I'm<00:07:25.930> going<00:07:26.020> to<00:07:26.110> give

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:26.200 
I always do this and I'm going to give

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.380 
I always do this and I'm going to give
it<00:07:26.320> one<00:07:26.560> more<00:07:26.860> little<00:07:27.100> hit<00:07:27.250> on<00:07:27.280> top<00:07:27.640> because

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:28.390 
it one more little hit on top because

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.630 
it one more little hit on top because
I'm<00:07:28.570> going<00:07:28.720> to<00:07:28.780> cover<00:07:28.930> it<00:07:29.050> with<00:07:29.140> plastic<00:07:29.640> and

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:30.640 
I'm going to cover it with plastic and

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.880 
I'm going to cover it with plastic and
it's<00:07:30.910> going<00:07:31.060> to<00:07:31.120> rise<00:07:31.360> take<00:07:32.290> a<00:07:32.320> good<00:07:32.530> look<00:07:32.710> at

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:32.890 
it's going to rise take a good look at

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.820 
it's going to rise take a good look at
how<00:07:33.040> much<00:07:33.430> of<00:07:33.580> the<00:07:33.670> bowl<00:07:33.910> this<00:07:34.240> fills<00:07:34.600> it's<00:07:35.560> a

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830 
how much of the bowl this fills it's a

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.490 
how much of the bowl this fills it's a
it's<00:07:36.190> maybe<00:07:36.430> oh<00:07:36.730> I<00:07:37.540> don't<00:07:37.750> know<00:07:37.900> one<00:07:38.140> quarter

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:38.500 
it's maybe oh I don't know one quarter

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.080 
it's maybe oh I don't know one quarter
one<00:07:38.530> third<00:07:39.010> of<00:07:39.160> the<00:07:39.250> bowl<00:07:39.430> volume<00:07:39.820> is<00:07:39.970> the

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.090 
one third of the bowl volume is the

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.900 
one third of the bowl volume is the
dough<00:07:40.830> but<00:07:41.830> there's<00:07:42.280> a<00:07:42.340> good<00:07:42.430> chance<00:07:42.490> it<00:07:42.850> will

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:42.910 
dough but there's a good chance it will

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.700 
dough but there's a good chance it will
rise<00:07:43.120> up<00:07:43.360> to<00:07:43.450> the<00:07:43.510> top<00:07:43.570> and<00:07:44.110> we<00:07:44.350> don't<00:07:44.530> want<00:07:44.650> it

to<00:07:44.800> stick<00:07:45.040> to<00:07:45.070> the<00:07:45.160> plastic<00:07:45.460> too<00:07:45.820> much<00:07:46.530> so<00:07:47.530> now

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:47.710 
to stick to the plastic too much so now

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.290 
to stick to the plastic too much so now
I'm<00:07:48.340> just<00:07:48.520> going<00:07:48.670> to<00:07:48.730> place<00:07:49.000> it<00:07:49.150> in<00:07:49.240> the
