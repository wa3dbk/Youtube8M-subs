00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
ground and comes back for me the next

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.360 
ground and comes back for me the next
spring<00:00:53.440> so<00:00:53.740> I<00:00:54.190> don't<00:00:55.030> do<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.480> I<00:00:55.990> just<00:00:56.620> do<00:00:57.130> little

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
spring so I don't do I I just do little

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.550 
spring so I don't do I I just do little
care<00:00:57.700> for<00:00:57.970> this<00:00:58.060> thing<00:00:58.360> so<00:00:58.780> I<00:00:58.810> know<00:00:59.020> that<00:00:59.440> the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
care for this thing so I know that the

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.040 
care for this thing so I know that the
seeds<00:00:59.890> do<00:01:00.220> develop<00:01:00.700> into<00:01:01.150> flower<00:01:01.420> bulbs<00:01:01.930> so

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
seeds do develop into flower bulbs so

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.380 
seeds do develop into flower bulbs so
you<00:01:02.110> can<00:01:02.380> always<00:01:02.620> scatter<00:01:03.520> the<00:01:03.790> seeds<00:01:04.030> and

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
you can always scatter the seeds and

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.840 
you can always scatter the seeds and
plant<00:01:04.720> them<00:01:04.960> back<00:01:04.989> in<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.500> ground<00:01:05.650> or<00:01:06.220> you<00:01:06.670> can

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
plant them back in the ground or you can

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.920 
plant them back in the ground or you can
even<00:01:06.970> leave<00:01:07.299> them<00:01:07.479> as<00:01:07.600> they<00:01:07.750> are

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
even leave them as they are

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.810 
even leave them as they are
over<00:01:08.259> the<00:01:08.380> winter<00:01:08.530> cuz<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.070> birds<00:01:09.280> love<00:01:09.579> them

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
over the winter cuz the birds love them

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.510 
over the winter cuz the birds love them
as<00:01:09.939> a<00:01:09.970> seed<00:01:10.299> you<00:01:10.509> know<00:01:10.780> food<00:01:11.049> source<00:01:11.409> but<00:01:12.369> I'm

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
as a seed you know food source but I'm

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.740 
as a seed you know food source but I'm
always<00:01:12.670> amazed<00:01:13.000> that<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.270> little<00:01:13.510> seeds

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
always amazed that the little seeds

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.080 
always amazed that the little seeds
develop<00:01:14.230> into<00:01:14.530> bulbs<00:01:14.980> and<00:01:15.310> then<00:01:15.460> they<00:01:15.610> develop

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
develop into bulbs and then they develop

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.170 
develop into bulbs and then they develop
into<00:01:16.390> a<00:01:16.420> big<00:01:16.659> plant<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:17.740> so<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.700> bulbs<00:01:19.060> are

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
into a big plant and so the bulbs are

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.760 
into a big plant and so the bulbs are
still<00:01:19.450> underneath<00:01:19.750> here<00:01:20.110> so<00:01:20.140> whether<00:01:20.560> you

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
still underneath here so whether you

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.230 
still underneath here so whether you
save<00:01:21.010> the<00:01:21.159> seeds<00:01:21.400> or<00:01:21.520> not<00:01:21.670> they're<00:01:21.850> gonna<00:01:21.940> come

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
save the seeds or not they're gonna come

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.570 
save the seeds or not they're gonna come
back<00:01:22.450> but<00:01:23.230> it's<00:01:23.500> true<00:01:23.800> too<00:01:24.010> whenever<00:01:24.370> they

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
back but it's true too whenever they

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.460 
back but it's true too whenever they
start<00:01:24.880> looking<00:01:25.060> really<00:01:25.540> ratty<00:01:25.870> like<00:01:26.229> they<00:01:26.350> are

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
start looking really ratty like they are

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.730 
start looking really ratty like they are
now<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:27.010> just<00:01:27.220> ride<00:01:27.400> trim<00:01:27.729> them<00:01:27.909> out<00:01:28.030> right<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
now I just ride trim them out right and

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.550 
now I just ride trim them out right and
I<00:01:30.280> still<00:01:31.180> like<00:01:31.360> to<00:01:31.390> plant<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:31.840> seeds<00:01:32.080> back<00:01:32.320> in

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
I still like to plant the seeds back in

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.140 
I still like to plant the seeds back in
because<00:01:32.740> it<00:01:32.920> might<00:01:33.070> take<00:01:33.280> up<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.580> seven<00:01:33.940> years

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
because it might take up to seven years

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.510 
because it might take up to seven years
to<00:01:34.300> get<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.479> bloom<00:01:34.570> off<00:01:34.990> of<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.290> seat<00:01:35.500> Wow<00:01:35.830> but

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
to get a bloom off of the seat Wow but

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.610 
to get a bloom off of the seat Wow but
even<00:01:37.030> if<00:01:37.180> you<00:01:37.570> take<00:01:37.780> them<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.200> just<00:01:38.380> kind<00:01:38.560> of

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
even if you take them and I just kind of

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.789 
even if you take them and I just kind of
leave<00:01:38.770> them<00:01:38.979> right<00:01:39.190> underneath<00:01:39.549> the<00:01:40.330> trees

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
leave them right underneath the trees

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.469 
leave them right underneath the trees
right<00:01:41.799> here<00:01:41.860> it<00:01:42.130> does<00:01:42.310> get<00:01:42.520> enough<00:01:42.760> Sun<00:01:43.030> so

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
right here it does get enough Sun so

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.750 
right here it does get enough Sun so
it's<00:01:43.659> not<00:01:43.780> too<00:01:44.049> shady<00:01:44.350> here<00:01:44.710> for<00:01:44.979> them<00:01:45.220> okay

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
it's not too shady here for them okay

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.210 
it's not too shady here for them okay
I'm<00:01:46.630> amazed<00:01:47.080> they'll<00:01:47.470> come<00:01:47.680> back<00:01:47.890> they<00:01:48.159> do

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
I'm amazed they'll come back they do

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.980 
I'm amazed they'll come back they do
really<00:01:48.490> well<00:01:48.610> in<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.000> northwest<00:01:49.450> apparently

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
really well in the northwest apparently

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.420 
really well in the northwest apparently
in<00:01:50.080> colder<00:01:50.409> climates<00:01:50.560> they<00:01:50.920> don't<00:01:51.100> make<00:01:51.280> it

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
in colder climates they don't make it

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.850 
in colder climates they don't make it
over<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.729> winter<00:01:51.760> okay<00:01:52.360> but<00:01:52.780> I<00:01:53.049> just<00:01:53.140> compost

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
over the winter okay but I just compost

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.340 
over the winter okay but I just compost
