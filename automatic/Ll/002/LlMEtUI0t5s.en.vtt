lot of people been waiting for the

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.260 
lot of people been waiting for the
Kinect<00:01:13.920> sensors<00:01:14.369> pretty<00:01:15.030> much<00:01:15.119> been

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
Kinect sensors pretty much been

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.950 
Kinect sensors pretty much been
Microsoft's<00:01:16.369> that's<00:01:17.369> really<00:01:17.729> kind<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.780> all

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
Microsoft's that's really kind of all

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.419 
Microsoft's that's really kind of all
they've<00:01:19.110> been<00:01:19.140> talking<00:01:19.380> about<00:01:19.710> recently<00:01:20.069> is

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
they've been talking about recently is

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.570 
they've been talking about recently is
connecting<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.509> house<00:01:22.259> near<00:01:22.530> brain<00:01:22.770> controller

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
connecting a house near brain controller

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.540 
connecting a house near brain controller
with<00:01:23.819> gaming<00:01:24.270> motion<00:01:24.720> based<00:01:24.929> gaming<00:01:25.399> into<00:01:26.399> our

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
with gaming motion based gaming into our

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.840 
with gaming motion based gaming into our
lives<00:01:27.050> so<00:01:28.050> there<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.679> Kinect<00:01:29.429> sensor

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
lives so there you see the Kinect sensor

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.370 
lives so there you see the Kinect sensor
in<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> box<00:01:31.490> handle<00:01:32.490> with<00:01:32.580> care<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.380> multiple

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
in the box handle with care in multiple

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.309 
in the box handle with care in multiple
languages<00:01:34.679> put<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.399> secure<00:01:35.729> surface<00:01:36.319> to

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
languages put on a secure surface to

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.510 
languages put on a secure surface to
pull<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.679> out<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.890> there<00:01:38.190> okay<00:01:40.520> it's

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
pull that out of there okay it's

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.870 
pull that out of there okay it's
attached<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.090> some<00:01:42.270> sort<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:43.039> wire<00:01:44.039> so<00:01:44.399> let's

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.559 

let's<00:01:47.880> get<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.149> out

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
let's get it out

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:54.199 
let's get it out
ok<00:01:49.470> got<00:01:50.190> it<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:51.330> lot<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.410> wiring<00:01:53.209> so

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
ok got it that is a lot of wiring so

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.869 
ok got it that is a lot of wiring so
there's<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.709> plug<00:01:55.709> actually<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.550> if<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.759> have

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:56.879 
there's a plug actually for if you have

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:59.839 
there's a plug actually for if you have
an<00:01:57.000> older<00:01:57.330> Xbox<00:01:57.720> 360<00:01:58.379> you're<00:01:59.190> gonna<00:01:59.340> need<00:01:59.550> to

00:01:59.839 --> 00:01:59.849 
an older Xbox 360 you're gonna need to

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:01.969 
an older Xbox 360 you're gonna need to
basically<00:02:00.690> plug<00:02:00.989> this<00:02:01.170> thing<00:02:01.229> into<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.679> wall

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
basically plug this thing into the wall

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.859 
basically plug this thing into the wall
but<00:02:02.879> if<00:02:02.970> you<00:02:03.060> have<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.269> of<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.420> newer<00:02:03.599> ones

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
but if you have one of the newer ones

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.229 
but if you have one of the newer ones
the<00:02:03.959> slim<00:02:04.289> model<00:02:04.470> you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.580> just<00:02:05.789> simply

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:06.239 
the slim model you can just simply

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:11.900 
the slim model you can just simply
remove<00:02:06.690> that<00:02:07.580> like<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:10.430> and<00:02:11.430> then<00:02:11.580> just<00:02:11.610> plug

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
remove that like so and then just plug

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.540 
remove that like so and then just plug
your<00:02:11.940> connect<00:02:12.830> directly<00:02:13.830> into<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.099> console

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
your connect directly into the console

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.100 
your connect directly into the console
you<00:02:15.150> won't<00:02:15.360> have<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.540> worry<00:02:15.690> about<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.900> power

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
you won't have to worry about a power

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.000 
you won't have to worry about a power
brick<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:18.090> that's<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.540> sensor<00:02:19.230> trying<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:19.950> see

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
brick so that's the sensor trying to see

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.900 
brick so that's the sensor trying to see
if<00:02:20.069> there's<00:02:20.190> anything<00:02:20.340> else<00:02:20.519> in<00:02:20.640> here<00:02:20.819> that

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
if there's anything else in here that

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.330 
if there's anything else in here that
you<00:02:21.030> want<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.209> pay<00:02:21.269> attention<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:22.610> see<00:02:23.610> oh

won't need to use that at all so let's
move<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.900> stuff<00:02:55.290> out<00:02:55.439> of<00:02:55.469> the<00:02:55.620> way<00:02:55.650> real

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
move that stuff out of the way real

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.130 
move that stuff out of the way real
quick<00:02:56.219> here

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
quick here

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.570 
quick here
and<00:02:57.230> just<00:02:57.380> take<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> look<00:02:57.770> at<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.160> sensor

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
and just take a look at the sensor

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.770 
and just take a look at the sensor
itself<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.910> when<00:03:02.030> we've<00:03:02.270> seen<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.510> in<00:03:02.600> pictures

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
itself so when we've seen it in pictures

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.780 
itself so when we've seen it in pictures
shots<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.830> front<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.070> a<00:03:04.130> TV<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.580> thing<00:03:04.670> like

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
shots in front of a TV and thing like

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.490

that<00:03:04.820> but<00:03:05.000> haven't<00:03:05.570> really<00:03:05.750> seen<00:03:05.870> how<00:03:06.020> largest

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
that but haven't really seen how largest

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.780

thing<00:03:06.590> is<00:03:06.710> and<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.040> fairly<00:03:07.490> substantial<00:03:08.590> I

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
thing is and it is fairly substantial I
