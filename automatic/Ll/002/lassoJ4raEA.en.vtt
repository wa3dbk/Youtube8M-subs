00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.380
 today we present a new constant database for art 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.160
 so clear 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.019
 as you can see 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:10.669
 it's a base 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:14.129
 with a lot of faded walls big enough situation 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:15.089
 So here is 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.560
 so a rather well-guarded entrance 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.560
 with a clone 9 hours after the earthquake 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.560
 a record a watchtower 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.869
 so that allows the clone 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.589
 and open 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.320
 or close the door squeaks 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.310
 the little ones 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.580
 click here 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.240
 so from here for that's here you see a little cannon 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.870
 headed by this company 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.960
 So here is 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.320
 right here 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.630
 nick reilly 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.830
 we also saw my first ball 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.320
 just like cameroon or a lure 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.320
 with pierre claude inside 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.800
 So here is 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.800
 m 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.570
 so when we open the doors we can see such a salary 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.430
 so there will be 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.760
 in this troubled context 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.340
 rather handy 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.420
 ie6 in 2008 that does not serve much 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.510
 why the road 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.450
 so there a mechanic who repairs in himself the recipes of the four 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.190
 there a little commander 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.570
 here 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.570
 so the boring a kind of the ump how to say 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.140
 dell this asterix h 30 stands at 3 pm 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.160
 for a single recorded death is tiny 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.050
 I want to see there 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.290
 this target 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.080
 is pretty good with guys 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.359
 a pirate 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.289
 which is useless so not stopped it will also be a problem 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.260
 so there you can see a whole row of trees from here 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.380
 for the peace of the locker room 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 black stars are spectators 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.070
 so here it is so it has a small staircase 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.259
 so space saw well here 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.299
 so the little staircase and cynical allows access 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.549
 long gold soul nor senate also provided the hand to matignon 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.909
 I added% as the drama is that the job does not leave right now 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:20.769
 Montreal 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.739
 r 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.909
 ok that's done 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.499
 so keep a paranoia 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.499
 we could then also see 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.039
 another species of 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.759
 the millimages mag 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.759
 with carcassonne that tightens lagarde 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.279
 with a spokesperson the mechanism is not very practical 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.119
 so the opening is like that 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:47.620
 there is a link 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.359
 even a lot of existing backup engine mechanisms if I want 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.459
 there is a problem 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.870
 the parable to intercept the communications after the mini-pc at low 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.129
 dry noise 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.400
 so why 7th place with a small staircase to be here 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.649
 that allow etf on gold 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:08.419
 so the landing stand 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:13.059
 can also announce the average non keserÃ¼ 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:17.149
 a theme that I modified that is also the same basin 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.529
 the first base 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:22.529
 and they sign kinds of douala machine guns 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:26.749
 my foot there too very important 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.839
 he remained the little genius the convoy vehicle in the episodes 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.939
 in the firmware 3 1 3 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:39.539
 hope that the revenge of the Sith Helen treated is surely t 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.189
 a few beers and if I find 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.219
 for stone look with a little motor that makes turn that do 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:50.669
 but here's where if there are any problems we can also see that the 

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:54.859
 so I call on the experts of writing 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:04:00.269
 and the closing of the door so for my part it's rather a lot of times 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.289
 I find my happiness 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:03.589
 it's like that 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:05.859
 good I have not considered 2 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.899
 great lessons that can fit in it's kind of a miniature base 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.009
 voila 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.499
 to do this m to know 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:17.199
 good nothing special 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.340
 so apart from that it will be everything 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.660
 my eyes are soon here
