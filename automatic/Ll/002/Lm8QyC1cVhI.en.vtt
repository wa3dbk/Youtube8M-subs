00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
electronic key axis that's gonna be

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.500 
electronic key axis that's gonna be
always<00:05:03.110> only<00:05:03.650> be<00:05:04.070> available<00:05:04.340> for<00:05:04.970> those<00:05:05.270> who

stay in the unit so there you have it
this<00:05:08.780> is<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:09.080> 15<00:05:09.440> square<00:05:09.710> meters<00:05:09.860> you<00:05:10.310> need

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
this is the 15 square meters you need
