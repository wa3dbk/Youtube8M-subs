00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.170
 a joy to have you here seeing you 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.660
 celebrate with your friends with your 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.750
 comrades that means all this achievement 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.690
 for you good many thanks very much 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.180
 I'm really happy because I'm happy 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.550
 I went back to the club we thought about this 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.369
 ascend and be champions so good 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.230
 it paid off so much because it has not touched you 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.660
 a bad one select a version 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.820
 complicated today had walking very well 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.820
 I imagine you will be in rehabilitation 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.910
 and also saying the reference of this 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.910
 group 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.350
 to that 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:58.640
 the hug with his partner and who 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.590
 replaced to see I want to do it greetings 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.260
 together because we talked with beto his 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.570
 injury you have to replace it being so 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.729
 young you have talked a lot about your ability and 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.970
 the truth of this first reflection 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.970
 yours 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:23.080
 always provided that only depend 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.080
 demonstrating 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:36.630
 at that time he taught me a lot I think 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.830
 that the talk we did then in 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:51.060
 two centuries after parker 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:52.410
 I think he's very young 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.890
 you had a change to everything that touched him 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:02:00.060
 play dreamed of the penalties and you have a 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:04.850
 promotion and a title I do not think it 's one 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.850
 to play minutes that I did not like 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.619
 but I got the chance and I tried 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.630
 take advantage of it in the best way and I 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.860
 I said spinoza fix it on river you go 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.940
 to buy half of the pass and we're going to 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.620
 continue in banfield 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.450
 If they told me that, I'm very happy 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.120
 that and good as a player 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.590
 of this award is very nice for me as well 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.650
 I hope that Carlos is very well 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.650
 night
