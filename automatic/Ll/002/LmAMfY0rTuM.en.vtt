the<00:00:05.730> cyber<00:00:06.029> slicers<00:00:06.600> are<00:00:06.960> on<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.890> loose<00:00:08.510> these

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
the cyber slicers are on the loose these

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.879 
the cyber slicers are on the loose these
are<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.690> guys<00:00:09.809> on<00:00:10.050> solving<00:00:10.320> them<00:00:10.500> out<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:10.800> as

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
are the guys on solving them out so as

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.370 
are the guys on solving them out so as
soon<00:00:11.070> as<00:00:11.160> these<00:00:11.340> guys<00:00:11.550> come<00:00:11.880> out<00:00:12.059> go<00:00:13.019> get<00:00:13.200> your

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
soon as these guys come out go get your

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.930 
soon as these guys come out go get your
magnet<00:00:13.769> gun<00:00:15.590> what<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> magnet<00:00:17.039> gun<00:00:17.310> does<00:00:17.580> to

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
magnet gun what the magnet gun does to

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.970 
magnet gun what the magnet gun does to
all<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.359> robots<00:00:18.869> as<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.199> picks<00:00:19.380> them<00:00:19.500> up<00:00:19.619> but

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
all the robots as it picks them up but

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.950 
all the robots as it picks them up but
to<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> cyber<00:00:20.490> slicers<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.630> kind<00:00:21.840> of

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
to the cyber slicers it just kind of

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.620 
to the cyber slicers it just kind of
erases<00:00:22.949> our<00:00:23.070> memory<00:00:23.130> temporarily<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.539> they

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
erases our memory temporarily so they

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.890 
erases our memory temporarily so they
like<00:00:25.730> become<00:00:26.730> disabled<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.900> stuns<00:00:28.380> them<00:00:28.650> yeah

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
like become disabled it stuns them yeah

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.310 
like become disabled it stuns them yeah
nice<00:00:31.219> it's<00:00:32.219> too<00:00:32.340> bad<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.640> don't<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:33.120> a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
eliminated total amount of uses it

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.810 
eliminated total amount of uses it
doesn't<00:01:14.130> overheat<00:01:14.189> right<00:01:16.549> I've<00:01:17.549> been<00:01:17.670> curious

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
doesn't overheat right I've been curious

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.550 
doesn't overheat right I've been curious
to<00:01:18.060> see<00:01:18.270> how<00:01:18.420> well<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.659> would<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.290> game

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
to see how well I would do on this game

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.530 
to see how well I would do on this game
considering<00:01:20.460> I've<00:01:20.549> never<00:01:20.790> played<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.240> but

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
considering I've never played it but

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.310 
considering I've never played it but
I've<00:01:21.689> SAT<00:01:22.049> through<00:01:22.080> all<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.530> us<00:01:23.180> yeah

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
I've SAT through all of us yeah

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.270 
I've SAT through all of us yeah
actually<00:01:26.320> know<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.500> better<00:01:26.740> experiment<00:01:27.190> will

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
actually know a better experiment will

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.970 
actually know a better experiment will
be<00:01:27.310> with<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.520> puzzle<00:01:28.410> see<00:01:29.410> if<00:01:29.470> you<00:01:29.560> remember<00:01:29.890> the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
be with a puzzle see if you remember the

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.290 
be with a puzzle see if you remember the
puzzle<00:01:30.280> is<00:01:30.370> to<00:01:30.400> see<00:01:30.700> how<00:01:30.760> well<00:01:30.910> I<00:01:30.970> can<00:01:31.060> remember

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.240 

because<00:01:34.300> it's<00:01:34.480> very<00:01:34.930> different<00:01:35.380> watching<00:01:36.160> the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
because it's very different watching the

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.430 
because it's very different watching the
video<00:01:36.550> you<00:01:37.450> have<00:01:37.540> no<00:01:37.690> concept<00:01:37.870> of<00:01:38.230> what's

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
video you have no concept of what's

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.920 
video you have no concept of what's
going<00:01:38.620> on<00:01:38.890> with<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.910> control<00:01:40.300> of<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.510> control

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
going on with the control of the control

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.630 
going on with the control of the control
yeah<00:01:41.260> probably<00:01:41.740> take<00:01:41.950> me<00:01:42.070> a<00:01:42.100> while<00:01:42.220> to<00:01:42.280> get<00:01:42.520> the
