think<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.480> was<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:10.349> b-side<00:00:11.099> or<00:00:11.370> ever<00:00:11.969> released

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
think this was a b-side or ever released

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.220 
think this was a b-side or ever released
at<00:00:12.570> all<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.990> think<00:00:13.349> he<00:00:13.620> he<00:00:14.490> did<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.820> one<00:00:14.969> before

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
at all I think he he did this one before

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.340 
at all I think he he did this one before
before<00:00:16.230> he<00:00:16.320> met<00:00:16.500> EP<00:00:17.660> so<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.720> want<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.960> Capitol

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
before he met EP so you want the Capitol

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.220 
before he met EP so you want the Capitol
on<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> 4th<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:23.750> it's<00:00:24.750> not<00:00:24.900> me

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
on the 4th and it's not me

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:37.760 
on the 4th and it's not me
not<00:00:25.410> many<00:00:25.560> calls<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.189> g<00:00:27.410> b7<00:00:28.410> e<00:00:29.420> minor<00:00:31.189> a7<00:00:33.710> see

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.180 

d<00:00:38.770> I<00:00:40.200> think<00:00:41.200> that's<00:00:41.380> about<00:00:41.530> it<00:00:41.680> really<00:00:41.920> fit

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
d I think that's about it really fit

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:53.420 
d I think that's about it really fit
cards<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.020> intro<00:00:47.320> it's<00:00:47.470> just<00:00:47.740> G

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.900

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.490 

and<00:01:02.910> then<00:01:03.150> you<00:01:03.240> get<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.540> the<00:01:03.630> first<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:04.020> which

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
and then you get to the first one which

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.160 
and then you get to the first one which
is<00:01:06.620> gb7

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
is gb7

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:19.270 
is gb7
a<00:01:09.340> minor<00:01:11.530> a7<00:01:14.470> C<00:01:16.750> D

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
a minor a7 C D

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.910 
a minor a7 C D
and<00:01:19.850> back<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.180> G<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:23.360> when<00:01:23.510> you<00:01:23.600> go<00:01:23.720> into<00:01:23.870> the<00:01:24.080> G

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920
