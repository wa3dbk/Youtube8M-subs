the<00:00:01.140> first<00:00:01.350> exercise<00:00:01.650> is<00:00:01.860> what<00:00:02.550> I<00:00:02.580> like<00:00:02.760> to

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
the first exercise is what I like to

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.519 
the first exercise is what I like to
call<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.480> full<00:00:04.290> strum<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:05.940> full<00:00:06.150> strum

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
call the full strum and the full strum

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.810 
call the full strum and the full strum
uses<00:00:07.529> this<00:00:07.770> this<00:00:08.130> idea<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.490> we're<00:00:08.670> going<00:00:08.760> to

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
uses this this idea that we're going to

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.629 
uses this this idea that we're going to
use<00:00:08.940> for<00:00:09.090> all<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.809> these<00:00:10.139> exercises<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.460> is

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
use for all of these exercises and it is

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.279 
use for all of these exercises and it is
muting<00:00:12.059> out<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.719> strings<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.259> guitar

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
muting out the strings of the guitar

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.900 
muting out the strings of the guitar
very<00:00:16.289> simple<00:00:16.619> right<00:00:16.770> one<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.760> things<00:00:17.820> that

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
very simple right one of the things that

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.550 
very simple right one of the things that
can<00:00:18.060> happen<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.420> sometimes<00:00:18.810> we<00:00:19.199> can<00:00:19.320> squeeze<00:00:19.529> a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
can happen is sometimes we can squeeze a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.800 
can happen is sometimes we can squeeze a
little<00:00:19.800> bit<00:00:20.039> too<00:00:20.220> hard<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.000> get<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> note<00:00:21.449> to

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
little bit too hard and get a note to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.740 
little bit too hard and get a note to
want<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.050> be<00:00:22.080> nice<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.949> loose<00:00:23.660> sometimes<00:00:24.660> we

want to be nice and loose sometimes we

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.929 
want to be nice and loose sometimes we
can<00:00:24.869> open<00:00:25.350> up<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.680> little<00:00:25.769> bit<00:00:25.949> more<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
can open up a little bit more and you

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.550 
can open up a little bit more and you
can<00:00:27.119> get<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.480> open<00:00:27.750> strings<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.320> just<00:00:28.439> want

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
can get the open strings you just want

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.349 
can get the open strings you just want
to<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:28.650> right<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.039> middle<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.240> it

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
to be right in the middle you can do it

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.620 
to be right in the middle you can do it
anywhere<00:00:31.019> on<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.590> guitar<00:00:32.210> get<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.270> slightly

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
anywhere on the guitar get a slightly

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.819 
anywhere on the guitar get a slightly
different<00:00:33.930> sound<00:00:34.520> if<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> bandana<00:00:36.510> or

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
different sound if you have a bandana or

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.860 
different sound if you have a bandana or
a<00:00:37.829> cloth<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.820> definitely<00:00:39.059> bring<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.690> over

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
a cloth you can definitely bring it over

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.229 
a cloth you can definitely bring it over
there<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.260> meet<00:00:40.469> out<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> strings<00:00:41.070> by<00:00:41.940> tying

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
there and meet out the strings by tying

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.619 
there and meet out the strings by tying
it<00:00:42.450> across<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.750> guitar<00:00:43.469> if<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.680> want<00:00:44.629> but

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
it across the guitar if you want but

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.270 
it across the guitar if you want but
that's<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.899> basic<00:00:46.020> idea<00:00:46.350> we're<00:00:47.070> going<00:00:47.190> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
that's the basic idea we're going to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.920 
that's the basic idea we're going to
transform<00:00:47.579> our<00:00:48.030> instrument<00:00:48.629> into<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
transform our instrument into a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.500 
transform our instrument into a
percussive<00:00:49.440> instrument<00:00:50.370> no<00:00:50.760> pitches<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.360> out

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
percussive instrument no pitches get out

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.979 
percussive instrument no pitches get out
this<00:00:52.469> allows<00:00:52.770> us<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.100> play<00:00:53.460> with<00:00:53.789> other<00:00:54.539> music

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
this allows us to play with other music

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.380 
this allows us to play with other music
which<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.739> really<00:00:55.920> huge<00:00:56.129> really<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.239> big

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
which is really huge really really big

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.680 
which is really huge really really big
deal<00:00:57.539> about<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.770> very<00:00:59.430> simply<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.539> full

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
deal about this so very simply the full

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.650 
deal about this so very simply the full
strum<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.100> guessed<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.510> strumming<00:01:03.510> all

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
strum is as you guessed it strumming all

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.429 
strum is as you guessed it strumming all
six<00:01:04.619> strings<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:05.220> fully<00:01:05.939> across<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:07.290> make

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
six strings just fully across but make

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.770 
six strings just fully across but make
sure<00:01:07.470> your<00:01:07.799> aim<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.070> there<00:01:08.520> take<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> look<00:01:09.540> at<00:01:09.750> it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
sure your aim is there take a look at it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.609 
sure your aim is there take a look at it
and<00:01:10.110> stare<00:01:10.590> too<00:01:10.830> right<00:01:11.010> hand<00:01:12.380> I'm<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.530> to

and stare too right hand I'm going to

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.590 
and stare too right hand I'm going to
get<00:01:13.710> all<00:01:13.799> six<00:01:14.070> strings<00:01:14.250> keep<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.240> very<00:01:15.360> very

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
get all six strings keep it very very

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.020 
get all six strings keep it very very
loose<00:01:15.840> wrist<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.610> strumming

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
loose wrist if you can the strumming

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.969 
loose wrist if you can the strumming
comes<00:01:18.330> from<00:01:18.630> these<00:01:18.990> muscles<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.770> these

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
comes from these muscles it's these

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.630 
comes from these muscles it's these
muscles<00:01:20.509> shaking<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.680> wrist<00:01:23.159> back<00:01:23.430> and

muscles shaking the the wrist back and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.490 
muscles shaking the the wrist back and
forth<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.630> notice<00:01:24.900> anything<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.380> your

elbow or in the top part of your arm
then<00:01:28.470> most<00:01:29.159> likely<00:01:29.340> what<00:01:29.670> you're<00:01:29.820> doing<00:01:30.030> is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
then most likely what you're doing is

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.660 
then most likely what you're doing is

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
strumming is coming from the top part of

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.510 
strumming is coming from the top part of
your<00:01:34.860> arm<00:01:35.159> over<00:01:35.430> here<00:01:35.939> with<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> loose<00:01:36.900> wrist

your arm over here with a loose wrist

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.830 
your arm over here with a loose wrist
you're<00:01:38.520> taking<00:01:38.790> these<00:01:38.880> two<00:01:39.090> big<00:01:39.270> muscle<00:01:39.600> sets

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you're taking these two big muscle sets

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.840 
you're taking these two big muscle sets
and<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.380> kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.590> wiggle<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.220> right

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
hand back and forth this is our

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.999 
hand back and forth this is our
foundational<00:01:45.540> strum<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.649> isn't

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
foundational strum this isn't

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.850 
foundational strum this isn't
necessarily<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.090> easy<00:01:48.390> easy<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.439> explain

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
necessarily that easy easy to explain

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.700 
necessarily that easy easy to explain
easy<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:51.090> me<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.210> demonstrate<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.530> take

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
easy for me to demonstrate this can take

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.350 
easy for me to demonstrate this can take
a<00:01:52.770> little<00:01:52.950> bit<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.220> time<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.820> together<00:01:53.939> I

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
a little bit of time to get together I

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.569 
a little bit of time to get together I

if<00:03:46.310> if<00:03:47.300> you're<00:03:47.750> doing<00:03:48.110> this<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.440> you're

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
if if you're doing this and you're

if if you're doing this and you're
really<00:03:48.830> working<00:03:48.980> out<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.280> muscles<00:03:49.489> you'll

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
really working out the muscles you'll

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.759 
really working out the muscles you'll
notice<00:03:50.300> that<00:03:50.330> these<00:03:50.630> guys<00:03:50.840> get<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.320> little<00:03:51.620> bit

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
notice that these guys get a little bit

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.130 
notice that these guys get a little bit
warm<00:03:52.160> as<00:03:52.430> you<00:03:52.760> go<00:03:52.910> through<00:03:53.180> there<00:03:53.360> this<00:03:53.900> is<00:03:54.110> a

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
warm as you go through there this is a

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.890 
warm as you go through there this is a
very<00:03:54.470> good<00:03:54.590> thing<00:03:54.890> it's<00:03:55.070> a<00:03:55.160> very<00:03:55.900> important

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
very good thing it's a very important

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.680 
very good thing it's a very important
thing<00:03:57.140> actually<00:03:57.350> this<00:03:57.980> is<00:03:58.190> helping<00:03:58.790> develop

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
thing actually this is helping develop

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.290 
thing actually this is helping develop
the<00:03:59.840> muscles<00:04:00.730> essentially<00:04:01.730> what's<00:04:01.880> happening

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
the muscles essentially what's happening

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.570 
the muscles essentially what's happening
is<00:04:02.420> your<00:04:03.140> muscles<00:04:03.470> aren't<00:04:03.590> strong<00:04:03.800> enough<00:04:04.010> to

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
is your muscles aren't strong enough to

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.100 
is your muscles aren't strong enough to
do<00:04:04.700> this<00:04:04.880> right<00:04:05.120> now<00:04:05.330> and<00:04:06.050> your<00:04:06.440> brain<00:04:06.650> goes<00:04:06.890> oh

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
do this right now and your brain goes oh

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.580 
do this right now and your brain goes oh
that<00:04:09.110> was<00:04:09.260> so<00:04:09.470> not<00:04:09.650> cool<00:04:10.300> and<00:04:11.300> it<00:04:11.840> starts<00:04:12.470> to

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
that was so not cool and it starts to

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.920 
that was so not cool and it starts to
allocate<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:13.550> know

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
allocate you know

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.640 
allocate you know
resources<00:04:14.739> so<00:04:14.920> that<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.519> next<00:04:16.180> day<00:04:16.560> when<00:04:17.560> you

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
resources so that the next day when you

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.800 
resources so that the next day when you
come<00:04:17.829> back<00:04:18.039> to<00:04:18.400> this<00:04:18.579> your<00:04:19.269> right<00:04:19.479> hand<00:04:19.720> will

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
come back to this your right hand will

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.050 
come back to this your right hand will
be<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:19.959> tiny<00:04:20.440> little<00:04:20.739> bit<00:04:20.979> stronger<00:04:21.340> because

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
be a tiny little bit stronger because

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.029 
be a tiny little bit stronger because
your<00:04:22.330> brain<00:04:22.539> has<00:04:22.840> has<00:04:23.229> built<00:04:23.530> a<00:04:23.650> little<00:04:23.919> bit

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
your brain has has built a little bit

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.270 
your brain has has built a little bit
more<00:04:24.220> muscle<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:25.259> your<00:04:26.259> muscle<00:04:26.770> memory<00:04:26.979> in

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
more muscle and your muscle memory in

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.070 
more muscle and your muscle memory in
this<00:04:27.370> area<00:04:27.669> is<00:04:27.759> getting<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.240> better<00:04:28.449> plus

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
this area is getting a better plus

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.080 
this area is getting a better plus
you're<00:04:29.530> mentally<00:04:30.130> thinking<00:04:30.160> about<00:04:30.729> it<00:04:30.850> from<00:04:30.970> a

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
you're mentally thinking about it from a

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.400 
you're mentally thinking about it from a
different<00:04:31.419> place<00:04:31.539> all<00:04:31.780> these<00:04:31.990> things<00:04:32.229> really

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
different place all these things really

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.020 
different place all these things really
come<00:04:32.680> together<00:04:32.830> which<00:04:33.190> is<00:04:33.310> why<00:04:33.460> it's<00:04:33.940> a

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
come together which is why it's a

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.050 
come together which is why it's a
week-long<00:04:34.240> study<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:36.130> key<00:04:36.340> is<00:04:36.490> choose<00:04:37.030> a

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
week-long study the key is choose a

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.330 
week-long study the key is choose a
piece<00:04:37.270> of<00:04:37.300> music<00:04:37.660> that<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:37.870> love<00:04:38.169> if<00:04:39.100> there

the groove within 20 seconds hit the
next<00:04:45.550> button<00:04:45.610> go<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.449> next<00:04:46.630> button<00:04:47.080> or<00:04:47.380> go

next button go to the next button or go
to<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:47.710> next<00:04:47.830> tune<00:04:48.099> this<00:04:48.720> idea<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:49.960> the

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
to the next tune this idea and the

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.620 
to the next tune this idea and the
strategy<00:04:50.680> works<00:04:50.889> for<00:04:51.250> by<00:04:51.729> far<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.449> majority

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
strategy works for by far the majority

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.580 
strategy works for by far the majority
of<00:04:53.380> pop<00:04:53.860> music<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.930> does<00:04:56.259> not<00:04:56.380> work<00:04:56.560> for

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
of pop music it does not work for

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.140 
of pop music it does not work for
everything<00:04:57.310> this<00:04:57.759> one<00:04:57.910> in<00:04:58.030> particular

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
everything this one in particular

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.570 
everything this one in particular
doesn't<00:04:58.509> work<00:04:58.720> very<00:04:58.780> well<00:04:58.990> with<00:04:59.289> waltzes<00:05:00.300> and

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
doesn't work very well with waltzes and

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.830 
doesn't work very well with waltzes and
definitely<00:05:03.580> with<00:05:03.729> odd<00:05:03.880> time<00:05:04.150> signatures<00:05:04.180> and

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
definitely with odd time signatures and

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.600 
definitely with odd time signatures and
we<00:05:04.960> get<00:05:05.139> we<00:05:05.349> get<00:05:05.440> into<00:05:05.710> a<00:05:05.740> different<00:05:06.580> category

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
we get we get into a different category

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.659 
we get we get into a different category
but<00:05:07.599> this<00:05:07.750> is<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.080> very<00:05:08.470> simple<00:05:08.770> pull<00:05:09.370> strum

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
but this is it very simple pull strum

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.020 
but this is it very simple pull strum
