by fortune well these packages have just

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.710 
by fortune well these packages have just
arrived<00:00:04.110> not<00:00:04.589> on<00:00:04.740> Google<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:06.540> going

to<00:00:06.779> be<00:00:06.839> my<00:00:07.020> next<00:00:07.200> project<00:00:07.980> it's<00:00:08.880> gonna<00:00:09.000> be

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
to be my next project it's gonna be

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.669 
to be my next project it's gonna be
built<00:00:09.870> not<00:00:10.110> let's<00:00:10.349> say<00:00:10.820> the<00:00:11.820> LD<00:00:12.120> or<00:00:12.690> Dax<00:00:13.410> era

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
built not let's say the LD or Dax era

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.939 
built not let's say the LD or Dax era
and<00:00:14.519> their<00:00:14.670> campaign<00:00:15.120> trail<00:00:15.770> with<00:00:16.770> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
and their campaign trail with the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.759 
and their campaign trail with the
hardtop<00:00:19.730> yeah<00:00:20.730> I'm<00:00:21.119> just<00:00:21.330> gonna<00:00:21.590> unpack<00:00:22.590> it

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
hardtop yeah I'm just gonna unpack it

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.790 
hardtop yeah I'm just gonna unpack it
all<00:00:22.890> just<00:00:23.189> now<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:24.470> hopefully<00:00:25.470> find<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
all just now and hopefully find the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.670 
all just now and hopefully find the
instruction<00:00:26.310> book<00:00:27.170> it's<00:00:28.170> not<00:00:28.320> supposed<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.590> be

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
instruction book it's not supposed to be

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.790 
instruction book it's not supposed to be
that<00:00:28.769> hard<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.130> put<00:00:29.160> together<00:00:30.080> but<00:00:31.080> I'll<00:00:31.740> just

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
that hard to put together but I'll just

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.470 
that hard to put together but I'll just
have<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> look<00:00:32.369> at<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.700> push<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:33.809> Space<00:00:34.399> Agency

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
have a look at it push for Space Agency

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.049 
have a look at it push for Space Agency
and<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.540> steer<00:00:36.809> EBS<00:00:37.620> hard<00:00:38.219> top<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:40.910> then<00:00:41.910> we've

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
and I steer EBS hard top and then we've

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.930 
and I steer EBS hard top and then we've
got<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.360> big<00:00:42.600> box<00:00:42.870> there<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.760> this<00:00:44.760> other

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
got that big box there and this other

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.850 
got that big box there and this other
box<00:00:45.239> which<00:00:45.840> I'm<00:00:46.050> guessing<00:00:46.200> he's<00:00:46.410> got<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.649> side

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
box which I'm guessing he's got the side

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.160 
box which I'm guessing he's got the side
panels<00:00:47.309> possibly<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.170> chassis<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
panels possibly the chassis in it a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.700 
panels possibly the chassis in it a
spare<00:00:52.170> wheel<00:00:53.210> load<00:00:54.210> bars<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:56.750> a<00:00:57.750> jockey<00:00:58.440> wheel

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
spare wheel load bars and a jockey wheel

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.530 
spare wheel load bars and a jockey wheel
and<00:00:59.270> spare<00:01:00.270> wheel<00:01:00.539> clamp<00:01:01.469> down<00:01:05.360> so<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and spare wheel clamp down so the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.899 
and spare wheel clamp down so the
trailer<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.960> got<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.500> there<00:01:07.860> there<00:01:08.340> Dax<00:01:08.670> outer

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
trailer I got is there there Dax outer

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.170 
trailer I got is there there Dax outer
one<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.810> seven<00:01:10.140> or<00:01:10.830> which<00:01:11.670> would<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
one to seven or which would be the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.550 
one to seven or which would be the
equivalent<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.810> LD<00:01:13.610> one<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.850> two<00:01:15.560> think

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
equivalent of the LD one to two think

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.600 
equivalent of the LD one to two think
it's<00:01:16.860> four<00:01:17.490> foot<00:01:17.939> by<00:01:18.240> three<00:01:18.540> foot<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.979> 100%

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
it's four foot by three foot and 100%

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.350 
it's four foot by three foot and 100%
sure<00:01:22.310> why<00:01:23.310> did<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.700> that

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
sure why did you see that

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.530 
sure why did you see that
that's<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.140> hardtop<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:26.180> that's<00:01:27.180> what<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
that's the hardtop so that's what the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.600 
that's the hardtop so that's what the
size<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.130> trailer<00:01:29.130> bed<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.549> gonna<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:30.500> mm

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
size of the trailer bed is gonna be mm

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.800 
size of the trailer bed is gonna be mm
looks<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.700> sacs<00:01:33.090> are<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.600> really

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
looks like sacs are going to be really

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.350 
looks like sacs are going to be really
decent<00:01:34.619> size<00:01:35.270> some<00:01:36.270> children<00:01:36.659> are<00:01:38.360> so

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
decent size some children are so

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.710 
decent size some children are so

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
and two metal mud guards so that's

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.889 
and two metal mud guards so that's
pretty<00:02:02.369> decent<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:06.090> solar<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.630> really

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
pretty decent the solar can really

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.889 
pretty decent the solar can really
really<00:02:07.350> good<00:02:07.530> quality<00:02:08.149> as<00:02:09.149> well<00:02:09.360> well<00:02:09.660> put

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
really good quality as well well put

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.650 
really good quality as well well put
together<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.440> far

Libby's it's real just certificate of
Conformity<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:29.239> take<00:02:30.239> that<00:02:30.420> out<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:33.769> that's

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
Conformity and take that out and that's

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:42.640 
Conformity and take that out and that's
an<00:02:34.980> instruction<00:02:35.580> pile<00:02:36.470> I'm<00:02:37.470> going<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.950> pop

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.960 

this<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.040> trailer<00:02:44.549> beast<00:02:45.739> looks

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
this is the trailer beast looks

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.520 
this is the trailer beast looks
fantastic<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.090> they<00:02:48.180> will<00:02:48.500> will<00:02:49.500> put

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
fantastic that they will will put

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.729 
fantastic that they will will put
together<00:02:51.140> which<00:02:52.140> one<00:02:52.290> it's<00:02:52.440> going<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.650> be<00:02:52.709> a

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
together which one it's going to be a

00:02:52.739 --> 00:03:04.890 
together which one it's going to be a
good<00:02:52.890> better<00:02:53.130> kit

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.960 

so<00:03:05.900> that's<00:03:06.110> roughly<00:03:06.440> what<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.220> trio<00:03:07.430> like

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
so that's roughly what the trio like

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.200 
so that's roughly what the trio like
once<00:03:08.240> it's<00:03:08.420> done<00:03:09.070> I'm<00:03:10.070> going<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.310> add<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.760> few

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
once it's done I'm going to add a few

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.300
