00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.939
 such a rainbow picture 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:12.939
 we don't need that 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.529
 but 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.949
 for the supply of oil to China 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.019
 let's see how she is 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.019
 opposed this 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.899
 United Russia 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.380
 secondly, if you have to invent 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.180
 no many people 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.280
 15 years ago it was then a new place where 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.010
 they come to concerts 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.370
 it was terrible 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.400
 for modernization for some reason stage 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.400
 feel free to talk about their database 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.570
 according to the organizers 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.879
 enterprises m 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.120
 I met at school 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.059
 they do not support paid so on 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.760
 concert 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.760
 offers goods 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.460
 Ukraine should not 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.360
 politician 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.430
 as says 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.490
 and that it is not reported to be held in May 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.980
 carrots beets and carrots touched 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.680
 me 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.330
 what is the real toyota though i don't have 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.570
 there is 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.680
 previously planned that from the end of April 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.570
 when the action of the word as it is 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.479
 called 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.619
 winner of numerous 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.430
 guests 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.400
 and decent gasoline yes 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.190
 he was moved 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.510
 we all saw 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.510
 so here 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.770
 being at the closing of the Sochi Olympics 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.220
 and the warehouse and for some reason that does not come that concerts 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.220
 to 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.580
 subject 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.550
 and the consequences of such as you know 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.540
 wary 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.100
 he is a rising star she is with us today so 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.840
 actively 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.649
 I believe that in comparison 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.189
 the guys came from other cities of Moscow 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.779
 somehow idle 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:17.589
 I do not know why he believes that Moscow 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:19.959
 gave her assessment 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.679
 but it shows 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:24.829
 my education 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.580
 I don't know, I think on the stage 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.529
 all the same on 0 2 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:31.060
 she worked on the radio 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.080
 she is what you like 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.330
 fast-paced hero marina moscow 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.530
 simply attacked the tourist enough 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.420
 prejudiced relate therefore here 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.219
 price competition 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.469
 otherwise 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:45.559
 is reading 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.299
 leader want to watch 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.299
 Yakovlev 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.879
 at the right moment 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.149
 my wife is the Interior Ministry 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.469
 according to the publication 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:03.999
 for a day 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.219
 hope nazin I don't even know 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.009
 I had a team 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:13.269
 I knew about it but it is impossible in January of this 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.429
 year introduced in connection with this 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:18.829
 i never stood on tuesday 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.319
 no doubt old man 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.319
 in the hall the question did not even give a voice 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:28.419
 actor cast data greece in 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.419
 its all to make a statement 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:37.869
 such a forecast was given 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.169
 pieces 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.169
 in the next concert 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:48.779
 but Moscow 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:51.879
 I've already gone twice 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.249
 predict the defeat of Moscow 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:58.069
 space circulation suggest 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.449
 what's next 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:04.169
 and it will not work, I think I generally think that 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.169
 will not tolerate underground people 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.180
 I think that the people will not let go 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.069
 next round 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.069
 Valery Matkovsky 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.009
 but Sasha is now like him 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:19.079
 the oldest our viewers totals 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.129
 voting in our hands Marina Leonova 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:23.830
 in the hospital 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.330
 food for myself but for starters me 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
 liked the prisma head of the city 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.909
 while valeri carp 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:34.909
 civil case is better than original 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.009
 two weeks ago myself is better with another 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.550
 parties 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.610
 good second place 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.990
 by results can be achieved 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.990
 coordination 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.419
 survived today 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.110
 it should be economical 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.400
 Maria Malkovskaya 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.870
 I spoke first I understand it is difficult 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.400
 the first 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.960
 he said a lot 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.309
 as practice shows 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:16.309
 for today 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.680
 made a decision 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.680
 introduction to the city 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.759
 Angelina Jolie 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.400
 up to two of our days 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.759
 Marina di Maria 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.759
 but both cargo and also known project 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.370
 but each of us was not one 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.409
 defeats 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.740
 predator 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.740
 Maria Mayakovskaya another result 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:51.449
 two years 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:53.849
 if you open three tenths of a percent 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:55.319
 exactly like this 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:56.330
 According to him 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.809
 basically 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:59.819
 length is the biggest result 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:00.949
 I'm the biggest 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.839
 maybe 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:05.839
 to a minimum 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:17.659
 Kharkov 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:23.379
 Mayakovskaya unfortunately leaves the site 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.960
 these are the rules
