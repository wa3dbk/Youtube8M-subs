00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.879
 man-woman we decide the same we use 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.759
 the same resources we provoke the 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:18.279
 the same consequences we lead in 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:22.509
 similar in a different way how he plays 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:25.560
 the emotion the reason with what equation a 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:28.680
 and another influence on decisions 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.410
 man is important in this era in this 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.010
 era in which women are each 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.840
 most day inserted in the professional world 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.510
 in the life of organizations and in 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.520
 important posts analyze very 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.850
 specifically very deeply what 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.750
 are the differences and similarities that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.120
 they are of different order different capacity 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.830
 neuronal differences in terms of 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.510
 characteristics of the organs to its 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.370
 size to its incidence to its influence 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.070
 but also hormonal differences 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.590
 all of the endocrine system today 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.920
 we could summarize in a discipline that 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.500
 it is becoming very fashionable 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.010
 differences have a framework that 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.200
 we could start psychoneuroimmunology 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.119
 this means consider consider 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.510
 these different psychological aspects 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.450
 hormonal neurological also 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.060
 of the immune system and somehow in 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.399
 30 analyze these differences one by one 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.009
 maybe as an example the most important 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.950
 We could tell from from 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.890
 neurological characteristics the first 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.200
 big difference that arises in the analysis 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.259
 and in the study is that difference that 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.080
 produces in body size and color 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.590
 callosum the corpus callosum is a kind 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.539
 of base on which is the thinking and 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.700
 which also protects the limbic is a 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.420
 kind of union between the two 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:58.180
 hemispheres which in turn supports 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.580
 from one and another and another part of the brain 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.780
 this corpus callosum in the case of 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.690
 man is more grayish and is narrower 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.210
 smaller in terms of thickness in the 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.700
 The woman's case is wider than 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.950
 dimension and whites 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.239
 the physiological differences are not 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.220
 relevant to the topic that we are 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.230
 analyzing but if the consequences of 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.220
 these physiological differences in 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.349
 concrete to say that it is more grayish 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.300
 means in the case of the brain of 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.220
 man of the corpus callosum of the man who 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.340
 has more centers 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.860
 neuronal bear more than are grayish in 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.250
 itself 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.540
 axons and dendrites meanwhile 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.580
 by the fact of having a honey 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.910
 initiation that protects the connection between 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.480
 yes it gives a whitish color which in 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.450
 synthesis allows to affirm that women 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.830
 It has a greater quantity and variety of 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.690
 Neural connections between hemispheres 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.570
 that the number of connections you have 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.510
 man but man in turn has 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:07.520
 more neuronal centers in 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:11.430
 particular then good is to say that 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.640
 in making decisions the man with 2 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.290
 or 3 not many arguments take the 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.940
 decision for example in the aspect 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.709
 commercial with two arguments you sell 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.500
 one thing to man instead woman 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.910
 requires more quantity and variety of 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.800
 Arguments for the same decision 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.230
 by the fact of having a brain a lot 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.790
 more interconnected is also 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.790
 important to say that in making 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.310
 decisions in the organization is 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.370
 the number one position is company 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.439
 of sector of department of area 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.750
 always requires more 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:45.609
 Considering factors or arguments 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:49.430
 jointly this amounts to saying that the 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:51.890
 decisions of number one posts are 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.879
 most appropriate for a structure or 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.680
 much more neuronal architecture 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.990
 interconnected and also interconnected 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.150
 between distant factors 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.040
 this also means recognizing that the 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.590
 woman has a neuronal architecture 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.940
 more conducive to decision making 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.850
 of number one and that's what we're 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.180
 observing in today's world today in 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.690
 a still macho world the woman 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.370
 is having more and more positions 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.079
 proportionally I mean taxes 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.040
 of number 1 growing in shape 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.590
 growing that's why 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.050
 the entrance to the professional world and 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.450
 Organization of women should not be done 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.060
 As we did years ago, we tried to 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.740
 trying to compete with the man in 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.530
 the most qualities qualities 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.390
 advantageous of man the woman has her 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.150
 qualities in some cases much more 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.940
 advantageous another differential aspect 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.670
 important is the area of ​​pre optics the area 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.070
 Pre optics in man is 2.5 times more 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.710
 large and has double the amount of 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.140
 neurons 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.430
 the pre-optic area in both man 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.620
 as the woman has to do with 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.770
 sexual stipulations 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.680
 this results in the fact that the 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.350
 man is much more dependent on the 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.560
 sexual stimulation that the woman or better 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:14.960
 said has greater 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:18.410
 influence greater incidence a stimulus 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.240
 today to not only glimpse 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.860
 creation to confuse in the decision 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.400
 The man has more 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.250
 independence in this sense 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.350
 then also by development of 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.960
 hippocampus the woman's hippocampus is a 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.539
 limbic brain organ is hippocampus 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.520
 the memory is bigger and the woman 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:40.210
 especially emotional memory of women 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.139
 it's much wider in terms of duration 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.710
 and intensity 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:47.919
 this is an emotional influence in the 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.350
 woman is influenced much more by the influence 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.120
 much more but more the woman remembers her 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.729
 for much longer 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.030
 and in some way that also causes 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:01.000
 a substantial differential when it comes to 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.830
 measure influences of organs or 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.340
 functioning of organs 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:09.199
 clearly in the hormonal 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.139
 the greatest amount of hormones 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.960
 testosterone in man makes a greater 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.729
 visuospatial specialization is located 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.800
 more on a map in a context in a 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.590
 territory but the least amount of 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.540
 testosterone in women allows you a 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.060
 work from the point of view 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.409
 much richer emotional much more 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.689
 effective 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:33.169
 but in synthesis this brings us to 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:35.449
 affirm as a summary of all this that the 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:37.759
 man and woman have with formations 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:40.000
 brain systems different 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:42.790
 different hormonal stimulation 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.180
 and of some variety all this takes us 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:49.270
 to some and others to have to settle their 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.760
 intelligence your decision making your 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.650
 general decisions on structures 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.009
 different with which with qualities 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.529
 different 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:00.559
 with different advantages and disadvantages 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:04.369
 also and this is the reality of the neuro 

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:08.529
 female leadership be aware of 

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:08.529
 differential qualities and take advantage of them
