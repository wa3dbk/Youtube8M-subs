00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
I really like my thing in this game and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.150 
I really like my thing in this game and
when<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.519> got<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.910> gun<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.180> didn't<00:00:24.859> as<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.010> see

I<00:00:26.189> didn't<00:00:26.460> realize<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.210> wasn't<00:00:27.480> a

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
I didn't realize that it wasn't a

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.350 
I didn't realize that it wasn't a
bolt-action<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.750> actually<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:31.380> a

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
bolt-action it actually is like a

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.180 
bolt-action it actually is like a
semi-auto<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.260> could<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:34.559> fire<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:34.950> much

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
semi-auto so you could just fire as much

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.610 
semi-auto so you could just fire as much
as<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.460> want<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.090> six<00:00:36.329> bullets<00:00:36.719> let<00:00:37.559> me

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.700 
for energy to two so just show that
they're<00:01:17.400> listening<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.710> she's<00:01:21.439> okay<00:01:22.439> hold<00:01:22.590> on

just yes just spray in that way I'll be

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.050 
just yes just spray in that way I'll be
able<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.620> move<00:02:13.830> while<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.310> scope<00:02:14.610> which<00:02:14.910> would

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
able to move while in scope which would

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.120 
able to move while in scope which would
be<00:02:15.180> nice<00:02:16.490> so<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:18.030> would<00:02:18.120> be<00:02:18.240> pretty<00:02:18.390> nice<00:02:18.630> but

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
be nice so that would be pretty nice but

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.470 
be nice so that would be pretty nice but
it'd<00:02:20.130> just<00:02:20.250> take<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.490> while<00:02:20.760> like<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.150> think<00:02:21.210> it's

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
it'd just take a while like I think it's

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.930 
it'd just take a while like I think it's
what<00:02:21.960> is<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.290> thousand<00:02:22.740> kills<00:02:22.940> maybe

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
what is it like a thousand kills maybe

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.100 
what is it like a thousand kills maybe
