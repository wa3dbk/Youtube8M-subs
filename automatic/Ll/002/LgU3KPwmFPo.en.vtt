the question is why
well<00:00:35.520> another<00:00:35.880> two<00:00:36.120> points<00:00:36.510> number<00:00:37.079> one<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.500> is

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
well another two points number one it is

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.520 
well another two points number one it is
also<00:00:38.190> by<00:00:38.370> far<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.000> fastest<00:00:39.690> external<00:00:40.290> drive

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530

you have a fast enough host computer you

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.480 
you have a fast enough host computer you
can<00:01:23.700> actually<00:01:24.119> expect<00:01:24.900> more<00:01:25.350> than<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> thousand

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
can actually expect more than a thousand

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.190 
can actually expect more than a thousand

right<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.180> crazy<00:01:30.600> because<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.680> can

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
right here that is crazy because you can

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.270 
right here that is crazy because you can
actually<00:01:32.100> finish<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.030> CD<00:01:33.750> full<00:01:34.380> worth<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.070> data

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
actually finish a CD full worth of data

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.380 
actually finish a CD full worth of data
on<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.869> less<00:01:37.439> one<00:01:38.040> second<00:01:38.790> look

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
on this one here in less one second look

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.920 
on this one here in less one second look
at<00:01:39.509> my<00:01:39.570> eyes<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.640> second<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.270> the

at my eyes that is one second and the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.929 
at my eyes that is one second and the
second<00:01:43.350> reason<00:01:43.470> why<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:44.220> worth<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> price

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
second reason why it's worth the price

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.880 
second reason why it's worth the price
because<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.780> desire<00:01:46.170> right<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.649> take<00:01:46.860> a
