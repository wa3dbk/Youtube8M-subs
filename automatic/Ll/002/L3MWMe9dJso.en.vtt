00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
keeper once again going into this I was

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.320 
keeper once again going into this I was
expecting<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.610> worst<00:02:11.820> I<00:02:12.030> thought<00:02:12.210> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
expecting the worst I thought the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330 
expecting the worst I thought the
Peacekeeper<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:13.080> either<00:02:13.440> really<00:02:13.920> really<00:02:14.160> good

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
Peacekeeper be either really really good

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.930 
Peacekeeper be either really really good
and<00:02:14.610> overpowering<00:02:15.420> or<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:16.500> would<00:02:16.770> be<00:02:17.460> just<00:02:17.760> a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
and overpowering or it would be just a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.970 
and overpowering or it would be just a
terrible<00:02:18.210> gun<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.410> won't<00:02:19.560> even<00:02:19.620> be<00:02:19.800> worth

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
terrible gun and it won't even be worth

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.390 
terrible gun and it won't even be worth
using<00:02:20.280> but<00:02:21.120> fortunately<00:02:21.690> it's<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.710> good<00:02:23.160> gun

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
using but fortunately it's a good gun

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.490 
using but fortunately it's a good gun
but<00:02:24.090> it's<00:02:24.210> not<00:02:24.270> too<00:02:24.780> good<00:02:24.990> it's<00:02:25.140> actually

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
but it's not too good it's actually

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.850 
but it's not too good it's actually
balanced<00:02:26.100> very<00:02:26.760> very<00:02:27.060> well<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:27.990> plays<00:02:28.830> just

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
balanced very very well it plays just

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.280

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
how they said it was going to they said

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.930 
how they said it was going to they said
I<00:02:31.320> was<00:02:31.410> gonna<00:02:31.500> be<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.710> hybrid<00:02:31.890> between<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.700> salt

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
I was gonna be a hybrid between the salt

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.870 
I was gonna be a hybrid between the salt
rifle<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.510> submachine<00:02:34.020> gun<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.580> it<00:02:35.580> works

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
rifle and a submachine gun and it works

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.390 
rifle and a submachine gun and it works
at<00:02:36.540> close<00:02:36.840> range<00:02:37.140> you're<00:02:37.440> probably<00:02:37.710> going<00:02:38.310> to

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
at close range you're probably going to

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.640 
at close range you're probably going to
lose<00:02:38.580> gunfights<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.330> better<00:02:39.690> close<00:02:40.410> range

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
lose gunfights to better close range

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.070 
lose gunfights to better close range
submachine<00:02:41.130> guns<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:42.180> longer<00:02:42.570> range<00:02:42.720> or<00:02:42.930> add

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
submachine guns the longer range or add

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.630 
submachine guns the longer range or add
lose<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.410> assault<00:02:43.709> rifles<00:02:44.070> but<00:02:44.190> those<00:02:44.340> good

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
lose to assault rifles but those good

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.420 
lose to assault rifles but those good
close<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.900> medium<00:02:46.350> range<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.890> area<00:02:47.220> you're

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
close to medium range that area you're

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.690 
close to medium range that area you're
going<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.790> be<00:02:47.910> winning<00:02:48.270> those<00:02:48.600> gunfights<00:02:49.170> and

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
going to be winning those gunfights and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.340 
going to be winning those gunfights and
which<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.850> great<00:02:51.150> because<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.540> lot<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.110> maps

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
which is great because a lot of the maps

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.760 
which is great because a lot of the maps
in<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:52.680> game<00:02:52.860> especially<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.490> DLC<00:02:53.970> play

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
in this game especially the DLC play

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.650 
in this game especially the DLC play
into<00:02:55.770> that<00:02:55.890> play<00:02:56.130> style<00:02:56.490> so<00:02:57.240> you're<00:02:57.450> still

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
into that play style so you're still

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.620 
into that play style so you're still
gonna<00:02:57.810> lose<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.350> MSMC<00:02:59.100> S&amp;P<00:02:59.430> dw's<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.330> all<00:03:00.420> that

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
gonna lose to MSMC S&amp;P dw's and all that

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.600 
gonna lose to MSMC S&amp;P dw's and all that
because<00:03:01.260> those<00:03:01.800> are<00:03:01.980> going<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.250> be<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
because those are going to be the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.390 
because those are going to be the
dominant<00:03:03.209> guns<00:03:03.750> but<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.650> Peacekeeper<00:03:05.190> is

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
dominant guns but the Peacekeeper is

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.590 
dominant guns but the Peacekeeper is
definitely<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:06.090> good<00:03:06.900> strong<00:03:07.620> choice<00:03:08.420> but<00:03:09.420> it's

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
definitely a good strong choice but it's

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.479 
definitely a good strong choice but it's
not<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:09.959> good<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.709> people<00:03:10.890> feel<00:03:11.220> like<00:03:11.250> they

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
not so good that people feel like they

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.000 
not so good that people feel like they
have<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.850> buy<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.060> dlc<00:03:12.330> in<00:03:13.050> order<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.709> get<00:03:13.860> this

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
have to buy the dlc in order to get this

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.820 
have to buy the dlc in order to get this
overpowered<00:03:14.640> weapon<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:16.380> I've<00:03:16.470> been<00:03:16.560> looking

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
overpowered weapon and I've been looking

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.530 
overpowered weapon and I've been looking
around<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.280> general<00:03:17.670> consensus<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.480> that

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
around the general consensus is that

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.740 
around the general consensus is that
it's<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.440> good<00:03:19.620> gun<00:03:19.800> but<00:03:20.310> it's<00:03:20.430> not<00:03:20.750> overpowered

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
it's a good gun but it's not overpowered

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.860 
it's a good gun but it's not overpowered
so<00:03:22.700> really<00:03:23.700> happy<00:03:24.330> with<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.600> situation

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
so really happy with that situation

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.600 
so really happy with that situation
right<00:03:25.350> now<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.860> course<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.130> leads<00:03:26.400> us

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
right now and of course that leads us

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.890 
right now and of course that leads us

final<00:04:19.970> topic<00:04:20.180> really<00:04:20.600> it's<00:04:20.990> it's<00:04:22.360> good<00:04:23.360> but

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
final topic really it's it's good but

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.100 
final topic really it's it's good but
it's<00:04:24.430> complicated<00:04:25.430> it's<00:04:25.490> very<00:04:26.110> different

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
it's complicated it's very different

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.970 
it's complicated it's very different
than<00:04:27.590> what<00:04:28.550> we've<00:04:28.700> played<00:04:28.970> in<00:04:29.150> zombies<00:04:29.570> before

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
than what we've played in zombies before

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.800 
than what we've played in zombies before
and<00:04:30.980> it's<00:04:31.370> not<00:04:31.520> like<00:04:31.700> a<00:04:31.730> transit<00:04:32.480> kind<00:04:32.720> of

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
and it's not like a transit kind of

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.270 
and it's not like a transit kind of
thing<00:04:32.990> I<00:04:33.230> think<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.680> lot<00:04:33.830> of<00:04:33.860> people<00:04:33.980> were

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
thing I think a lot of people were

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.240 
thing I think a lot of people were
turned<00:04:34.550> off<00:04:34.670> by<00:04:34.880> transit<00:04:35.650> I'm<00:04:36.650> included<00:04:37.160> in

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
turned off by transit I'm included in

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.830 
turned off by transit I'm included in
that<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.610> didn't<00:04:37.880> really<00:04:38.090> think<00:04:38.270> transit

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
that I didn't really think transit

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.370 
that I didn't really think transit
what's<00:04:39.260> done<00:04:39.760> perfectly<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:41.120> this<00:04:41.840> map<00:04:42.080> is

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
what's done perfectly and this map is

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.820 
what's done perfectly and this map is
strictly<00:04:43.330> survival<00:04:44.330> as<00:04:44.810> far<00:04:45.080> as<00:04:45.170> i<00:04:45.320> know<00:04:45.530> i've

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
strictly survival as far as i know i've

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.730 
strictly survival as far as i know i've
played<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.730> probably<00:04:47.270> five<00:04:47.600> times<00:04:47.960> then<00:04:48.500> get

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
played it probably five times then get

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.580 
played it probably five times then get
past<00:04:49.010> like<00:04:49.310> round<00:04:49.550> 10<00:04:49.820> each<00:04:50.210> of<00:04:50.420> them<00:04:50.540> but<00:04:51.380> i'm

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
past like round 10 each of them but i'm

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.350 
past like round 10 each of them but i'm
probably<00:04:51.890> going<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.310> sit<00:04:52.640> down<00:04:52.670> my<00:04:53.000> friends
