00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.940
 low 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.640
 all right 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.880
 hello how are you all welcome to a 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.070
 new video this time I come to 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.710
 talk about an application that maybe to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.860
 many will serve us in daily use 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.530
 of our android device it's about 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.320
 of an acz blocker 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.539
 that we can find in the google 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.290
 place thor 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.000
 it's called explore and we can get it 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.579
 free from the store 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.129
 Google applications as you can see 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.440
 It is very light and will not take long 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.719
 install 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.489
 now we are going to open it to show you 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.430
 the operation of this blocker 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.289
 als that will give us a little more 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.289
 security in our devices 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.289
 android especially in our phones 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.920
 That's the welcome screen 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.800
 can see gives us two options one in the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.100
 that asks us to add a pin 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.640
 4 digits and another in which we can 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.620
 establish a pattern 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.590
 the typical unlocking pattern of 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.800
 Android that we use sometimes in the 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.970
 Locks of our screen 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.550
 I 'm going to set a pin 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.820
 let's put a pin any of 1 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.820
 to 4 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.820
 ask them to confirm the pin 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.810
 and we are redirected to this interface in the 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.050
 that we are welcomed and asked 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.570
 let's start blocking some apps 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.820
 we slide this button 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.920
 and as you can see here we are shown the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.530
 list of all the apps that we have 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:59.160
 installed for example if you want 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.400
 block facebook which is the most typical 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.680
 when you lend someone your cell phone and 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.740
 you do not want them to see what your networks are 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.950
 social start blocking for example 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.410
 Facebook 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.980
 we can also block the mail 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.040
 gmail 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.140
 and all 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.140
 the applications that we want 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.950
 let's leave for while these two 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.900
 applications only let's go back 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.810
 and I'm going to show you 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.299
 how this application works there are some 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.360
 profiles that use the application as 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:37.350
 can see here at the bottom it 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.410
 it shows us 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.420
 that 2 sachs have been blocked and in the 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.340
 top part is set the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:50.190
 job profile or word these profiles 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.920
 can be modified if we slide towards 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.500
 the left we will find with the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.660
 profile 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.220
 off in which all the 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.400
 applications are going to be free of 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.100
 lock and if we slide to the right 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.040
 there is another profile called home for when 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.080
 let's be in the house as I say these 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.170
 profiles can be edited in the part of 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.560
 up there is a symbol there is a small 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:19.510
 icon of a pencil if we press we can 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.510
 we can change the profile name 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.330
 For example , we will translate it Spanish 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.790
 and we put work to him we give him in himself 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.180
 and we can also change the icon of the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.180
 profile 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.890
 let's leave it there because for 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.170
 As you can see, the name has already been changed 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.980
 of work and this we will also be able 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.980
 change 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.290
 at home 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:52.260
 and I would be there then in each profile 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.190
 we can block the applications that 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:01.080
 more convenient for us and thus manage it 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.710
 more comfortably by these profiles I'm going to 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.480
 the 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.020
 I'm going to block here the album and the 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.020
 Youtube 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.200
 As you can see already below is shown 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.340
 is blocked 2 sachs in this profile 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.129
 From home 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.799
 also the ones I want to show you is 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:20.500
 that you can also add the 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.710
 profiles that we want if we give in 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.660
 this button up on this button other 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.000
 As you can see we are shown that 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.949
 we select a new profile of the 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.169
 following can be the profile of 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.840
 school or it can be the control profile 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.360
 parent for parents that some 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.820
 Sometimes they lend the cell phone to their children 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.660
 and finally if we go to the configuration 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.580
 here in the top left 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.800
 we are going to find these adjustments 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.920
 here in the first option we can 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.920
 change from ping to pattern or vice versa 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.720
 here in the second option we can 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.040
 prevent someone from trying to uninstall 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:07.070
 for this we will have to activate it 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.240
 pressing and we touch on activate and here 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.090
 are you going to ask us if we want 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.950
 activate ex lock as our 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.550
 device manager we give 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:19.150
 activate and finally enter the 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.270
 pin already established 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.280
 and in this way we will prevent someone 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.160
 I installed the application and if I 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.840
 try to do you will be asked to ping 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.220
 previously established also in the 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.100
 third option we will have a 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:37.150
 functionality of the application that we 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:40.690
 allows you to quickly activate a profile 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:44.470
 established by connecting to 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:47.440
 true wifi for example let's give it in 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.300
 enable let's activate this option and 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.210
 as you can see already in this section 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.000
 of the profiles we have added a 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.650
 button that tells us to press for 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.470
 activate the profile 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.259
 we play here and if it's going to show us a 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.900
 list of wi-fi networks to which our 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:09.090
 device has previously accessed and 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.800
 that therefore remember not 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.080
 As you can see they can select 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.790
 anyone and automatically as well 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.479
 our mobile is connected to one of these 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:21.660
 networks is going to activate the profile that 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:23.250
 we have selected and those are all 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.470
 The main characteristics that 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.350
 has this app blocker that I'm 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.750
 sure they will be very useful to 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.030
 many since it always comes in handy 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.400
 more security in our device 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:39.389
 android and good one thing that I 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:42.150
 I forgot to tell them is that to activate 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:46.770
 profiles manually only 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:48.810
 just touch the main icon by 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:52.889
 example if I want to activate this profile 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:54.840
 of work we played in the center and already 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.820
 will activate the profile 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.840
 well I hope you liked this 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:03.540

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.699
 encourage to try it and if you liked or served 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.160

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:10.979

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.090
 community and nothing we see in a next 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:15.180
 video-tutorial
