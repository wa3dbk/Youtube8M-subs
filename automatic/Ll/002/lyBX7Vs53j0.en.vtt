they actually answered the question in a

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.480 
they actually answered the question in a
very<00:02:54.900> specific<00:02:55.260> way<00:02:56.090> they<00:02:57.090> told<00:02:57.450> me<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:58.490> in

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
very specific way they told me that in

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.250 
very specific way they told me that in
the<00:02:59.760> final<00:03:00.240> product<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:02.100> they<00:03:02.310> sell<00:03:03.260> there

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
the final product that they sell there

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.480 
the final product that they sell there
is<00:03:04.500> less<00:03:04.950> than<00:03:05.520> one<00:03:06.360> part<00:03:06.990> per<00:03:07.320> million<00:03:08.160> of

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
flora the first time anyone has given me

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.720 
flora the first time anyone has given me
a<00:03:12.209> specific<00:03:12.540> answer<00:03:13.140> meaning<00:03:13.740> that<00:03:14.040> they<00:03:14.280> test

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
a specific answer meaning that they test

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.420 
a specific answer meaning that they test
for<00:03:14.880> this<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.480> they<00:03:16.320> know<00:03:16.590> its<00:03:16.800> specific

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
for this and they know its specific

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.060 
for this and they know its specific
level<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.750> they<00:03:18.870> use<00:03:19.110> water<00:03:19.620> that's

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
level so they use water that's

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.390 
level so they use water that's
fluoridated<00:03:20.930> but<00:03:21.930> in<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.739> final<00:03:22.950> product

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
fluoridated but in the final product

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.420 
fluoridated but in the final product
less<00:03:24.330> than<00:03:24.570> one<00:03:24.870> part<00:03:25.380> per<00:03:25.620> million<00:03:26.070> in

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
care reform which is not a reform it's

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.390 
care reform which is not a reform it's
merely<00:03:58.730> a<00:04:00.760> it's<00:04:02.080> basically<00:04:03.280> forcing<00:04:04.280> the

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
merely a it's basically forcing the

insurance industry so basically it's a

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.190 
spending but I've talked about that
enough<00:04:24.880> I'll<00:04:25.880> probably<00:04:26.180> say<00:04:26.479> more<00:04:26.840> about<00:04:26.930> it

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
enough I'll probably say more about it

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.100 
enough I'll probably say more about it
again<00:04:27.320> later<00:04:27.680> because<00:04:28.040> it<00:04:28.190> just<00:04:29.110> aggravates

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
again later because it just aggravates
