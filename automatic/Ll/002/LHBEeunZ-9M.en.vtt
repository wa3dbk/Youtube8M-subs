all<00:01:02.430> my<00:01:02.789> hair<00:01:03.149> no<00:01:04.100> extensions<00:01:05.100> which<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.640> just

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
all my hair no extensions which I just

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.530 
all my hair no extensions which I just
didn't<00:01:06.510> want<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.750> put<00:01:07.049> any<00:01:08.299> extensions<00:01:09.299> in

didn't want to put any extensions in

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.340 
didn't want to put any extensions in
because<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.330> just<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:13.049> that

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
because I just I just think that that

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.770 
because I just I just think that that
kind<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.100> adds<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> tension<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.390> all<00:01:15.509> that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
kind of adds to the tension and all that

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.929 
kind of adds to the tension and all that
stuff<00:01:16.110> anyway<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.770> pretty<00:01:19.770> much<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.250> rated

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
stuff anyway so I pretty much it's rated

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.080 
stuff anyway so I pretty much it's rated
at<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.240> side<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.840> middle<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.759> is<00:01:26.090> twisted

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
at the side and the middle is is twisted

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.819

and<00:01:28.820> at<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.030> back<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.689> braided<00:01:31.020> up<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.590> little

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
and at the back it's braided up a little

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.380 
and at the back it's braided up a little
bit<00:01:33.110> like<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> nice<00:01:35.520> little<00:01:35.700> pattern<00:01:36.060> is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
