00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.730 

on<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.889> line<00:04:50.020> there's<00:04:51.020> any<00:04:51.229> won't<00:04:51.469> like<00:04:51.710> it

on the line there's any won't like it

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.800 
on the line there's any won't like it
but<00:04:51.979> I<00:04:52.189> thought<00:04:52.400> that<00:04:52.460> landed<00:04:53.060> on<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.270> line<00:04:53.449> I

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
but I thought that landed on the line I

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.010 
but I thought that landed on the line I
was<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.139> tightening<00:04:54.680> up<00:04:54.830> on<00:04:55.639> players<00:04:56.060> having

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
was a tightening up on players having

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:08.080 
was a tightening up on players having
about<00:04:57.400> horses<00:04:58.400> I<00:05:06.219> certainly<00:05:07.219> hasn't<00:05:07.550> affected

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
about horses I certainly hasn't affected

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.950 
about horses I certainly hasn't affected
it<00:05:08.289> no<00:05:09.289> no<00:05:09.469> faffing<00:05:09.710> about<00:05:09.889> that<00:05:10.629> is<00:05:11.629> right

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
it no no faffing about that is right

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:32.529 
it no no faffing about that is right
I'll<00:05:12.139> do<00:05:12.289> it<00:05:30.939> something<00:05:31.939> of<00:05:32.029> a<00:05:32.090> high-risk

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
I'll do it something of a high-risk

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.540 
I'll do it something of a high-risk
strategy<00:05:32.719> that<00:05:33.259> one<00:05:33.439> but<00:05:33.590> it<00:05:33.680> works<00:05:33.919> when<00:05:34.490> you

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
strategy that one but it works when you

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.689 
strategy that one but it works when you
playing<00:05:34.759> on<00:05:34.849> the<00:05:34.969> middle<00:05:35.150> of<00:05:35.180> the<00:05:35.270> court

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
there's a good time to play one but most

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.409 
there's a good time to play one but most
importantly<00:05:39.620> it<00:05:39.710> was<00:05:39.800> very<00:05:39.979> well<00:05:40.159> executed<00:05:40.419> if
