towing<00:03:41.860> one<00:03:42.130> time<00:03:42.340> there<00:03:42.580> was<00:03:42.730> a<00:03:43.030> whale<00:03:43.270> that

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
towing one time there was a whale that

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.780 
towing one time there was a whale that
beached<00:03:44.110> itself<00:03:44.440> because<00:03:45.130> we<00:03:45.340> have<00:03:45.550> a<00:03:45.580> lot<00:03:45.760> of

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
beached itself because we have a lot of

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.840 
beached itself because we have a lot of
waterfront<00:03:46.210> property<00:03:46.750> where<00:03:46.960> we<00:03:47.110> live<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.850> we

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
waterfront property where we live and we

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.520 
waterfront property where we live and we
were<00:03:49.000> called<00:03:49.270> out<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.480> recover<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.350> whale

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530

were called out to recover the whale
from<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.250> beach<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:51.640> I<00:03:51.670> think<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:52.030> that

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
from the beach so I think that that

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.390 
from the beach so I think that that
one's<00:03:52.390> pretty<00:03:52.570> unique<00:03:52.930> we<00:03:53.410> used<00:03:53.590> flatbed<00:03:54.130> and

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
one's pretty unique we used flatbed and

one<00:03:54.670> of<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.880> flatbeds<00:03:55.300> that<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.960> really<00:03:56.890> like

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
one of the flatbeds that I really like

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.250 
one of the flatbeds that I really like
is<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.700> righted<00:03:58.030> right<00:03:58.420> approach<00:03:58.750> flatbed

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
is the righted right approach flatbed

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.560 
is the righted right approach flatbed
