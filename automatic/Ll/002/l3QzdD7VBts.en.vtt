00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.290
 up to my 2,400 and thought the land was 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.420
 the center of the universe that revolved around 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.590
 around us this theory was known 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.600
 as today centrism in the mid-1500's 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.490
 Copernicus through studies has concluded 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.410
 that in fact the land was just more 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.830
 a planet in orbit around the star 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.640
 sun shifting all the vision fell on the mika 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.039
 of the time 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.560
 this new arrangement took the name of 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.690
 helium centrism now let's see one 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.370
 image of our solar system should be 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.590
 a little frustrating for a person 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.350
 from that time which was the center of 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.270
 everything is so low that point 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.950
 imagine how much it must have shaken 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.899
 pillars of the church when they know that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.300
 God's plans we were not in the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.190
 center by a difficult acceptance for the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.140
 religious thought of the time 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.289
 I even became so significant even for 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.360
 give it a patÃ© leco on it 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.239
 Well, this is more than 500 years ago. 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.579
 and today what we know today 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.610
 well here's a photo of the galaxy in 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.400
 that we lived the milky way that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.590
 more than 200 billion stars 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.659
 this great spot are clumps of 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.290
 stars and where the sun is 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.110
 here is the sun just another one in the middle 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.990
 of so many others in the galaxy can reach 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.009
 a few million to 500 million 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.110
 stars 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.119
 there are more stars in the universe than 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.890
 grain of sand on our beaches 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.799
 our brain just does not have 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.009
 ability to understand the 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.920
 greatness of that whole dimension you think 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.290
 ours started by playing neighborhoods well 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.110
 I'll move on to approach the gem gentlemen. 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.909
 this is the map of our universe every 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.880
 white spot you see is a 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.229
 galaxy cluster universe possesses 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:56.149
 more than 7 trillion visible galaxies 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.920
 wow, it's too big for damn it's too much 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.460
 already have these scientists studying the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.960
 possibility of having multiple universes 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.090
 that we would be just one more between 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.680
 many others 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.649
 today we know that there is still in our 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.209
 universe is approximately 13.7 billion 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.710
 of years 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.990
 now let's compare the universe 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.760
 as if it were a one-year calendar of the 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.130
 beginning until today 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.020
 Let's distribute this calendar 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.130
 beginning on 1 August and 31 December 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.770
 December 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.580
 now you ask where we are and where 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.740
 the human being would be well I'm going to reveal 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.080
 four days to the 31st day of 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.390
 December is missing here only those 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.790
 four days is when the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.740
 superior and dominant species of the planet 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.560
 that we know well today 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.930
 the dinosaurs, what have I been? 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.220
 They thought I was talking about who is 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.530
 we have to admit that dinosaurs 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.470
 duty and dominate our planet more 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.570
 of 200 million years a modern man 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.210
 that we know today has less than 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.730
 50,000 from the birth of Christ ie 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.580
 of the year to this day represents 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.530
 only the last four seconds on the day 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.190
 December 31th 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.960
 It's very little we just arrived and 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.840
 we are late 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.330
 we came to believe that we were the first 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.820
 reason for everything but the amount of life 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.040
 that can give life on other planets and 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.930
 why not intelligent life would be too 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.950
 selfishness on our part to think we are 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.720
 the only 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.550
 the only bacteria a grain of sand 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.600
 in this immense desert 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.300
 then you are still superior but as 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.050
 live with it like how to keep on 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.960
 front 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.420
 some people to live need and 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.610
 need a higher purpose one 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.980
 purpose that is placed on a plateau 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.520
 greater in existence often a 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.640
 Divine purpose well instead of believing 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.570
 early easy answers 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.330
 that has already defined the 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.610
 mysteries of the universe secrets of life 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.020
 contradicting much of what I said 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.400
 now but making you live 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.620
 comfortably 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.300
 but one in itself a possible comfort is 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.030
 illusory by the lack of questioning 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.880
 let history show us that 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.640
 much more complex and detailed answer 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.160
 of what we believed to be but we did not 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.480
 to be afraid and want to meet him 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.630
 I think the great motivation of 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.049
 existence and search for these answers 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.090
 understanding and rational understanding 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.669
 something very exciting and 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.750
 challenging and if I have felt 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.420
 live this 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.300
 the endless search for the mysteries of 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.640
 universe and life hide the doubt and 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.340
 curiosity is much more fascinating a 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.410
 The answer given is a book being 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.600
 written in real time and gives a lot of 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.820
 anxiety about knowing what will be next 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.000
 chapter for each response you 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.560
 we find one more question seems 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.970
 questions we might never get 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.980
 unveil life 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.180
 I think it was worth dying trying 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.820
 find them 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.040
 I hope you liked it if you liked it 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.960
 of the video click here and I liked it and did not 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.370
 forget to subscribe to the channel this is 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.940
 very important for the series to be 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.940
 prosper
