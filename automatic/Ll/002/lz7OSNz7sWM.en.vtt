604 all right but I think for everyday
use<00:05:24.550> I<00:05:24.820> do<00:05:25.390> think<00:05:25.600> that<00:05:25.660> one<00:05:25.960> could<00:05:26.650> take<00:05:26.800> the

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
use I do think that one could take the

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.470 
use I do think that one could take the
German<00:05:27.370> that<00:05:27.520> this<00:05:27.700> one<00:05:27.880> could<00:05:28.030> t<00:05:28.240> because

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
German that this one could t because

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.330 
German that this one could t because
that<00:05:28.630> one<00:05:28.750> is<00:05:28.780> because<00:05:29.230> a<00:05:29.260> real<00:05:29.620> big<00:05:29.950> like<00:05:30.130> the

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
that one is because a real big like the

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.180 
that one is because a real big like the
big<00:05:30.490> like<00:05:30.520> this<00:05:30.790> and<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.570> co<00:05:31.720> vania<00:05:31.990> is<00:05:32.170> and<00:05:32.470> I

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
big like this and the co vania is and I

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.520 
big like this and the co vania is and I
don't<00:05:33.430> think<00:05:33.610> that<00:05:33.730> those<00:05:34.170> headset<00:05:35.170> that<00:05:35.380> I

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
don't think that those headset that I

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.050 
don't think that those headset that I
had<00:05:35.710> said<00:05:35.950> could<00:05:36.130> check<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.460> German<00:05:36.910> that
