00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
also because they do produce some very

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.970

Neil<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> lot<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.940> history<00:01:00.180> thing<00:01:00.410> so

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
Neil is this a lot of history thing so

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.540 
Neil is this a lot of history thing so
it<00:01:01.469> was<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> big<00:01:01.770> decision<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> leave

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it was a big decision for you to leave

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.320 
it was a big decision for you to leave
and<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.780> think<00:01:04.710> adapting<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.159> I've<00:01:06.000> taken<00:01:06.210> him

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and I think adapting to I've taken him

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.210 
and I think adapting to I've taken him
time<00:01:06.540> he's<00:01:06.900> coming<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.200> an<00:01:07.380> injury<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.189> he's

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
time he's coming with an injury so he's

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.649 
time he's coming with an injury so he's
missed<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> first<00:01:08.939> part<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.420> that's

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
missed the first part and that's

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.300 
missed the first part and that's
obviously<00:01:09.869> when<00:01:10.320> there's<00:01:10.470> d-train<00:01:10.830> he's<00:01:11.130> dead

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
obviously when there's d-train he's dead

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.210 
obviously when there's d-train he's dead
and<00:01:11.750> i<00:01:12.750> think<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.290> taking<00:01:13.560> time<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.830> adapt<00:01:14.010> to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and i think is taking time to adapt to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.530 
and i think is taking time to adapt to
it<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.549> silly<00:01:14.939> things<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> weather

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
of training which is which is much much

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.060

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.130 
better qualities are obvious i think
that<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.340> manager<00:01:45.210> likes<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.600> also<00:01:45.960> knows

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
that the manager likes it also knows

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.080 
that the manager likes it also knows
that<00:01:46.170> there's<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> there's<00:01:47.429> a<00:01:47.520> way<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.700> go<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
that there's a there's a way to go and

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.730 
that there's a there's a way to go and
his<00:01:48.179> game<00:01:48.360> has<00:01:48.479> got<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.659> refine<00:01:48.990> some<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
his game has got to refine some of the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.050 
his game has got to refine some of the
aspects<00:01:50.069> to<00:01:50.189> his<00:01:50.280> game<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.670> i<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:50.819> he's<00:01:51.030> got

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
aspects to his game so i think he's got

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.350 
aspects to his game so i think he's got
more<00:01:52.020> effective<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:53.039> can<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:54.179> those

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
more effective if we can that those

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.480 
more effective if we can that those
types<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.810> players<00:01:55.020> i<00:01:55.170> think<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.439> greater<00:01:55.619> to

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
types and players i think it greater to

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.639 
types and players i think it greater to
watch<00:01:56.780> because<00:01:57.780> they<00:01:57.899> connect<00:01:58.200> everyone<00:01:58.469> in

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
watch because they connect everyone in

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.630 
watch because they connect everyone in
the<00:01:58.740> team<00:01:59.210> so<00:02:00.619> that's<00:02:01.619> sort<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.860> JV<00:02:02.159> quality

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
the team so that's sort of JV quality

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.389 
the team so that's sort of JV quality
that<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.819> have<00:02:03.030> all<00:02:03.209> moderate<00:02:03.630> qualities

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
that you have all moderate qualities

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.529 
that you have all moderate qualities
it's<00:02:05.399> great<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:05.700> almost<00:02:05.849> like<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.090> spider<00:02:06.390> in

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
it's great you almost like a spider in

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.350 
it's great you almost like a spider in
the<00:02:06.720> web<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.310> think<00:02:08.310> Giles<00:02:08.519> also<00:02:08.819> put<00:02:08.970> up<00:02:09.090> a

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
the web I think Giles also put up a

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.910 
the web I think Giles also put up a
little<00:02:09.780> bit<00:02:09.869> more<00:02:09.989> effective<00:02:10.380> in<00:02:10.500> terms<00:02:10.649> of

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
little bit more effective in terms of

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.640 
little bit more effective in terms of
goals<00:02:11.489> assists<00:02:12.120> key<00:02:12.329> passes<00:02:12.810> which<00:02:13.500> he

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
goals assists key passes which he

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.470 
goals assists key passes which he
recognizes<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.519> he's<00:02:14.849> working<00:02:15.060> really<00:02:15.239> hard

fact it's a straight quality that
they've<00:03:36.780> got<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.230> were<00:03:37.560> how<00:03:37.710> they've

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920

learned<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.370> Suarez<00:03:39.240> is<00:03:39.270> I<00:03:39.780> think<00:03:39.960> really

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
learned and Suarez is I think really

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.460 
learned and Suarez is I think really
similar<00:03:40.770> and<00:03:41.610> that's<00:03:41.760> other<00:03:41.940> quality<00:03:42.470> so

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
similar and that's other quality so

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.760 
similar and that's other quality so
though<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.770> not<00:03:44.000> it's<00:03:45.000> not<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.270> tallest

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
though is not it's not the tallest

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.930 
though is not it's not the tallest
certainly<00:03:46.770> how<00:03:46.920> he<00:03:46.980> protects<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.520> ball<00:03:47.700> and

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
certainly how he protects the ball and

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.810 
certainly how he protects the ball and
how<00:03:48.870> he<00:03:48.930> copes<00:03:49.230> in<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.530> premier<00:03:49.890> don't<00:03:50.670> think

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
how he copes in the premier don't think

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.620 
how he copes in the premier don't think
we're<00:03:51.000> problem<00:03:51.210> in<00:03:51.390> that<00:03:51.420> respect<00:03:51.840> okay
