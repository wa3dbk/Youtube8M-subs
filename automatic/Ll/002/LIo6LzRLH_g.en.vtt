00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.780

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.859
Hello friends, today they're going to bath me for the first time!

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:19.239
Yes of course!!!!

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.430
Here we are in the bathroom, we have mooved into the bathroom

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.189
to give you your first bath and we have to be very gentle.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.169
What do we need? Well basically a brush, a hair dryer,

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.240
towels , well acually the same as us, basically the same

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.460
We will start playing with him, the best place to do so is

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.400
the bathroom sink, we will let him run around and get used

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.130
to the place, after a few minutes

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.640
we will then

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.500
open the tap very slowly

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.940
making sure the water is warm

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.060
just as we would like

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.020
it

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.930
and also what we have to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.340
say is that

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.790
the first time we bath our pet rabbit, he has to be

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.360
completely neutered and vaccinated to make sure that their defenses are up to date and that the animal

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.380
will not catch any disease by doing this

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.330
Here you see  the head, that the first times I dont want to

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.210
wet his head much

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.980
and just like with us, you have to be very careful with the shampoo

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.829
right?

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.500
that it doesn't get into the eyes, as it stings

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.630
here we go

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.180
with the first soap

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.210
we will use

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.070
a generous amount of shampoo

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.070
this shampoo is special for small pets

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.420
Hey!!! you like it don't you!!

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.810
you're enjoying it aren't you!!!

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.299
come on, into the water again

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.159
very good!!

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.259
let's soap again

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.149
he's staying very still

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:18.089
and he likes it

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:20.259
let's rinse out the soap

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:21.839
Hey thats cool!

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.739
Also this is good like a radiotherapy, these massages are very

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.819
good for animals, just like us, it makes

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.950
their hair stronger

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.980
and vitalizes their hair and skin, look

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.549
he likes it because he is very still

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.069
isn't he?

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.449
you don't even look like a a rabbit, you look like a kangaroo!

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.829
a baby kangaroo!

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.079
You know what? I have had the chance to visit Japan

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.309
and in Japan there are real great hospitals for rabbits

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.539
there the rabbit is a very popular pet

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:56.599
they give them massages

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.969
it is so amazing what people are able to do

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.999
with these pets, they take them out for walks

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:09.999
there are even restaurants where you can find special food for them, its incredible!

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.209
I hope that one day Spain will take care

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.829
of their pets like they do there in Japan

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.649
Look, look how relaxed he is!

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:22.209
he is almost asleep

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.609
how he likes it, how he is enjoying it!!

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.119
and some people say that rabbits don't like water, well this is not the

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:29.389
case

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.679
this fellow is super relaxed here

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:39.679
and look, look he wants to dry himself, ooohhh

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.889
Thats nice, and here I come with the hair dryer so you feel

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.509
nice and warm

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:52.269
that's very nice!!

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.869
You like that!

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:04.869
How nice! Come on!

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:13.120
We will keep changing from the brush to

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.959
the hair dryer

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.719
to avoid hair knots and damage

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:24.719
the hair

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.520
Look at that

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.710
nice and fluffy!

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.240
We are ready

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.270
to go out for a walk!

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.110
See you later!!
