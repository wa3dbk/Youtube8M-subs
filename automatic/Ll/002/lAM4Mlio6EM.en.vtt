Underworld demonstrating good Mouse aim
but<00:00:30.240> I've<00:00:31.019> had<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.349> many<00:00:31.529> Lightning<00:00:31.980> gun<00:00:32.099> duels

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340

but I've had so many Lightning gun duels
it<00:00:32.550> was<00:00:32.730> hard<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.030> pick<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> good<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:33.870> from

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
it was hard to pick a good one from

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.459 
it was hard to pick a good one from
memory<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.790> one<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.940> did<00:00:36.210> include<00:00:36.480> didn't

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
memory and the one I did include didn't

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.799 
memory and the one I did include didn't
show<00:00:37.710> mouse<00:00:38.010> aim<00:00:38.250> as<00:00:38.399> well<00:00:38.610> as<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.850> intended<00:00:39.149> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
show mouse aim as well as I intended and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.350 
show mouse aim as well as I intended and
I<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.590> feel<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.219> added<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> video<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.149> an

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
I I feel it added the video to an

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.229 
I I feel it added the video to an
unnecessary<00:00:42.690> length<00:00:43.350> through<00:00:43.710> its<00:00:44.610> series<00:00:45.149> of

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
unnecessary length through its series of

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.619 
unnecessary length through its series of
25<00:00:45.690> minutes<00:00:46.879> recently<00:00:47.879> though<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.120> think<00:00:48.510> it

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
25 minutes recently though I think it
