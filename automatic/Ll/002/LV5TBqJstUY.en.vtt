00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
always believed with photography there's

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.850 
always believed with photography there's
there<00:01:32.330> is<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.479> function<00:01:33.020> connected<00:01:33.590> with<00:01:33.770> the

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
there is a function connected with the

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.520 
there is a function connected with the
photography<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:34.640> therefore<00:01:35.030> if<00:01:35.750> you're<00:01:36.110> doing

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530

because<00:02:37.040> they<00:02:37.160> need<00:02:37.310> help<00:02:37.489> it's<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:37.910> very<00:02:38.090> poor

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
because they need help it's a very poor

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.580 
because they need help it's a very poor
country

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.240 

I<00:02:44.680> think<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.550> biggest<00:02:45.870> problem<00:02:47.010> for<00:02:48.010> me<00:02:48.129> and

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
I think the biggest problem for me and

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.089 
I think the biggest problem for me and
going<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.580> do<00:02:48.670> this<00:02:48.819> project<00:02:49.170> was<00:02:50.170> where<00:02:50.950> the

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
going to do this project was where the

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.369 
going to do this project was where the
project<00:02:51.519> was<00:02:51.640> going<00:02:51.849> to<00:02:52.000> end<00:02:52.150> up<00:02:52.300> so<00:02:52.750> if<00:02:53.019> I<00:02:53.200> was

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
project was going to end up so if I was

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.410 
project was going to end up so if I was
going<00:02:53.530> there<00:02:53.620> very<00:02:54.310> often<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.910> have<00:02:55.390> a

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
going there very often I I have a

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.059 
going there very often I I have a
different<00:02:55.629> approach<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.739> things<00:02:58.860> so<00:02:59.860> if<00:02:59.950> I'm

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
different approach to things so if I'm

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.430 
different approach to things so if I'm
photographing<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:01.030> cover<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.720> Rolling<00:03:01.989> Stone<00:03:02.230> I

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
photographing a cover of Rolling Stone I

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.559 
photographing a cover of Rolling Stone I
know<00:03:02.500> what<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:02.920> function<00:03:03.220> is<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.670> as<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.360> said<00:03:04.420> a

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
know what the function is it as I said a

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.170 
know what the function is it as I said a
minute<00:03:04.780> ago<00:03:04.930> it's<00:03:05.230> maybe<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:06.250> promote<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
minute ago it's maybe to promote the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.000 
minute ago it's maybe to promote the
person<00:03:07.569> is<00:03:07.690> maybe<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.110> promote<00:03:08.440> Rolling<00:03:08.739> Stone

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
person is maybe to promote Rolling Stone

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.809 
person is maybe to promote Rolling Stone
whatever<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.410> case<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.650> going<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.280> Baneen

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
whatever in the case of going to Baneen

whatever in the case of going to Baneen
for<00:03:13.599> me<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.989> final<00:03:14.410> product<00:03:14.650> here<00:03:15.190> although

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
for me the final product here although

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.569 
for me the final product here although
it<00:03:15.790> had<00:03:15.940> had<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.239> function<00:03:16.750> as<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:17.019> said<00:03:17.260> earlier

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
it had had a function as I said earlier

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.370 
it had had a function as I said earlier
that<00:03:18.579> there<00:03:19.269> was<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.450> function<00:03:19.930> for<00:03:20.079> going

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
that there was a function for going

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.190 
that there was a function for going
there<00:03:20.590> but<00:03:21.489> at<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.700> same<00:03:21.910> time<00:03:22.269> this<00:03:22.959> wasn't

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
there but at the same time this wasn't

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.080 
there but at the same time this wasn't
going<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.560> go<00:03:23.739> into<00:03:23.860> National<00:03:24.340> Geographic<00:03:24.519> and

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
going to go into National Geographic and

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.559 
going to go into National Geographic and
it<00:03:25.720> wasn't<00:03:26.019> going<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.319> go<00:03:26.470> into<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:28.120> know<00:03:28.150> book

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
it wasn't going to go into you know book

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.839 
it wasn't going to go into you know book
necessarily<00:03:29.349> but<00:03:30.099> it<00:03:30.220> was<00:03:30.340> going<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.549> end<00:03:30.579> up

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
necessarily but it was going to end up

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.270 
necessarily but it was going to end up
in<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.120> wall<00:03:31.329> in<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.599> museum<00:03:31.989> so<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.920> minute<00:03:33.190> that

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
in a wall in a museum so the minute that

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.979 
in a wall in a museum so the minute that
something<00:03:33.670> ends<00:03:33.849> up<00:03:33.970> in<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.209> wall<00:03:34.390> in<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.599> museum

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
something ends up in a wall in a museum

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.190 
something ends up in a wall in a museum
this<00:03:35.799> is<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:35.980> different<00:03:36.459> function<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:37.690> it's<00:03:38.049> a

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
this is a different function so it's a

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.319 
this is a different function so it's a
museum<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:39.220> has<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.459> have<00:03:39.790> the

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
museum and it has to have the

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.000 
museum and it has to have the
photography<00:03:40.870> has<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.170> have<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.319> certain<00:03:41.410> power

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
photography has to have a certain power

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.600 
photography has to have a certain power
I<00:03:42.370> think<00:03:42.730> a<00:03:42.879> certain<00:03:43.599> weight<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:45.250> couldn't

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
I think a certain weight and I couldn't

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.880 
I think a certain weight and I couldn't
just<00:03:45.730> go<00:03:45.970> around<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.510> do<00:03:46.690> too<00:03:47.410> many<00:03:47.530> snapshots

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
just go around and do too many snapshots

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.520 
just go around and do too many snapshots
and<00:03:48.430> hope<00:03:48.609> that<00:03:48.819> when<00:03:48.940> I<00:03:48.970> came<00:03:49.090> here<00:03:49.600> to

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
and hope that when I came here to

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.900 
and hope that when I came here to
Hamburg<00:03:50.889> to<00:03:51.100> do<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.340> show<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:51.760> the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
Hamburg to do the show that the

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.569 
Hamburg to do the show that the
snapshots<00:03:52.720> good<00:03:52.959> work<00:03:53.170> because<00:03:54.100> then<00:03:54.280> what

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
snapshots good work because then what

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.220 
snapshots good work because then what
happens<00:03:54.940> sometimes<00:03:55.450> with<00:03:55.630> photographers

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
happens sometimes with photographers

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.740 
happens sometimes with photographers
they<00:03:56.799> can<00:03:57.040> end<00:03:57.609> up<00:03:57.850> with<00:03:58.090> pictures<00:03:58.299> that<00:03:58.660> are

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
they can end up with pictures that are

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.449 
they can end up with pictures that are
not<00:03:58.900> strong<00:03:59.200> enough<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.620> the<00:04:00.040> only<00:04:00.190> way<00:04:00.400> to

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
not strong enough and the only way to

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.280 
not strong enough and the only way to
present<00:04:00.910> them<00:04:01.090> is<00:04:01.209> snapshot<00:04:01.720> so<00:04:01.930> you<00:04:01.989> say<00:04:02.260> I

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
present them is snapshot so you say I

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.620 
present them is snapshot so you say I
took<00:04:02.410> snapshots<00:04:02.799> and<00:04:03.250> here<00:04:03.400> they<00:04:03.519> are<00:04:03.599> but<00:04:04.599> I

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
took snapshots and here they are but I

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.300 
took snapshots and here they are but I
was<00:04:04.840> interested<00:04:05.349> in<00:04:05.410> something<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.920> little<00:04:06.099> bit

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
was interested in something a little bit

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.059 
was interested in something a little bit
stronger<00:04:06.609> so<00:04:07.209> I<00:04:07.239> did<00:04:07.510> do<00:04:07.720> some<00:04:07.959> snapshots<00:04:08.260> but

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
stronger so I did do some snapshots but

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.440 
stronger so I did do some snapshots but
I<00:04:09.099> in<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.430> end<00:04:09.549> I<00:04:09.700> was<00:04:09.849> interested<00:04:10.359> in

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
I in the end I was interested in

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.660 
I in the end I was interested in
something<00:04:11.230> that<00:04:11.410> was<00:04:11.769> a<00:04:11.799> little<00:04:12.040> bit<00:04:12.340> bigger

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
something that was a little bit bigger

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.490 
something that was a little bit bigger
and<00:04:13.090> more<00:04:13.900> important<00:04:14.530> so<00:04:15.329> I<00:04:16.329> had<00:04:17.289> thought

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
and more important so I had thought

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.500 
and more important so I had thought
about<00:04:17.560> this<00:04:18.010> before<00:04:18.250> I<00:04:18.489> went<00:04:18.700> of<00:04:18.910> course<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.389> I

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
about this before I went of course and I

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.029 
about this before I went of course and I
was<00:04:22.510> of<00:04:22.660> course<00:04:22.840> interested<00:04:23.470> in<00:04:23.590> portraiture

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
was of course interested in portraiture

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.310 
was of course interested in portraiture
I<00:04:24.460> was<00:04:24.970> interested<00:04:25.450> in<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.630> people<00:04:25.840> i<00:04:26.200> was

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
I was interested in the people i was

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.430 
I was interested in the people i was
interested<00:04:26.710> in<00:04:27.510> voodoo<00:04:28.510> which<00:04:28.810> is<00:04:28.960> a<00:04:28.990> big<00:04:29.229> part

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
interested in voodoo which is a big part

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.560 
interested in voodoo which is a big part
of<00:04:29.530> benin<00:04:29.919> i<00:04:30.160> was<00:04:30.910> interested<00:04:31.270> in<00:04:31.510> the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
of benin i was interested in the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.450 
of benin i was interested in the
difference<00:04:31.990> between<00:04:32.110> north<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.770> south<00:04:32.889> the

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
difference between north and south the

because the work is so diversified that

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:18.749 
because the work is so diversified that

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
of course sometimes people have a

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:20.189 
of course sometimes people have a
problem<00:06:19.209> with<00:06:19.329> it<00:06:19.360> because<00:06:19.569> it's<00:06:19.839> diversified

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
problem with it because it's diversified

problem with it because it's diversified
so<00:06:21.099> the<00:06:21.219> advantage<00:06:21.639> is<00:06:22.149> it's<00:06:22.629> a<00:06:22.839> diversified

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:23.829 
so the advantage is it's a diversified

00:06:23.829 --> 00:06:26.389 
so the advantage is it's a diversified
and<00:06:24.009> the<00:06:24.129> disadvantage<00:06:24.849> it's<00:06:25.509> diversified

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:26.399 
and the disadvantage it's diversified

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:29.069 
and the disadvantage it's diversified
