leap which we'll get to that phone in a

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.830 
leap which we'll get to that phone in a
minute<00:00:27.570> actually<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.439> think<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.710> got<00:00:28.859> it

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
minute actually I think I got it

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.729 
minute actually I think I got it
that's<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.990> shield<00:00:32.300> here<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:33.360> go<00:00:33.739> they

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
that's the shield here we go they

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.380 
that's the shield here we go they
announced<00:00:34.980> his<00:00:35.130> BlackBerry<00:00:35.579> leap<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
announced his BlackBerry leap and the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.930 
announced his BlackBerry leap and the
BlackBerry<00:00:36.809> leap<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.230> actually<00:00:37.770> not<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.670> bad

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
BlackBerry leap is actually not a bad

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.340 
BlackBerry leap is actually not a bad
device<00:00:39.440> but<00:00:40.440> I'm<00:00:40.559> kind<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.640> mind<00:00:41.879> of

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
device but I'm kind of of the mind of

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.560 
device but I'm kind of of the mind of
why<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:44.190> BlackBerry<00:00:44.640> leap<00:00:44.850> doesn't<00:00:45.420> really

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
why the BlackBerry leap doesn't really

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.240 
why the BlackBerry leap doesn't really
bring<00:00:45.870> anything<00:00:46.079> new<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> table<00:00:46.890> outside

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
bring anything new to the table outside

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.790 
bring anything new to the table outside
of<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.730> BlackBerry<00:00:48.149> z30<00:00:48.660> they<00:00:49.410> both<00:00:49.590> have

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
of the BlackBerry z30 they both have

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.430 
of the BlackBerry z30 they both have
720p<00:00:50.550> displays<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.629> think<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> display

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
720p displays and I think the display

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.290 
720p displays and I think the display
they<00:00:53.039> didn't<00:00:53.250> say<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> LeapPad<00:00:53.969> but<00:00:54.270> I

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
they didn't say with the LeapPad but I

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.930 
they didn't say with the LeapPad but I
think<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.260> display<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.070> z30<00:00:56.670> where<00:00:56.820> it's

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
think the display on the z30 where it's

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.520 
think the display on the z30 where it's
an<00:00:57.030> AMOLED<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.539> gonna<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.780> better<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.350> is

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
an AMOLED is gonna be better if this is

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.579 
an AMOLED is gonna be better if this is
an<00:00:58.649> LCD<00:01:01.430> so<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.460> don't<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.910> need<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.589> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
an LCD so I don't see the need for the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.039 
an LCD so I don't see the need for the
leap<00:01:04.799> unless<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.760> renewal<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.630> what

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
leap unless it's a renewal of what

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.399 
leap unless it's a renewal of what
they're<00:01:07.200> trying<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:08.390> with<00:01:09.390> bb10<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
they're trying to do with bb10 and

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.510 
they're trying to do with bb10 and
whatnot<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:10.979> wanted<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.340> another
