uncomfortable is too much praise and

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.930 
uncomfortable is too much praise and
which<00:06:10.440> is<00:06:10.560> ironic<00:06:11.070> because<00:06:11.100> you<00:06:11.640> know<00:06:11.760> as<00:06:11.880> a

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
which is ironic because you know as a

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.190 
which is ironic because you know as a
kid<00:06:12.060> growing<00:06:12.330> up<00:06:12.390> that's<00:06:12.600> all<00:06:12.780> I<00:06:12.810> wanted<00:06:13.140> was

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
kid growing up that's all I wanted was

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.860 
kid growing up that's all I wanted was
people<00:06:13.530> to<00:06:13.680> put<00:06:13.860> me<00:06:13.980> over<00:06:14.360> which<00:06:15.360> is<00:06:15.480> why<00:06:15.600> I<00:06:15.630> got

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
people to put me over which is why I got

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.360 
people to put me over which is why I got
into<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.110> sport<00:06:16.440> so<00:06:16.590> I<00:06:16.650> could<00:06:16.800> be<00:06:16.890> cheered<00:06:17.220> by

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
into the sport so I could be cheered by

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.070 
into the sport so I could be cheered by
perfect<00:06:17.610> strangers<00:06:17.790> because<00:06:18.750> I<00:06:18.840> thought<00:06:18.960> it

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
perfect strangers because I thought it

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.540 
perfect strangers because I thought it
would<00:06:19.140> fill<00:06:19.410> the<00:06:19.530> emptiness<00:06:19.860> I<00:06:20.100> had<00:06:20.250> inside

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
would fill the emptiness I had inside

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.760 
would fill the emptiness I had inside
which<00:06:20.910> it<00:06:21.060> didn't<00:06:21.390> but<00:06:21.720> I<00:06:21.900> filled<00:06:22.470> that<00:06:22.530> you

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
which it didn't but I filled that you

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.210 
which it didn't but I filled that you
know<00:06:22.890> I<00:06:22.920> ended<00:06:23.520> up<00:06:23.580> filling<00:06:23.820> that<00:06:24.000> myself<00:06:24.240> but

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
know I ended up filling that myself but

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.590 
know I ended up filling that myself but
but<00:06:26.220> the<00:06:26.340> irony<00:06:26.640> is<00:06:26.820> is<00:06:26.970> all<00:06:27.120> I<00:06:27.150> ever<00:06:27.270> wanted

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
but the irony is is all I ever wanted

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.450 
but the irony is is all I ever wanted
was<00:06:27.780> to<00:06:27.810> be<00:06:27.930> praised<00:06:28.320> by<00:06:28.500> perfect<00:06:28.950> strangers

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
was to be praised by perfect strangers

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.050 
was to be praised by perfect strangers
and<00:06:29.640> yet<00:06:30.330> when<00:06:30.510> they<00:06:30.630> do<00:06:30.690> a<00:06:31.640> first<00:06:32.640> I'd<00:06:32.820> scrape

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
and yet when they do a first I'd scrape

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.340 
and yet when they do a first I'd scrape
but<00:06:33.210> then<00:06:33.360> all<00:06:33.480> of<00:06:33.540> a<00:06:33.660> sudden<00:06:33.690> it<00:06:34.080> becomes

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
but then all of a sudden it becomes

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.960 
but then all of a sudden it becomes
really<00:06:34.560> uncomfortable<00:06:35.130> so<00:06:35.310> it's<00:06:35.490> just<00:06:35.640> rather

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
really uncomfortable so it's just rather
