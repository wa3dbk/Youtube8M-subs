that I'm building I'm working on getting
it<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:13.020> use<00:00:13.740> wood<00:00:13.950> pellets

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
it to use wood pellets

it to use wood pellets
a lot<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.510> seasoned<00:00:16.020> firewood<00:00:16.290> this<00:00:16.680> year<00:00:16.920> so

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
a lot of seasoned firewood this year so

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.250 
a lot of seasoned firewood this year so
to<00:00:17.580> get<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.850> started<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.870> need<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.080> take<00:00:19.230> a

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
to get it started you need to take a

fuel<00:00:27.300> tray<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:31.140> then<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.350> just<00:00:31.530> take

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
fuel tray and then you just take

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.900 
fuel tray and then you just take
yourself<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.129> propane<00:00:32.790> torch<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:38.250> that'll<00:00:38.760> get

back take a look at this thing it's just

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.940 
back take a look at this thing it's just
made<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.860> old<00:01:08.039> air<00:01:08.250> compressor<00:01:08.789> tank<00:01:09.950> and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
made out of old air compressor tank and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.540 
made out of old air compressor tank and
I<00:01:11.130> molded<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.720> homemade<00:01:13.530> refractory<00:01:14.100> clay<00:01:14.369> out

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
I molded so homemade refractory clay out

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.990 
I molded so homemade refractory clay out
of<00:01:14.640> cat<00:01:14.820> litter<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.119> vermiculite<00:01:16.610> these<00:01:17.610> PVC

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
of cat litter and vermiculite these PVC

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.190 
of cat litter and vermiculite these PVC
pipe<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.420> form<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:21.240> chambers<00:01:21.690> within<00:01:21.929> it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
pipe to form the chambers within it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.580 
pipe to form the chambers within it
you'll<00:01:23.100> notice<00:01:23.399> I've<00:01:23.550> left<00:01:23.729> some<00:01:23.970> extra<00:01:24.300> room

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
this is so I can build a heat exchanger

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.980 
this is so I can build a heat exchanger
and<00:01:27.270> use<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.539> to<00:01:27.660> heat<00:01:27.869> water<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:29.599> a<00:01:30.599> hydronic

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and use it to heat water for a hydronic

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.359 
and use it to heat water for a hydronic
heating<00:01:32.119> system<00:01:33.800> take<00:01:34.800> a<00:01:34.830> look<00:01:35.069> and<00:01:35.190> see

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
heating system take a look and see

heating system take a look and see
what's<00:01:35.550> going<00:01:35.849> on<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.179> there<00:01:37.369> see<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.490> diesels

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
what's going on in there see the diesels

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
may be able to see some of the smoke for

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.510 
may be able to see some of the smoke for
me<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:09.670> there<00:02:12.120> pretty<00:02:13.120> fascinating<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.840> watch

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
take much more to get it ready

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.310 
take much more to get it ready
you<00:02:41.730> just<00:02:41.910> put<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> grill<00:02:42.390> over<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.780> top<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.020> it

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
you just put a grill over the top of it

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.910 
you just put a grill over the top of it
and<00:02:43.380> be<00:02:43.560> ready<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:43.890> go<00:02:45.320> try<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.350> get<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.590> view

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
and be ready to go try to get a view

00:02:46.920 --> 00:03:01.610 
and be ready to go try to get a view
down<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:47.370> there

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.350 

you<00:03:01.799> see<00:03:02.280> how<00:03:02.459> high<00:03:02.700> those<00:03:02.849> flames<00:03:03.180> are

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
you see how high those flames are

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.100 
you see how high those flames are
shooting

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.110 

still<00:03:07.830> coming<00:03:08.160> up<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.400> temperature

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.000 

once<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:11.900> gets<00:03:12.050> there<00:03:12.319> that<00:03:12.530> smoke<00:03:12.860> will

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
once it gets there that smoke will

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.010 
once it gets there that smoke will
completely<00:03:13.489> clear<00:03:13.880> up

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.430 

things<00:03:18.980> pretty<00:03:19.510> hungry<00:03:20.510> for<00:03:20.840> pellets<00:03:21.230> which

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
things pretty hungry for pellets which

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.070 
things pretty hungry for pellets which
is<00:03:21.620> good<00:03:21.830> I<00:03:22.100> need<00:03:22.550> it<00:03:22.670> produce<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.180> lot<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.450> BTUs

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
is good I need it produce a lot of BTUs

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.250 
is good I need it produce a lot of BTUs
to<00:03:24.320> eat<00:03:24.500> a<00:03:24.530> lot<00:03:24.800> of<00:03:24.830> water<00:03:25.720> so<00:03:26.720> I<00:03:26.750> plan<00:03:26.990> to<00:03:27.020> eat

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
to eat a lot of water so I plan to eat

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.550 
to eat a lot of water so I plan to eat
in<00:03:27.350> my<00:03:27.440> house<00:03:27.680> as<00:03:28.330> well<00:03:30.610> as<00:03:31.610> my<00:03:31.880> water<00:03:32.180> off<00:03:32.560> of

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
in my house as well as my water off of

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.060 
in my house as well as my water off of
this<00:03:33.740> system<00:03:34.690> I'll<00:03:35.690> have<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.230> capacity<00:03:36.920> or<00:03:37.010> not

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.760 

but<00:03:41.070> we'll<00:03:41.310> find<00:03:41.550> out<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:43.290> figure<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.710> out

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
but we'll find out to figure that out

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.340 
but we'll find out to figure that out
and<00:03:44.100> I'm<00:03:44.540> taking<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.600> number<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:45.930> BTUs<00:03:46.320> per

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
and I'm taking the number of BTUs per

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.650 
and I'm taking the number of BTUs per
pound<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:48.290> these<00:03:49.290> wood<00:03:49.530> pellets<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.970> finding

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
pound of these wood pellets and finding

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.830 
pound of these wood pellets and finding
how<00:03:51.780> long<00:03:52.020> it<00:03:52.230> takes<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.560> burn<00:03:52.800> a<00:03:52.830> pound<00:03:53.130> and

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
how long it takes to burn a pound and

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.980 
how long it takes to burn a pound and
that<00:03:54.840> would<00:03:54.960> give<00:03:55.110> me<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.230> good<00:03:55.410> way<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.620> gauge

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
that would give me a good way to gauge

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.390 
that would give me a good way to gauge
theoretically<00:03:58.160> depending<00:03:59.160> on<00:03:59.250> the

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
theoretically depending on the

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.190 
theoretically depending on the
efficiency<00:04:00.000> of<00:04:00.030> my<00:04:00.240> system<00:04:00.770> how<00:04:01.770> many<00:04:01.950> BTUs<00:04:02.580> I

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
efficiency of my system how many BTUs I

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.860 
efficiency of my system how many BTUs I
can<00:04:04.200> produce<00:04:04.560> for<00:04:04.800> heating<00:04:05.750> thanks<00:04:06.750> for
