up being on the title track you know was

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.110 
up being on the title track you know was
just<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.590> those<00:00:34.770> things<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> cool

just one of those things it is a cool

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.420 
just one of those things it is a cool
box<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.590> got<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.890> find<00:00:38.100> your<00:00:38.219> own<00:00:38.399> voice

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430

with<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.120> guess<00:00:39.149> that's<00:00:39.510> what<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.780> but

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
with it I guess that's what it is but

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.139 
with it I guess that's what it is but
anyway<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.980> nuts<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.340> bolts<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.760> put<00:00:42.059> it

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
anyway the nuts and bolts of it put it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.380 
anyway the nuts and bolts of it put it
first<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:43.200> always<00:00:43.379> first<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.980> at<00:00:44.160> first<00:00:44.430> if

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
first it's always first out at first if

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
first it's always first out at first if
you're<00:00:45.629> looking<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> really<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.680> rock<00:00:47.219> tone

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.029 
you're looking for a really a rock tone
it<00:00:47.940> wants<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.570> mess<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.350> your<00:00:49.500> tone<00:00:49.710> first

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
it wants to mess with your tone first

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.650 
it wants to mess with your tone first
before<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.910> any<00:00:51.059> kind<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.300> distortion

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
before you get to any kind of distortion

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.750 
before you get to any kind of distortion

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
or delay so right now we got a little

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.630 
or delay so right now we got a little
saturator<00:00:54.350> we<00:00:55.350> got<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> little<00:00:55.800> delay<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.399> there

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
saturator we got a little delay on there

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.869 
saturator we got a little delay on there
and<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:57.750> got<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> wah-wah<00:00:58.430> that's<00:00:59.430> work<00:00:59.670> and

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
and we got a wah-wah that's work and

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.490 
and we got a wah-wah that's work and
this<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.149> little<00:01:00.420> funky<00:01:00.629> prototype<00:01:01.289> that's

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
this is a little funky prototype that's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.410 
this is a little funky prototype that's
why<00:01:01.649> it's<00:01:01.800> called<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.100> Joe<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.940> doesn't<00:01:03.210> say

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
why it's called a Joe and it doesn't say

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.570 
why it's called a Joe and it doesn't say
box<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.989> Joe<00:01:04.350> nice<00:01:04.799> we're<00:01:05.159> working<00:01:05.460> on

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
box on Joe nice we're working on

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.250 
box on Joe nice we're working on
something<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.510> think<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.990> should<00:01:07.020> maybe

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
something but I think we should maybe

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.780 
something but I think we should maybe
play<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> little<00:01:07.650> bit<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.950> song<00:01:08.250> excerpt<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
play a little bit of a song excerpt and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.190 
play a little bit of a song excerpt and
then<00:01:08.939> maybe<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> same<00:01:09.540> idea<00:01:09.810> let's<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.080> what

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
then maybe the same idea let's see what

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.359 
then maybe the same idea let's see what
it<00:01:10.290> sounds<00:01:10.590> without<00:01:11.070> it

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
it sounds without it

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.070 
it sounds without it
yeah<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.000> then<00:01:12.270> with<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:12.869> should<00:01:12.990> we

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
yeah and then with it what should we

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.920 
yeah and then with it what should we
play<00:01:13.460> how<00:01:14.460> about<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.909> favorite<00:01:15.360> song<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.780> mine

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
you record it to make sure it's full

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.680 
you record it to make sure it's full
bandwidth<00:02:10.769> and<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.069> play<00:02:12.030> around<00:02:12.299> with<00:02:12.480> some

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
bandwidth and you play around with some

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.539 
bandwidth and you play around with some
limiting<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.410> can<00:02:13.560> get<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.920> really<00:02:14.190> have

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
limiting you can get it to really have

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.880 
limiting you can get it to really have
its<00:02:14.730> own<00:02:14.880> voice<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.150> I'm<00:02:16.019> thinking<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.440> summer
