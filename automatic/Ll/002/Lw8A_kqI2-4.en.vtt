door<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.510> know<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:10.410> I've<00:00:10.559> already<00:00:10.769> built<00:00:11.099> one

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
door I know that I've already built one

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.600 
door I know that I've already built one
of<00:00:11.309> these<00:00:11.490> but<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.300> built<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.380> much<00:00:13.799> more<00:00:14.099> compact

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
of these but I built a much more compact

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.109 
of these but I built a much more compact
one<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:16.109> much<00:00:16.289> smarter<00:00:16.740> one<00:00:17.160> considering

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
one and a much smarter one considering

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.859 
one and a much smarter one considering
that<00:00:18.170> it<00:00:19.170> knows<00:00:19.529> whether<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.340> lost<00:00:20.699> or<00:00:21.180> like

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
that it knows whether you lost or like

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.450 
that it knows whether you lost or like
if<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.199> didn't<00:00:22.500> type<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.890> password<00:00:22.949> right

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
if you didn't type in the password right

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.269 
if you didn't type in the password right
or<00:00:23.760> if<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.000> did<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.560> it<00:00:25.560> has<00:00:25.800> music

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
or if you did and it has music

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.009 
or if you did and it has music
associated<00:00:27.119> with<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.359> which<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.720> kind<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:27.960> cool

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
that if you get rid of the connecting

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.630 
that if you get rid of the connecting
the<00:02:35.150> buttons<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.930> parts<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.859> yeah<00:02:37.609> i

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
the buttons to the parts of it yeah i

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.670 
the buttons to the parts of it yeah i
guess<00:02:37.760> i'll<00:02:38.030> show<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.269> guys<00:02:38.480> how<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.780> works<00:02:38.930> so

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
guess i'll show you guys how it works so

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.800 
guess i'll show you guys how it works so
over<00:02:39.890> here<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:40.340> my<00:02:40.670> very<00:02:40.910> first<00:02:41.120> model<00:02:41.540> oh<00:02:41.660> yeah

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
over here is my very first model oh yeah

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.030 
over here is my very first model oh yeah
and<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:41.989> reason<00:02:42.260> why<00:02:42.500> there's<00:02:42.739> like<00:02:42.890> this

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
and the reason why there's like this

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.750 
and the reason why there's like this
moat<00:02:43.400> here<00:02:43.730> is<00:02:43.910> so<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.870> i<00:02:45.049> know<00:02:45.799> what's<00:02:46.459> in

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
moat here is so that i know what's in

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.690 
moat here is so that i know what's in
there<00:02:47.000> not<00:02:47.420> like<00:02:48.319> copy<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:48.980> like<00:02:49.160> if<00:02:49.310> i<00:02:49.400> want<00:02:49.609> to

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
there not like copy so like if i want to

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.759 
there not like copy so like if i want to
copy<00:02:49.910> paste<00:02:50.269> something<00:02:50.540> maybe<00:02:51.109> into<00:02:51.500> another

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
copy paste something maybe into another

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.190 
copy paste something maybe into another
test<00:02:52.130> world<00:02:52.430> or<00:02:52.760> something<00:02:53.120> then<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.870> don't

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
test world or something then I don't

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.690 
test world or something then I don't
have<00:02:54.319> to<00:02:54.440> deal<00:02:54.650> with<00:02:54.799> any<00:02:55.010> extra<00:02:55.430> blocks

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
have to deal with any extra blocks

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.229 
have to deal with any extra blocks
coming<00:02:56.180> in<00:02:56.299> so<00:02:57.169> anyway<00:02:57.410> let's<00:02:58.220> show<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.459> let's

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
coming in so anyway let's show it let's

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.229 
coming in so anyway let's show it let's
show<00:02:59.389> how<00:02:59.540> it<00:02:59.660> works<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.549> this<00:03:01.549> is<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.880> rig<00:03:02.060> and

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
show how it works so this is the rig and

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.349 
show how it works so this is the rig and
actually<00:03:02.780> it's<00:03:02.900> not<00:03:03.139> on<00:03:03.380> right<00:03:04.069> it<00:03:04.819> should<00:03:05.329> be

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
actually it's not on right it should be

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.280 
actually it's not on right it should be
let's<00:03:06.049> reset<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.910> there<00:03:07.910> we<00:03:08.060> go<00:03:08.209> so<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.200> way<00:03:09.260> it

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
let's reset it there we go so the way it

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.650 
let's reset it there we go so the way it
works<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.829> we've<00:03:10.489> got<00:03:10.519> a<00:03:10.730> set<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.120> RS<00:03:11.419> nor<00:03:11.599> latch

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
works is we've got a set of RS nor latch

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.599 
works is we've got a set of RS nor latch
is<00:03:12.049> here<00:03:12.260> all<00:03:12.440> connected<00:03:13.160> like

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
is here all connected like

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.220 
is here all connected like
interconnected<00:03:14.540> using<00:03:15.549> repeaters<00:03:16.549> and

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
interconnected using repeaters and

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.839 
interconnected using repeaters and
redstone<00:03:18.230> torches<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.160> design<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.549> all

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
redstone torches and this design is all

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.059 
redstone torches and this design is all
mine<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.269> did<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:20.989> came<00:03:21.319> up<00:03:21.470> with<00:03:21.500> all<00:03:21.769> of<00:03:21.799> this

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
mine I did I came up with all of this

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.240 
mine I did I came up with all of this
over<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.430> weekend<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:24.500> turned<00:03:24.769> out<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.130> go

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
over the weekend and it turned out to go

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.180 
over the weekend and it turned out to go
pretty<00:03:25.639> well<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:26.000> like<00:03:26.389> it<00:03:26.599> and<00:03:26.750> it's<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.980> most

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
pretty well I like it and it's the most

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.129 
pretty well I like it and it's the most
compact<00:03:28.609> I've<00:03:28.790> ever<00:03:28.970> seen<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.560> full<00:03:30.560> auto<00:03:32.139> you

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
compact I've ever seen a full auto you

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.990 
compact I've ever seen a full auto you
know<00:03:33.290> password<00:03:33.769> lock<00:03:34.099> door<00:03:34.370> that<00:03:34.579> drops<00:03:34.849> you

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
know password lock door that drops you

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.400 
know password lock door that drops you
if<00:03:35.120> you<00:03:35.180> get<00:03:35.299> it<00:03:35.419> wrong<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.599> opens<00:03:36.200> don't

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
if you get it wrong and opens don't

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.460 
if you get it wrong and opens don't
forget<00:03:36.709> it<00:03:36.799> right<00:03:37.150> so<00:03:38.150> yeah<00:03:38.569> and<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.200> plays

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
forget it right so yeah and it plays

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.699 
forget it right so yeah and it plays
music<00:03:39.680> also<00:03:40.069> so<00:03:41.169> basically<00:03:42.169> the<00:03:42.349> way<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:42.530> works

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
music also so basically the way it works

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.339 
music also so basically the way it works
is<00:03:43.000> right<00:03:44.000> now<00:03:44.180> it's<00:03:44.359> calibrated<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:45.109> just

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
is right now it's calibrated to just

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.770 
is right now it's calibrated to just
work<00:03:45.590> by<00:03:45.889> pressing<00:03:46.280> buttons<00:03:46.609> in<00:03:46.730> order<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:47.629> if

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
work by pressing buttons in order so if

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.740 
work by pressing buttons in order so if
i<00:03:47.870> press<00:03:48.049> it<00:03:48.230> like<00:03:48.379> this

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
i press it like this

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.590 
i press it like this
as<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:50.260> can<00:03:50.380> see<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:50.770> turned<00:03:51.010> off<00:03:51.190> this<00:03:51.600> stream

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
as you can see it turned off this stream

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.170 
as you can see it turned off this stream
of<00:03:52.810> redstone<00:03:53.280> then<00:03:54.280> if<00:03:54.370> i<00:03:54.490> press<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.790> next<00:03:55.030> one

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
of redstone then if i press the next one

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.070 
of redstone then if i press the next one
turn<00:03:55.930> off<00:03:56.110> that<00:03:56.140> one<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:57.330> then<00:03:58.330> turning<00:03:58.930> it

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
turn off that one and then turning it

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.220 
turn off that one and then turning it
off<00:03:59.340> turning<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:00.430> off<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:00.610> then<00:04:01.060> that<00:04:01.810> torch

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
off turning it off and then that torch

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.730 
off turning it off and then that torch
turns<00:04:02.590> on<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.810> whole<00:04:04.930> point<00:04:05.110> of<00:04:05.230> this<00:04:05.410> is

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
turns on so the whole point of this is

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.390 
turns on so the whole point of this is
when<00:04:06.190> you<00:04:06.310> go<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.520> the<00:04:06.760> wiring<00:04:07.530> there<00:04:08.530> are<00:04:08.890> two

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
when you go to the wiring there are two

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.610 
when you go to the wiring there are two
and<00:04:09.730> gates<00:04:10.120> this<00:04:10.720> one<00:04:10.959> over<00:04:11.200> here<00:04:11.230> is<00:04:11.440> what

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
and gates this one over here is what

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.800 
and gates this one over here is what
opens<00:04:11.770> the<00:04:12.070> door<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.550> the<00:04:12.850> one<00:04:13.000> down<00:04:13.240> here<00:04:13.270> is

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
opens the door and the one down here is

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.410 
opens the door and the one down here is
the<00:04:14.590> one<00:04:14.830> that<00:04:15.130> determines<00:04:15.550> whether<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.239> fall

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
the one that determines whether you fall

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.599 
the one that determines whether you fall
in<00:04:16.510> love<00:04:16.660> or<00:04:16.840> not<00:04:18.060> so<00:04:19.060> yeah<00:04:19.420> that<00:04:19.930> current

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
in love or not so yeah that current

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.550 
in love or not so yeah that current
right<00:04:21.609> here<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:22.270> comes<00:04:22.540> from<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:22.900> system

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
right here that comes from the system

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.909 
right here that comes from the system
will<00:04:24.010> go<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.250> places<00:04:24.700> first<00:04:25.540> and<00:04:25.930> deactivating

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
will go to places first and deactivating

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.010 
will go to places first and deactivating
one<00:04:27.100> torch<00:04:27.400> in<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.669> sand<00:04:27.880> gate<00:04:28.090> there's<00:04:28.930> a

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
one torch in the sand gate there's a

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.540 
one torch in the sand gate there's a
signal<00:04:29.380> deactivating<00:04:30.100> a<00:04:30.160> torch<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.430> the

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
signal deactivating a torch and the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.159 
signal deactivating a torch and the
other<00:04:30.700> one<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.000> as<00:04:31.600> you<00:04:31.750> can<00:04:31.900> see<00:04:31.930> it's

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
other one and as you can see it's
