00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
are interesting in that they can be

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.260 
are interesting in that they can be
either<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.590> good<00:00:31.830> thing<00:00:32.099> or<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.430> bad<00:00:32.640> thing<00:00:32.820> and

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
thing there are game ruining glitches

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.110 
thing there are game ruining glitches
across<00:00:37.469> countless<00:00:37.890> titles<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:38.910> there<00:00:39.030> are

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
across countless titles but there are

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.810 
across countless titles but there are
also<00:00:39.270> game<00:00:39.570> enhancing<00:00:40.500> glutens<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> speak

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
also game enhancing glutens so to speak

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.970 
also game enhancing glutens so to speak
this<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.600> making<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.079> bit<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.379> an<00:00:43.649> assumption

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
this is making a bit of an assumption

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.340 
this is making a bit of an assumption
but<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:44.760> pretty<00:00:44.969> safe<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.570> make<00:00:45.750> there's

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
but it's pretty safe one to make there's

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.380 
but it's pretty safe one to make there's
probably<00:00:46.649> no<00:00:46.860> game<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.370> lacks<00:00:47.670> or<00:00:48.059> at<00:00:48.210> one

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
probably no game that lacks or at one

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.740 
probably no game that lacks or at one
point<00:00:48.570> lacked<00:00:49.129> glitches<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.180> try<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.480> try

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
point lacked glitches we can try and try

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.750 
point lacked glitches we can try and try
to<00:00:51.870> avoid<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:52.800> inevitable<00:00:53.280> there's

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
to avoid it but it's inevitable there's

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.029 
to avoid it but it's inevitable there's
always<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.059> fault<00:00:54.329> somewhere<00:00:54.870> hopefully<00:00:55.530> the
