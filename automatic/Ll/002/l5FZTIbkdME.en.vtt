00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
you a list of things that I know but

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.270 
you a list of things that I know but
there's<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.360> many<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:31.320> each<00:02:31.560> time<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:32.070> one

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
there's so many and each time that one

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.550 
there's so many and each time that one
gets<00:02:32.790> into<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.180> media<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.690> kids<00:02:33.900> use<00:02:34.320> it<00:02:34.500> a

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
gets into the media the kids use it a

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.900 
gets into the media the kids use it a
little<00:02:34.650> bit<00:02:34.860> less<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.220> go<00:02:35.310> towards<00:02:35.670> something

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
little bit less and go towards something

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.470 
little bit less and go towards something
else<00:02:36.210> so<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.140> more<00:02:37.500> about<00:02:38.060> how<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.090> behave

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
else so it's more about how to behave

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.260 
else so it's more about how to behave
online<00:02:39.990> I<00:02:40.260> think<00:02:40.500> then<00:02:41.280> attacking<00:02:41.700> only<00:02:42.120> the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
online I think then attacking only the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.730 
online I think then attacking only the
app<00:02:42.390> right<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:42.990> I<00:02:43.020> think<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.260> big<00:02:43.380> problem<00:02:43.680> is

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
app right and I think a big problem is

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.800 
app right and I think a big problem is
when<00:02:43.890> we<00:02:44.010> were<00:02:44.130> growing<00:02:44.340> up<00:02:44.640> yet<00:02:45.390> maybe<00:02:45.570> we'd

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
when we were growing up yet maybe we'd

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.420 
when we were growing up yet maybe we'd
get<00:02:46.020> made<00:02:46.170> fun<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.410> at<00:02:46.560> school<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.190> then<00:02:47.310> we

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
get made fun of at school but then we

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.490 
get made fun of at school but then we
would<00:02:47.580> go<00:02:47.730> home<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.540> was<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.660> safe<00:02:48.960> place<00:02:49.200> it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
would go home and it was a safe place it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.310 
would go home and it was a safe place it
was<00:02:49.710> over<00:02:50.130> but<00:02:50.640> now<00:02:50.790> kids<00:02:51.480> come<00:02:51.810> home<00:02:52.020> and

because you were bullied I've been

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.650 
because you were bullied I've been

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
bullied most of my life for my looks and

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.280 
bullied most of my life for my looks and
I<00:04:04.380> was<00:04:04.620> adopted<00:04:04.890> in<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.340> 60s<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:06.110> nobody<00:04:07.110> had

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
I was adopted in the 60s and nobody had

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.310 
I was adopted in the 60s and nobody had
my<00:04:07.410> color<00:04:07.650> skin<00:04:08.010> so<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.510> stood<00:04:09.840> out<00:04:09.989> so

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
my color skin so that I stood out so

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.199 
my color skin so that I stood out so
much<00:04:10.500> like<00:04:10.830> a<00:04:10.860> sore<00:04:11.190> thumb<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.760> couldn't<00:04:12.090> get

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
much like a sore thumb I couldn't get

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.780 
much like a sore thumb I couldn't get
there<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.690> teach<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.350> kids<00:04:13.790> ownership

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
there so I teach the kids ownership

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.570 
there so I teach the kids ownership
because<00:04:15.540> if<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:15.870> don't<00:04:15.959> have<00:04:16.169> ownership<00:04:16.650> you

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
because if you don't have ownership you

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.760 
because if you don't have ownership you
never<00:04:17.850> really<00:04:18.209> learn<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.989> problem<00:04:19.350> is<00:04:19.440> we

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
never really learn and the problem is we

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.830 
never really learn and the problem is we
parents<00:04:20.250> we<00:04:20.370> really<00:04:20.640> love<00:04:20.820> our<00:04:20.850> kids<00:04:21.150> but<00:04:21.390> we

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
parents we really love our kids but we

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.500 
parents we really love our kids but we
do<00:04:21.960> it<00:04:22.080> sometimes<00:04:22.470> wrong<00:04:22.740> including<00:04:23.070> myself

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
do it sometimes wrong including myself

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.270 
do it sometimes wrong including myself
see<00:04:24.510> if<00:04:24.750> my<00:04:25.290> daughter<00:04:25.560> would<00:04:25.800> have

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
see if my daughter would have

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.240 
see if my daughter would have
a<00:04:26.340> uniqueness<00:04:26.880> that<00:04:27.210> she<00:04:27.360> gets<00:04:27.510> bullied<00:04:27.690> for

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
a uniqueness that she gets bullied for

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.040 
a uniqueness that she gets bullied for
our<00:04:29.250> instinct<00:04:29.970> is<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.210> say<00:04:30.330> no<00:04:30.480> you<00:04:30.540> don't<00:04:30.810> have

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
our instinct is to say no you don't have

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.020 
our instinct is to say no you don't have
that<00:04:31.200> sweetheart<00:04:31.590> right<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.580> think<00:04:32.820> that's

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
that sweetheart right and I think that's

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.720 
that sweetheart right and I think that's
where<00:04:33.270> problem<00:04:33.810> really<00:04:34.110> lies<00:04:34.430> because<00:04:35.430> if<00:04:35.580> I

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
where problem really lies because if I

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.580 
where problem really lies because if I
was<00:04:35.880> short<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.450> they<00:04:36.660> called<00:04:36.870> me<00:04:37.050> a<00:04:37.080> foreigner
