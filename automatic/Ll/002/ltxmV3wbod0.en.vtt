00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.610

 and I hope you like it good I bet that sitel is highlighting this topic 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.600
 for me this moment is the best 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.520
 good to order this theme 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.060
 let's go this cuteness load 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.399
 of course leave in the video edition so it will be easier 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.450
 forte 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.450
 let's open our browsers 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.830
 we were a moment 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.830
 and well here I write the characters of styles 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.760
 the inder loads the assai trio and we wait for 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.220
 and here we believe we are known for delivering file and created us because 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.910
 I have a complement 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.820
 and ready here the base in normal discharge 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.770
 and keeps you north 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.630
 once done that 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.139
 is going to load a file while human tedh can see what 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.720
 the icon of the city 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.020
 the ice change because these icons 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.020
 with can see menem mayor 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.930
 the theme I think he's going to change the icons too very good 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:15.029
 sometimes they played everything 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.109

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.109
 tÃ¡boas customer made is bring here 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.379
 and here we have where to go avatar in which its cost 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.159
 here 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.639
 can not see as a child 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.119
 three folders and what I did was a classic what 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:46.059
 I will not explain 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:47.520
 here in there 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.829

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.279
 come the icons as I told you 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:53.359
 here that changes the icons 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.829
 come these very good icons that are recontra good 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:03:02.649
 does not believe in anyone by chris mckenzie good a barbie knows in the movie 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:03.879
 of anime 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.540
 she also followed these icons are that she and she passed them pointed 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:16.999
 had charge the gold 1 as you see here vick is very good in length the 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:17.939
 summer 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.339
 rock 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:23.209
 and here is the have but here 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.509
 It requires explaining that it is football and the bases and the majority knows this 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:32.209
 a transparent way to the theme 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.209
 for example here said 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:39.299
 for example has given 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.299
 the team look no longer transparent 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:45.929
 it's good to in 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:50.119
 What happened to you, what you are going to do is give him a double Christian 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:54.629
 you need to install tarpaulins or double click and this will come out here in navarra 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.629
 hectares and there they will be transparent 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:03.510
 nothing more very simple and this is the subject what we are going to do to 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.669
 to install the theme it's good to copy it 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.609
 we do not copy the two 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.989
