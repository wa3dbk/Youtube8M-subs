00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
are no flats on this pedal so I'm going

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.320 
are no flats on this pedal so I'm going
to<00:00:44.540> use<00:00:44.720> this<00:00:44.930> 8<00:00:45.140> millimeter<00:00:45.590> hex<00:00:45.890> wrench<00:00:46.330> from

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
to use this 8 millimeter hex wrench from

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.540 
to use this 8 millimeter hex wrench from
the<00:00:47.540> backside<00:00:47.990> of<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.260> crank<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:48.950> to<00:00:49.010> install

the backside of the crank so to install

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.090 
the backside of the crank so to install
it<00:00:49.850> I'm<00:00:50.300> just<00:00:50.690> gonna<00:00:50.780> line<00:00:51.080> the<00:00:51.320> hole<00:00:51.530> up<00:00:51.800> with

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
it I'm just gonna line the hole up with

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.690 
it I'm just gonna line the hole up with
the<00:00:52.760> axle<00:00:53.330> and<00:00:53.600> then<00:00:54.380> the<00:00:54.830> right<00:00:55.070> pedal<00:00:55.340> is<00:00:55.670> a

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
the axle and then the right pedal is a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.700 
the axle and then the right pedal is a
right-handed<00:00:56.510> thread<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.110> I'm<00:00:57.230> gonna<00:00:57.380> turn

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
right-handed thread so I'm gonna turn

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:06.010 
right-handed thread so I'm gonna turn
this<00:00:57.980> clockwise<00:01:01.450> all<00:01:02.450> the<00:01:02.690> way<00:01:02.840> in<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:05.390> then

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
this clockwise all the way in and then

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.640 
this clockwise all the way in and then
I'm<00:01:06.170> just<00:01:06.229> going<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:06.560> Snug<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:06.920> down<00:01:11.650> now

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
I'm just going to Snug it down now

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.399 
I'm just going to Snug it down now
because<00:01:13.040> we're<00:01:13.580> not<00:01:13.700> measuring<00:01:14.050> force<00:01:15.050> at<00:01:15.320> the

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
because we're not measuring force at the

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.160 
because we're not measuring force at the
axle<00:01:15.980> the<00:01:16.250> torque<00:01:16.909> specification<00:01:17.780> is<00:01:17.930> going

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
axle the torque specification is going

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.620 
axle the torque specification is going
to<00:01:18.260> be<00:01:18.380> what<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:19.070> manufacturer<00:01:20.060> of<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.300> crank

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
to be what the manufacturer of the crank

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.050 
to be what the manufacturer of the crank
arm<00:01:20.870> recommends<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.970> twerk<00:01:23.920> installation<00:01:25.060> is

not affecting the pedal force
measurement<00:01:29.300> at<00:01:29.360> all<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:29.960> snug<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.100> down<00:01:31.150> if

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
measurement at all so snug it down if

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.399 
measurement at all so snug it down if
you<00:01:32.299> want<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.570> get<00:01:32.659> really<00:01:32.780> technical<00:01:33.350> about

the<00:01:38.600> crank<00:01:38.870> that<00:01:39.080> you're<00:01:39.229> installing<00:01:39.590> the

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
the crank that you're installing the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.370 
the crank that you're installing the
pedal<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:41.360> then<00:01:41.450> we'll<00:01:41.600> repeat<00:01:41.960> that

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
pedal to and then we'll repeat that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.670 
pedal to and then we'll repeat that
process<00:01:43.220> on<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.940> left<00:01:44.150> side<00:01:44.350> I'm<00:01:45.350> gonna<00:01:45.500> grab

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
process on the left side I'm gonna grab

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.830 
process on the left side I'm gonna grab
the<00:01:45.890> left<00:01:46.070> pedal<00:01:46.600> again<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:49.690> washer<00:01:50.690> goes

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
the left pedal again the washer goes

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.310 
the left pedal again the washer goes
over<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.200> axle<00:01:52.000> I'm<00:01:53.000> gonna<00:01:53.210> line<00:01:53.510> the<00:01:53.810> hole<00:01:54.049> up

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
over the axle I'm gonna line the hole up

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.450 
over the axle I'm gonna line the hole up
and<00:01:54.700> insert<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:56.270> hex<00:01:56.750> wrench<00:01:57.010> through<00:01:58.010> so

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
and insert the hex wrench through so

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.510 
and insert the hex wrench through so
because<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.750> left<00:02:00.080> pedal<00:02:00.350> is<00:02:00.650> a<00:02:00.920> left<00:02:01.220> hand

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
because the left pedal is a left hand

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.149 
because the left pedal is a left hand
thread<00:02:01.670> I'm<00:02:02.600> gonna<00:02:02.840> turn<00:02:03.080> this<00:02:03.290> one<00:02:03.500> clockwise

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
thread I'm gonna turn this one clockwise

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.480 
thread I'm gonna turn this one clockwise
as<00:02:04.490> well<00:02:04.520> but<00:02:05.299> I'm<00:02:05.990> gonna<00:02:06.140> be<00:02:06.350> on<00:02:06.590> the

as well but I'm gonna be on the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.839 
as well but I'm gonna be on the
opposites

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
opposites

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.380 
opposites
