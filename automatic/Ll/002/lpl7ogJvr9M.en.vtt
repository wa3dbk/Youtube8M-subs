00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.939
 Month-long guesswork Erpel's fans and competitors 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.539
 the new iPhone would look good 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.539
 The new version of the multimedia phone gets a built-in radio 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.129
 as a display of Cuban LEDs there is even a letter and 

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:24.470
 media 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.600
 now it is under the name iPhone 3gs in the trade 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.329
 and the great innovation has failed 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.829
 more so this summer come out as many set of alternatives as 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:35.880
 never 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.150
 So it pays to get a grip on the new iPhone or offers the competition 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.150
 maybe more smartphones for less money 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
 we prefer to come to advice seekers Jungle of information technology 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.280
 to a new edition of the gadget inspector 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.320
 one of the hottest competitors 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.690
 is Nokia's successor to the multimedia machine in 96 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.920
 the freshman gets the resourceful name 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.140
 97 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.450
 he is short or 50 grams heavy 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.910
 and after the successful Nokia 5800 Express Music the second act screen 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.330
 Mobile phone of the Finns 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
 per round costs up to 650 euros is without a contract 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.420
 and at Nokia one hopes 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.920
 that is something trendsetter 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.920
 Finally 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.050
 Paroli can offer 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.130
 The iPhone is completely unchanged, at least at first sight 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.420
 still there is the flagship only at t-mobile 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.670
 for the price between one and 250 euros 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.900
 together with a mandatory two-year contract 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.180
 only the slightly modified name iPhone 3g he betrays 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.830
 that's the inner ones 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.150
 the stories nearly 140 collected heavy device 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.450
 modified machine acts 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.390
 that is above all for speed 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.880
 this is ensured by the better processor 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.689
 a faster mobile network 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.579
 and a lot of fine work on the operating system which is now available in version 3 points 0 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.010
 Incidentally, this is also free to download for the older iPhones 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.740
 ready 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.740
 and offers already sorely missed features such as the possibility of 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.790
 Keyboard when typing emails to cross and thus more space to tilt 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.749
 win 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.769
 and also mark the cut out copying text between different ones 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.639
 Applications is finally possible 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.870
 The new iPhone bows business more suitable 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:28.719
 The n97 is faster than previous Nokia phones 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:29.719
 Thing 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.359
 this is ensured by the new start screen 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.099
 which can be largely freely configured 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.099
 and also allows direct access to various programs 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.789
 as with the iPhone via a central home button called 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.749
 this also worked without any significant delay 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:47.719
 even if it is one 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.079
 Tecan is slower than Apple 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.349
 but the n97 shines with an integrated keyboard which is made of the 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.799
 Device unfold under "test so clearly for the business 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.729
 Use predestined 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.699
 tap ten fingers 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:03.290
 Of course that is not possible 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.129
 but the keys are well positioned 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.120
 thanks to the integrated keyboard, the n97 is, however, and half of the k as that 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.779
 iPhone 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:15.419
 Still hardly cause for criticism is the display of the iPhone 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.740
 a good 9 centimeters diagonal 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.380
 can videos in a decent quality and bean Leupold in DieÃŸen 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.109
 the screen resolution is smaller than Nokia's n97 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.619
 in everyday use but that does not matter 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:30.799
 on the contrary 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.579
 texts can be read on the iPhone and never better 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.269
 especially in direct a case of sunlight 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.819
 because working weakens the 16 to 9 display the n97 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:42.749
 significantly better 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.979
 For Nokia, however, the comparison of built-in cameras is not applicable 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.129
 here has the n97 with its five megapixel chip 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.649
 the Zeiss objectively 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:54.489
 and the built-in flash clearly ahead 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.979
 This can be in good light very decent pictures 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.529
 and even with flash photography over short distances 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:03.149
 still reasonably usable photos make 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:07.070
 The new iPhone now has a 3-megapixel camera 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.210
 even with manual controllable focus 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.210
 with which videos can finally be recorded 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.049
 now clearly Nokia the standard 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.699
 also in terms of RAM Apple has upgraded 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.889
 the iPhone now offers up to 32 gigawatts 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.169
 And thus more than plenty of room for thousands in p3 music tracks or photos 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.240
 and a few hundred minutes of video 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.310
 both in terms of video quality 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.699
 as well as the data memory, the n97 corresponds to the iPhone 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.129
 however, the memory of the Nokia with the help of is the cards still 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.069
 upgrade to up to 48 gigabytes 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:47.119
 Apple continues to offer this option as well as the often required change of AKU 

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:48.949
 not on 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:54.099
 The n97 e-mail address addresses via mobile with no objection 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:55.809
 my office mailbox 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:59.649
 but despite the abundant data storage, I am in the test, the n97 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:03.889
 Band Management pushed my address to unexpected limits 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.060
 the operating system Symbian only takes maximum care of the individual applications 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.139
 Collaboration memory available 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.909
 admittedly with 4000 entries quite large contact database is too much 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.490
 in the search for entries 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.219
 The Nokia then the stalwarts 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:22.680
 a clear shortcoming 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.879
 at least for contacts Jonke little 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.430
 on the iPhone, on the other hand 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.409
 did not crack my address book 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.729
 Not only does the comparison with the office work without any problems 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.729
 There are also hardly any waiting times when looking for contacts 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.629
 serious weakness but unites a forum and n97 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:44.729
 with both the address book sorted only before the surname 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.189
 who does not have to hand 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:49.189
 or months to contact had a company looking for bad luck 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:53.250
 Both devices do not diverge in functionality 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.920
 the real thing's machines for the Blackberrys of RIM as well 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.920
 Smartphones with windows mobile operating system offer 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.630
 all in all 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.370
 but prove both the n97 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.430
 as well as Apple's new edition 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.500
 as equally practical are the good and functional smartphones 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.099
 with business qualities 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:16.009
 Apple continues to shine with its extremely intuitive operation 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:20.779
 Vielschreiber but are better served with Nokia's top model so much for 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:22.199
 today 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.599
 they have regained some perspective my name is Thomas Kuhn 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.190
 until the next time the gadget inspector thanks for watching
