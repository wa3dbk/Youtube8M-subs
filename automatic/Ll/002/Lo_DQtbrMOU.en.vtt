00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
doing both so we decided let's go for it

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.110 
doing both so we decided let's go for it
looks<00:00:18.530> like<00:00:18.650> a<00:00:18.680> really<00:00:19.070> chocolaty<00:00:19.700> triple

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
yourself a s'more that's when I decided

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.850 
yourself a s'more that's when I decided
that<00:00:41.420> we<00:00:41.690> should<00:00:41.750> pull<00:00:42.050> out<00:00:42.200> a<00:00:42.230> couple<00:00:42.500> of<00:00:42.739> the

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
that we should pull out a couple of the

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
biscuit and eventually we switched away

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.720

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
roasted barley because what we wanted to

stout and then also kind of match it up
with<00:01:04.280> some<00:01:04.670> malts<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:05.179> they're<00:01:05.329> going<00:01:05.449> to<00:01:05.509> be

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
kind of bready maybe we can bring out a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.550 
kind of bready maybe we can bring out a
little<00:01:07.670> bit<00:01:07.909> of<00:01:07.969> the<00:01:08.060> idea<00:01:08.329> of<00:01:08.509> a<00:01:08.600> cookie<00:01:08.959> in

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
little bit of the idea of a cookie in

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.679 
little bit of the idea of a cookie in
there<00:01:09.770> how<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.009> hops<00:01:10.310> we<00:01:10.639> just<00:01:10.969> did<00:01:11.209> some

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
there how the hops we just did some

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.349 
there how the hops we just did some
Apollo<00:01:12.380> in<00:01:12.649> there<00:01:12.829> at<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.069> 60<00:01:13.459> minute<00:01:13.759> along

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:14.359 
Apollo in there at the 60 minute along

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:16.300 
Apollo in there at the 60 minute along
with<00:01:14.539> a<00:01:14.569> cocoa<00:01:14.780> powder<00:01:15.079> then<00:01:15.740> some<00:01:15.979> northern

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
with a cocoa powder then some northern

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.209 
with a cocoa powder then some northern
brewer<00:01:16.639> followed<00:01:17.240> up<00:01:17.329> by<00:01:17.359> Wilmette<00:01:18.109> so<00:01:18.560> it's

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
brewer followed up by Wilmette so it's

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.129 
brewer followed up by Wilmette so it's
supposed<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:19.850> just<00:01:20.090> complement<00:01:20.569> it<00:01:20.749> and<00:01:20.929> not

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:21.139 
supposed to just complement it and not

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:23.260 
supposed to just complement it and not
really<00:01:21.350> stand<00:01:21.829> out<00:01:21.979> too<00:01:22.310> much<00:01:22.340> it's<00:01:23.060> not<00:01:23.240> a

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
really stand out too much it's not a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.510 
really stand out too much it's not a
whole<00:01:23.479> lot<00:01:23.659> of<00:01:23.689> hops<00:01:23.929> but<00:01:24.859> we<00:01:25.069> did<00:01:25.249> put<00:01:25.490> some

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
whole lot of hops but we did put some

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.190 
whole lot of hops but we did put some
thought<00:01:25.969> into<00:01:25.999> it<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.630> northern<00:01:26.959> brewer

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
thought into it the northern brewer

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.679 
thought into it the northern brewer
often<00:01:27.679> has<00:01:27.829> kind<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.130> minty<00:01:28.609> flavor<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.659> I

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
often has kind of minty flavor and I

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.389 
often has kind of minty flavor and I
thought<00:01:29.899> for<00:01:30.049> a<00:01:30.139> flavor<00:01:30.380> hop<00:01:30.649> that<00:01:30.889> could<00:01:31.039> that

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
thought for a flavor hop that could that

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:32.739 
thought for a flavor hop that could that
could<00:01:31.520> mesh<00:01:31.729> really<00:01:31.969> well<00:01:32.119> with<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.450> chocolate

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
could mesh really well with a chocolate

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:35.199 
could mesh really well with a chocolate
so<00:01:33.200> this<00:01:33.439> beer<00:01:33.859> is<00:01:34.069> ready<00:01:34.369> to<00:01:34.670> firm<00:01:34.849> it<00:01:34.999> the

of that Pete the smokiness at the end
the<00:02:46.349> middle<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.799> really<00:02:46.860> kind<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.370> oily<00:02:47.880> and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
the middle is really kind of oily and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.180 
the middle is really kind of oily and
there's<00:02:48.390> just<00:02:48.569> kind<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.840> like<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.079> nice<00:02:50.040> little

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
there's just kind of like a nice little

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.059 
there's just kind of like a nice little
attack<00:02:50.610> when<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:50.970> first<00:02:51.150> get<00:02:51.299> into<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:52.040> yeah<00:02:53.040> I

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
attack when you first get into it yeah I

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.100 
attack when you first get into it yeah I
expect<00:02:53.579> it<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.819> be<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.000> little<00:02:54.180> bit<00:02:54.390> more<00:02:54.840> heavy

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
expect it to be a little bit more heavy

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.660 
expect it to be a little bit more heavy
in<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.380> mouthfeel<00:02:55.739> but<00:02:55.980> he's<00:02:56.160> right<00:02:56.340> it's<00:02:56.549> a

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
in the mouthfeel but he's right it's a

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.030 
in the mouthfeel but he's right it's a
little<00:02:56.849> oily<00:02:57.410> which<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.560> interesting<00:02:58.769> and

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
little oily which is interesting and

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.160 
little oily which is interesting and
bitter<00:02:59.299> so<00:03:00.299> I<00:03:00.329> guess<00:03:00.540> we're<00:03:00.690> going<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.870> call<00:03:01.049> it

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
bitter so I guess we're going to call it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.880 
bitter so I guess we're going to call it
the<00:03:01.290> triple<00:03:01.860> chocolate<00:03:02.069> cocoa<00:03:02.790> cookie<00:03:03.209> stout

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
the triple chocolate cocoa cookie stout

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.259 
the triple chocolate cocoa cookie stout
because<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.040> kind<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.400> tastes<00:03:05.700> like<00:03:05.849> a<00:03:06.000> cookie

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
because it kind of tastes like a cookie

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.660 
because it kind of tastes like a cookie
I<00:03:06.569> think<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.930> came<00:03:07.049> out<00:03:07.200> pretty<00:03:07.440> well<00:03:07.610> what<00:03:08.610> do

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
I think it came out pretty well what do

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.199 
I think it came out pretty well what do
you<00:03:08.760> think

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
you think

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.990 
you think
same<00:03:10.019> here<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.680> think<00:03:10.920> since<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.670> is<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.790> little

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
same here I think since it is a little

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.819 
same here I think since it is a little
bit<00:03:12.090> aggressive<00:03:12.269> once<00:03:12.840> we<00:03:13.019> put<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.500> ice<00:03:13.620> cream

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
bit aggressive once we put the ice cream

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.349 
bit aggressive once we put the ice cream
in<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.100> should<00:03:14.400> have<00:03:14.609> a<00:03:14.639> nice<00:03:14.760> little<00:03:14.970> balance

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
in it should have a nice little balance

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.000 
in it should have a nice little balance
to<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.690> I'm<00:03:15.989> looking<00:03:16.049> forward<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.829> well

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
to it I'm looking forward to it well

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.030
