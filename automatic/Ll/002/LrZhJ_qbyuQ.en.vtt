somebody's<00:03:19.530> head<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:19.860> I've<00:03:20.010> got<00:03:20.159> no<00:03:20.400> idea

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
somebody's head and I've got no idea

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.850 
somebody's head and I've got no idea
what<00:03:20.879> he's<00:03:20.970> thinking<00:03:21.030> about<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.720> it's<00:03:22.560> it's

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
what he's thinking about and it's it's

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.699 
what he's thinking about and it's it's
really<00:03:23.129> he's<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.580> one<00:03:23.819> with<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.030> answers<00:03:24.709> but

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709

really he's the one with the answers but
as<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:25.860> say<00:03:26.069> it's<00:03:26.220> very<00:03:26.340> bizarre<00:03:26.610> I've<00:03:27.000> never

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
as I say it's very bizarre I've never

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.059 
as I say it's very bizarre I've never
seen<00:03:27.450> anything<00:03:27.659> like<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:28.860> know<00:03:28.980> it

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
seen anything like it and you know it

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.740 
seen anything like it and you know it
didn't<00:03:29.730> look<00:03:29.849> like<00:03:29.940> there<00:03:30.120> was<00:03:30.150> any<00:03:30.269> signs<00:03:30.629> of

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
didn't look like there was any signs of

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.000 
didn't look like there was any signs of
it<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.019> match<00:03:31.170> up<00:03:31.319> to<00:03:31.409> that<00:03:31.560> point

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
it that match up to that point

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.110 
it that match up to that point
there<00:03:32.250> didn't<00:03:32.489> seem<00:03:32.549> like<00:03:32.760> there<00:03:32.849> was<00:03:32.909> any

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
there didn't seem like there was any

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.759 
there didn't seem like there was any
sign<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.450> needle<00:03:33.959> between<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.409> two<00:03:34.590> men

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769

sign of needle between the two men
either<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.190> mean<00:03:35.370> clearly<00:03:35.700> there's<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.150> great

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
either I mean clearly there's a great

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.330 
either I mean clearly there's a great
rivalry<00:03:36.989> between<00:03:37.470> Henry<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.099> Anne<00:03:38.190> Sullivan
