00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.139
 today is the bugle is attacking 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.330
 a letter of the alphabet that cause 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.160
 some pronunciation problems to 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.910
 French when they speak German and 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.470
 to Germans when he speaks French 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.509
 here is the eighth letter of the alphabet 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.899
 the french the call h 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.239
 the Germans ah well let's say all of 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.520
 the German hb is a big 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.350
 problem for the French it's 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.359
 besides one of the characteristics of 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.730
 the French accent that forget about 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:43.219
 pronounce this h which is a real letter 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.449
 in German take for example the word 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:50.629
 you have to say, let's listen 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.280
 well hals and not hals as say 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.679
 a lot of French who did not put 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.710
 the language if you say ald the 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:00.499
 Germans will hear the conjunction 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.679
 alyscamps of the same if instead of saying you 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:06.380
 as house the house tells you daf 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:09.560
 however the Germans will understand the end of 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.890
 something or cults the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.940
 dog that turns into rain the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.550
 conjunction is so this German g is 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.910
 expired you have to feel the air coming out of the 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.930
 stuffy 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:28.520
 valls raus brunt go again to 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.740
 the rise count attention josh is not 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.050
 always pronounced he can be silent 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.130
 for example in the middle of a word we do not 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.010
 will not say disappoint my enemies question 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.130
 of ear and practice not his work 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.380
 french lof french and dumb most 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.210
 from time to pronunciation is like 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.450
 if they did not exist for example 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.290
 the word hotels behaves as if there 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.320
 had no h 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.650
 the hotel is said to have made the connection one does not 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.960
 not a good hotel but a good hotel 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.210
 but it also exists in French 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.260
 many words starting with 1 h 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.190
 aspirated 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.319
 let's take the word beans the h is sucked 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.110
 Well, that does not mean that we aspire 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.939
 loudly air to say bean 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.760
 but it's a bit like there's a 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:19.260
 wall in front of the word beans one can not 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.680
 not make a connection and say 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.860
 ricoh not told the bean and we do not say 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.650
 not the good beans but the good beans 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.120
 in this respect I allow myself to indicate to 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.010
 all german who visit paris 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.329
 that we do not give ourselves to the appointment in 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.090
 full center of paris 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.840
 in the halls but in the halls with a h 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.519
 aspirated 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.739
 I do not know why the Germans 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.640
 who speaks French so well do this 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.560
 mistake with perseverance but it must 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.140
 how to guess if the h is mute or 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.540
 aspire there too practice question 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.730
 so of course as this is the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.859
 French language there are exceptions 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.590
 it would come because it is a 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:01.049
 especially pretty let's take the word the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.430
 wing hero in german 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.180
 begins in both cases by an age 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.069
 pure coincidence so the hero 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.139
 let's put it in the feminine it gives 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.690
 heroin but not the drug well 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.970
 sure the ermine the heroic woman 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.120
 if you are attentive you have 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:22.560
 noticed that one says the hero and 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:26.010
 the heroine in a male case the h is 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.790
 sucked the hero and in the other case at 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.660
 feminine the h is dumb the weird heroine 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.829
 weird 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:38.220
 likewise the h of the adjective heroic and 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:41.970
 of the substantive heroics are dumb have 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.410
 says a heroic rescue and not a 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.349
 heroic rescue 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.850
 so we do the liaison the same way 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:53.660
 we say a great heroism 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.260
 not a big heroism why the hd 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.910
 only hero is he so aspire 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.650
 some linguists say that this 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.560
 anomaly would come from the following reason 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.810
 there is another French word that 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.900
 is written differently but is pronounced 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.180
 the same way ayrault the hero is the l 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.240
 man who in the middle ages brought in the 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.000
 campaigns the royal ordinances the hb of the 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.270
 hero would have become aspired by homology 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.310
 with that of the hero who knows but he 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.200
 there is another explanation a lot 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.800
 prettier be careful 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.700
 let's put our heroes to the plural the hero 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.160
 becomes the hero the heroine becomes the 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.920
 heroines but what would it be if the 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.400
 hero had a mute task like that of 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.000
 heroin 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.690
 it looks like the singular Herault and the 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.140
 plural 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:50.090
 so what would your plural say but yes 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:53.060
 the heroes the heroes as the heroes of the 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.490
 hero transform into 0 it was 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.100
 impossible practice immediately 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.890
 remedy this potential impertinence 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.330
 and gloriously saved us 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.330
 brave hero of the nation
