00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.789 

okay

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.859 

hard<00:00:15.490> drive<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:17.830> one<00:00:18.160> I<00:00:18.189> think<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:19.480> nine

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
hard drive this one I think is nine

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.730 
hard drive this one I think is nine
point<00:00:20.230> five<00:00:20.500> millimeter<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:22.359> the<00:00:23.020> one<00:00:23.230> inside

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
point five millimeter and the one inside

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.330 
point five millimeter and the one inside
here<00:00:24.369> on<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:25.150> envy<00:00:25.570> for<00:00:27.930> maybe<00:00:28.930> is<00:00:29.340> seven

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
here on the envy for maybe is seven

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.389 
here on the envy for maybe is seven
millimeter<00:00:30.790> supposedly<00:00:31.599> they<00:00:32.129> original<00:00:33.129> one

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
millimeter supposedly they original one

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:51.400 
millimeter supposedly they original one
with<00:00:33.879> the<00:00:34.000> connector<00:00:34.570> and<00:00:36.180> screws

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:11.570 

so<00:00:52.190> I<00:00:52.460> connect<00:00:52.850> those<00:00:53.000> out

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.400 

oh<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:12.180> say<00:01:12.720> these<00:01:13.080> screws<00:01:13.500> right<00:01:13.770> here<00:01:15.410> seven

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
oh I say these screws right here seven

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:25.550 
oh I say these screws right here seven
millimeter<00:01:19.880> versus<00:01:21.230> night<00:01:23.510> so<00:01:24.510> I<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:24.840> know

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
millimeter versus night so I don't know

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.960 
millimeter versus night so I don't know
it's<00:01:25.920> gonna<00:01:26.160> fit

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
it's gonna fit

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.020 
it's gonna fit
as<00:01:27.450> long<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.410> fit<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:32.580> then<00:01:32.850> when

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
as long and fit in here and then when

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.840 
as long and fit in here and then when
you<00:01:33.120> close<00:01:33.630> this

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.200 

all<00:01:40.390> right<00:01:40.659> this<00:01:40.930> one<00:01:41.140> looks<00:01:41.439> more<00:01:41.710> like<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:42.610> 12

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
all right this one looks more like a 12

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.289 
all right this one looks more like a 12
millimeter<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:44.140> case<00:01:47.940> actually<00:01:48.940> the

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
millimeter the case actually the

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:56.010 
millimeter the case actually the
difference<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.799> thickness<00:01:54.369> different<00:01:55.030> it's

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
difference the thickness different it's

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.270 
difference the thickness different it's
almost<00:01:56.380> double<00:01:56.950> so<00:01:57.430> far<00:01:57.670> terabyte<00:01:59.280> this

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
almost double so far terabyte this

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:16.740 
almost double so far terabyte this
finally<00:02:00.880> cost<00:02:01.649> 68<00:02:02.649> bucks

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.740 

oh<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> nine<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.030> half<00:02:19.060> millimeter

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
oh this is a nine and a half millimeter

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.460 
oh this is a nine and a half millimeter
and<00:02:20.320> this<00:02:20.620> one<00:02:20.920> from<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.780> external<00:02:23.320> hard

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
and this one from the external hard

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:36.060 
and this one from the external hard
drive<00:02:23.770> so<00:02:24.310> they<00:02:24.400> gotta<00:02:24.640> be<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.620> important

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
drive so they gotta be so the important

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:45.790 
drive so they gotta be so the important
thing<00:02:36.280> is

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.430 

but<00:02:46.460> the<00:02:46.580> case<00:02:46.940> can<00:02:47.360> closed

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
but the case can closed

00:02:49.440 --> 00:03:10.420 
but the case can closed
so<00:02:49.980> there's<00:02:50.220> nothing<00:02:50.460> in<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.450> works

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.440 

this<00:03:11.209> man

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.470 

not<00:03:18.450> bad<00:03:18.720> at<00:03:18.900> all

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
not bad at all

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.620 
not bad at all
ladies<00:03:21.480> hey<00:03:21.720> view<00:03:24.350> all<00:03:25.350> right
