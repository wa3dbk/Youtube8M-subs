 water in your residence 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.500
 Tip 1 The first step is to tie the float

 of the reservoir preventing the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.619
 Water

 directly from the default because now 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.600
 fully record the pattern 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.150
 and also the position of the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.700
 hands on the hydrometer to guard two 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.450
 hours to see if there is any change in the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.299
 notation 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.860

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.170

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.780
 water level 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.180
 wait two more hours if the level of 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.079
 Reservoir lower the leak is

 Fillets of water is because there are leaks 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.530
 if the person identifies that there is 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.200
