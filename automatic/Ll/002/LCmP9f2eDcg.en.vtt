00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:47.370 
get rid of all right now I like all
contraptions<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:42.490> mainly<00:03:46.230> alright<00:03:47.230> this

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
contraptions this is mainly alright this

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.190 
contraptions this is mainly alright this
encryption<00:03:47.800> is<00:03:48.130> always<00:03:48.790> well<00:03:49.239> like<00:03:49.690> all<00:03:49.959> good

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
encryption is always well like all good

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.949 
encryption is always well like all good
contraptions<00:03:50.860> is<00:03:51.250> separating<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.300> into<00:03:52.360> two

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
contraptions is separating it into two

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.810 
contraptions is separating it into two
different<00:03:53.410> parts<00:03:54.250> cause<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.660> effect<00:03:56.820> like

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
different parts cause and effect like

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.120 
different parts cause and effect like
the<00:03:58.000> cause<00:03:58.270> is<00:03:58.930> pretty<00:03:59.170> much<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.500> sensors

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
the cause is pretty much the sensors

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.949 
the cause is pretty much the sensors
that<00:04:00.550> turn<00:04:00.940> on<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.600> redstone<00:04:02.170> like<00:04:03.040> say<00:04:03.930> has<00:04:04.930> a

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
that turn on the redstone like say has a

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.270 
that turn on the redstone like say has a
pressure<00:04:05.290> plate<00:04:05.470> on<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.800> ground<00:04:06.010> when<00:04:06.220> you

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
pressure plate on the ground when you

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.900 
pressure plate on the ground when you
step<00:04:06.550> on<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:07.020> you<00:04:08.020> fall<00:04:08.320> down<00:04:08.560> into<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:08.950> roomful

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
step on it you fall down into a roomful

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.510 
step on it you fall down into a roomful
of<00:04:09.970> teen<00:04:10.239> teen<00:04:10.420> explodes<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.590> cause<00:04:11.830> is<00:04:12.280> you

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
of teen teen explodes the cause is you

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.400 
of teen teen explodes the cause is you
standing<00:04:13.180> on<00:04:13.300> the<00:04:13.390> pressure<00:04:13.600> plate<00:04:13.690> and<00:04:13.989> the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
standing on the pressure plate and the

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.349 
standing on the pressure plate and the
effect<00:04:14.739> is<00:04:14.920> you<00:04:15.130> following<00:04:15.640> into<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.180> room

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
effect is you following into the room

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.560 
effect is you following into the room
full<00:04:16.600> of<00:04:16.630> tea<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:16.989> tea<00:04:18.030> now<00:04:19.030> let<00:04:19.419> me<00:04:19.540> explain

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
full of tea and tea now let me explain

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.550 
full of tea and tea now let me explain
this<00:04:21.150> now<00:04:22.150> these<00:04:22.330> command<00:04:22.660> blocks<00:04:22.750> use<00:04:23.290> the

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
this now these command blocks use the

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.330 
this now these command blocks use the
new<00:04:23.740> test<00:04:24.520> for<00:04:24.669> block<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:27.010> to<00:04:27.850> test<00:04:28.480> if<00:04:29.340> the

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
new test for block and to test if the

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.280 
new test for block and to test if the
blocks<00:04:30.840> are<00:04:31.840> present<00:04:32.530> here<00:04:32.800> like<00:04:33.240> if<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.810> place

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
blocks are present here like if I place

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.800 
blocks are present here like if I place
this<00:04:35.530> pumpkin<00:04:36.160> here<00:04:36.550> that's<00:04:37.390> one<00:04:37.660> of<00:04:37.750> the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
this pumpkin here that's one of the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.070 
this pumpkin here that's one of the
places<00:04:38.050> where<00:04:38.350> blocks<00:04:39.310> are<00:04:39.460> supposed<00:04:39.700> to<00:04:39.790> be

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
places where blocks are supposed to be

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.290 
places where blocks are supposed to be
and<00:04:41.080> this<00:04:41.290> circuit<00:04:41.800> turns<00:04:42.040> on<00:04:42.400> because<00:04:43.030> this

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
and this circuit turns on because this

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.810 
and this circuit turns on because this
command<00:04:43.750> block<00:04:43.870> is<00:04:44.200> testing<00:04:44.950> to<00:04:45.070> see<00:04:45.280> if<00:04:45.460> that

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
command block is testing to see if that

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.659 
command block is testing to see if that
particular<00:04:46.330> block<00:04:46.570> is<00:04:46.750> there<00:04:46.990> if<00:04:47.950> it<00:04:48.160> is<00:04:48.310> and

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
particular block is there if it is and

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.250 
particular block is there if it is and
this<00:04:48.790> turns<00:04:49.090> on<00:04:51.270> now<00:04:52.270> this<00:04:52.479> is<00:04:52.539> what<00:04:52.870> isn't

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
this turns on now this is what isn't

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.659 
this turns on now this is what isn't
called<00:04:53.650> an<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:54.160> gate

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
called an and gate

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.200 
called an and gate
only<00:04:55.120> if<00:04:55.360> all<00:04:55.719> of<00:04:56.439> these<00:04:56.620> turn<00:04:57.009> on<00:04:57.189> meaning<00:04:57.699> own

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
only if all of these turn on meaning own

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.159 
only if all of these turn on meaning own
only<00:04:59.080> if<00:04:59.199> all<00:04:59.409> of<00:04:59.650> these<00:04:59.800> torches<00:05:00.280> turned<00:05:00.729> off

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
only if all of these torches turned off

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.770 
only if all of these torches turned off
will<00:05:02.169> this<00:05:02.379> system<00:05:02.590> activate<00:05:03.520> will<00:05:04.150> just<00:05:04.330> turn

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
will this system activate will just turn

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.619 
will this system activate will just turn
on<00:05:04.960> all<00:05:05.949> of<00:05:06.189> this<00:05:06.310> simply<00:05:06.819> removes<00:05:07.300> all<00:05:07.599> the

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629 
on all of this simply removes all the

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:11.730 
on all of this simply removes all the
blocks<00:05:08.409> like<00:05:09.069> the<00:05:09.250> pumpkins<00:05:09.939> the<00:05:10.240> wool<00:05:11.080> the

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
blocks like the pumpkins the wool the

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.850 
blocks like the pumpkins the wool the
etc<00:05:12.430> I'm<00:05:12.639> using<00:05:12.879> setblock<00:05:13.389> command<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:14.259> then

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
etc I'm using setblock command and then

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.850 
etc I'm using setblock command and then
here<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.430> simply<00:05:15.849> summons<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.449> mobs<00:05:19.530> CI<00:05:20.530> and

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
here it simply summons the mobs CI and

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.619 
here it simply summons the mobs CI and
these<00:05:21.039> are<00:05:21.340> simply<00:05:21.789> just<00:05:21.939> the<00:05:22.090> sensors<00:05:22.599> that

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
these are simply just the sensors that

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.770 
these are simply just the sensors that
look<00:05:23.439> for<00:05:23.770> all<00:05:23.889> the<00:05:24.159> blocks<00:05:24.490> that<00:05:25.030> have<00:05:25.599> been

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
look for all the blocks that have been

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.420 
look for all the blocks that have been
placed<00:05:26.340> like<00:05:27.340> you<00:05:27.520> know<00:05:27.639> for<00:05:27.909> all<00:05:28.060> the<00:05:29.430> like

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
placed like you know for all the like

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:52.439 
placed like you know for all the like
say<00:05:30.639> if<00:05:30.699> I<00:05:30.849> constructed<00:05:31.509> this<00:05:31.659> again<00:05:50.849> I<00:05:51.849> didn't

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
say if I constructed this again I didn't

00:05:52.449 --> 00:06:00.240 
say if I constructed this again I didn't
do<00:05:52.659> that<00:05:52.900> right<00:05:54.150> now<00:05:58.560> I'm<00:05:59.560> going<00:05:59.800> to<00:05:59.889> leave<00:06:00.039> the

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
do that right now I'm going to leave the

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.579 
do that right now I'm going to leave the
head<00:06:00.370> for<00:06:00.639> a<00:06:00.669> moment<00:06:00.819> just<00:06:01.270> so<00:06:01.449> it<00:06:01.629> doesn't<00:06:01.690> do

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:02.589 
head for a moment just so it doesn't do

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:03.689 
head for a moment just so it doesn't do
its<00:06:02.800> thing<00:06:02.919> yet

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
alright so now all of these have been

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.540 
alright so now all of these have been
turned<00:06:06.699> on<00:06:07.770> except<00:06:08.770> for<00:06:08.919> this<00:06:09.039> one<00:06:09.099> this<00:06:09.490> is

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
turned on except for this one this is

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.779 
turned on except for this one this is
the<00:06:09.879> pumpkin<00:06:10.719> head<00:06:10.960> now<00:06:11.800> because<00:06:12.159> this<00:06:12.520> is

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
the pumpkin head now because this is

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.409 
the pumpkin head now because this is
still<00:06:13.029> off<00:06:13.270> this<00:06:14.050> torch<00:06:14.589> is<00:06:14.949> still<00:06:15.190> on<00:06:15.430> meaning

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
still off this torch is still on meaning

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.029 
still off this torch is still on meaning
that<00:06:16.539> this<00:06:16.750> is<00:06:16.930> all<00:06:17.080> still<00:06:17.349> on<00:06:17.529> meaning<00:06:17.919> that

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 
that this is all still on meaning that

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:21.209 
that this is all still on meaning that
this<00:06:18.279> torch<00:06:18.729> is<00:06:19.150> off<00:06:19.740> as<00:06:20.740> soon<00:06:20.889> as<00:06:20.979> I<00:06:21.039> place
