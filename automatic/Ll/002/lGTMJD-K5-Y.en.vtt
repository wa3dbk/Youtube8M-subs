00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.180 
because heels a little bit bitter to the
taste<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.199> don't<00:00:16.350> have<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.590> put<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.949> into

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
taste so you don't have to put that into

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.760 
taste so you don't have to put that into
the<00:00:17.670> Vitamix<00:00:18.060> but<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.900> nice<00:00:19.050> thing<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.590> you

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
the Vitamix but the nice thing is is you

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.420 
the Vitamix but the nice thing is is you
leave<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.520> white<00:00:20.730> part<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.210> that's<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.779> pit

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
leave the white part on that's the pit

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.950 
leave the white part on that's the pit
so<00:00:23.430> there's<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.760> word<00:00:24.060> called<00:00:24.090> bioflavonoids

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
so there's a word called bioflavonoids

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.960 
so there's a word called bioflavonoids
it's<00:00:25.560> kind<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.920> sexy<00:00:26.310> little<00:00:26.460> word<00:00:26.730> but

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
it's kind of a sexy little word but

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.849 
it's kind of a sexy little word but
that's<00:00:27.150> really<00:00:27.449> what's<00:00:27.840> located<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.619> pits

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
that's really what's located in the pits

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.650 
that's really what's located in the pits
and<00:00:29.099> that's<00:00:29.220> what<00:00:29.429> delivers<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.970> vitamin<00:00:30.390> C

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
and that's what delivers the vitamin C

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.640 
and that's what delivers the vitamin C
into<00:00:31.050> your<00:00:31.170> body

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
into your body

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.889 
into your body
so<00:00:32.160> without<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.610> pit<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.450> won't<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
so without the pit you won't get the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.770 
so without the pit you won't get the
vitamin<00:00:34.230> C<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.880> juicer<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:36.120> does<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:36.510> it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
vitamin C a juicer just does what it

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.250 
vitamin C a juicer just does what it
extracts<00:00:37.350> juice<00:00:37.559> right<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.270> all<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.930> sugar

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
extracts juice right so all that sugar

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.510 
extracts juice right so all that sugar
water<00:00:40.500> goes<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.100> probably<00:00:41.340> need<00:00:41.460> about

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
water goes on you probably need about

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.290 
water goes on you probably need about
six<00:00:41.910> oranges<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:43.469> get<00:00:43.649> probably<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.879> cup

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
six oranges to get probably like a cup

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.600 
six oranges to get probably like a cup
of<00:00:45.450> orange<00:00:45.629> juice<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.500> your<00:00:46.680> money<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.070> all

the<00:00:47.820> fiber<00:00:48.770> Holt<00:00:49.770> gets<00:00:50.070> from<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.460> trash<00:00:50.700> so

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
the fiber Holt gets from the trash so

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.600 
the fiber Holt gets from the trash so
with<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.500> all<00:00:52.710> stays<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.219> there<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.550> you

with this it all stays in there so you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.790 
with this it all stays in there so you
use<00:00:53.820> less<00:00:53.850> fruit<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:55.620> more

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
use less fruit but you get more

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.400 
use less fruit but you get more
nutrition<00:00:56.070> save<00:00:56.460> more<00:00:56.670> money<00:00:56.699> okay<00:00:57.449> next

Apple<00:01:21.400> in<00:01:21.490> four<00:01:21.820> and<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:23.770> you<00:01:23.860> put<00:01:24.040> that<00:01:24.160> all

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
Apple in four and then you put that all

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.250 
Apple in four and then you put that all
in<00:01:24.520> including<00:01:25.300> that<00:01:25.420> stem<00:01:25.750> so<00:01:26.080> there's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
in including that stem so there's

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.680 
in including that stem so there's
there's<00:01:26.590> pectin<00:01:27.220> which<00:01:27.790> we<00:01:27.970> call<00:01:28.210> nature's

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
there's pectin which we call nature's

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.570 
there's pectin which we call nature's
broom<00:01:28.900> that<00:01:29.230> cleans<00:01:29.560> you<00:01:29.710> out<00:01:29.740> that's<00:01:30.310> gonna

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
broom that cleans you out that's gonna

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
come out of the seeds and the corn the

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.010 
come out of the seeds and the corn the
stem<00:01:32.500> so<00:01:33.490> again<00:01:33.700> we've<00:01:33.880> used<00:01:34.390> a<00:01:34.570> lot<00:01:34.750> less

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
stem so again we've used a lot less

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.170 
stem so again we've used a lot less

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.750 

now<00:03:36.230> you<00:03:36.319> have<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.500> camper<00:03:37.010> stick<00:03:37.250> with<00:03:37.400> all<00:03:37.549> the

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
acceleration tools I can push everything

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.729 
acceleration tools I can push everything
down<00:03:40.129> into<00:03:40.549> that<00:03:40.790> place<00:03:41.440> we<00:03:42.440> have<00:03:42.620> that

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
down into that place we have that

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.190 
down into that place we have that
fitting<00:03:43.069> started<00:03:43.459> so<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:44.480> cut<00:03:44.810> orange

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
fitting started so that cut orange

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.720 
fitting started so that cut orange
that's<00:03:45.440> already<00:03:45.739> getting<00:03:45.950> juiced<00:03:46.310> down<00:03:46.549> there

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
that's already getting juiced down there

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.339 
that's already getting juiced down there
at<00:03:46.819> the<00:03:46.849> bottom<00:03:46.970> now<00:03:47.750> if<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:47.900> want<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.170> have

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
at the bottom now if you want to have

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:49.839 
at the bottom now if you want to have
work<00:03:48.590> you<00:03:49.129> do<00:03:49.250> like<00:03:49.400> this<00:03:49.549> like<00:03:49.760> an

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
work you do like this like an

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:50.500 
work you do like this like an
infomercial

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
infomercial

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.330 
infomercial
so<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.840> Vitamix<00:03:51.260> actually<00:03:51.709> can<00:03:51.890> become<00:03:52.040> an

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
so the Vitamix actually can become an

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.460 
so the Vitamix actually can become an
app<00:03:52.489> where<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:52.819> turned<00:03:53.090> up<00:03:53.209> on<00:03:53.360> high<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:53.900> you

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
app where it turned up on high and you

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.080 
app where it turned up on high and you
just<00:03:54.590> do<00:03:54.739> add<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.430> kitchen<00:03:55.760> no<00:03:55.970> I'm

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
just do add that the kitchen no I'm

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
just do add that the kitchen no I'm
kidding<00:03:56.450> just<00:03:56.690> throw<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:56.959> all<00:03:57.079> down

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.460 

I<00:04:01.140> just<00:04:01.680> have<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.010> little<00:04:02.130> run
