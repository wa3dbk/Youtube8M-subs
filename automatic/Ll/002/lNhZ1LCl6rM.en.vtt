00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
um chorus course pretty much like a main

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:46.950 
um chorus course pretty much like a main
room<00:04:43.979> but<00:04:44.979> I<00:04:45.099> like<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.490> play<00:04:45.699> like<00:04:45.729> some<00:04:46.449> sort

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
room but I like to play like some sort

00:04:46.960 --> 00:05:07.920 
room but I like to play like some sort
of<00:04:47.849> ascending<00:04:49.020> thing<00:04:50.020> down<00:04:50.229> it's<00:04:50.470> done<00:05:06.930> so

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
of ascending thing down it's done so

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.050 
of ascending thing down it's done so
let's<00:05:08.139> all<00:05:08.409> that<00:05:08.979> would<00:05:09.159> look<00:05:09.340> like<00:05:09.550> a<00:05:09.610> doll<00:05:12.060> I

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
let's all that would look like a doll I

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.930 
let's all that would look like a doll I
guess<00:05:13.720> it<00:05:13.900> keeps<00:05:14.020> us<00:05:14.259> with<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.590> solo<00:05:14.860> I'm<00:05:15.639> just

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
guess it keeps us with the solo I'm just

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.969 
guess it keeps us with the solo I'm just
gonna<00:05:16.409> play<00:05:17.409> slow<00:05:17.849> for<00:05:18.849> you<00:05:18.940> guys<00:05:19.150> so<00:05:19.630> you<00:05:20.380> have

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
gonna play slow for you guys so you have

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:22.920 
gonna play slow for you guys so you have
an<00:05:21.129> idea<00:05:21.400> how<00:05:21.550> it<00:05:21.699> works<00:05:21.940> it's<00:05:22.240> not<00:05:22.419> necessary

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
an idea how it works it's not necessary

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.270 
an idea how it works it's not necessary
to<00:05:22.990> play<00:05:23.169> it<00:05:23.229> exactly<00:05:23.349> like<00:05:23.710> that<00:05:23.889> I<00:05:24.370> guess<00:05:24.909> but

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
to play it exactly like that I guess but

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:39.850 
to play it exactly like that I guess but
here's<00:05:27.280> how<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.430> pledge<00:05:32.310> something<00:05:33.310> like<00:05:33.430> this

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
I'm something like that I think it's

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:23.410 
I'm something like that I think it's
pretty<00:06:16.280> close<00:06:16.580> to<00:06:16.760> the<00:06:16.850> original<00:06:18.460> um<00:06:20.950> then<00:06:22.420> I

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.420 
pretty close to the original um then I

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.970 
pretty close to the original um then I
play<00:06:24.050> in<00:06:24.320> my<00:06:24.470> video<00:06:25.690> some<00:06:26.690> sort<00:06:26.900> of<00:06:26.930> an<00:06:27.050> outro<00:06:27.650> I

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:27.980 
play in my video some sort of an outro I

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.020 
play in my video some sort of an outro I
think<00:06:28.580> it's<00:06:28.760> a<00:06:28.850> lot<00:06:29.690> like<00:06:30.160> the<00:06:31.160> saxophone<00:06:31.760> on

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
think it's a lot like the saxophone on

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.700 
think it's a lot like the saxophone on
the<00:06:32.300> original<00:06:32.780> version

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
the original version

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.670
