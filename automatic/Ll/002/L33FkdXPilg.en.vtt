let's<00:00:46.690> take<00:00:46.809> a<00:00:46.870> look<00:00:47.079> at<00:00:47.199> this<00:00:47.320> first<00:00:47.530> example

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
let's take a look at this first example

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.569 
let's take a look at this first example
and<00:00:48.280> you'll<00:00:48.579> see<00:00:48.760> just<00:00:48.789> why<00:00:49.949> now<00:00:50.949> first<00:00:51.190> off<00:00:51.370> if

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
and you'll see just why now first off if

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.610 
and you'll see just why now first off if
you<00:00:51.699> don't<00:00:51.879> have<00:00:52.059> any<00:00:52.239> AutoCAD<00:00:52.750> DWG<00:00:52.930> laying

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
you don't have any AutoCAD DWG laying

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.950 
you don't have any AutoCAD DWG laying
around<00:00:53.890> your<00:00:54.100> your<00:00:55.059> design<00:00:55.420> now<00:00:55.600> so<00:00:55.750> you

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
around your your design now so you

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.360 
around your your design now so you
probably<00:00:56.170> haven't<00:00:56.469> been<00:00:56.710> designed<00:00:57.039> for<00:00:57.219> too

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
probably haven't been designed for too

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.639 
probably haven't been designed for too
long<00:00:57.519> everybody's<00:00:58.090> got<00:00:58.239> DWG<00:00:58.899> we've<00:00:59.320> all<00:00:59.469> got

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
long everybody's got DWG we've all got

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.110 
long everybody's got DWG we've all got
some<00:00:59.800> old<00:00:59.890> drawings<00:01:00.280> in<00:01:00.399> there<00:01:00.550> that<00:01:00.730> we<00:01:00.820> that

some old drawings in there that we that
we'd<00:01:01.239> like<00:01:01.420> to<00:01:01.570> use<00:01:01.719> rather<00:01:01.960> than<00:01:02.079> starting

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
we'd like to use rather than starting

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.259 
we'd like to use rather than starting
from<00:01:02.500> scratch<00:01:02.739> all<00:01:03.039> the<00:01:03.160> time<00:01:03.340> now<00:01:04.000> one<00:01:04.150> of<00:01:04.180> the

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
new part file here now all of that

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.719 
new part file here now all of that
information<00:01:19.570> now<00:01:20.140> is<00:01:20.579> information<00:01:21.579> that<00:01:21.610> I

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
information now is information that I

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.179 
information now is information that I
can<00:01:21.939> use<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.180> create<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:23.140> 3d<00:01:23.170> model<00:01:23.680> this<00:01:24.009> so<00:01:24.159> I

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
can use to create the 3d model this so I

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.050 
can use to create the 3d model this so I
can<00:01:24.250> go<00:01:24.430> ahead<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.610> move<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.240> design<00:01:25.570> forward

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
can go ahead and move the design forward

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.690 
can go ahead and move the design forward
rather<00:01:28.060> than<00:01:28.210> simply<00:01:28.780> editing<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:30.460> lines

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
rather than simply editing the lines

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.850 
rather than simply editing the lines
arcs<00:01:30.970> and<00:01:31.090> circles<00:01:31.210> that<00:01:31.630> represent<00:01:32.259> apart<00:01:32.649> I

arcs and circles that represent apart I

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.350 
arcs and circles that represent apart I
can<00:01:33.130> go<00:01:33.250> ahead<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.430> make<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.640> full<00:01:34.060> digital

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
can go ahead and make a full digital

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.780 
can go ahead and make a full digital

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.819 
it to extrude to this face so that
they're<00:02:04.509> both<00:02:04.659> flush<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.229> they'll<00:02:05.409> always<00:02:05.649> be

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
they're both flush and they'll always be

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.760 
they're both flush and they'll always be
flush<00:02:06.219> so<00:02:06.850> if<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.119> dimension<00:02:07.570> changes<00:02:07.990> i<00:02:08.170> know

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
flush so if the dimension changes i know

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.220 
flush so if the dimension changes i know
that<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.250> my<00:02:09.520> new<00:02:09.880> boss<00:02:10.090> here<00:02:10.390> is<00:02:10.570> going<00:02:11.110> to

that the my new boss here is going to
maintain<00:02:11.760> its<00:02:12.760> flush<00:02:13.150> relationship<00:02:13.750> with<00:02:14.140> the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
maintain its flush relationship with the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.260 
maintain its flush relationship with the
outside<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.830> now<00:02:15.490> here<00:02:15.820> i'm<00:02:16.000> going<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.180> go

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
outside of that now here i'm going to go

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.980 
outside of that now here i'm going to go
ahead<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.420> place<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.690> cup

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
ahead and place a cup

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.280 
ahead and place a cup
holes<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:18.190> again<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.450> hole<00:02:19.600> diameter<00:02:20.140> was

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
holes and again the hole diameter was

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.690 
holes and again the hole diameter was
something<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.620> was<00:02:20.830> included<00:02:21.130> in<00:02:21.520> the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
something that was included in the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.310 
something that was included in the
original<00:02:21.790> sketch<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.660> I'm<00:02:23.020> going<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.200> go

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
original sketch and I'm going to go

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.260 
original sketch and I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.530> reference<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.340> parameter<00:02:24.700> that

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
ahead and reference that parameter that

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.600 
ahead and reference that parameter that
also<00:02:25.660> came<00:02:25.810> across<00:02:25.990> from<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.920> from<00:02:27.580> the

also came across from the from the
AutoCAD<00:02:28.180> 2d<00:02:28.630> data<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:30.160> I've<00:02:30.250> got<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.400> couple

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
AutoCAD 2d data so I've got a couple

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.750 
AutoCAD 2d data so I've got a couple
through<00:02:30.910> holes<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.330> elastic
