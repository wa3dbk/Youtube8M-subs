00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.630
 a greeting to all friends of 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.420

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.430
 pack of sony xperia l smartphone 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.310
 medium to medium low end we 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.070
 said because I would insert in the band 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.779
 medium or medium high instead xperia sl che 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.960
 we have already reviewed some 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.330
 technical feature in connectivity 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.860
 hsp at up to 21 megabits per second 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:45.010
 bluetooth 4.0 nfc no video output 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.400
 not even via mhl dual core processor 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.330
 latest generation 1 GB snapdragon 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.080

 1750 milan battery for 4 screen 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.080
 inches and 3 with 480 x 854 resolution 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.350
 pixel 8 megapixel camera that 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.470
 record video in hd but not in full hd 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.770
 front camera and it's often just 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.170
 9.7 mm is the curious positioning of the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.200
 smartphone because you go to position in 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:26.079
 a band in another type of band 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.609
 respect just asl but then here there 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.340
 they are manuals because there is a moment 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:32.380
 see right to be sure not 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.530
 there is nothing else in the package 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.350
 so we saw feeder 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:44.219
 italian micro usb cable usb 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.219
 no earphones this year battery 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:50.200
 this is the smartphone smartphone that 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.999
 very reminiscent of xperia jane that 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.499
 we have already reviewed on our site 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.350
 the technical characteristics of inspica 

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:01.569
 cei were, however, so to speak 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.119
 handed down if we want to the small xp is 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.159
 which we have already reviewed while instead 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.600
 this xp and l is positioned exactly one 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.030
 middle between sp is the old j 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.140
 however a decidedly more hardware 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.050
 updated this is the cover slightly 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.209
 removable curve and therefore battery 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.430
 removable slot for micro sd and la 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:35.070
 sim there seems a need for a sim 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:37.130
 complete ok we turn it on the side 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.390
 right we have the power button 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.070
 made and stick to mind like everyone 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.530

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.430
 searched from three and a half central behind

 the 8 megapixel camera with LEDs 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.000
 flash 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.340
 the speaker and the sticker that shows us the 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.590
 presence of nfc we will review this 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.959
