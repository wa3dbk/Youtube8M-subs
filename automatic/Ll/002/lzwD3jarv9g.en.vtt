I'm<00:02:53.480> holding<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:54.190> 4<00:02:55.190> kg<00:02:55.780> block<00:02:56.780> of<00:02:57.050> mulch<00:02:57.610> which

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
I'm holding a 4 kg block of mulch which

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.000 
I'm holding a 4 kg block of mulch which
is<00:02:58.910> shredded<00:02:59.510> coconut<00:03:00.050> husk<00:03:00.350> that's<00:03:00.740> been

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
is shredded coconut husk that's been

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.880 
is shredded coconut husk that's been
compressed<00:03:01.870> when<00:03:02.870> water<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.290> added<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.710> it

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
compressed when water is added to it

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.240 
compressed when water is added to it
between<00:03:04.550> 4<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.090> 5<00:03:05.300> gallons<00:03:05.870> or<00:03:06.110> just<00:03:06.950> letting

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
between 4 and 5 gallons or just letting

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
between 4 and 5 gallons or just letting
the<00:03:07.370> rain<00:03:07.960> soaked<00:03:08.960> in<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:10.100> can<00:03:10.370> then<00:03:10.550> be<00:03:10.580> broken

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
the rain soaked in it can then be broken

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.610 
the rain soaked in it can then be broken
up<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.660> raked<00:03:12.410> out<00:03:12.620> level<00:03:14.290> when<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.410> gets

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
up and raked out level when it gets

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.360 
up and raked out level when it gets
spread<00:03:16.580> out<00:03:17.230> two<00:03:18.230> inches<00:03:18.620> thick<00:03:18.860> will<00:03:19.100> cover

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
spread out two inches thick will cover

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.860 
spread out two inches thick will cover
12<00:03:19.760> square<00:03:20.150> feet<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:22.670> advantages<00:03:23.390> of<00:03:23.420> it

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
12 square feet and the advantages of it

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.870 
12 square feet and the advantages of it
not<00:03:24.260> only<00:03:24.470> in<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:25.630> ability<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.900> handle<00:03:27.380> this

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
not only in the ability to handle this

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.730 
not only in the ability to handle this
because<00:03:28.880> when<00:03:29.300> it's<00:03:29.450> expanded<00:03:30.080> it<00:03:30.170> equals<00:03:30.590> a

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
because when it's expanded it equals a

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.030 
because when it's expanded it equals a
two<00:03:30.950> cubic<00:03:31.400> foot<00:03:31.640> bag<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:32.180> mulch<00:03:32.800> but<00:03:33.800> this

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
two cubic foot bag of mulch but this

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.390 
two cubic foot bag of mulch but this
mulch<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:35.030> coconut<00:03:35.600> shredded<00:03:35.900> coconut<00:03:36.560> will

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
mulch the coconut shredded coconut will

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.290 
mulch the coconut shredded coconut will
last<00:03:37.730> three<00:03:38.570> times<00:03:39.340> what<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.520> average<00:03:40.550> bulk

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
last three times what the average bulk

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.750 
last three times what the average bulk
wood<00:03:42.290> would<00:03:42.740> bark<00:03:43.400> mulch<00:03:43.930> so<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.200> also<00:03:45.700> on<00:03:46.700> a

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
wood would bark mulch so and also on a

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.470 
wood would bark mulch so and also on a
slope<00:03:48.130> it'll<00:03:49.130> hold<00:03:49.340> in<00:03:49.580> place<00:03:49.880> because<00:03:50.180> it

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
slope it'll hold in place because it

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.020 
slope it'll hold in place because it
doesn't<00:03:50.840> float<00:03:51.250> whereas<00:03:52.250> a<00:03:52.280> lot<00:03:52.400> of<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.670> bark

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
doesn't float whereas a lot of the bark

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.120 
doesn't float whereas a lot of the bark
mulches<00:03:53.600> will<00:03:53.870> just<00:03:54.110> float<00:03:54.380> away<00:03:54.530> in<00:03:54.830> a<00:03:54.920> heavy

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
mulches will just float away in a heavy

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.980 
mulches will just float away in a heavy
rain<00:03:55.810> so<00:03:56.810> those<00:03:56.990> are<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.290> advantages
