I<00:01:05.189> know<00:01:05.339> Club<00:01:05.670> Penguin<00:01:05.939> does<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> lot<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.450> codes

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.390 
I know Club Penguin does a lot of codes
but<00:01:07.080> not<00:01:07.290> one<00:01:07.500> where<00:01:07.680> they<00:01:07.799> donate<00:01:08.130> money<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
but not one where they donate money and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.510 
but not one where they donate money and
I<00:01:08.610> think<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> gave<00:01:09.330> some<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:10.710> guys<00:01:10.920> the

I think that gave some you guys the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.109 
I think that gave some you guys the
users<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.570> bit<00:01:12.720> more<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.890> push<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.460> get

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
users a little bit more of a push to get

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.660 
users a little bit more of a push to get
this<00:01:15.330> item<00:01:15.570> not<00:01:16.380> only<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.100> cool<00:01:17.400> but

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.310 
this item not only because it's cool but
also<00:01:17.880> because<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.659> really<00:01:18.930> helps<00:01:19.170> out<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
also because it really helps out the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.870 
also because it really helps out the
environment<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> think<00:01:19.979> that's<00:01:20.280> also<00:01:20.700> what

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
