confusing<00:03:29.239> me<00:03:29.330> that<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.630> scenes<00:03:29.900> people<00:03:30.080> love

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
confusing me that the scenes people love

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.460 
confusing me that the scenes people love
the<00:03:30.530> most<00:03:30.560> were<00:03:30.920> scenes<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.520> didn't<00:03:31.850> get

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
the most were scenes that I didn't get

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.260 
the most were scenes that I didn't get
for<00:03:33.470> example<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.370> scene<00:03:34.640> when<00:03:34.880> Ted<00:03:35.120> is

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
for example the scene when Ted is

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.090 
for example the scene when Ted is
hanging<00:03:35.600> out<00:03:35.660> with<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.930> hookers<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.860> big

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
hanging out with the hookers the big

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.130 
hanging out with the hookers the big
joke<00:03:37.430> is<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:37.910> there's<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.330> piece<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.810> poop<00:03:39.020> in

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140

joke is that there's a piece of poop in
the<00:03:39.260> middle<00:03:39.500> of<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.620> room<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.400> ends

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
the middle of the room and it ends

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.940 
the middle of the room and it ends
with<00:03:40.849> Mark<00:03:41.090> Wahlberg<00:03:41.360> saying<00:03:41.870> whoa<00:03:42.379> it's<00:03:42.799> that

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
piece of well you know the way I see it

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.710 
piece of well you know the way I see it
that<00:03:46.340> scene<00:03:46.819> comes<00:03:47.060> off<00:03:47.209> as<00:03:47.390> awkward

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
disgusting but like I said comedy is

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.920 
disgusting but like I said comedy is
subjective<00:03:52.150> however<00:03:53.150> there<00:03:53.629> are<00:03:53.720> a<00:03:53.750> few

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
subjective however there are a few

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.479 
subjective however there are a few
scenes<00:03:54.230> in<00:03:54.379> this<00:03:54.470> movie<00:03:54.530> that<00:03:54.829> did<00:03:55.250> get

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
chuckle out of me I did think the scene

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.160 
chuckle out of me I did think the scene
when<00:03:58.310> John<00:03:58.579> introduces<00:03:58.849> his<00:03:59.390> parents<00:03:59.780> at<00:03:59.930> Ted
