00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.300
 These are the legitimate scope trekking 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.009
 sticks and that are the tripods so 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.480
 a man tripods as a tracking stock 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.919
 can be used and at the same time 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.900
 the functions have that you as 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.460
 a tripod can use 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.400
 that makes sense if somehow 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.360
 on the way is so filled in berlin and 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.860
 then just stop once 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.850
 weight distribution then still right 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.170
 can use stronger 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.490
 in the back is heavy 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.420
 backpack tripod you can look in the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.700
 save end- effect 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.230
 you have two in there and that 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.480
 once the traffic stop shop you 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.970
 can use as a tripod here 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.130
 the models are almost the same so once 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.960
 more a tripod made of aluminum and then 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.030
 we have one of carbon 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.380
 the difference in weight that lifts 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.150
 back on that the carbon 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.140
 Tripod is a bit longer 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.660
 So it can go a bit further 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.680
 extend and how that works exactly 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.980
 and what you can do 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.870
 I'll show you the carbon now 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.670
 tripod that's the one behind us here 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.590
 Seen from them that possesses thus here 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.750
 shoot three where I cry here 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.700
 can take off and the whole 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.870
 Monopod my personal big 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.350
 then set as I need it 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.040
 And the aluminum tracking once tripod 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.080
 has two close for two times here 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.690
 to open and adjust the height 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.950
 We'll do that right now 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.600
 start here with the simpler one 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.640
 model to the so is the aluminum 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.960
 or if they unpack it at home and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.400
 then full of enthusiasm here the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.140
 close also make and then pull 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.070
 you have full soup and suddenly you have it 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.229
 then something in the hand 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.640
 that is not unintentional you can 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.560
 So pull it out and you can do it too 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.030
 go beyond the point where you are 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.760
 then you can take all house 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.799
 that makes sense were on the way 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.580
 are and it is raining and it is mushy 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.990
 and it gets dirty 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.400
 then you can see the so undress completely 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.900
 and may she had muffy more comfortable then 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.520
 just clean it 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.530
 if I now a certain height 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.150
 I want to adjust then I do that in 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.259
 I now here the bottom two 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.549
 first take off and four now me one 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.610
 choose the mark I have 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.650
 I would like to have such a thing 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.150
 meter 40 for me about the measure of all 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.229
 Things are pretty comfortable where I am 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.240
 can wear or 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.250
 then use as a walking stick 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.049
 then close it and then the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.670
 I go up and do the same thing too 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.410
 again, and to the same length 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.180
 that is, they represent 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.680
 the identical values ​​once actually 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.940
 for it at the upper close and 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.430
 then once the provider for sure 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.220
 below and then I have that exactly 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.930
 adjusted to my length that is so 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.120
 the aluminum instead of the ban 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.010
 Tripod is a bit different then 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.680
 wise here as well the close as 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.170
 just in the fast way are 3 here must 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.550
 I start with the bottom one and that 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.420
 Of course I can do it all together too 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.430
 slightly longer than the aluminum 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.140
 tripod or the tracking stock and indeed 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.240
 I have to start down here 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.240
 I have to go in groups and search where 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.870
 starts the marking a bit 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.930
 pull it out 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.060
 So I'm here for the art or 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.430
 on the note or here it stops 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.320
 That's the maximum length here 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.970
 The mother can then choose below 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.800
 then I just go there 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.850
 and then do it here in the second step 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.100
 I know that with the 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.610
 made aluminum tripod a tenant 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.770
 45 as an example click and then 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.070
 once the holders up here 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.300
 to adjust 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.370
 and now she can measure that too 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.350
 team is now a meter 45 long 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.750
 that could not show you here now 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.340
 but it is actually so and now 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.810
 time to top the handle again 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.910
 That's the special thing when you're here 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.770
 what have you got on this track ? 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.840
 just hold this normal third 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.430
 stock then turns into a tripod 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.370
 But before I explain here 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.900
 briefly a declaration Although namely 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.010
 Up here the power is really great 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.720
 handy is also a bit 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.580
 Ergonomically shaped is a small one 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.680
 you can really buckle 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.030
 touch it well and you can do it all 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.640
 even with this wrist strap then 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.260
 Call it all around your wrist 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.090
 Immediately and so new are that 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.340
 but a rubber band humor so 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.680
 either hand by sleeping on 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.510
 secure and then just right here 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.239
 good grip tight grip 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.680
 but now to the special so to the 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.370
 special feature and that is this 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.250
 once up 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.750
 the handle until 27 this little one 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.130
 highlighting that almost looks like one 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.760
 small golf club as is 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.020
 here on the inside a small one 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.100
 slider and that is also here if 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.510
 I can not recognize it 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.010
 So we have a lock for him 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.299
 symbol for closed what now the 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.949
 condition is 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.239
 I can not open it now 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.190
 move in the moment where I am here 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.919
 the lever simply direction open funds 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.610
 I can just turn it off like this 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.740
 and I can do it and I have it here 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.150
 A bad witness above really winds up 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.560
 then attach the camera 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.879
 the whole thing will be here with you 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.960
 this simply screw down firmly 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.620
 made ie the camera is 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.240
 placed 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.889
 I turn on the little camera 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.780
 and then I can do it all year 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.960
 as easy to use a tripod 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.879
 so now I have this here 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.250
 monopod or the 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:52.800
 tracking stock and can now here 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:57.210
 simply the camera approaches under the 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:01.469
 hold thread and then just go with it 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.669
 of the camera on the thread above 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:05.849
 or on the podium 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.139
 stock attach so that's natural 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.310
 a small screw with it only one 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.199
 turn a little more but that works 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.009
 really easy in a hand and one hand 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:17.819
 easy and that's no problem at all 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:19.139
 that then they can fix here 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.879
 of course try one too 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.259
 small ballhead but well what you 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.110
 Exaggerate because you can do everything 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:27.509
 and now we have a tripod here and 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.039
 As you can see, that also holds and must 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.340
 Also, do not worry that one 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.460
 So here's the expensive one 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.229
 Camera equipment smashed to ground 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.060
 and that's the special thing has 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.680
 give him this account over one 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.139
 Tracking stop working out that way 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.340
 especially at this point too 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.599
 another message which they note can 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.279
 Of course, this stick is as well 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.479
 telescope to abuse can than here 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.550
 go up on the camera 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:54.210
 Set self- timer mode and 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.949
 can then actually here somehow 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.029
 so down from above and then how 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.580
 always want to do that 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:01.080
 a photo is ultimately thought 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.770
 hopefully not started right now 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.960
 So that's the telescope tracking here 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.150
 stock tripod and while the film for the 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.669
 Two models have the workshop once 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.469
 the cover version and once the 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.120
 aluminum version so these are from the 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:16.830
 functions identical only has with the 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.500
 difference that the aluminum tripod 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.300
 not quite as long and the carbon 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.580
 Tripod longer accordingly 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.860
 yes I say so much fun while hiking 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.419
 and do not take pictures and do not forget them 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.419
 here a thunderstorm
