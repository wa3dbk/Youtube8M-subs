00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the foamed up comments from the previous

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.029 
the foamed up comments from the previous
video<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.020> as<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.650> see<00:00:22.800> we've<00:00:22.920> got<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
video so as you can see we've got a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.769 
video so as you can see we've got a
pretty<00:00:23.220> decent<00:00:23.400> team<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:24.000> feel<00:00:24.570> like<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
pretty decent team I feel like the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.029 
pretty decent team I feel like the
midfield<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> little<00:00:25.590> bit<00:00:25.769> weak<00:00:25.920> of

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
midfield can be a little bit weak of

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.620 
midfield can be a little bit weak of
times<00:00:26.250> kadir<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.760> quite<00:00:26.970> slow<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.420> he's<00:00:27.510> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
times kadir is quite slow so he's the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.730 
times kadir is quite slow so he's the
only<00:00:27.779> kind<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.109> player<00:00:28.320> that's<00:00:28.500> gonna<00:00:28.590> be

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
only kind of player that's gonna be

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.189 
only kind of player that's gonna be
coming<00:00:29.160> back<00:00:29.279> defensively<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.929> sure<00:00:31.080> how

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
coming back defensively so not sure how

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.209 
coming back defensively so not sure how
that's<00:00:31.380> going<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.529> go<00:00:31.590> down<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.070> are
