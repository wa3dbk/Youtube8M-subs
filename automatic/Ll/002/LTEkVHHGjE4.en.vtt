00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.599
 I'm there with a match that game is 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.260
 This guy thinks Tibia, right? 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.940
 no joke from mw3 to 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.580
 who has never played this game and it is not 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.279
 daily and he is shooting people and 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.289
 playing marginal is that game that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.920
 you paid before you 're connected to 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.619
 the pink sister plays cse new cs and today in 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.149
 day I see you kill the rust and kill 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.890
 the Bolivians 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.559
 a lie has a dog barking I hope 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.760
 that you are not coming but next 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.070
 I decided to bring a recorded game already 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.300
 decod because I want to vary a little in the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.160
 content in the gallery 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.829
 even these days said that my 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.770
 The channel was only from f3 to a 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.020
 and lie my degree is not only f3 I 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.140
 I'm just recording a lot of df 3 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.789
 because I 'm playing more today 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.460
 I took a little time to find this 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.070
 guy and I find a guy in this game 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.619
 It 's because I know everybody's starting there. 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.450
 using're so fucking kind if there see the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.850
 team with eight people only three appear 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.470
 on the radar and I do not think of this as a 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.720
 business appeal man because I 'm 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.210
 accustomed to playing games without radar knows 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.460
 example team fortress this does not need 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.070
 having radar to play well just listen well 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.090
 to understand how the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.850
 match 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.250
 good in that from there I did a frag up 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.049
 How good compared to cross how to do 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.939
 I will not talk to Fred because otherwise he will 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.920
 lose the grace of the video but I think 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.170
 You'll like it too. 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.530
 But today, I wanted to talk too. 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.270
 about daisy a gurizada is me 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.880
 charging a lot of recording right and that only 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 that does not give simply does not give the 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.479
 I've spent four 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.619
 moment to take him to hell to 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.340
 Deise servers galore with a lot of 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.290
 hacker are very harassed these type 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.299
 days I was trying to record until I learned 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.490
 I learned how unstable was here one 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.890
 difficulty installing to discover how 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.140
 I installed what happened, I got in the 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.290
 The guy gave me hs and I did not even 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.959
 seen karoshi little municipal city 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.079
 She may have seen me and taken everything. 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.569
 then I'll get another tip of the map 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:24.120
 We speak fifth of hell and even 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.090
 so the guy gave me a real gaiatice 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.040
 face that was there in the other Spanish 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.720
 managed to give 10 or be hacker the guy 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.629
 get away from anywhere and kill everything 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.730
 server world and I tried to enter 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.959
 servers had complaining in the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.930
 chat 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.780
 I decided to give up and people are sad about this. 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.060
 because I do not know, I do not know, but I 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.579
 I'm the type of player who does not play 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.670
 Brazil better plays to have fun 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:53.069
 laughing to play has to take the 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.930
 game to seriously themes not to the point of you 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.919
 have to use a hacker to do well 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.709
 bags 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:02.340
 I quote a bad training game a little bit and 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.530
 she recognize the very famous dinosaur 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.689
 she is next 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.720
 training a little bit that you will get good 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.579
 or if it takes a quick mega because you play 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.379
 alone and the game is not easy because 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.659
 You're bad, you have to play with a friend. 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.489
 Dude, you do not know how much good it is. 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.109
 I played with a friend that in this game 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.840
 such with Natalia and the people 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.989
 I was talking was very funny when 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.599
 I died when I always killed a subject. 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.489
 You know and I give this tip everyone who 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.440
 Use that tries to have fun with a friend. 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.790
 instead of getting better for a 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.549
 program 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.260
 so these days I spoke a noise in the 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.659
 twitter is a real friend, you know when 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.400
 uses hacker and it's like a girl arrives 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.769
 it was not you who took the attitude 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.620
 It was not you who did the business. 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.359
 you just happened to be a 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.209
 tool and was used 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:54.030
 I bet 90% of people think that 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.340
 The woman that bomb I also found 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.260
 I was going to die but I think those 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.449
 that you bought and paid for 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.129
 real knows that they mortar and not 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:05.639
 exploded think that happened with 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:09.840
 that bombinha basically where they go 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:12.359
 Send this message of peace to you 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.120
 that you stop using the mw3 machine 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:18.479
 nudity and that the game is and starts to play 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.120
 to have fun fucking expensive pay game 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.400
 not funny all know and enjoy 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.250
 still today with taxes that are 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.639
 charged in Brazil is very expensive games 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.090
 has 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.830
 enjoy the face and so I do not have 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.379
 shame to say that 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.599
 of ten matches played in milan mw 3 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.789
 sets to 1 fred negatives sometimes I give 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:41.879
 a shit and make a match like that 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.590
 But I do not go out here. 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:45.060
 mobile use when I want to kimbo 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.560
 user when I'm with friends 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.060
 angle do not deny that use here in 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.969
 some matches 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.719
 only that nothing else for fun not sack 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:56.310
 to make a good freight and so I think 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:58.439
 This has to happen to the galley. 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.810
 That's when the crowd is lost. 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:03.240
 because I only have pity but not the cup I 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.159
 I think it's just a matter of custom know 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.650
 because we got used to the rack 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.180
 got used to the easy game now that 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.919
 I see how hard we have to use 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.050
 This program works well. 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.840
 the case knocked over the hyper mutirÃ£o just to 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.069
 advised but I think that's a crowd 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.349
 people will get better 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.569
 I'm sure if we play 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:25.710
 united play for fun will improve 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.999
 many games galera br is go 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.900
 change this image that we have there 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:30.500
 out 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.819
 Well, the game is already ending. 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.400
 I even wanted to give a 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:40.770
 look at the final you will have now is a 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.779
 I hate to look at you 1 2 3 e 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.599
 go there for fifa 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:46.860
 it was amazing he talks about dew he shows up in 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.240
 your front right? 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.460
 Anyway, I hope you liked it. 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.039
 of the video if you liked want more 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.810
 videos ask such a taste that's the 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.050
 favorite to help until the next and 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.050
 perhaps
