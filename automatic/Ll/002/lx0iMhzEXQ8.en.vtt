00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
how this works out game recording I have

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.850 
how this works out game recording I have
no<00:01:15.210> idea<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:15.540> you're<00:01:15.689> able<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.049> innate<00:01:16.590> well

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
no idea if you're able to innate well

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.920 
no idea if you're able to innate well
you're<00:01:17.430> able<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.939> enable<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> don't

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
you're able to enable it but I don't

you're able to enable it but I don't
know<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.350> actually<00:01:19.560> corresponds<00:01:20.460> with

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
know if that actually corresponds with

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.109 
know if that actually corresponds with
the<00:01:20.820> combat<00:01:21.750> training<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.830> anyway<00:01:23.340> make<00:01:24.090> sure

boost<00:03:28.409> on<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.889> I<00:03:29.040> guess<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.669> lot<00:03:29.699> of<00:03:29.969> my

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
boost on this I guess like a lot of my

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.390 
boost on this I guess like a lot of my
friends<00:03:30.629> like<00:03:30.659> the<00:03:30.959> boost<00:03:31.169> I<00:03:31.409> don't<00:03:31.889> like<00:03:32.069> it<00:03:32.280> I

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
friends like the boost I don't like it I

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.939 
friends like the boost I don't like it I
don't<00:03:32.459> see<00:03:32.730> really<00:03:32.939> a<00:03:33.030> big<00:03:33.269> point<00:03:33.599> into<00:03:34.019> it<00:03:34.139> but

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
don't see really a big point into it but

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:36.979 
don't see really a big point into it but
uh<00:03:34.980> yeah<00:03:35.939> so<00:03:36.239> basically<00:03:36.359> you<00:03:36.659> just<00:03:36.689> keep

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
uh yeah so basically you just keep

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.750 
uh yeah so basically you just keep
killing<00:03:37.319> them<00:03:37.349> and<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.620> get<00:03:37.769> lots<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.549> lots

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
killing them and you get lots and lots

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.939 
killing them and you get lots and lots
of<00:03:38.909> points<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.389> think<00:03:39.419> after<00:03:39.780> one<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.349> my<00:03:40.500> games
