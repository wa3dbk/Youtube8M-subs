00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
statue I've ever seen but I guess close

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.630 
statue I've ever seen but I guess close

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
enough considered close them up a faith

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.000 
enough considered close them up a faith
yeah<00:03:08.510> doesn't<00:03:08.840> look<00:03:09.079> a<00:03:09.170> whole<00:03:09.410> lot<00:03:09.440> like<00:03:09.650> you

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
but close enough I mean so the chest you

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.920 
but close enough I mean so the chest you
can<00:03:21.889> see<00:03:22.069> this<00:03:22.910> is<00:03:23.090> where<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.389> game<00:03:23.540> is<00:03:23.750> right

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.659 

probably<00:04:58.840> with<00:04:59.410> a<00:04:59.440> little<00:04:59.830> bit<00:04:59.949> of<00:04:59.979> art<00:05:00.310> is

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
probably with a little bit of art is

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.450 
probably with a little bit of art is
what<00:05:00.940> it<00:05:01.060> seems<00:05:01.330> like<00:05:01.479> it<00:05:01.720> says<00:05:02.220> and<00:05:03.220> I<00:05:03.310> also

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
what it seems like it says and I also

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.270 
what it seems like it says and I also
got<00:05:03.729> a<00:05:03.759> really<00:05:03.940> cool<00:05:04.180> code<00:05:04.949> multiplayer<00:05:05.949> codes

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
got a really cool code multiplayer codes

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.480 
got a really cool code multiplayer codes
so<00:05:06.580> that<00:05:06.610> when<00:05:06.849> I<00:05:06.880> die<00:05:07.030> I<00:05:07.270> can<00:05:07.840> turn<00:05:08.080> into<00:05:08.289> a<00:05:08.800> mob

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
so that when I die I can turn into a mob

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.089 
so that when I die I can turn into a mob
of<00:05:09.880> spiders<00:05:10.570> and<00:05:10.810> go<00:05:11.050> kill<00:05:11.289> my<00:05:11.440> enemies<00:05:11.860> with

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099

of spiders and go kill my enemies with
them<00:05:12.280> I<00:05:12.520> probably<00:05:13.090> won't<00:05:13.240> be<00:05:13.389> using<00:05:13.419> that

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870
