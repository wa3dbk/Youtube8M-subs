00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.779
 So said Jehovah, go and buy a pot 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.490

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.130

 Valley of the son came to the 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.010
 entrance of the eastern gate and 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.220
 will proclaim there the words that I give you 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.000
 I will speak, then you will say today the word of Jehovah 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.010

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.800

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.810
 Israel behold, I bring evil upon 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.360
 this place such that to everyone who 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.520
 wounds the retina in the ears because I 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.320
 they left and alienate or in this place and 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.360
 they offered incense to the gods 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.059
 others who had not known 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.430
 they neither their parents nor the kings of Judah 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.950
 and they filled this place with blood of 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.410
 innocent and built high places 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.079
 endorsement to burn their children with fire 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.450
 in holocausts to the same goes to the thing that 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.270
 I did not send them or speak or came to me 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.670
 thought for so much here they come 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.010

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.190

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.200
 and name but valley of slaughter and 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.710

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.990

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.150
 in this place and I will make them fall by the sword 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.460
 in front of his enemies and in his hands 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.229
 of those who seek their lives and give their 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.930
 bodies for food to the birds of the sky 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.479
 and to the beasts of the earth I will put 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.790

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.550

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.649
 will mock about all its destruction and 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.170
 I will make them eat the flesh of their children and 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.509
 the flesh of their daughters and everyone will eat 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.159
 the flesh of his friend in the siege and in 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.820
 the trouble with which they will be shortened 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.200
 enemies and those who seek their lives 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.119
 then he will break the vessel before the 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.310

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.100

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.289

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.240

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.280
 because there was no other place to bury 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.590
