00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
example that we grow in the land and

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.660 
example that we grow in the land and
it's<00:00:13.300> a<00:00:13.420> massive<00:00:14.020> kind<00:00:14.650> of<00:00:14.710> like<00:00:14.830> a<00:00:14.860> barricade

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
it's a massive kind of like a barricade

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.060 
it's a massive kind of like a barricade
that<00:00:15.940> we<00:00:16.029> grow<00:00:16.240> here<00:00:16.270> along<00:00:16.960> with<00:00:17.070> these

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
that we grow here along with these

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.679 
that we grow here along with these
things<00:00:18.400> I<00:00:18.490> don't<00:00:18.550> know<00:00:18.730> what<00:00:18.880> they<00:00:18.970> call<00:00:19.240> in

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
things I don't know what they call in

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.870 
things I don't know what they call in
English<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.609> also<00:00:22.949> one<00:00:23.949> of<00:00:24.070> these<00:00:24.249> things<00:00:24.579> I

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
English and also one of these things I

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.429 
English and also one of these things I
think<00:00:25.599> these<00:00:25.929> are<00:00:26.109> called<00:00:26.349> ice<00:00:26.589> melon<00:00:28.439> but

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
think these are called ice melon but

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.609 
think these are called ice melon but
it's<00:00:29.619> a<00:00:29.679> very<00:00:29.890> common<00:00:30.369> food<00:00:30.999> that<00:00:31.539> we<00:00:31.630> grow<00:00:31.839> in

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
it's a very common food that we grow in

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.279 
it's a very common food that we grow in
Asian<00:00:33.400> cooking<00:00:33.640> but<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.570> main<00:00:34.750> thing<00:00:34.989> I<00:00:35.109> want

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:35.289 
Asian cooking but the main thing I want

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.000 
Asian cooking but the main thing I want
to<00:00:35.350> show<00:00:35.440> you<00:00:35.500> today<00:00:35.770> a<00:00:36.609> great<00:00:37.149> plant<00:00:37.859> to<00:00:38.859> grow

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
to show you today a great plant to grow

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.410 
to show you today a great plant to grow
is<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:39.940> bitter<00:00:40.120> melon<00:00:41.460> these<00:00:42.460> are<00:00:43.000> pretty

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
is the bitter melon these are pretty

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.259 
is the bitter melon these are pretty
much<00:00:43.629> at<00:00:43.899> the<00:00:44.050> end<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.890> season<00:00:45.430> for<00:00:46.090> us

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
much at the end of the season for us

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.130 
much at the end of the season for us
because<00:00:46.539> it's<00:00:46.840> been<00:00:47.140> many<00:00:47.469> months<00:00:47.679> and<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:49.870> had

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
because it's been many months and we had

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.410 
because it's been many months and we had
tremendous<00:00:51.629> yield<00:00:52.629> from<00:00:53.230> I<00:00:53.649> think<00:00:53.769> a<00:00:54.070> few

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
tremendous yield from I think a few

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.520 
tremendous yield from I think a few
vines<00:00:55.420> that<00:00:55.870> we<00:00:56.140> grow<00:00:56.379> and<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:58.149> we<00:00:58.809> grew<00:00:59.079> two

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
vines that we grow and and we grew two

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.939 
vines that we grow and and we grew two
varieties<00:00:59.800> we<00:01:00.609> have<00:01:00.640> one<00:01:01.600> that<00:01:01.870> is<00:01:01.899> a<00:01:01.989> Japanese

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
varieties we have one that is a Japanese

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.040 
varieties we have one that is a Japanese
bitter<00:01:03.460> melon<00:01:03.820> variety<00:01:04.300> and<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.720> other<00:01:04.870> one

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
bitter melon variety and the other one

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.510 
bitter melon variety and the other one
is<00:01:05.199> just<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.939> know<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.329> most<00:01:07.479> common<00:01:07.630> one<00:01:08.140> in

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
is just you know the most common one in

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.580 
is just you know the most common one in
Southeast<00:01:09.520> Asia<00:01:10.079> I'm<00:01:11.079> just<00:01:11.290> going<00:01:11.439> to<00:01:11.470> show

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
Southeast Asia I'm just going to show

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.550 
Southeast Asia I'm just going to show
you<00:01:11.680> how<00:01:11.799> to<00:01:11.860> harvest<00:01:12.159> these<00:01:13.020> vegetables<00:01:14.020> so

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
you how to harvest these vegetables so

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.359 
you how to harvest these vegetables so
you<00:01:14.790> would<00:01:15.790> find<00:01:16.090> one<00:01:17.049> that<00:01:17.590> is<00:01:17.740> relatively

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
you would find one that is relatively

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.639 
you would find one that is relatively
big<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:19.210> depending<00:01:19.689> on<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.930> variety<00:01:20.110> if<00:01:20.560> you

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
big and depending on the variety if you

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.920 
big and depending on the variety if you
have<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.890> really<00:01:21.220> long<00:01:21.460> variety<00:01:22.149> then<00:01:22.750> it's

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
have the really long variety then it's

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.980 
have the really long variety then it's
going<00:01:23.140> to<00:01:23.200> grow<00:01:23.670> quite<00:01:24.670> long<00:01:25.210> like<00:01:25.540> around

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
going to grow quite long like around

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.710 
going to grow quite long like around
maybe<00:01:26.740> 40<00:01:27.220> centimeter<00:01:27.640> 30<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.180> 40<00:01:28.479> centimeters

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
maybe 40 centimeter 30 to 40 centimeters

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.590 
maybe 40 centimeter 30 to 40 centimeters
but<00:01:29.560> this<00:01:29.829> particular<00:01:30.220> variety<00:01:30.579> that<00:01:31.090> we<00:01:31.360> have

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
but this particular variety that we have

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.340 
but this particular variety that we have
here<00:01:31.960> is<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.369> smaller<00:01:33.700> one<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:35.140> way

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
here is the the smaller one and the way

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.649 
here is the the smaller one and the way
you<00:01:35.409> can<00:01:35.860> tell<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:36.340> is<00:01:36.460> ready<00:01:37.329> for

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
you can tell that is ready for

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.819 
you can tell that is ready for
harvesting<00:01:38.439> is<00:01:38.799> that<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.310> ridges<00:01:39.729> here

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
harvesting is that the ridges here

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.920 
harvesting is that the ridges here
they're<00:01:41.829> more<00:01:42.280> inflate<00:01:42.729> so<00:01:43.600> they're<00:01:43.780> more

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
they're more inflate so they're more

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.560 
they're more inflate so they're more
spread<00:01:44.259> out<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:44.799> they're<00:01:45.360> generally<00:01:46.360> you

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
spread out and they're generally you

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.569 
spread out and they're generally you
look<00:01:46.750> at<00:01:46.930> it<00:01:47.079> see<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:48.100> difference<00:01:48.490> between

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
look at it see the difference between

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:59.500 
look at it see the difference between
these<00:01:48.939> two<00:01:49.180> I<00:01:49.390> mean<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:49.659> can<00:01:50.409> harvest<00:01:50.860> this<00:01:51.039> too

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.760 

just<00:02:00.510> when<00:02:00.690> you<00:02:00.810> think<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.140> don't<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.500> enough

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
just when you think we don't have enough

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.680 
just when you think we don't have enough
we<00:02:02.730> have<00:02:02.910> some<00:02:03.090> more<00:02:04.520> well<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.880> one<00:02:06.120> is<00:02:06.390> a

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
we have some more well this one is a

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.170 
we have some more well this one is a
different<00:02:07.290> variety<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.490> ones<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.910> we<00:02:09.030> go

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
different variety to the ones that we go

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:16.490 
different variety to the ones that we go
down<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.110> other<00:02:10.229> end<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:14.420> got<00:02:15.420> here<00:02:15.690> oh<00:02:15.990> no

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
down the other end and I got here oh no

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:25.940 
down the other end and I got here oh no
an<00:02:16.950> example<00:02:19.130> of<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.280> ripe<00:02:24.320> bitter<00:02:25.320> melon<00:02:25.710> and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
an example of a ripe bitter melon and

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.670 
an example of a ripe bitter melon and
basically<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:27.030> would<00:02:27.060> leave<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:28.170> get<00:02:28.500> this

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
basically you would leave it to get this

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.160 
basically you would leave it to get this
ripe<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.880> save<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.270> seed<00:02:30.450> for<00:02:30.750> next<00:02:30.780> year

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
ripe and to save the seed for next year

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.340 
ripe and to save the seed for next year
and<00:02:31.550> inside<00:02:32.550> it's<00:02:33.180> like<00:02:33.300> this<00:02:33.540> beautiful<00:02:34.610> red

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
and inside it's like this beautiful red

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.490

it's white but is actually this variety

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.790 
it's white but is actually this variety
has<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.280> white<00:03:05.459> seed<00:03:05.870> other<00:03:06.870> variety<00:03:07.560> when<00:03:07.770> I

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
has the white seed other variety when I

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.610 
has the white seed other variety when I
get<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.280> ripen<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.720> seed<00:03:09.959> is<00:03:10.200> actually<00:03:10.380> a

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
get this ripen the seed is actually a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.540 
get this ripen the seed is actually a
lighter<00:03:11.040> it's<00:03:11.820> like<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.030> lighter<00:03:12.300> brown<00:03:12.630> color

helps to promote the the good lipid and

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.150 
helps to promote the the good lipid and
lowering<00:04:30.699> the<00:04:30.940> fat<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:32.020> bad<00:04:32.229> lipid<00:04:32.740> so<00:04:32.979> your

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
lowering the fat the bad lipid so your

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.409 
lowering the fat the bad lipid so your
HDL<00:04:33.669> dry<00:04:33.970> try<00:04:34.479> with<00:04:34.990> Sarai<00:04:35.260> and<00:04:35.710> LDL<00:04:36.610> so<00:04:37.240> all

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.420 
moist and you leave it in there for
around<00:05:12.700> about<00:05:13.090> 4<00:05:13.389> to<00:05:13.630> 8<00:05:13.840> weeks<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:14.440> that<00:05:15.099> will

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
around about 4 to 8 weeks and that will

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.089 
around about 4 to 8 weeks and that will
be<00:05:15.639> the<00:05:16.240> best<00:05:16.450> way<00:05:16.810> to<00:05:16.840> germinate<00:05:17.470> or<00:05:17.710> the

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
be the best way to germinate or the

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.330 
be the best way to germinate or the
other<00:05:18.250> easiest<00:05:18.820> way<00:05:18.970> is<00:05:19.240> just<00:05:19.750> to<00:05:20.010> throw<00:05:21.010> it<00:05:21.220> in

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
other easiest way is just to throw it in

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.850 
other easiest way is just to throw it in
the<00:05:21.430> ground<00:05:21.610> and<00:05:22.060> cover<00:05:22.360> it<00:05:22.599> up<00:05:22.720> with<00:05:22.780> soil<00:05:23.560> and

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
the ground and cover it up with soil and

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.940 
the ground and cover it up with soil and
you<00:05:24.760> will<00:05:24.940> have<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.389> same<00:05:25.599> result<00:05:26.050> but<00:05:26.320> it's

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
you will have the same result but it's

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.719 
you will have the same result but it's
less<00:05:27.370> it's<00:05:28.300> less<00:05:29.289> predictable<00:05:30.160> if<00:05:30.280> you<00:05:30.430> do<00:05:30.580> it

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
less it's less predictable if you do it

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.010 
less it's less predictable if you do it
that<00:05:30.880> way

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
that way

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.969 
that way
and<00:05:34.560> yeah<00:05:35.560> the<00:05:35.800> best<00:05:35.950> way<00:05:36.160> to<00:05:36.190> do<00:05:36.849> this<00:05:37.060> is

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
and yeah the best way to do this is

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.129 
and yeah the best way to do this is
springtime<00:05:39.090> so<00:05:40.090> so<00:05:40.330> disease<00:05:40.660> in<00:05:40.840> springtime

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
springtime so so disease in springtime

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.730 
springtime so so disease in springtime
and<00:05:41.860> because<00:05:42.130> this<00:05:42.310> is<00:05:42.490> summer<00:05:42.760> crop<00:05:43.380> it<00:05:44.380> makes

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
and because this is summer crop it makes

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.560 
and because this is summer crop it makes
sense<00:05:44.979> don't<00:05:45.400> do<00:05:45.490> it<00:05:45.610> in<00:05:45.700> the<00:05:45.789> winter<00:05:46.060> time<00:05:46.210> I'm

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
sense don't do it in the winter time I'm

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.050 
sense don't do it in the winter time I'm
just<00:05:46.870> doing<00:05:47.139> a<00:05:47.229> demo<00:05:47.440> today<00:05:47.770> so<00:05:48.310> usually<00:05:49.030> I

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
just doing a demo today so usually I

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.230 
just doing a demo today so usually I
wouldn't<00:05:49.510> so<00:05:50.470> pick<00:05:51.250> two<00:05:51.370> melon<00:05:51.639> seed<00:05:51.880> at<00:05:52.090> this

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
wouldn't so pick two melon seed at this

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.129 
wouldn't so pick two melon seed at this
time<00:05:52.510> of<00:05:52.690> the<00:05:52.750> year

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
time of the year

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.230 
time of the year
but<00:05:53.680> you<00:05:53.860> can<00:05:54.010> do<00:05:54.190> that<00:05:54.340> as<00:05:54.490> well<00:05:54.729> if<00:05:54.970> you<00:05:55.060> have

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
but you can do that as well if you have

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.010 
but you can do that as well if you have
a<00:05:55.270> hothouse<00:05:55.889> or<00:05:56.889> greenhouse<00:05:57.250> and<00:05:58.020> that's

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
a hothouse or greenhouse and that's

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.260 
a hothouse or greenhouse and that's
pretty<00:05:59.289> much<00:05:59.560> it<00:05:59.830> once<00:06:00.340> you<00:06:00.639> put<00:06:00.970> them<00:06:01.060> in<00:06:01.180> a

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
pretty much it once you put them in a

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.770 
pretty much it once you put them in a
tray<00:06:01.389> and<00:06:01.810> it's<00:06:02.020> not<00:06:02.169> to<00:06:02.289> grow<00:06:02.699> it's<00:06:03.699> a<00:06:03.849> vine<00:06:04.120> so

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
tray and it's not to grow it's a vine so

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.140 
tray and it's not to grow it's a vine so
therefore<00:06:05.289> it<00:06:05.560> needs<00:06:05.590> at<00:06:06.160> least<00:06:06.430> if<00:06:06.669> you<00:06:07.030> have

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
therefore it needs at least if you have

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.900 
therefore it needs at least if you have
a<00:06:07.180> trellis<00:06:07.690> that<00:06:07.930> will<00:06:08.320> be<00:06:08.440> great<00:06:08.650> if<00:06:08.919> not<00:06:08.979> then

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
a trellis that will be great if not then

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.719 
a trellis that will be great if not then
you<00:06:10.240> can<00:06:10.450> just<00:06:10.659> grow<00:06:10.930> it<00:06:11.080> on<00:06:11.200> the<00:06:11.320> tree<00:06:11.590> if<00:06:12.340> you

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
you can just grow it on the tree if you

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.450 
you can just grow it on the tree if you
have<00:06:12.849> a<00:06:12.880> tree<00:06:13.210> if<00:06:13.780> you<00:06:13.930> don't<00:06:14.110> have<00:06:14.229> a<00:06:14.260> tree

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
have a tree if you don't have a tree

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.510 
have a tree if you don't have a tree
use<00:06:16.120> your<00:06:16.600> fence<00:06:16.900> or<00:06:17.350> you<00:06:17.410> can<00:06:17.830> just<00:06:18.040> grow<00:06:18.340> on

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
use your fence or you can just grow on

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.310 
use your fence or you can just grow on
the<00:06:18.640> ground<00:06:18.910> but<00:06:19.270> it's<00:06:19.510> not<00:06:19.840> that<00:06:20.050> great

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
the ground but it's not that great

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.110 
the ground but it's not that great
growing<00:06:20.920> on<00:06:21.100> the<00:06:21.220> ground<00:06:21.400> because<00:06:21.790> it's

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
growing on the ground because it's

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.460 
growing on the ground because it's
ideally<00:06:22.810> it<00:06:22.960> likes<00:06:23.200> to<00:06:23.350> climb<00:06:24.630> and<00:06:25.630> yeah<00:06:26.020> enjoy

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
ideally it likes to climb and yeah enjoy

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.620 
ideally it likes to climb and yeah enjoy
gardening<00:06:26.890> and<00:06:27.310> I<00:06:27.400> hope<00:06:27.520> to<00:06:27.670> see<00:06:27.850> you<00:06:28.150> grow

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630
