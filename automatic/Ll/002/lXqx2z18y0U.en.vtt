00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.330 

now<00:01:44.200> verse<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:45.220> verse<00:01:45.250> comes<00:01:45.880> in<00:01:47.190> those<00:01:48.190> are

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
now verse the verse comes in those are

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.510 
now verse the verse comes in those are
your<00:01:48.460> four<00:01:48.640> magical<00:01:49.060> notes<00:01:49.270> right<00:01:49.510> there<00:01:50.520> but

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
your four magical notes right there but

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.800 
your four magical notes right there but
it's<00:01:51.640> not<00:01:51.790> over<00:01:52.000> an<00:01:52.060> a-flat<00:01:52.299> like<00:01:52.570> we<00:01:52.690> would

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
it's not over an a-flat like we would

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.080 
it's not over an a-flat like we would
think<00:01:52.990> very<00:01:53.740> sneaky<00:01:54.100> it<00:01:54.460> is<00:01:54.610> over<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.880> G<00:01:55.210> flat

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
think very sneaky it is over a G flat

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.270 
think very sneaky it is over a G flat
okay<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.659> then<00:01:58.900> we<00:01:59.020> have<00:01:59.200> so<00:01:59.470> we<00:01:59.560> have<00:01:59.649> a<00:01:59.920> flat

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
okay and then we have so we have a flat

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.730 
okay and then we have so we have a flat
minor<00:02:01.090> over<00:02:01.810> G<00:02:02.140> flat<00:02:02.470> chord<00:02:03.369> then<00:02:04.119> we<00:02:04.180> go<00:02:04.360> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
minor over G flat chord then we go to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.530 
minor over G flat chord then we go to
the<00:02:05.740> flat<00:02:06.190> over<00:02:06.790> G<00:02:07.890> then<00:02:08.890> we<00:02:08.979> have<00:02:09.450> B<00:02:10.450> flat<00:02:10.680> sus4

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the flat over G then we have B flat sus4

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.110 
the flat over G then we have B flat sus4
there's<00:02:13.540> our<00:02:15.209> Susteren<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.450> flat<00:02:16.810> minor<00:02:18.120> okay

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
there's our Susteren a flat minor okay

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.229 
there's our Susteren a flat minor okay
so<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.420> once<00:02:19.600> again<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:19.930> structure<00:02:20.380> is<00:02:22.230> here

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
so it once again that structure is here

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.100 
so it once again that structure is here
to<00:02:25.239> here<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:27.310> here<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.450> it's<00:02:28.600> how<00:02:28.720> he<00:02:28.780> fills

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
to here to here and it's how he fills

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.509 
to here to here and it's how he fills
out<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.530> stuff<00:02:29.739> in<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.920> middle<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.220> makes

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
out the stuff in the middle that makes

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:37.790 
out the stuff in the middle that makes
it<00:02:30.670> really<00:02:30.790> effective<00:02:32.670> sometimes<00:02:33.670> it's<00:02:33.850> this

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.390 

drill<00:02:38.800> on<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.130> end

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.670 

something<00:02:43.400> simple<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.819> that<00:02:44.000> more

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.630 

okay<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.700> does<00:02:50.849> that<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> few<00:02:51.330> times<00:02:52.640> it's

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
okay so it does that a few times it's

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:07.130 
okay so it does that a few times it's
fun<00:02:56.660> running<00:02:57.660> down<00:02:59.599> and<00:03:00.599> so<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:05.600> do<00:03:06.600> we<00:03:06.810> can

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
fun running down and so on do we can

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:15.230 
fun running down and so on do we can
again<00:03:08.690> okay<00:03:10.610> dog<00:03:11.610> city<00:03:12.360> streets

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.320 

creamy

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
creamy

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.510 
creamy
and<00:03:17.840> now<00:03:18.020> here's<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.410> difference<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:19.340> goes

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
and now here's the difference it goes

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.740 
and now here's the difference it goes
back<00:03:19.790> down<00:03:19.820> so<00:03:20.570> I<00:03:20.750> might<00:03:21.110> take<00:03:21.320> my<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:22.580> G<00:03:23.390> flat

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
back down so I might take my a G flat

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:32.870 
back down so I might take my a G flat
major<00:03:26.860> G<00:03:27.860> major<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.930> Waterloo

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.650 

he<00:03:33.120> flat<00:03:33.480> sus2<00:03:34.140> this<00:03:34.800> time<00:03:35.130> so<00:03:35.700> than<00:03:35.880> F<00:03:36.090> and

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
he flat sus2 this time so than F and

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:47.170 
he flat sus2 this time so than F and
that<00:03:36.690> resolves<00:03:37.170> quickly<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:40.200> we<00:03:40.440> go<00:03:40.590> into

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.179 

so<00:03:47.870> I'll<00:03:47.989> show<00:03:48.170> that<00:03:48.319> whole<00:03:48.470> thing<00:03:48.739> to<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:49.010> so

solo<00:04:15.370> is<00:04:15.760> is<00:04:16.120> very<00:04:16.660> tricky<00:04:17.019> in<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.620> way<00:04:17.829> because

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
solo is is very tricky in a way because

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.129 
solo is is very tricky in a way because
what<00:04:18.669> we<00:04:18.760> try<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:18.970> do<00:04:19.150> is<00:04:19.269> listen<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:19.690> it<00:04:19.959> and

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
what we try to do is listen to it and

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.960 
what we try to do is listen to it and
figure<00:04:20.590> out<00:04:20.739> all<00:04:20.889> of<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.489> parts<00:04:21.760> that<00:04:21.820> are

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
figure out all of the parts that are

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.400 
figure out all of the parts that are
happening<00:04:22.150> that's<00:04:22.510> almost<00:04:22.720> impossible<00:04:23.320> to

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
happening that's almost impossible to

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.340 
happening that's almost impossible to
play<00:04:23.590> those<00:04:23.800> live<00:04:24.070> because<00:04:24.430> it<00:04:24.669> is<00:04:24.790> extremely

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
play those live because it is extremely

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.750 
play those live because it is extremely
overdub<00:04:26.350> there's<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:26.889> don't<00:04:27.400> know<00:04:27.460> three<00:04:27.669> or

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
overdub there's I don't know three or

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.340 
overdub there's I don't know three or
four<00:04:27.820> different<00:04:28.090> synthesizer<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:28.990> keyboard

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
parts going on in any given time so I'll

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.370 
parts going on in any given time so I'll
give<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.520> basic<00:04:33.910> structure<00:04:34.510> of<00:04:34.690> it<00:04:34.840> okay

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
give you the basic structure of it okay

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.580 
give you the basic structure of it okay
we<00:04:35.800> start<00:04:36.010> with<00:04:36.100> an<00:04:36.220> a-flat<00:04:36.580> major<00:04:36.910> chord

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.200 

that's<00:04:41.590> second<00:04:42.070> inversion<00:04:42.340> of<00:04:42.670> Euler<00:04:43.270> County

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
that's second inversion of Euler County

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:54.189 
that's second inversion of Euler County
we've<00:04:46.210> got<00:04:46.360> a<00:04:46.390> b-flat<00:04:46.960> minor

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.730 

unexpectedly

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
unexpectedly

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.700 
unexpectedly
a<00:04:58.160> deep

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
a deep

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:11.120 
a deep
liner<00:05:01.250> set<00:05:01.940> an<00:05:02.449> IRT<00:05:03.320> minor<00:05:03.800> nine

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.830 

the<00:05:11.370> last<00:05:11.610> coat<00:05:11.820> right<00:05:12.000> there<00:05:12.060> that's<00:05:12.450> an<00:05:12.660> F

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
the last coat right there that's an F

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.360 
the last coat right there that's an F
minor<00:05:13.170> so<00:05:13.530> our<00:05:13.650> courts<00:05:13.950> are<00:05:14.040> again<00:05:14.660> minor<00:05:16.370> flat

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
minor so our courts are again minor flat

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.990 
minor so our courts are again minor flat
minor<00:05:17.790> D<00:05:18.860> minor<00:05:20.060> ninth<00:05:21.320> to<00:05:22.320> admire<00:05:23.220> it's<00:05:23.940> a

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
minor D minor ninth to admire it's a

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.230 
minor D minor ninth to admire it's a
really<00:05:24.300> funky<00:05:24.780> set<00:05:25.320> of<00:05:25.440> resolutions<00:05:26.250> I<00:05:26.490> kind

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
really funky set of resolutions I kind

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.340 
really funky set of resolutions I kind
of<00:05:27.270> think<00:05:27.390> it's<00:05:27.540> pretty<00:05:27.750> cool<00:05:27.900> when<00:05:28.110> you<00:05:28.230> go

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
of think it's pretty cool when you go

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:34.100 
of think it's pretty cool when you go
down<00:05:28.560> from<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:28.890> B<00:05:29.010> flat<00:05:29.990> by<00:05:31.730> thirds<00:05:33.110> totally

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
down from the B flat by thirds totally

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.790 
down from the B flat by thirds totally
unrelated<00:05:34.790> very<00:05:35.790> weird<00:05:36.120> stuff<00:05:36.480> okay<00:05:37.050> but<00:05:37.650> hey

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
unrelated very weird stuff okay but hey

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
that's what makes UK awesome they make

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:55.290 
that's what makes UK awesome they make
it<00:05:40.050> work<00:05:40.260> so

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.550 

a<00:05:55.360> little<00:05:55.810> lick<00:05:55.990> right<00:05:56.229> there<00:05:56.440> is<00:05:56.740> just<00:05:57.069> a

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
a little lick right there is just a

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
little slick you hear this all the time

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:22.149 
little slick you hear this all the time
and<00:06:01.690> keyboard<00:06:02.050> players<00:06:02.289> I<00:06:02.500> do

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:22.159 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:26.320 

so<00:06:23.059> on<00:06:24.069> that<00:06:25.069> little<00:06:25.249> synthesizer<00:06:25.849> line<00:06:26.149> that

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
so on that little synthesizer line that

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.679 
so on that little synthesizer line that
comes<00:06:26.539> in<00:06:26.779> which<00:06:26.929> is<00:06:27.050> oh<00:06:27.229> so<00:06:27.259> cool<00:06:28.839> flat<00:06:31.689> seven

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:32.689

comes in which is oh so cool flat seven
Portman<00:06:33.909> 2d<00:06:34.909> flat<00:06:39.879> and<00:06:40.879> then<00:06:40.999> wave<00:06:41.269> them<00:06:41.479> F

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:45.349 
okay and you basically have to just sort

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:46.959 
okay and you basically have to just sort
of<00:06:45.439> pick<00:06:45.679> and<00:06:45.800> choose<00:06:45.889> what<00:06:46.339> exactly<00:06:46.819> you<00:06:46.939> want
