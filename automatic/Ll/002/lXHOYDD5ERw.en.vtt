00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
and I guess it's fixed we're using an

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.680 
and I guess it's fixed we're using an
ebow<00:02:03.610> right<00:02:03.820> now<00:02:03.940> which<00:02:04.180> is<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:04.330> magnetic

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
ebow right now which is a magnetic

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.480 
ebow right now which is a magnetic
effect<00:02:05.170> that<00:02:05.350> puts<00:02:05.619> feedback<00:02:06.070> in<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.280> tune

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
effect that puts feedback in the tune

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.670 
effect that puts feedback in the tune
which<00:02:06.700> sounds<00:02:06.940> pretty<00:02:07.060> sweet<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:11.489> then<00:02:12.489> I

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
which sounds pretty sweet and then I

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.479
