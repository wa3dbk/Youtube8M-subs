00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 and then here we have another class we see 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.230
 that this person has few advantages 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.460
 it has rather accessories for the weapon 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.980
 main in the most secondary one 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.960
 kind of saving a weird aparatejo that 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.519
 it is not what it can be but good and this 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.710
 have used two soldiers of those 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.140
 from below what milk is that and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.670
 we see there two prestigious acquaintances and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.840
 nothing, let's see what the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.670
 trailer 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.500
 Now let's see a sight species 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.940
 it detects very good the truth a measure 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.680
 very good that detects enemies at 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.750
 background that look like kind of 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.059
 red squares around them like 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.260
 if it were a 130 and now a novelty 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.809
 new is that the riot shield is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.730
 can plant on the ground and only to 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.559
 protect us you can not stop through 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.070
 of him but above him but it's a 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.300
 good way to take cover and not 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.470
 well, it will also relieve you of a weight 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.600
 whenever you want, you do not want to use it 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.210
 well that's what happens here a 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.580
 new helicopter that brings the drone of 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.980
 attack is more futuristic a kind 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.930
 of how missiles down the sides looks like 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.180
 quite more comfortable to handle than 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.440
 assault drone I hope the modern 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.270
 warfare 3 is talking 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.830
 I hope it's faster than him and as 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.080
 you can see by one thing that I already 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.660
 He had noticed but I'll comment 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.940
 now several minutes before it is down 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.500
 that we see that the typical 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.330
 when you kill someone, you think it's the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.530
 title and the emblem I think it's going to be 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.850
 exactly as white is one 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.619
 the titles are not going to be able 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.330
 logically customize but the emblem 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.950
 you can do it to your liking bring the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.360
 controversies that bring 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.770
 I think it will be very well that 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.600
 because I really liked the truth what 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.549
 that is to customize that what we have here 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.049
 a very curious class that has six 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.579
 advantages something that I would like to do 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.200
 sure because I think it's the best 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.450
 put yourself in many advantages 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.549
 and less grenades and etcetera the best I 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.470
 for my taste is to get advantages and 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.759
 main and then also the three are 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.770
 lay those from below who will already see what 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.689
 what is this a mystery by the unveiling 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.399
 and I think it's something that reaches 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.869
 so that we are there in intrigue and 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.569
 we started thinking things and we have 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.280
 points of view or theories or hypotheses of 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.659
 what can be no but I think that 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.170
 this is a very curious class that I'm going to 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.520
 know now of how man uses the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.799
 gun that has three bullets left as 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.179
 you can see below to the right and something that 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.709
 it strikes me you see those three 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.060
 little birds that are there 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.280
 that down to the right and the streak is the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.739
 highest streak you see that streak as 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.390
 you will see later at the end of this video there is 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.849
 as a kind of aircraft by air 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.470
 that one crashes against an enemy 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.599
 what I think is that all those planes 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.549
 they are there that are yours not only one but 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.380
 there are several that you do not control 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.299
 but you call it and those planes 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.010
 automatically detect enemies that 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.550
 are outdoors and I think that goes 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.350
 to make it crash in the 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.330
 detect enemies and crash 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.800
 against them I think that is not what 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.450
 more likely if there would not be so many 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.250
 decoration aircraft in the air that's 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.020
 my point of view I hope that the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.700
 comments come yours 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.110
 what do you think of this trailer and also 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.190
 we see the dogs the return of the 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.990
 dogs that's something that I love 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.030
 I hope they are equally strong here 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.560
 as we can see from a couple of bullets it 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.270
 I'm charging this little guy here he was 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.260
 fighting against man maybe he is already 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.480
 wounded of which he was against 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.880
 shooting is not known but now we are going to 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.430
 see how he's going to take our knife 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.340
 friend who equips him that is not 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.740
 r3 knife or the button that is of the 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.200
 this from the xbox but I think it 's 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.780
 equip yourself something that is pretty good 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.310
 depends and well here we see that the 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.410
 tomahawk I hope this time the tomahawk 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.610
 roll and bounce on the floor not as in 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.680
 the modern warfare 3 that stays stuck 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.380
 the red knife did I hope it rolls 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.300
 so that it is easier to make across 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.380
 the maps etcetera and here we have another 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.390
 class we have a class of 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.830
 sniper that has few advantages 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.300
 the truth because I believe that for the 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.490
 sniper two essential advantages 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.930
 are unhocked saves to aim 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.600
 fast and quickly reload the name 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.910
 to put him here I do not care 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.040
 and we see that it has two maybe that green and 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.670
 that yellow are what I'm saying 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.960
 I do not know I do not know but they are two 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.850
 advantages that are paramount that are 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.070
 essential in the sniper follows 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.510
 perhaps rendering and aiming fast or 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.670
 it is important to know about yellow wes or both 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.890
 who knows all this is true 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.530
 will reveal later and now we are going to 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.630
 see something very curious that seems to me mounted 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.120
 a very very disproportionate weapon because 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.010
 because a peephole is a weapon that is 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.050
 as a sniper but with a peephole 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.430
 very short since it is easy to point 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.780
 with that yellow you do not have to do 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.520
 maybe cost with a measure that puts a lot 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.590
 zoom if it's not a yellow that does not point 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.230
 very much the truth and it will be charged to three 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.150
 uncles of a bullet or you are in front of you 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.760
 You do a quiz with a weapon 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.840
 with just a peephole and you load it 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.450
 That may seem like a lot to me 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.270
 provided 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.770
 because they 'll kill you with a bullet if 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.690
 over three crosses you will kill you 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.220
 one fixed bale or yes and the above paste 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.600
 at three to the body although it is likely 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.740
 have a kind of impact or something 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.110
 well the advantages that the 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.540
 noise but it gives me the feeling that 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.870
 is a very disproportionate weapon already 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.670
 will see 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.380
 you will see everything in the trailer good the 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.870
 trailer in the game really the day that 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.280
 come out and nothing now we are going to 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.640
 seeing how a quiz cop does is something that 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.260
 I like the quiz coach that the 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.480
 2005 did not have white whites 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.800
 had and something that those of infinity now 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.150
 have always done so I like that 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.860
 she brought it here also because 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.630
 there are many people fan of the kiosks like 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.870
 me that I love and is possibly 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:00.170
 make a montage the first month first 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.250
 the time or as soon as possible that that 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.140
 day that the target of all also 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.030
 I'll make zombies and so on and here's the 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.770
 weapon that came to look yellow 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.540
 It is that with it you have one in front and 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.610
 it's super easy to aim you hit a shot 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.140
 and you 're going to get it, yes or yes, then 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.180
 although the recoil although I took a little 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.580
 in doing what is jammed the 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.440
 bullet or what is to click click that 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.630
 to stop you from firing another bullet 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.520
 maybe I'll be a little bit if you come two what 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.880
 you have a goal but if you have one in front 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.190
 one 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.450
 It will be very easy if you are fast and 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.050
 good pointing is going to be very easy 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.210
 kill it because that you see it points is 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.980
 easy to point etcetera but good 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.240
 I also set this game apart and 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.500
 changing the subject has very good 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.140
 graphics I think it's from the call of 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.300
 The best duty without doubt that better 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.310
 graphics has at least is what I 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.320
 gives me the respect the feeling that I 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.000
 gives this the multiplayer the trailer 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.129
 here you see three of a bullet makes a 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.919
 anyone and the pig give you 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.749
 this title and all the challenges of those 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.279
 here we see a kind of grenade 

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:56.619
 secondary is not a frog 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:59.149
 secondary but it will be a kind of 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:00.619
 portable radar or something like that kind of 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:02.839
 thing that is put instead of grenades 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:04.219
 blinding etc so you have that as 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:05.449
 you can see below on the left below to 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.979
 the right that has been removed if you do not 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.389
 you see reverse you see that before 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.869
 place it had the drawing and then 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.759
 has been removed 

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:13.489
 this is a shotgun we see another class 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:15.050
 more or less the usual 23 advantages what 

00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:16.189
 that is usually put around the world by 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.099
 everyone us who is in the background 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:20.899
 here we go and three streaks does not appear a 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.279
 rocket me that look like weird things 

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:23.539
 then for what I realize there 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:25.610
 many little pictures down to the left 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.879
 of different equipment so there are 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.769
 quite a variety of other equipment 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:32.330
 thing that I like and now let's see 

00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:33.619
 also how does f 4 have one thing that 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.689
 it attracts a lot of attention and that I like 

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:36.740
 in all cases and here our friend 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:38.389
 a very good run is made with a 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.469
 type shotgun to 12 staff that a little 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.509
 the image quality I do not know what it has 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:42.679
 past and you will see here some planes that I 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:44.899
 I think that is what I have told you before 

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:46.099
 this that detect enemies and explode 

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:47.869
 against them and they give you the low so 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:49.639
 a streak of love I love that streak 

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:51.709
 I think that's going to be almost certainly 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.499
 but almost certainly we will see also now 

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:55.460
 one thing that very good very cool 

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:57.889
 let's hope it goes well 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.300
 there are three teams one team against others 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:01.069
 two that is the three teams face 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.449
 among them an authentic past and I 

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:04.039
 I would like to finish saying it's like me 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:06.229
 I think it will be the best class 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:08.000
 best class creation for me all 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:09.919
 advantages to put the six advantages and 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.030
 focus only on the first weapon like that 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.800
 nothing, I think that's going to be what 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.810
 better one kids until then 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.190
 remember to give you likes 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.199

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.199
