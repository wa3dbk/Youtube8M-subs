overclocking<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.490> but<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.270> still<00:02:00.479> gonna

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
overclocking it but it's still gonna

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.690 
overclocking it but it's still gonna
make<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> difference<00:02:01.229> for<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> n64<00:02:02.040> but<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
make a difference for the n64 but the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.550 
make a difference for the n64 but the
Super<00:02:03.030> Nintendo<00:02:03.149> works<00:02:03.600> great<00:02:03.930> regular

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
Super Nintendo works great regular

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.580 
Super Nintendo works great regular
nintendo<00:02:04.710> sega<00:02:05.670> games<00:02:06.090> work<00:02:06.329> good<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.930> mean<00:02:07.110> get

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
nintendo sega games work good I mean get

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.339 
nintendo sega games work good I mean get
a<00:02:07.619> lot<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.890> bang<00:02:08.129> for<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.429> buck<00:02:09.140> i'm<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
a lot of bang for the buck i'm going to

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.540 
a lot of bang for the buck i'm going to
show<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.500> guys<00:02:10.679> what<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.009> looks<00:02:11.039> like<00:02:11.310> i'm

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
show you guys what it looks like i'm

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.710 
show you guys what it looks like i'm
going<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.760> plug<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.060> in

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
going to plug it in

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.900 
going to plug it in
so<00:02:13.440> there<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.740> no<00:02:13.920> power<00:02:14.220> button<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.790> this

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
so there is no power button on this

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.250 
so there is no power button on this
system<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.990> once<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.620> plug<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.310> turns<00:02:17.520> out

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
system so once you plug in it turns out

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.310 
system so once you plug in it turns out
only<00:02:19.260> takes<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.740> few<00:02:19.770> minutes<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.280> start<00:02:20.580> up

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
only takes a few minutes to start up

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.930 
only takes a few minutes to start up
that's<00:02:22.320> like<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.710> do<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.010> put<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.280> roms<00:02:23.520> on<00:02:23.790> as

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
that's like to do to put the roms on as

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.000 
that's like to do to put the roms on as
you<00:02:24.120> put<00:02:24.330> them<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.570> USB<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.380> plug<00:02:25.830> into

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
you put them on a USB and you plug into

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.760 
you put them on a USB and you plug into
the<00:02:26.130> retro<00:02:26.550> pie<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.140> they<00:02:28.140> will<00:02:28.260> upload<00:02:28.620> on

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.650 
the retro pie and they will upload on
the<00:02:28.860> system<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.730> emulators<00:02:30.270> will<00:02:30.420> pop<00:02:30.630> up

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
the system and the emulators will pop up

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.880 
the system and the emulators will pop up

so<00:03:34.909> I'm<00:03:35.239> pretty<00:03:35.780> impressed<00:03:36.019> with<00:03:36.469> the

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
so I'm pretty impressed with the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.170 
so I'm pretty impressed with the
raspberry<00:03:37.010> too<00:03:37.249> i<00:03:37.280> would<00:03:37.609> recommend<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.150> to

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
raspberry too i would recommend it to

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.270 
raspberry too i would recommend it to
anyone<00:03:38.480> it's<00:03:39.049> not<00:03:39.290> just<00:03:39.349> for<00:03:39.769> a<00:03:39.829> gaming<00:03:40.099> system

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
anyone it's not just for a gaming system

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.000 
anyone it's not just for a gaming system
obviously<00:03:40.819> i<00:03:41.329> think<00:03:41.780> programmers<00:03:42.560> use<00:03:42.590> it

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
obviously i think programmers use it

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.940 
obviously i think programmers use it
there's<00:03:43.519> many<00:03:43.730> uses<00:03:44.480> for<00:03:44.510> this<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:45.139> i<00:03:45.530> decided

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
there's many uses for this and i decided

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.679 
there's many uses for this and i decided
to<00:03:46.069> use<00:03:46.219> it<00:03:46.400> for<00:03:46.579> a<00:03:46.609> retro<00:03:46.999> gaming<00:03:47.239> system

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:47.689 
to use it for a retro gaming system

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:49.869 
to use it for a retro gaming system
because<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:47.989> was<00:03:48.200> cheap<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.889> i<00:03:49.430> thought<00:03:49.760> it

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
because it was cheap and i thought it

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.390 
because it was cheap and i thought it
would<00:03:49.939> be<00:03:50.090> cool<00:03:50.329> if<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:51.739> download<00:03:52.280> the

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
would be cool if you download the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.339 
would be cool if you download the
Raspberry<00:03:52.849> Pi<00:03:52.909> operating<00:03:53.689> system<00:03:54.079> you<00:03:54.200> can

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
Raspberry Pi operating system you can

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.440 
Raspberry Pi operating system you can
play<00:03:54.530> Minecraft<00:03:55.189> on<00:03:55.370> they<00:03:55.969> actually<00:03:56.269> have<00:03:56.420> a

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
play Minecraft on they actually have a

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.929 
play Minecraft on they actually have a
Raspberry<00:03:56.959> Pi<00:03:57.019> version<00:03:57.829> it's<00:03:58.310> not<00:03:58.489> exactly

00:03:58.929 --> 00:03:58.939 
Raspberry Pi version it's not exactly

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.089 
Raspberry Pi version it's not exactly
the<00:03:59.150> same<00:03:59.359> as<00:03:59.510> a<00:03:59.540> pc<00:04:00.019> version<00:04:00.469> but<00:04:00.620> it's<00:04:00.799> still

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
the same as a pc version but it's still

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.069 
the same as a pc version but it's still
pretty<00:04:01.159> cool<00:04:01.700> it's<00:04:02.180> basically<00:04:02.659> just<00:04:02.780> in

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
pretty cool it's basically just in

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.839 
pretty cool it's basically just in
creative<00:04:03.499> mode<00:04:03.530> there's<00:04:04.010> no<00:04:04.129> survival<00:04:04.669> mode

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
creative mode there's no survival mode

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.759 
creative mode there's no survival mode
I'll<00:04:05.209> actually<00:04:05.389> make<00:04:05.719> a<00:04:05.750> video<00:04:05.989> of<00:04:06.139> it<00:04:06.409> I<00:04:06.560> just

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
I'll actually make a video of it I just

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.199 
I'll actually make a video of it I just
have<00:04:06.859> to<00:04:06.889> download<00:04:07.189> and<00:04:07.459> put<00:04:07.609> on<00:04:07.730> my<00:04:07.879> SD<00:04:08.000> card

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
have to download and put on my SD card

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.089 
have to download and put on my SD card
so<00:04:08.629> i'll<00:04:08.750> show<00:04:08.930> you<00:04:08.989> guys<00:04:09.230> in<00:04:09.530> another<00:04:09.769> video

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
so i'll show you guys in another video

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.099 
so i'll show you guys in another video
