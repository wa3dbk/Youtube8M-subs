stuck it there and I tied it to kick I

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.740 
stuck it there and I tied it to kick I
secured<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.690> onto<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.770> road<00:00:50.129> track<00:00:50.600> piece<00:00:51.600> of

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
secured it onto this road track piece of

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.910 
secured it onto this road track piece of
wood<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.430> like<00:00:53.430> yeah<00:00:53.879> well<00:00:54.780> first<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.739> want

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
wood and like yeah well first you want

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.520 
wood and like yeah well first you want
to<00:00:55.980> know<00:00:56.100> where<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.340> put<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.140> I've<00:00:58.140> been

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
to know where to put it and I've been

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.760 
to know where to put it and I've been
feeding<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.340> pot<00:00:59.730> here<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.989> about<00:01:01.260> three

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
feeding this pot here for about three

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.939 
feeding this pot here for about three
days<00:01:01.949> now<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.840> I<00:01:03.840> thought<00:01:04.290> it'd<00:01:04.439> be<00:01:04.559> smart<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
days now and I thought it'd be smart to

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.460 
days now and I thought it'd be smart to
set<00:01:05.189> one<00:01:05.339> right<00:01:05.489> here

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
set one right here

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.740 
set one right here
well<00:01:09.170> what<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> Hogs<00:01:10.500> supposed<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> do<00:01:11.159> is

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
well what the Hogs supposed to do is

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.450 
well what the Hogs supposed to do is
walk<00:01:12.750> through<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.110> from<00:01:13.290> either<00:01:13.530> side<00:01:13.680> they

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
walk through here from either side they

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.749 
walk through here from either side they
try<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.930> dig<00:01:15.930> up<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.259> corn<00:01:16.619> I'm<00:01:17.549> going<00:01:17.700> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
try to dig up this corn I'm going to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.390 
try to dig up this corn I'm going to
repeat<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.180> later<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:19.009> it's<00:01:20.009> going<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.159> walk

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
repeat it later and it's going to walk

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.660 
repeat it later and it's going to walk
through<00:01:20.640> right<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:22.189> this<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.490> is

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
through right here and this in there is

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.289 
through right here and this in there is
about<00:01:24.229> one<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.380> half<00:01:25.439> feet<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:26.299> diameter

about one and a half feet in diameter

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.410 
about one and a half feet in diameter
and<00:01:28.579> that's<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.909> good<00:01:30.090> enough<00:01:30.299> for

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and that's just good enough for

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.480 
and that's just good enough for
basically<00:01:31.140> any<00:01:31.320> size<00:01:31.590> hog<00:01:31.829> all<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.250> want<00:01:32.400> to

should<00:01:36.380> just<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.680> panic<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.369> maybe

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
should just like panic and maybe

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.940 
should just like panic and maybe
strangle<00:01:40.110> itself<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.530> death<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:42.770> right<00:01:43.770> here

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
strangle itself to death and right here

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.069 
strangle itself to death and right here
you<00:01:44.310> may<00:01:44.460> think<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:44.850> not<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.210> heavy<00:01:45.420> it's

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
you may think it's not that heavy it's

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.499 
you may think it's not that heavy it's
rotten<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.530> everything<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.850> not<00:01:48.149> really

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
rotten in everything but it's not really

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.940 
rotten in everything but it's not really
to<00:01:48.780> hold<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.140> down<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.770> much<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:51.590> just<00:01:52.590> there

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
to hold it down as much it's just there

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.310 
to hold it down as much it's just there
for<00:01:53.610> support<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.390> keep<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.750> snare<00:01:55.079> off<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
for support to keep the snare off the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.219 
for support to keep the snare off the
truck<00:01:55.560> because<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.030> tell<00:01:57.240> I'm<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.110> a

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
truck because as you can tell I'm in a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.779 
truck because as you can tell I'm in a
little<00:01:58.500> open<00:01:58.619> area

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
little open area

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.410 
little open area
I've<00:02:00.270> set<00:02:00.750> snares<00:02:01.280> over<00:02:02.280> there<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.700> where

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
I've set snares over there and where

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.850 
I've set snares over there and where
they<00:02:03.509> come<00:02:03.750> from<00:02:03.780> over<00:02:04.560> there<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:07.710> is

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
they come from over there and that is

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.580 
they come from over there and that is
just<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.190> hold<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:10.050> hog<00:02:10.259> will

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
just to hold it up and the hog will

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.770 
just to hold it up and the hog will
probably<00:02:11.009> be<00:02:11.099> able<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.340> drag<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.120> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
probably be able to drag this but it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.180 
probably be able to drag this but it
won't<00:02:12.989> get<00:02:13.110> too<00:02:13.319> far<00:02:13.590> because<00:02:13.830> I'll<00:02:14.040> be<00:02:14.129> able

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
won't get too far because I'll be able

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.890 
won't get too far because I'll be able
to<00:02:14.340> see<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.550> slide<00:02:14.790> marks<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.390> it's<00:02:15.690> not

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
to see the slide marks and it's not

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.860 
to see the slide marks and it's not
going<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.110> get<00:02:16.200> anywhere<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.220> brush<00:02:17.870> so

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870
