scratch<00:01:38.430> once<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.909> week<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.020> would<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.350> be

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
scratch once a week but it would all be

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.480 
scratch once a week but it would all be
predominantly<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:42.439> combat<00:01:43.439> base<00:01:43.680> layer<00:01:44.189> based

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
predominantly a combat base layer based

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.429 
predominantly a combat base layer based
and<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.270> would<00:01:45.390> pretty<00:01:45.509> much<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.409> I

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
and that would pretty much be that so I

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.510 
and that would pretty much be that so I
don't<00:01:46.680> feel<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.009> that'd<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> most

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
don't feel like that'd be the most

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.289

enjoyable<00:01:47.880> thing<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.270> watch<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:49.229> anyway

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299
