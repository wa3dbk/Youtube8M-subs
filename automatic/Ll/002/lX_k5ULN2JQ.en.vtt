00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
distributors for high-performance

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.000 
distributors for high-performance
vehicles<00:00:29.960> because<00:00:30.960> they<00:00:31.289> will<00:00:31.800> break<00:00:33.860> just<00:00:34.860> to

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
vehicles because they will break just to

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.830 
vehicles because they will break just to
show<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.280> something<00:00:35.820> real<00:00:36.690> quick<00:00:37.309> see<00:00:38.309> this

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.710 

that's<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:43.050> good

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.360 

totally<00:00:46.500> broken<00:00:48.920> just<00:00:49.920> flopping<00:00:50.190> around

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.750 

I<00:00:53.400> guess<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.330> bushings<00:00:54.720> went<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.290> I

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
I guess the bushings went out on it I

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.070 
I guess the bushings went out on it I
did<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.790> lot<00:00:56.970> of<00:00:57.000> research<00:00:57.240> these<00:00:57.690> things<00:00:57.900> are

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
did a lot of research these things are

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.260 
did a lot of research these things are
very<00:00:58.700> well<00:00:59.700> a<00:00:59.910> lot<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.420> bad<00:01:00.600> reviews<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:01.260> them

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
very well a lot of bad reviews on them

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.230 
very well a lot of bad reviews on them
unless<00:01:03.270> you're<00:01:03.570> running<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.670> stock<00:01:05.670> motor

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
unless you're running like a stock motor

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.950 
unless you're running like a stock motor
I<00:01:06.440> wouldn't<00:01:07.440> recommend<00:01:07.530> them<00:01:07.950> at<00:01:08.040> all<00:01:08.960> but

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
I wouldn't recommend them at all but

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.950 
I wouldn't recommend them at all but
that's<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.440> MSD<00:01:11.369> Street<00:01:11.729> fire<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.270> don't<00:01:12.690> know

the<00:01:13.140> exact<00:01:13.470> part<00:01:13.740> number<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:15.200> they<00:01:16.200> cost

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
the exact part number but they cost

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.510 
the exact part number but they cost
about<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.890> 1<00:01:17.390> 130<00:01:18.390> bucks<00:01:18.660> they're<00:01:19.260> junk

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.749 

there's<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.640> lot<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.910> play<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:25.160> it<00:01:26.160> just<00:01:26.460> it

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
just blew up basically I thought it was

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
going to be the coil but it wasn't the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.810 
going to be the coil but it wasn't the
coil<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.509> tested<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.100> tested<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.190> pickup<00:01:32.550> coil

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
