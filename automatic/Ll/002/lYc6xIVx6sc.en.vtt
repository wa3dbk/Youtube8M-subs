00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.700 
have got the gray Nick's branding which
is<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> little<00:01:45.210> bit<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.479> criticism<00:01:45.990> which<00:01:46.590> is

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
is a little bit of a criticism which is

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.440 
is a little bit of a criticism which is
probably<00:01:47.100> wise<00:01:47.310> isn't<00:01:47.670> quite<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.149> same<00:01:48.180> as

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
probably wise isn't quite the same as

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.660 
probably wise isn't quite the same as
the<00:01:48.840> Amiga<00:01:49.140> XRD<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.040> quite<00:01:50.220> bizarre<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.579> got

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the Amiga XRD it's quite bizarre you got

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.270 
the Amiga XRD it's quite bizarre you got
some<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.000> them<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.710> some<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.799> them<00:01:52.920> haven't

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
some of them have some of them haven't

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.830 
some of them have some of them haven't
which<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> little<00:01:53.909> bit<00:01:54.030> sort<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.420> weird<00:01:54.659> if

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
which is a little bit sort of weird if

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.649 
which is a little bit sort of weird if
you<00:01:54.869> ask<00:01:55.110> me<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> massive<00:01:56.610> fan<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.820> but

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
you ask me not a massive fan of but

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.310 
you ask me not a massive fan of but
again<00:01:58.070> turn<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.189> round<00:01:59.340> only<00:02:00.240> two<00:02:00.719> wheels<00:02:01.049> on

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
again turn it round only two wheels on

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.810 
again turn it round only two wheels on
this<00:02:01.439> one<00:02:01.619> again<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.979> slight<00:02:02.280> difference<00:02:02.700> to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
this one again a slight difference to

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.730 
this one again a slight difference to
the<00:02:02.909> Amiga<00:02:03.210> clearly<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.380> sort<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.649> a

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
the Amiga clearly this is sort of a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.980 
the Amiga clearly this is sort of a
mid-range<00:02:05.310> wheelie<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:05.969> terms<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.360> price<00:02:06.630> a

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
mid-range wheelie in terms of price a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.169 
mid-range wheelie in terms of price a
largely<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.039> terms<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.399> site<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.789> these<00:02:08.970> are

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
largely in terms of site so these are

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.910 
largely in terms of site so these are
the<00:02:09.239> little<00:02:09.390> differences<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.140> Amiga<00:02:10.619> only

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the little differences to the Amiga only

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.110 
the little differences to the Amiga only
to

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
to

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.210 
to
you<00:02:11.180> wheels<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.599> obviously<00:02:11.989> they're<00:02:12.349> sort<00:02:13.159> of

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
you wheels and obviously they're sort of

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.530 
you wheels and obviously they're sort of
rod<00:02:13.670> at<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:13.879> middle

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
rod at the middle

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.559 
rod at the middle
flicking<00:02:15.080> I've<00:02:15.170> got<00:02:15.409> the<00:02:15.470> same<00:02:15.650> handle<00:02:16.150> as<00:02:17.150> the

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
flicking I've got the same handle as the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.820 
flicking I've got the same handle as the
Amiga<00:02:17.810> which<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.049> might<00:02:18.230> not<00:02:18.379> think<00:02:18.409> would<00:02:18.680> be

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
Amiga which you might not think would be

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.860 
Amiga which you might not think would be
good<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:19.280> obviously<00:02:19.580> pull<00:02:19.849> your<00:02:20.330> big<00:02:20.510> fan<00:02:20.720> of

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
good but obviously pull your big fan of

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.780 
good but obviously pull your big fan of
this<00:02:20.930> hand<00:02:21.140> lots<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.409> same<00:02:21.620> one<00:02:21.860> good<00:02:22.250> nice

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
this hand lots the same one good nice

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.430 
this hand lots the same one good nice
and<00:02:22.819> steady<00:02:23.269> obviously<00:02:23.720> it's<00:02:23.840> not<00:02:23.989> quite<00:02:24.290> as

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
and steady obviously it's not quite as

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.619 
and steady obviously it's not quite as
good<00:02:24.470> as<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.709> suitcase<00:02:25.190> but<00:02:25.790> for<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.090> bag<00:02:26.299> of<00:02:26.510> this

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
good as a suitcase but for a bag of this

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.690 
good as a suitcase but for a bag of this
sort<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:27.140> price<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.860> this<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.129> very<00:02:28.459> good

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
sort of a price and this is a very good

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.520 
sort of a price and this is a very good
handle<00:02:29.000> now<00:02:29.930> what<00:02:30.110> we'll<00:02:30.200> do<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.319> we'll<00:02:30.409> go

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
handle now what we'll do is we'll go

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.050 
handle now what we'll do is we'll go
into<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:30.769> gray<00:02:31.040> Enix<00:02:31.250> branded<00:02:31.790> front

into this gray Enix branded front
section<00:02:32.510> it's<00:02:32.780> different<00:02:33.140> from<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.769> Amiga

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
section it's different from the Amiga

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.289 
section it's different from the Amiga
because<00:02:34.250> it's<00:02:34.400> not<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:34.760> organized<00:02:35.150> it's

mainly just one big central section to
be<00:02:37.069> honest<00:02:37.310> with<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.459> few<00:02:37.700> little<00:02:37.909> extras<00:02:38.299> so

tunneling and I think it's a really good
idea<00:02:56.870> just<00:02:57.260> makes<00:02:57.409> a<00:02:57.500> bag<00:02:57.680> very<00:02:57.950> versatile
