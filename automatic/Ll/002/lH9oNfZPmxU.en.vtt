00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
hundred thousand how much revenue will

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.520 
hundred thousand how much revenue will
you<00:02:03.299> drive<00:02:03.540> from<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.930> type<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> investment

so how many units what type of revenue

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.839 
so how many units what type of revenue
numbers<00:02:06.630> um<00:02:06.960> well<00:02:07.409> we<00:02:07.560> expect<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.280> based<00:02:08.640> on

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
numbers um well we expect that based on

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.720 
numbers um well we expect that based on
an<00:02:09.479> $800,000<00:02:10.259> number<00:02:10.619> for<00:02:10.950> marketing<00:02:11.489> and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
an $800,000 number for marketing and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.290 
an $800,000 number for marketing and
average

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
average

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.410 
average
and<00:02:12.950> factoring<00:02:13.950> combined<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.910> think<00:02:15.210> that<00:02:15.330> we

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and factoring combined we think that we

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.880 
and factoring combined we think that we
could<00:02:15.570> bring<00:02:15.750> back<00:02:15.900> about<00:02:16.200> 3.6<00:02:16.650> million

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
could bring back about 3.6 million

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.130 
could bring back about 3.6 million
dollars<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.430> two<00:02:17.550> year<00:02:17.580> period<00:02:17.700> okay<00:02:18.660> let's

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
dollars in a two year period okay let's

potential<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.460> think<00:02:30.090> if<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.300> could<00:02:30.420> get<00:02:30.600> a

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
potential I think if you could get a

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.350 
potential I think if you could get a
good<00:02:31.170> spokesperson<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:32.700> stand<00:02:32.970> behind<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
good spokesperson to stand behind the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.540 
good spokesperson to stand behind the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
product to differentiate it I think that

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.520 
product to differentiate it I think that
would<00:02:35.670> be<00:02:35.730> great<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.270> how<00:02:36.960> can<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.200> say<00:02:37.350> no<00:02:37.500> to
