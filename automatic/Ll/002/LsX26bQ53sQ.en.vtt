okay<00:00:04.680> what<00:00:04.920> we're<00:00:05.069> going<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.250> do<00:00:05.370> here<00:00:05.580> is

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
okay what we're going to do here is

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.920 
okay what we're going to do here is
we're<00:00:05.819> going<00:00:05.939> to<00:00:06.000> use<00:00:06.180> this<00:00:06.390> tool<00:00:06.660> here<00:00:06.689> called

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
we're going to use this tool here called

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.140 
we're going to use this tool here called
a<00:00:07.290> cookie<00:00:07.589> cutter<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:08.040> do<00:00:08.190> a<00:00:08.219> patch<00:00:08.490> can<00:00:09.000> see

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
a cookie cutter to do a patch can see

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.950 
a cookie cutter to do a patch can see
the<00:00:09.299> patch<00:00:09.510> place<00:00:10.170> an<00:00:10.350> easy<00:00:10.650> pass<00:00:10.889> right<00:00:11.190> there

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
the patch place an easy pass right there

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:25.659 
the patch place an easy pass right there
so<00:00:23.060> cut<00:00:24.060> out<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.360> old<00:00:24.390> piece<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.779> carpet

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:25.669 
so cut out the old piece of carpet

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.530 
so cut out the old piece of carpet
hopefully<00:00:26.669> without<00:00:26.970> cutting<00:00:27.210> all<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.509> way

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
hopefully without cutting all the way

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.650 
hopefully without cutting all the way
through<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.020> carpet<00:00:28.349> underneath<00:00:28.649> it

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
through to the carpet underneath it

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:46.610 
through to the carpet underneath it
actually<00:00:44.720> I'm<00:00:45.720> going<00:00:45.900> to<00:00:45.990> move<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.290> much<00:00:46.470> of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
actually I'm going to move it much of

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.620 
actually I'm going to move it much of
the<00:00:46.710> NAP<00:00:46.950> out<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.430> ways<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.730> possibly<00:00:48.270> can

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
the NAP out of the ways I possibly can

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.569 
the NAP out of the ways I possibly can
so<00:00:49.220> that<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:50.579> cut<00:00:50.880> the<00:00:51.210> cutter<00:00:51.620> does<00:00:52.620> not<00:00:52.920> cut

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
so that the cut the cutter does not cut

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.380 
so that the cut the cutter does not cut
the<00:00:53.790> NAP<00:00:54.770> then<00:00:55.770> an<00:00:56.010> unavoidable<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.970> cut<00:00:57.150> some

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the NAP then an unavoidable to cut some

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:28.510 
the NAP then an unavoidable to cut some
nap<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:58.410> we<00:00:58.530> try<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> avoid<00:00:59.070> it

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:44.130 

right<00:01:29.120> here<00:01:42.130> Logan<00:01:43.130> don't<00:01:43.430> know<00:01:43.640> what's<00:01:43.820> ready

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
right here Logan don't know what's ready

00:01:44.140 --> 00:02:21.350 
right here Logan don't know what's ready
no<00:01:46.150> one

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.170 

then<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.450> take<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.870> seam<00:02:23.170> tape<00:02:24.150> put<00:02:25.150> it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
then I take the seam tape put it

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.100 
then I take the seam tape put it
underneath<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:27.129> one<00:02:27.879> piece<00:02:28.209> we'll<00:02:28.450> fix<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.989> up

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
underneath and one piece we'll fix it up

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.759 
underneath and one piece we'll fix it up
just<00:02:29.319> right<00:02:33.510> then<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.599> determine<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.230> friction

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
just right then I determine the friction

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:45.150 
just right then I determine the friction
that<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:36.280> carpet<00:02:36.819> is<00:02:36.940> running<00:02:43.830> seems<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:45.040> me

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
that the carpet is running seems to me

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.940 
that the carpet is running seems to me
that<00:02:45.190> it's<00:02:45.610> just<00:02:46.140> rough<00:02:47.140> going<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.739> way<00:02:47.920> and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
that it's just rough going that way and

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.100 
that it's just rough going that way and
flatus<00:02:48.640> can<00:02:48.819> be<00:02:48.940> going<00:02:49.150> down<00:02:49.390> like<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.810> and

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
flatus can be going down like that and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.020 
flatus can be going down like that and
it's<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.739> little<00:02:50.980> bit<00:02:51.099> flat<00:02:51.370> going<00:02:51.670> that<00:02:51.849> way

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
it's a little bit flat going that way

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:06.330 
it's a little bit flat going that way
too<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.230> goes<00:02:59.410> up<00:02:59.440> just<00:02:59.680> like<00:03:00.190> this

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:15.700 

okay

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.870 

now<00:03:16.710> you're<00:03:16.920> going<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.100> be<00:03:17.220> able<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.490> see<00:03:17.730> this

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
now you're going to be able to see this

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.880 
now you're going to be able to see this
patch<00:03:18.150> because<00:03:18.450> this<00:03:18.870> carpet<00:03:19.290> here<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.590> worn

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
patch because this carpet here is worn

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.170 
patch because this carpet here is worn
it's<00:03:20.520> half<00:03:20.730> half<00:03:21.270> slave<00:03:21.600> worn<00:03:22.020> up<00:03:22.970> where<00:03:23.970> we're

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
it's half half slave worn up where we're

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.570 
it's half half slave worn up where we're
using<00:03:24.210> a<00:03:24.600> brand<00:03:24.930> new<00:03:25.230> piece<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.680> carpet<00:03:26.100> for

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
using a brand new piece of carpet for

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:34.070 
using a brand new piece of carpet for
the<00:03:26.670> patch<00:03:32.330> but<00:03:33.330> it's<00:03:33.480> going<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.690> look<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.930> heck

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
the patch but it's going to look a heck

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:50.260 
the patch but it's going to look a heck
of<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.320> lot<00:03:34.410> better<00:03:34.680> than<00:03:34.770> it<00:03:35.010> did

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.240 

this<00:03:51.270> tool<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.660> tractor<00:03:52.170> use<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.980> tractor

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
this tool is a tractor use the tractor

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.370 
this tool is a tractor use the tractor
to<00:03:53.580> push<00:03:54.210> the<00:03:54.420> glue<00:03:54.630> into<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.960> back<00:03:55.110> end<00:03:55.350> of

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
to push the glue into the back end of

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
to push the glue into the back end of
the<00:03:55.500> carpet

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:50.410 

let<00:04:02.090> that<00:04:02.330> cool<00:04:02.930> down<00:04:03.230> for<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.590> moment

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.400 

that's<00:04:51.420> how<00:04:51.630> we<00:04:51.750> do<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:51.930> cookie-cutter<00:04:52.320> patch

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
that's how we do a cookie-cutter patch

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:06.890 
that's how we do a cookie-cutter patch
just<00:04:55.410> like<00:04:55.590> that

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.960
