00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
right here so I've got then lifted up I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.300 
right here so I've got then lifted up I
put<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.939> front<00:01:39.210> grille<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:40.560> chest<00:01:41.070> plate

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
put up the front grille the chest plate

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.710 
put up the front grille the chest plate
and<00:01:41.579> these<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:43.020> put<00:01:43.500> up<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.700> put<00:01:45.090> these<00:01:45.390> up

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
and these I put up and I put these up

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.420 
and these I put up and I put these up
with<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> doors<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.710> windows<00:01:47.070> out<00:01:47.220> so

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
with the doors with the windows out so

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.120 
with the doors with the windows out so
don't<00:01:47.549> close<00:01:47.850> probably<00:01:48.119> because<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.540> mesh

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
don't close probably because of the mesh

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.910 
don't close probably because of the mesh
so<00:01:50.130> now<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.490> more<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.820> an<00:01:50.939> X<00:01:51.180> shape<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:52.799> i

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
so now it's more like an X shape so i

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.660 
so now it's more like an X shape so i
guess<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.310> good<00:01:53.490> makes<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.659> look<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:55.250> dane<00:01:56.250> or

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
guess it good makes it look a dane or

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.080 
guess it good makes it look a dane or
like<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> dangerous<00:01:57.210> chevrolet<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.820> they<00:01:59.939> make

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
like a dangerous chevrolet so they make

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.910 
like a dangerous chevrolet so they make
you<00:02:00.180> look<00:02:00.210> good<00:02:00.450> i<00:02:00.719> like<00:02:01.320> with<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.590> chest<00:02:01.740> i

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
you look good i like with the chest i

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.440 
you look good i like with the chest i
can<00:02:02.100> make<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.310> look<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.579> battering<00:02:02.969> ram<00:02:03.000> that

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
can make you look a battering ram that

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.910 
can make you look a battering ram that
bumper<00:02:04.290> bumper<00:02:04.740> car<00:02:04.950> sort<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.310> thing<00:02:07.069> okay

elbows<00:02:40.090> automatically<00:02:41.080> shift<00:02:41.700> into<00:02:42.700> the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
elbows automatically shift into the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.729 
elbows automatically shift into the
middle<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.569> gives<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.590> that

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739

and<00:04:38.889> you've<00:04:39.889> got<00:04:39.979> the<00:04:40.039> turret<00:04:40.690> to<00:04:41.690> rapid<00:04:42.080> fire

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
and you've got the turret to rapid fire

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.210 
and you've got the turret to rapid fire
gun<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:43.759> I've<00:04:44.090> turned<00:04:44.560> these<00:04:45.560> forward

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
gun and I've turned these forward

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.360 
gun and I've turned these forward
instead<00:04:46.550> of<00:04:46.669> like<00:04:46.849> that<00:04:47.090> so<00:04:47.509> a<00:04:48.250> lot<00:04:49.250> more

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
instead of like that so a lot more

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.330 
instead of like that so a lot more
forward<00:04:49.930> takes<00:04:50.930> less<00:04:51.169> time<00:04:51.199> to<00:04:51.530> hit<00:04:52.099> the<00:04:52.220> enemy

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
forward takes less time to hit the enemy

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.210 
forward takes less time to hit the enemy
and<00:04:53.150> I<00:04:53.599> put<00:04:54.080> these<00:04:54.169> back<00:04:54.470> so<00:04:54.710> it<00:04:54.770> only<00:04:54.860> shows

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
and I put these back so it only shows

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.330 
and I put these back so it only shows
the<00:04:55.400> front<00:04:55.610> tires<00:04:55.789> and<00:04:56.680> put<00:04:57.680> these<00:04:57.830> up<00:04:58.070> like

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
the front tires and put these up like

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.580 
the front tires and put these up like
that<00:04:58.490> there's<00:04:58.789> much<00:04:58.970> of<00:04:59.000> a<00:04:59.150> v-shape<00:04:59.630> which

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
that there's much of a v-shape which

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.649 
that there's much of a v-shape which
makes<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:00.979> look<00:05:01.159> pretty<00:05:01.400> cool<00:05:01.580> and<00:05:01.820> also

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659 
makes it look pretty cool and also

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.770 
makes it look pretty cool and also
because<00:05:02.810> this<00:05:03.409> one<00:05:03.620> arm<00:05:03.919> joint<00:05:04.789> this<00:05:05.510> could

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
because this one arm joint this could

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.899 
because this one arm joint this could
move<00:05:06.050> out<00:05:06.289> like<00:05:06.620> that<00:05:06.800> so<00:05:07.490> when<00:05:07.699> you're<00:05:07.820> on<00:05:07.880> the

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
move out like that so when you're on the

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:13.360 
move out like that so when you're on the
minigun<00:05:08.500> like<00:05:09.500> that<00:05:10.120> it<00:05:11.120> can<00:05:11.449> like<00:05:12.199> go<00:05:13.190> out

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
minigun like that it can like go out

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.120 
minigun like that it can like go out
there's<00:05:13.669> someone<00:05:14.060> at<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.270> side<00:05:15.130> straight

Starscream I'm a it more like the game
with<00:05:29.419> the<00:05:29.900> front<00:05:30.229> coming<00:05:30.560> down<00:05:30.680> like<00:05:31.130> that<00:05:31.310> and

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
with the front coming down like that and

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.960 
with the front coming down like that and
i<00:05:32.060> took<00:05:32.479> this<00:05:32.780> panel<00:05:33.169> up<00:05:33.380> and<00:05:33.770> shift<00:05:34.729> get<00:05:34.880> the
