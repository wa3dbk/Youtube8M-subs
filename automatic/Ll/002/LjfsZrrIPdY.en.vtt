00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.540
 created by expert ugarte in 1981 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.989
 It is the first videogame with difficulty selection 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.910
 this series video game have some very revolutionary graphics palay little 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.660
 some say that the beta version of this video game to which it produces attacks 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.710
 epileptic was the famous politician video game 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.190
 the goal of the videogame to be able to advance as much as you can 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.700
 here we will drive a claw-shaped ship 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.700
 that does not stop turning around the edges of a little 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.550
 these wells front of assistants geometric shapes 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.550
 we have to trust the spacecraft to shoot everything that is going up 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.580
 summers we want the clippers 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.990
 a select red that does not stop going up to finish us when they arrive 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.640
 up will start to chase the player 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.880
 also the fmi press mena look like inside balls 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.760
 then we have the Spaniards 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.470
 this is what they do is raise and lower the wells 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.030
 When they reach the bottom, they become the balls of the clippers. 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.190
 beware 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.070
 since if we kill ourselves half the way 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.670
 they usually leave a green hairline 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.250
 when we have to put them in the well 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.549
 we have chemistry that green hairline photo ap is first this ship 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.500
 then we have the conservatives 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.780
 These enemies are quite strong and can also detect your position 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.770
 this video game was the first one that allowed you to continue where you had 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.869
 left and so I do not have to start from scratch 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.159
 p the video game came to have two children's schools version 2000 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.819
 created for the fee act sega saturn the former treasurer and former senator 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.089
 pirates bight 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.089
 to comfort him 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.439
 talking about politicians 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.739
 apart from the graphics set in this official propaganda 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.969
 I have a theory of epileptic calculations that were victims by 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.069
 this entity is 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.999
 the flakes especially towards those visions of Puerto Rican nightmares 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:42.909
 and all those bullshit 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.019
 possibly 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.919
 atari changes the name of the final version 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.939
 and also you have to keep in mind that I expected work had forces 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.549
 American armed 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.939
 all this due to the success of the paper video game are 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:56.829
 but who knows
