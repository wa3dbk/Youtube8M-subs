00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.360
[typing]

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.120
Well, it's once again time
to cover some random game

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.420
'cause I ran out of time and didn't
feel like doing anything more involved.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.740
Today it's "BC's Quest for Tires,"

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.660
developed by Charles Benton

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.140
and published by Sierra Online in 1983.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.780
This is the version for the Commodore 64,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.660
although it first saw a release on the Atari 8-bit,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.880
followed by the Apple II, IBM PC, MSX,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.240
Sinclair Spectrum and ColecoVision.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.140
This particular port was done by Sydney Development,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.980
but the original was created by Chuck Benton,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.240
which is a familiar name if
you're a fan of early Sierra stuff.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.060
He's the guy that was behind "Softporn Adventure,"

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.260
which later became "Leisure Suit Larry,"

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.440
which later became utter sadness.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.920
Despite the pervy association,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.620
you won't be getting laid in this game,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.820
at least not explicitly.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.000
After all, it's based on the "B.C."
comic strip by the late Johnny Hart.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.760
It's a delightfully original game
that you'll want to play for hours,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.240
which must be true,
since it's on the back of the box.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.200
Inside, you get a tidy little plastic tray

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200
designed to hold media of several shapes and sizes,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.920
in this case, a C64 ROM cart.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.660
You also get this sumptuous
Sierra registration card,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.740
which entitles you to a replacement
floppy disk in case yours dies.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.540
And I suppose cartridge users just get shafted.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.340
So that's nice.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.900
And then there's this little fold-out instruction booklet,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.460
complete with some artwork by Mr. Hart,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.340
as well as WAY more information
than the game itself will give you,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.520
so you may as well read it front to back

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.700
to get your money's worth,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.700
since there's practically no text in the game.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.480
"BC's Quest for Stone Age 
Ring-Shaped Vehicle Components"

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.700
begins with a colorful title screen,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.940
followed by a menu with some credits

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.880
and excess yellowness.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.160
Press a joystick button to commence your tire quest,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.460
Aaaaaaand...

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.440
it's "Moon Patrol."

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.380
[chuckles]

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.260
So much for being delightfully original.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.260
But instead of a lunar rover,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.220
here you play as Thor,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.840
with the goal of rescuing your love interest Cute Chick

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.200
from the clutches of a hungry dinosaur.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.380
In true "B.C." form,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.440
you're riding your trusty impossible-wheeled unicycle

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.660
and you have the ability to both
jump and duck while riding it.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.000
You can also speed up or slow down by holding
down the joystick button and pushing left or right.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.320
But there's really no reason to do
so for the most part, so who cares?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.460
What you do need to worry about are the
various obstacles above and below you,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.580
and thankfully the controls are rather forgiving.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.780
When you jump, you have a bit of
time to move left and right in mid-air,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.560
which also speeds you up momentarily,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.040
so there's a bit of leeway in maneuverability.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.800
And after you're done hopping
rocks and dodging tree branches,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.340
you'll stop moving and have to cross a small waterway

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.120
populated by turtles.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.460
The character Fat Broad is on
the opposite side taunting you,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.180
but she's nothing but hot air,
so just ignore her and move on.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.640
After this, it's more hopping and
dodging some falling rocks up a hill,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.820
and then you've gotta time a
jump underneath a bird thing

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.180
that will carry your smug mug across a pit of lava.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.000
[synth fanfare]

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.540
Seems physically legit.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.220
And there's some more falling rocks,

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.020
and more water-logged turtles to hop across,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.640
this time with the dinosaur on the other side

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.540
that'll instakill if you touch him.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.180
After that, it's stalactite and stalagmite time,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.720
and, aw, yeah...

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.440
Cute Chick, in all her pixelated sexiness,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.640
is waiting and ready...

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.600
to send you a floating heart graphic.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.760
...Hot.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.200
After that, it just loops around

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.280
again and again,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.100
each time getting a little bit faster...

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.280
and, uh, that's "BC's Quest for Tires."

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.520
It's a twist on Moon Patrol, and

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.900
while it's kind of fun, I can't say
I wanted to play for hours on end.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.360
Freakin' box blurbs overselling
the crap of everything as usual.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.600
But ignoring the overreaching marketing jargon,

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.160
it's a sufficiently competent game from an era
when games could be sufficiently competent

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.240
and still be a retail success.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.240
I certainly don't mind endless runner-type games,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.780
so I'm totally onboard with
the concept of being on rails

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.940
and dodging some chunky
pixels with a prehistoric theme.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.700
And the aesthetic is just awesome

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.280
in the way that it mimics the look of
hand-drawn comics as best as it can

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.400
within the confines of the
hardware's graphical capabilities.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.180
You gotta remember this is from 1983,

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.200
less than a year after the
Commodore 64 was even launched,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.540
and compared to other C64 games
from that year, it looks pretty darn good!

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.740
...And it has that added appeal
if you're a fan of Johnny Hart's work,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.200
even though it doesn't do anything
particularly memorable with it.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.240
The game would do perfectly fine
without any of the licensed property at all,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.100
which is a sign of a solid underlying game,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.280
and also arguably a sign of poor
implementation of the source material.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.320
But whatever! It's one of those earlier
examples of a licensed game,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.160
one of the earlier Commodore 64 games in general,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.500
and an early Sierra game
before their point-and-click days.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.560
So, just for the sake of being all-around early,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.140
I'm compelled to give it a thumbs up.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.480
Don't expect it to go and
make you a pizza or anything,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.660
but do expect bursts of arcade fun

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.980
with an 8-bit comic strip aesthetic.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.880
[synth music]

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.060
And if you enjoyed this video on a game
that I have no idea why I covered,

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.620
then why not check out some of my others

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.560
that I've... also done the same? Heh.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.020
It's Lazy Game Reviews,

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.480
gotta live up to the name sometimes.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.620
So yeah, just click some of those things here,

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.280
or follow me on Twitter and Facebook

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.220
for other updates and such throughout the week,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.660
as well as support the show on Patreon,
