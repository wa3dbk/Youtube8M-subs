00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.340
 from ignorant to knowledgeable one bit from 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.710
 silly to inventor school and 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.400
 Institute from an ordinary child to 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.070
 a scientist is one toy but smart and this is a miracle 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.990
 constructors your child from these 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.780
 designers will collect the most real 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.390
 the robot and these robots will move 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.210
 act execute commands reached 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.970
 progress of labor is not physically disappeared but 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.809
 can be replaced by automated 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.230
 here is robot 1 brush sweeps granite crumbs 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.030
 from the table of science he loves cleanliness and 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.219
 so when we turn it on 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.649
 starts walking around the table and erase 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.249
 for a bullet for this he has two 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.929
 brushes 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:51.870
 Shaya and in my beauty, but the duck is a robot 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:55.280
 lazy they peck pinch the one who his 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.120
 assembled will push on new inventions 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.359
 when we turn it on 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.280
 he begins to call his point to walk around 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.950
 table across the surface on its 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.560
 funny paws usually in the first lessons 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.680
 Physics in school for children shows that 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.250
 such a dynamo we twist it by the handle and 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.140
 it reproduces electricity 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.300
 actually din the car is not waiting 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.580
 school physics your child can 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.020
 collect from the inventor inventor 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.350
 there is a special light bulb here 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.930
 when creating an electrical circuit and when 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.159
 the child will twist his pen but 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.950
 go out to the car the light bulb will glow 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.109
 ideas that these designers give as 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.840
 bank of brilliant data and even 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:42.710
 ordinary aluminum can as 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.789
 valuable contribution 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.060
 you can take your dividends for example from 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.969
 this set of robot beetle real 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:58.130
 mustache wings which will 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.719
 move and strengthen your child his 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.880
 friends 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:05.530
 smart designers give the child a lot 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.179
 development first is a scientific interest 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.250
 these constructors call baby 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.910
 curiosity love of science and 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.579
 technology 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.370
 secondly logical thinking and 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:18.980
 creative impulses playing with such 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.870
 constructors the child becomes also 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.720
 very creatively does not develop creative 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.790
 thinking because how to connect all 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.099
 details to make it real 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.940
 mobile robot here need to apply 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.280
 imagination of the imagination and its some 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.260
 creativity and if u have your 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.870
 the child will be several sets at once 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.269
 smart robots he can invent his 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.000
 own creation which will be 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.000
 only his team will perform 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.730
 do what the child himself but to conceive 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.980
 and that 's not all with the help of a robot baby 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.880
 can make a real cartoon 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.480
 home movie studios in this box in front 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.299
 you set 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.169
 cinema which includes parts for 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.940
 making the simplest movie cameras and 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:07.239
 with the help of a child can 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.190
 ordinary pattern gives movement 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.470
 make your own short movie 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.700
 and our movie about home robots 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.310
 coming to the end 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.310
 pleasant discoveries of song and toy
