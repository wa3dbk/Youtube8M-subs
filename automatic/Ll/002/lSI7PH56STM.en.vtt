00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:11.700
 the concert has been born and they have to be 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.860
 good families as we are welcome 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 to the internet channel of the super 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.939
 crafts you've caught me right 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.800
 writing my diary where I put everything 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.710
 what I want in the future I do not know 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.259
 go from the mind to remember everything and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.630
 I do not only have a diary, I also have the 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.979
 box of the future here I keep things 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.859
 which are very large that do not fit in the 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:34.500
 daily for example this doll of 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.179
 japan or for example the postcard of my 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.070
 friends the frogs that all Christmas 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.660
 They send me a super cool postcard all 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.250
 everything is here inside but the most 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.010
 amazing is the cap look what design 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.460
 more handsome with many flowers with a lot 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.499
 color and especially with a design 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.309
 amazing and dragon or jordi this is very 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:56.579
 complicated 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.670
 this is all this is somewhat difficult 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.050
 nothing is not at all difficult because what 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.210
 I made with play mais 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.659
 play mais is made of corn and 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.180
 natural dyes by just wetting the 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.610
 on a cloth moistened with water 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.000
 they stick instantly and to 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.070
 forever 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.560
 with a plastic knife that comes 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.710
 inside the container or scissors can be 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.220
 cut 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.990
 and with his fingers without being a Muslim he 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.479
 can model 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.920
 in light of the end before today I do not stop defining 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.340
 amazing hallucinating then that to me 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.200
 work with the play more I think that 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.720
 amazing mindful look here I have a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.670
 heap to make the lid of the box and 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.170
 decorate it we are going to cut it by the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.360
 half so not to have to cut 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.220
 paste hit 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.590
 first we make the first step that is 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.409
 cut them all until you have a good 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.090
 bunch and that simple we take the first 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:00.770
 and with the knife in half like this 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.409
 this bowl I take another and 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.960
 here directly I was lame a blue and 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.259
 to notice that it is very simple does not 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.810
 lack that appears 'aces' or that you have 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.239
 to make a great effort so 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.610
 remember you have to do many many 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.569
 many many depending on how big the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:24.879
 box so now is the time to 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.879
 cut or rather cut 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:35.200
 and the last one is already I have them all 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.180
 trimmed there is already something less than 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.030
 work now I'm going to withdraw this by 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.580
 here and now what we have to do is 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.370
 take 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.819
 cookie and moisten the nothing that 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.459
 water jet or you do not have them 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.130
 that catch a trickle the wet jce 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.890
 tighten well that all the excess is gone 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.450
 of water is worth and important you have to 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.550
 dry your hands because if you do not go to 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.010
 paste all the feathers in your hand and go to 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.830
 be all a mess so I dry 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.430
 Well, we take the cookie and I'll go 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.709
 to place in a plastic dish and 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.590
 pay attention to what I have here 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.530
 I have started to work the lid 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.600
 making some flowers of many colors and 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.180
 very nice look the center is a 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.890
 color and the exterior is from another and is 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.680
 formed by one two three four five 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.950
 six pieces we are going to do it in a way 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:35.090
 joint remember we take first to see 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:38.000
 this blue we wet it on the damp cloth 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.970
 by magic when placing it in a 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.590
 surface whatever it is already stays 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:49.540
 stuck now I take another one according and what 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.540
 placed here 2 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.260
 this puts here 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.360
 place it like this 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.959
 and look, I'm going to place the one in the center that 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.040
 I'm going to make red, it's worth here 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:08.650
 look very good if you squeeze a little 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.650
 remember that the play 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.980
 they are also modeled when you go and what 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.720
 fun is that you can do the form 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.850
 that you want me for example I'm 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.739
 making flowers but you if you want to make 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.970
 a more abstract design with many 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.830
 colors then do what you want if 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.760
 you want to make the initial of your name 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.889
 also as you see it here is matter 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.330
 to enjoy having fun 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:37.630
 easy simple and quick look I already have 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.880
 this list flower is blue and the 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.760
 inside of red color and now I have to 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.910
 fill all this I have to 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.090
 fill and you too so hands to the 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.090
 work 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.680
 Well, I have all the 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.470
 top of the lid now I have 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.380
 that decorate the edge for that look 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.800
 united different playmates together these 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.240
 all yellow what I do is 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.340
 crush them on top of the damp cloth 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.270
 because that's how I do both at the same time 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:14.610
 crush and moisten and look what I'm going to 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:18.060
 place just because over here it is and I squeeze 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.729
 if it is simple simple simple 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.570
 and fast fast fast result 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:27.510
 fast when you finish you'll have something like 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:32.669
 this here I have already finished you see the 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:35.520
 yellow the orange the edge and I'm going to 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:39.930
 open the box so you can see how it is 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.030
 this amazing cover and inside 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.919
 everything you want to keep and 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:49.139
 then tapas and wait for the future 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.370
 to be opened again by the way I 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.560
 I made flowers but you can do the 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.440
 design that you want for example for 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.340
 this holiday I designed this box 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:03.139
 you've seen with a little boat with the sea with 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.780
 the sky so imagine the infinity 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.639
 of designs that you can go through the 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.740
 head the box the one you want 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.060
 Remember plastic cardboard because 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.530
 Plame there sticks anywhere 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.470
 now we have to go 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:22.530
 that this has been easy simple and fast 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:26.400
 so see you in the next video on 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:29.150
