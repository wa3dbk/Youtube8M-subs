the time we feature composers all the
time

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
time

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.070 
time
overlap<00:02:42.100> of<00:02:42.310> composer<00:02:42.730> conductor<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.960> a

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
overlap of composer conductor is a

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.840 
overlap of composer conductor is a
little<00:02:44.410> bit<00:02:44.500> unusual<00:02:44.650> obviously<00:02:45.340> not<00:02:45.520> every

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
little bit unusual obviously not every

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.580 
little bit unusual obviously not every
composer<00:02:46.240> is<00:02:46.420> going<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.750> conduct<00:02:47.080> their<00:02:47.260> music

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
composer is going to conduct their music

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.900 
composer is going to conduct their music
but<00:02:47.800> how<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.160> how<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:48.460> different<00:02:48.670> than

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
but how so how is that different than

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.670 
but how so how is that different than
working<00:02:49.150> with<00:02:49.390> with<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.750> conductor<00:02:50.290> who's<00:02:50.470> not

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
working with with a conductor who's not

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.130 
working with with a conductor who's not
the<00:02:50.920> composer<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:52.210> higher<00:02:52.420> stakes<00:02:52.840> what

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
the composer is it higher stakes what

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.660 
the composer is it higher stakes what
does<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.290> tell<00:02:53.590> us<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:53.770> think<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.280> stakes<00:02:54.520> are

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
does that tell us I think the stakes are

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.000 
does that tell us I think the stakes are
higher<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.210> I<00:02:55.330> think<00:02:55.630> it's<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.870> more<00:02:56.200> intimate

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
higher and I think it's a more intimate

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.250 
higher and I think it's a more intimate
experience<00:02:57.160> for<00:02:57.790> everybody<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.390> mean<00:02:59.080> more

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
experience for everybody I mean more

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.660 
experience for everybody I mean more
intimate<00:02:59.560> because<00:02:59.770> it's<00:02:59.890> more<00:03:00.010> vulnerable<00:03:00.520> I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
intimate because it's more vulnerable I

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.610 
intimate because it's more vulnerable I
think<00:03:00.850> for<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.240> composer<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.260> for<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
think for the composer and and for the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.240 
think for the composer and and for the
players<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:04.540> lot<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:05.200> conductor<00:03:05.770> composers

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
players and a lot of conductor composers

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.270 
players and a lot of conductor composers
get<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.240> way<00:03:07.360> with<00:03:08.320> Mattias<00:03:08.710> it's<00:03:08.860> like<00:03:08.980> he
