00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
then more duffel bags behind the seats

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.650 
then more duffel bags behind the seats
and<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.129> watch<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.879> I'm<00:00:48.270> just<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.600> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
and if you watch this I'm just going to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.029 
and if you watch this I'm just going to
pause<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> video<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.530> second<00:00:49.800> move<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
pause the video for a second move the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.080 
pause the video for a second move the
seats<00:00:50.250> forward<00:00:52.460> okay<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.520> now<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:53.940> see

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
seats forward okay so now you can see

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.439 
seats forward okay so now you can see
how<00:00:54.210> much<00:00:54.390> room<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.600> actually<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.289> here

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
how much room we actually have in here

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.529 
how much room we actually have in here
so<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.690> look<00:00:57.899> under<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.800> I've<00:00:59.120> got<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
so if you look under here I've got a

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.149 
so if you look under here I've got a
drawer<00:01:01.320> sliding<00:01:01.829> hardware

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.090 

so<00:01:07.759> that'll<00:01:08.030> slide<00:01:08.299> it<00:01:08.420> right<00:01:08.600> there<00:01:09.100> this

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
so that'll slide it right there this

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.080 
so that'll slide it right there this
folds<00:01:10.490> down<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:12.250> then<00:01:13.250> same<00:01:13.549> thing<00:01:13.789> on<00:01:13.969> the

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
folds down and then same thing on the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:22.209 
folds down and then same thing on the
side<00:01:16.600> that<00:01:17.600> slides<00:01:17.990> out<00:01:19.149> this<00:01:20.149> goes<00:01:20.390> down<00:01:21.219> and

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
side that slides out this goes down and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:28.690 
side that slides out this goes down and
now<00:01:23.380> we've<00:01:24.380> got<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:25.039> bed<00:01:26.409> this<00:01:27.409> is<00:01:27.679> over<00:01:28.369> six

buckets go so as we're sleeping we can

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.970 
buckets go so as we're sleeping we can
fold<00:02:17.299> this<00:02:17.480> up<00:02:17.720> get<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.079> whatever<00:02:18.230> we<00:02:18.530> have<00:02:18.709> to
