you pull out the arms from here and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.330 
you pull out the arms from here and
rotate<00:02:08.149> this<00:02:08.300> piece<00:02:08.570> round<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:09.920> should<00:02:10.220> be

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
rotate this piece round it should be

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.270 
rotate this piece round it should be
noted<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:10.700> whilst<00:02:11.570> it<00:02:11.780> looks<00:02:11.990> like<00:02:12.200> crap<00:02:12.980> i

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
noted that whilst it looks like crap i

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.570 
noted that whilst it looks like crap i
have<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.300> added<00:02:14.870> some<00:02:15.080> gold<00:02:15.350> paint<00:02:15.620> there<00:02:15.860> i<00:02:16.130> did

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
have a added some gold paint there i did

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.940 
have a added some gold paint there i did
attempt<00:02:17.210> painting<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:18.230> also<00:02:18.350> got<00:02:18.530> symbol<00:02:18.860> on

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
attempt painting it also got symbol on

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.610 
attempt painting it also got symbol on
this<00:02:19.130> side<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.460> will<00:02:19.610> both<00:02:19.820> blank<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:21.380> which

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
this side that will both blank and which

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.070 
this side that will both blank and which
is<00:02:21.770> kind<00:02:22.070> of<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:22.280> downside<00:02:23.030> but<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:23.660> is<00:02:23.840> since

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
is kind of it downside but this is since

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.650 
is kind of it downside but this is since
rubbed<00:02:24.350> off<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.070> lasted<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:26.240> i'll

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
rubbed off this is lasted so i'll

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
that's trying is a bit hard but that's

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.270

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.270 
hasbro that's so there's his robot knows
a<00:04:35.940> nice<00:04:36.940> robot<00:04:37.360> bird<00:04:37.570> and<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:38.590> didn't<00:04:39.010> initially

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
a nice robot bird and I didn't initially

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.159 
a nice robot bird and I didn't initially
like<00:04:39.700> it<00:04:39.910> when<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.090> saw<00:04:40.240> photos<00:04:40.510> of<00:04:40.840> him<00:04:41.020> online

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
like it when I saw photos of him online

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.920 
like it when I saw photos of him online
I<00:04:41.790> posed<00:04:42.790> ability<00:04:43.240> was<00:04:43.419> his<00:04:44.130> toes<00:04:45.130> move<00:04:45.930> that's

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
I posed ability was his toes move that's

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.260 
I posed ability was his toes move that's
more<00:04:47.169> useful<00:04:47.590> than<00:04:47.620> you<00:04:47.860> think<00:04:48.040> his<00:04:48.669> legs

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
more useful than you think his legs

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.930 
more useful than you think his legs
splayed<00:04:49.600> that<00:04:49.930> way<00:04:50.169> which<00:04:50.710> is<00:04:51.010> more<00:04:51.400> awkward

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
splayed that way which is more awkward

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.340 
splayed that way which is more awkward
because<00:04:52.330> you'll<00:04:52.540> be<00:04:52.570> putting<00:04:52.840> them<00:04:52.960> in<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.110> pose

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
because you'll be putting them in a pose

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.810 
because you'll be putting them in a pose
and<00:04:53.680> he'll<00:04:53.979> just<00:04:54.190> go<00:04:54.370> there<00:04:55.950> legs<00:04:56.950> up<00:04:57.190> here<00:04:57.610> on

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
and he'll just go there legs up here on

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.110 
and he'll just go there legs up here on
ball<00:04:58.090> joints<00:04:58.479> they<00:04:58.600> do<00:04:59.139> swivel<00:04:59.729> and<00:05:00.729> the<00:05:00.940> name
