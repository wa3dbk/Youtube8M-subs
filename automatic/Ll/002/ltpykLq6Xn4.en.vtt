00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:08.830
 Evil Dilin Presents Review 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:13.330
 prepared specifically for online 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.779
 Journal brain and dying light 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.830
 new project by polish studio techland 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:20.499
 dedicated to survival in the city 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.390
 a zombie for the Poles is overwhelmed 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:25.599
 not the first experience of creating a game with live 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.300
 dead people recently released them 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.669
 Well d Thailand in which the walking corpse and 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.680
 captured the whole resort island but in 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.080
 dying light there are some fundamentally 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.510
 new items that seriously affect 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.640
 on the game course fight alive 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.040
 dead in dying light accounted for 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.020
 mostly in melee using clubs 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.540
 pipe scraps and in general all that 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.000
 comes across as in Thailand 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.100
 there is a crafting system with 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.610
 which can be improved and combined 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.190
 weapon 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.710
 for example collect macheto beating enemies 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.480
 current or attach to a circular stick 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.640
 saw in dying light 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.460
 there will often be situations when 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.530
 fighting is best avoided for example at night with 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.359
 darkness occurs immediately 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.149
 few unpleasant things first 

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.810
 zombies wake up now they see heroes 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.820
 from afar 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.310
 try to chase him and generally 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.049
 show increased aggressiveness in 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.850
 second some infected with 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.590
 nightfall turn into 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.630
 original super zombies 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.090
 so you need to be ready not only 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.039
 fight but during retreat for 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.490
 this is useful parkour system 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.210
 built-in kvd thailand action 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.159
 dying light 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.170
 will unfold in the open world 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.179
 in addition to the plot tasks 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.280
 the developers promise to cook and 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.439
 many optional quests that 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.209
 will pop up by themselves as 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.340
 research card so in 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:46.990
 demo game hero 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.439
 running past one of the abandoned 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.080
 houses 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.540
 heard sounds coming from inside 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.150
 and making your way to the building I found in one of 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.520
 cabinets to death scared girl 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.950
 reported by the radio to the allies 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.230
 it may very well be that dying light will be 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.510
 techland for about the same than steel 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.360
 for developers assassin's creed 2 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.760
 part of the series in thailand developers 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.860
 We try out new gameplay mechanics and 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.290
 new project looks like a logical 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.510
 development of these ideas is quite possible that 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.100
 made by the authors add-ons will take 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.100
 game to a whole new level
