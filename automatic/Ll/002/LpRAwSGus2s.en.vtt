00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.350 
and it works the same way it just a you
know<00:05:00.950> logs<00:05:01.640> in<00:05:01.820> through<00:05:01.970> your<00:05:02.090> cell<00:05:02.330> phone

so<00:05:05.660> I<00:05:05.720> believe<00:05:05.960> it<00:05:06.320> builds<00:05:06.830> your<00:05:06.860> account

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
so I believe it builds your account

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.100 
so I believe it builds your account
depending<00:05:07.910> on<00:05:08.030> what<00:05:08.120> kind<00:05:08.210> of<00:05:08.300> a<00:05:08.390> account<00:05:08.930> you

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
depending on what kind of a account you

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.170 
depending on what kind of a account you
have<00:05:09.430> like<00:05:10.430> I<00:05:10.460> mentioned<00:05:10.670> earlier<00:05:10.850> the

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
have like I mentioned earlier the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.640 
have like I mentioned earlier the
unlimited<00:05:11.390> one<00:05:11.750> so<00:05:11.930> it<00:05:12.020> doesn't<00:05:12.260> affect<00:05:12.500> me

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
unlimited one so it doesn't affect me

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.040 
unlimited one so it doesn't affect me
much<00:05:12.800> but<00:05:12.860> if<00:05:13.280> you<00:05:13.370> pay<00:05:13.850> per<00:05:14.150> message<00:05:14.360> it<00:05:14.720> might

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
much but if you pay per message it might

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.000 
much but if you pay per message it might
you<00:05:15.080> might<00:05:15.290> have<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.530> look<00:05:15.710> into<00:05:15.830> that<00:05:15.890> a

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
you might have to look into that a

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.770 
you might have to look into that a
little<00:05:16.130> bit<00:05:16.280> further<00:05:16.490> but<00:05:17.330> I<00:05:17.480> like<00:05:17.660> this

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.779 
to do each one of these individually but
I<00:07:03.050> like<00:07:03.349> I'd<00:07:03.560> rather<00:07:03.800> have<00:07:04.099> them<00:07:04.310> all<00:07:04.520> at<00:07:04.759> once

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:04.789 
I like I'd rather have them all at once

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:08.429 
I like I'd rather have them all at once
because<00:07:05.629> it<00:07:05.780> just<00:07:05.870> makes<00:07:06.229> more<00:07:06.469> sense<00:07:06.800> it<00:07:07.460> also

00:07:08.429 --> 00:07:08.439 
because it just makes more sense it also

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:12.309 
because it just makes more sense it also
allows<00:07:09.439> you<00:07:09.800> to<00:07:09.919> control<00:07:10.280> ring<00:07:11.180> ring<00:07:11.509> no<00:07:12.289> ring

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 
allows you to control ring ring no ring

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:15.100 
allows you to control ring ring no ring
vibrate<00:07:13.069> ring<00:07:13.370> volume<00:07:13.629> you<00:07:14.629> can<00:07:14.690> change<00:07:14.990> from

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
vibrate ring volume you can change from

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.529 
vibrate ring volume you can change from
3g<00:07:15.440> to<00:07:15.620> 2g<00:07:15.710> settings<00:07:16.430> we<00:07:16.610> just<00:07:16.789> go<00:07:16.909> on<00:07:17.030> Wi-Fi

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:17.539 
3g to 2g settings we just go on Wi-Fi

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:20.020 
3g to 2g settings we just go on Wi-Fi
you<00:07:18.259> can<00:07:18.289> also<00:07:18.500> turn<00:07:18.770> your<00:07:18.979> timeout<00:07:19.520> screen

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.030 
you can also turn your timeout screen

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.969 
you can also turn your timeout screen
mode<00:07:20.629> and<00:07:20.870> there's<00:07:21.020> also<00:07:21.169> the<00:07:21.349> screen

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:21.979 
mode and there's also the screen

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.820 
mode and there's also the screen
brightness<00:07:22.099> you<00:07:22.430> adjust<00:07:22.969> that<00:07:23.150> on<00:07:23.719> here<00:07:24.560> and

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830 
brightness you adjust that on here and

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.279 
brightness you adjust that on here and
there's<00:07:25.219> also<00:07:25.430> um<00:07:25.849> heaven<00:07:26.569> there's<00:07:26.960> a<00:07:27.020> way<00:07:27.229> to

there's also um heaven there's a way to

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:30.070 
there's also um heaven there's a way to
actually<00:07:27.800> get<00:07:28.789> different<00:07:28.969> profiles<00:07:29.659> set<00:07:29.990> up

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 
actually get different profiles set up

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:37.009 
setting and it'll just adjust everything

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:38.439 
setting and it'll just adjust everything
