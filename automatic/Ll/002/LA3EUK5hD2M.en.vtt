00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 It's one more in defense of my beautiful ones today. 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.080
 It's day of hairstying here on the do channel. 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.150
 a well-knit coke and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.389
 will also have a tip on how to do the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.590
 coque donut on makeshift at home 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.049
 for you to have a hairstyle more 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.240
 tidy with a romantic footprint until 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.640
 party day falls very well and though 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.859
 get the hair is already dry is already in 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.720
 rail half way but this way 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.820
 hairstyle people do not bother doing 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.010
 babyliss while doing you can 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.550
 leave as it is natural that will give 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.109
 right 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.660
 I started to take care of the herd you 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.550
 You know I love your little eyes. 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.260
 then to the nutribem because the hair is 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.450
 very porous mainly here in the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.790
 tips and very dry because of the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.129
 lights then I used the shampoo and conditioner 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.809
 from victor that is joel that he has 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.879
 an African academy as principal 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.500
 active and now I will also prepare the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.210
 uncles so that the hairstyle becomes more 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.120
 beautiful with more shine to the hair more 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.680
 silky and I will apply 2 pampas that pro 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.690
 my hair is enough 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.829
 alignment also not only because the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.260
 here jewelry from length to ends 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.170
 much more disciplined hair and 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.180
 grinds in my hand I 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.729
 flying hairs that are here in the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.380
 Head high and now it's broke. 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.810
 It's ready for us to start today. 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.570
 You will need some grampinhos. 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.979
 of two hair elastics and one half 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.320
 as incredible as it may seem you will 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.270
 then need a 63 rooms to 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.990
 help our call wants to stay longer 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.600
 cool 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.610
 so what do you do with her tip 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.770
 Where do you usually stick your foot? 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.200
 you gonna roll out, go rollin ' 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.270
 and how about the tip of the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.009
 little finger you cut with scissors and 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.659
 hides the tip we have to 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.610
 make two children one on each side 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.740
 then back to show us gives 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.990
 different way of making you choose the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.180
 what do you feel most comfortable in here? 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.100
 That's where I played my 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.920
 Hair I'm going to leave this little strip like this 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.960
 Like a charm here and I'll get a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.060
 way to make a 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.939
 braid then divide into three 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.850
 parts and I pull it back over the 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.600
 head then braid down braid 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.600
 there diagonally 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.970
 when you are arriving at the tip 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.980
 You hold a little stick like this and calculate 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.540
 if it gets there behind it's where 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.720
 She learns ok, you get a 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.130
 Shock a clamp in learning here 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.170
 On this side we will do differently. 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.000
 make a braid with emotion until they 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.260
 I've already got the hint here in the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.050
 channel for you 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.990
 then it also starts with a 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.030
 normal wick 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.430
 divided into three parts and now 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.420
 that a marchinha goes back to the class 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.130
 she brings another half remembers the tip she 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.950
 never come back alone 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.770
 we pass her by now more 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.530
 full with more hair and the same thing 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.530
 here with this top gun 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.890
 I got more hair like inside 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.050
 and remember to make that same braid 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.450
 pulling back so we can have the 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.049
 ideal is when it passes my 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.830
 Ear, I'm going to go down normally without 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:31.920
 borrow more hair and 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.810
 voltran sando to the tip then people 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.220
 this length sufficient to reach 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.390
 back then learn here at the tip 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.940
 I'll come to see you better. 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.580
 Now I'm going to dine on those 500 elastic and 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.459
 pull them together so we can learn 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:54.000
 everything at the back of the neck joins his whole 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:55.799
 hair then stuck with that same self 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.750
 I think I was not even using it 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.269
 too tight we 're going to make use of 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.080
 from our 6 I spent my little fingers through 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:06.090
 mine and now I leave it around my 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.090
 hair and already leaves the other elastic 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.540
 ready at hand what we will do 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.450
 cover all mine with hot hair 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.600
 pass around my now safe 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.970
 So , I'll think maybe 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.110
 You need to straighten your hair or the other to 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.849
 cover everything then you will feeling going 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.110
 passing the nail to hit everything 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.900
 cute and 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.090
 we like to separate into two parts 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:39.010
 and then I'm going around everything 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.470
 now carefully together with the other 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.950
 step I will not put a 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:48.670
 grapinho here in another grapinho here 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:51.430
 in we have our coke that a braid in the 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.800
 Legends for you to see if you feel 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.540
 but the braid is built in if you 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.030
 I want to make a braid 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.340
 conventional and behind what you already know 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.020
 How to do the tip is to wear a rubber band 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.640
 for after passing the 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.950
 elastic tight this will te 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.380
 help and also if you have a sock 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.750
 darker if you are a brunette will 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.180
 also favor their hairstyle and make 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.770
 your likes remember to use the hashtag or 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.570

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.460
 inspirations and to sign up there too 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.590
