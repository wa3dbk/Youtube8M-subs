do that we give them a reward we want to
be<00:00:31.980> something<00:00:32.340> better<00:00:32.550> than<00:00:32.880> what's<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.180> their

not<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.420> are<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.840> try<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.170> take

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
not that we are going to try and take

00:00:58.410 --> 00:02:18.550 
not that we are going to try and take
their<00:00:58.590> food<00:00:58.770> away

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.500 

at<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.920> point<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.400> should<00:02:20.430> have<00:02:20.910> ended<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
at this point I should have ended the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.510 
at this point I should have ended the
training<00:02:21.870> session<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.500> just<00:02:22.560> let<00:02:23.130> him<00:02:23.310> finish

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
training session and just let him finish

training session and just let him finish
his<00:02:23.850> meal<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.420> you'll<00:02:24.600> see<00:02:24.840> why<00:02:25.020> in<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.290> minute

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:04:07.610 

Oh

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.080 

okay<00:04:08.620> so<00:04:08.680> there<00:04:09.010> are<00:04:09.099> just<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.370> few<00:04:09.400> things<00:04:09.910> I

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
okay so there are just a few things I

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.120 
okay so there are just a few things I
want<00:04:10.330> to<00:04:10.420> point<00:04:10.510> out<00:04:10.870> about<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.440> use<00:04:11.739> of<00:04:12.010> the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
want to point out about the use of the

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.640 
want to point out about the use of the
electronic<00:04:12.670> collar<00:04:12.880> in<00:04:13.239> this<00:04:13.390> video<00:04:13.690> first

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
electronic collar in this video first

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.650 
electronic collar in this video first
and<00:04:14.860> foremost<00:04:15.370> it's<00:04:15.819> important<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.389> note<00:04:16.630> that

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
and foremost it's important to note that

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.629 
and foremost it's important to note that
the<00:04:17.079> levels<00:04:17.500> of<00:04:17.590> intensity<00:04:18.070> that<00:04:18.220> we<00:04:18.400> are

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
the levels of intensity that we are

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.810 
the levels of intensity that we are
using<00:04:18.970> are<00:04:19.359> extremely<00:04:20.079> low<00:04:20.260> he<00:04:21.040> is<00:04:21.070> on<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:21.370> level

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
using are extremely low he is on a level

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.930 
using are extremely low he is on a level
six<00:04:22.300> out<00:04:22.510> of<00:04:22.570> 100<00:04:23.380> on<00:04:23.530> an<00:04:23.979> educator<00:04:24.550> brand

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
six out of 100 on an educator brand

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.810 
six out of 100 on an educator brand
remote<00:04:25.360> collar<00:04:25.660> that<00:04:26.530> level<00:04:26.979> is<00:04:27.190> so<00:04:27.550> low<00:04:27.789> that

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
remote collar that level is so low that

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.779 
remote collar that level is so low that
the<00:04:28.210> average<00:04:28.419> human<00:04:28.810> being<00:04:29.260> cannot<00:04:29.919> even<00:04:30.310> feel

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
the average human being cannot even feel

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.360 
the average human being cannot even feel
it<00:04:30.820> so<00:04:31.479> it<00:04:31.600> is<00:04:31.720> certainly<00:04:32.080> not<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.710> painful

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
it so it is certainly not a painful

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.730 
it so it is certainly not a painful
level<00:04:33.970> of<00:04:34.090> intensity<00:04:34.539> or<00:04:34.630> a<00:04:34.870> high<00:04:35.260> level<00:04:35.590> of

Correction by any means the second point

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.430 
Correction by any means the second point
of<00:04:39.010> importance<00:04:39.610> is<00:04:39.850> that<00:04:39.910> this<00:04:40.900> was<00:04:41.169> not<00:04:41.200> the

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
of importance is that this was not the

of importance is that this was not the
first<00:04:42.039> time<00:04:42.460> that<00:04:42.850> we<00:04:42.970> introduced<00:04:43.660> the
