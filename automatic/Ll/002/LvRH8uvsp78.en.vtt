 the program 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:45.410
 is a very joint structure with the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.150
 spectacular front combination and the 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.150
 His work machine patio 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.590
 now we come to the table by the planes 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.420
 that in that we have the head of the cradle 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.060
 that stands out with invoice stretches 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.260

 color combinations 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.440
 and let's dedicate ourselves with the quilt of 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.450
 our that the teacher look at everything 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.100
 who has loves this way of 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.990
 work maybe now where not only 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.850
 when I was the same and solved 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.850
 designed a place 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.210
 in block number 4 of our 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.220
 program let's go back to take it out for 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.630
 that the person who was not bought early 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.280
 to our tuning that I am buying 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.280
 this moment can enjoy 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:22.440
 is a florida technique or the 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.610
 patchwork technique on a cover 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:30.289
 tank we have from another technique of 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.289
 blue on one side takes over 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:43.320
 this is the semi-noble technique here in 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:46.440
 the top part and it carries its flowers in 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.360
 the olive technique excellence and first 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.139
 the worker's day job or was going 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.139
 to be this bag 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:05:04.620
 and they are well set and that also 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.260
 the creator accompanies us, we thank him 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.550
 his presence here in the studio 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.000
 she also although this was 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.000
 too 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.260
 to the bathroom 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:28.380
 so it's a brilliant double idea 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:30.980
 Felix teacher learning today is only for 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.980
 to work 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.110
 because I know the oak first 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:47.190
 what are we going to do is double 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.190
 cut a square of 22 x 22 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.250
 but let's fold it in half 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.290
 here 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.490
 let's fold the fabric in half and 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.280
 let's iron 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.540
 I already had previously folded it but 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.820
 I'll do 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.190
 iron again to be marked 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.150
 better the fabric 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:22.050
 and then we open and we bend in the other 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.890
 felt like that inside with the double we're going to 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.890
 make a cross 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:35.539
 what we already have that cross 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:38.139
 we open the test and we will take the 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:38.139
 tips 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.510
 inhabit I am only doing with one 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:49.940
 simple fabric but in the valleys course 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.940
 with doublet so that it does not remain 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:07:02.000
 22 22 22 girls moments do not put on what 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.000
 that make you mind mind bracelet 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.370
 and all 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.370
 balance 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.830
 we're always going to keep the doubles 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:29.210
 extremely interesting but we want 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.210
 make a small 

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:41.969
 ah 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.159
 approach based on number 1
