00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
confused about how it was all gonna work

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.930 
confused about how it was all gonna work
because<00:00:12.990> there<00:00:13.230> are<00:00:13.380> like<00:00:13.590> Xbox<00:00:14.009> 360<00:00:14.549> settings

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.279 
buy any extra stuff so let's have a look
at<00:00:26.070> my<00:00:26.160> setup<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.689> can<00:00:27.810> see<00:00:28.019> I've<00:00:28.199> got

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
at my setup so as you can see I've got

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.040 
at my setup so as you can see I've got
the<00:00:28.439> Xbox<00:00:28.859> one<00:00:29.070> here<00:00:29.510> it's<00:00:30.510> all<00:00:30.720> ready<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> go

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the Xbox one here it's all ready to go

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.359 
the Xbox one here it's all ready to go
right<00:00:31.260> now<00:00:31.349> we're<00:00:31.470> gonna<00:00:31.560> have<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> look<00:00:32.160> at<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
right now we're gonna have a look at the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.760 
right now we're gonna have a look at the
back<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:33.390> all<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> cords<00:00:33.989> now<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
back with all the cords now this is the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.520 
back with all the cords now this is the
Kinect<00:00:35.489> cable<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.329> HDMI<00:00:36.899> cable<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
Kinect cable the HDMI cable and the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.360 
Kinect cable the HDMI cable and the
power<00:00:37.559> supply

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
power supply

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.229 
power supply
so<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.420> HDMI<00:00:39.989> cable<00:00:40.440> actually<00:00:41.190> runs<00:00:41.460> over

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
so this HDMI cable actually runs over

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.180 
so this HDMI cable actually runs over
here<00:00:42.510> through<00:00:43.170> third<00:00:43.710> sure<00:00:43.860> my<00:00:43.980> Elgato

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
here through third sure my Elgato

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.790 
here through third sure my Elgato
capture<00:00:45.120> device<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.899> goes<00:00:46.079> into<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> HDMI

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
capture device so it goes into the HDMI

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.580 
capture device so it goes into the HDMI
IN<00:00:47.190> right<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.289> where<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
IN right here and this is where the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.939 
IN right here and this is where the
PlayStation<00:00:50.129> 3<00:00:50.399> cord<00:00:50.910> would<00:00:51.180> go<00:00:51.469> but<00:00:52.469> that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
PlayStation 3 cord would go but that

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.590 
PlayStation 3 cord would go but that
Xbox<00:00:53.430> one<00:00:53.610> goes<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.910> there<00:00:54.030> where<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> Xbox

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
Xbox one goes in there where the Xbox

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.619 
Xbox one goes in there where the Xbox
360<00:00:55.079> would<00:00:55.199> usually<00:00:55.410> go<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.360> we're<00:00:57.510> gonna

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
360 would usually go and so we're gonna

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.099 
360 would usually go and so we're gonna
move<00:00:57.809> across<00:00:58.430> and<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.090> kind<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.539> USB

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
move across and this is the kind of USB

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.020 
move across and this is the kind of USB
that<00:01:01.530> powers<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> out<00:01:02.190> gutter<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:02.850> this

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that powers the out gutter and then this

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.899 
that powers the out gutter and then this
is<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> HDMI<00:01:03.780> out<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.650> HDMI<00:01:05.159> cable<00:01:05.580> runs

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
is the HDMI out now this HDMI cable runs

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.280 
is the HDMI out now this HDMI cable runs
along<00:01:06.119> here<00:01:06.150> there's<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.630> lot<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.900> cords<00:01:07.170> back
