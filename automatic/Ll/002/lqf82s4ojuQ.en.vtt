00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.699
 start waiting for our cucumbers and 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.710
 cutting it in three parts 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.680
 those three parts we're going to make a 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.260
 seat to take our cucumber 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.360

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.670
 small we are going to remove the seeds 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.880
 to be able to fill it with our 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.909

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.720
 our apples are going to do the same 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.659
 I'm going to use this that I bought that is 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.570
 to cut the apples as they see 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.450
 this way so that it does so low 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.369
 so I can achieve this in 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.619

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.830

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.020
