00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.900
 Fire and dude just to clarify here I

 I do not see gunshot, I only do the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.470
 white weapon level 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.540

 come on today I'm bringing the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.500

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.820
 long you will understand why and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.470
 I wanted to thank you too, it's human, igor. 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.379
 Who lent the bill to us? 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.809
 making cost are together and is nóis 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.909
 fan when I ask you if you 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.710
 You have not watched my video review yet. 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.330
 punch like I thought if you watch 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.339
 putting it back on the screen gives you a 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.710
 look there is if you did not watch 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:07.020
 watch it a few days this beauty 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.970
 because in several parts he described voting 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.130
 comparing the common punch with a punch 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.930
 mário the punch English magma arrived there 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.869
 nuclei fails in the second part of 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.149
 siberia update is had until the rumors 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.039
 then when the guys went to implant 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.070
 first country to update unintentionally 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:26.340
 they put it there but after they turned it 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.350
 he and how it was supposed to happen he arrived 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.380
 in the second part of the update in 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.090
 box the magma this box magma not only 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.609
 has an English punch has two other two 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.130
 weapons that in the case is external and magma 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:41.310
 wm magma that for me is the best prize 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.229
 each box costs one thousand three hundred p 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.689
 And I think it's a good move because 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.210
 types are three guns in a box or 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.460
 It is the more chance that you will win I will 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.409
 talk about his injuries I already want 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.499
 warn that these damages that you will see 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.890
 is without a vest and without a helmet and another is 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:01.289
 characteristic of the mortal punch is the 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.539
 English Southern English punch 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.469
 so you click the mouse it gives 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.569
 two worlds 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.759
 so I'm considering these damages 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.890
 with both worlds to take because they have 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.540
 pipo time you give a click 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.220
 but the two worlds do not get their 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.390
 because it gives moral to the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.190
 left and right 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.170
 Let's suppose there's an hour that I just get from 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.610
 right is on do not get caught in 2011 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.520
 so jesus I'm going to show you 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.390
 it's important to take both 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:30.980
 beauty in the head he takes a hundred in the chest 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:34.790
 77 in the stomach 88 in the arms 55 in the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.100
 legs 55 and feet 55 his steppe is 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.430
 100 in all parts of the body as 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.400
 You can see his damage is exactly 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.050
 equal to the common English punch 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.600
 If you go through the video you go 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.920
 To know is exactly the same. 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.990
 It makes no difference why I 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.150
 I said at the beginning of this video that 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.130
 This review was not going to be too long. 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.310
 basically they are basically not 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.650
 only it only changes skin at speed 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.060
 slash and distribution to same back 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.180
 putting slash on you guys 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.910
 comparison you see is the same thing 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.310
 How did I say a magma English punch? 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.420
 only changes to an ordinary English punch in the 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.910
 issue of the left 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.400
 the mask is precisely this fact that I 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.110
 I think it takes advantage of it because there 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.870
 Yes, it 's very beautiful for you, can you? 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.570
 see a real good stuff well done 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.060
 not only of soul with one of the external and 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.610
 bird is very beautiful and because of the fact 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.620
 it is seasonal ie after it 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.870
 leaving the country will emanate this weapon can 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.280
 turn around area maybe she will not come back 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.950
 every nuke fire I am 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.750
 feature the English punch features 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.720
 by the fact that its weight 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.209
 mano is an air on super light he is one of the 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.850
 lighter streets of the country goes along with the 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.910
 mortal punch along with the English punch 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.940
 normal and are extremely fast weapons 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.010
 that you stay in line with her is slash 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.080
 it is also a very fast slash and the 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.660
 Steppe, man, can you give two 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.520
 steves followed human giant speed 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.560
 is connected is an air in the very possible 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.020
 agile with her but to give a man who 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.910
 balanced because of the fact that 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.580
 light and the guy get faster 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.740
 they decreased the distance from the distance 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.020
 of the punch is not with a distance of one 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.270
 spade where is civil ax 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.250
 but mano that is for the fact of balancing 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.350
 Imagine if this water has this 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.240
 distance from one meets a shovel today and the 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.250
 dude was still very light 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.380
 And I know a lot, so this is 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.880
 issue of balance as a whole and saw 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.330
 a lot of people ask me how I 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.509
 Should I play kun hand? 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.490
 an old punch my opinion and not only 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.530
 landed with all the white weapons I 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.110
 I recommend you always play stebe 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.650
 what is always what is left is fatal 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.349
 switched on 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.719
 in case about laws mano and plays with stebe 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.849
 why the speed of his steppe you 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:49.770
 you can give two ends in a row 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.629
 at a very fast speed on 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.969
 you could not do with complying 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.889
 neither with a shovel because he is very fast 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.539
 How are you, darling? 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.569
 So when you went with him, you play. 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:02.129
 always of steppe slash mano in the last 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.409
 conditions created only if there is no way 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.960
 same domain at the head and 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.789
 exit in the lech and to end here face 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.770
 the final considerations 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.090
 It's not worth it or I'm not here for 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.030
 try to rotate 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.280
 it is in these the human taking into account that 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.770
 If you go in the box you have a chance to 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.389
 winning three years I think it's worth it because 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.190
 Like if you can not win it 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.349
 you will probably gain another weapon 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.080
 And the prizes you have there are not 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:30.060
 Bad cousins are connected to the wm and the 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.069
 As I said here it is you are 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.849
 great prizes and dude if you take one 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.310
 English punch 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.960
 it's as if you're a seasonal version one 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.879
 version that is rare 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.340
 no one knows if she's coming back or not 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:43.050
 so if you have the account, go 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.060
 give a good valuation to your account 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.099
 So that's how I told you it's a 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.240
 That's a good weapon for me. 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.949
 stop guns 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.440
 is little compared to an ax one 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:55.409
 to meet only is her style is a little 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.430
 different y'know gives the normal is a 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.099
 gun you have to approach 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.750
 the bigger the enemy is the more you will have 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.360
 very easy to approach because 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.919
 you have more mobility to connect then 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.449
 you take a while to get used to it 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.339
 It took me a while to get the scenes 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:11.430
 more expensive that with the time you wind up 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:13.289
 beauty at 0 was going to leave the video review eu 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.400
 I hope you like it I know 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.310
 what the crowd is going to ask to do 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.169
 gameplay with the estelle and when to wm 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.580
 I'll do yes, you 'll only have to calm down. 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.620
 My classes are back, so it's a 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.969
 Little tricky here one more time I'm going 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.039
 to do everything for this week is 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:26.699
 posting the game place with her by 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.409
 little boy 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.789
 did you like to own and share with 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:32.099
 a friend of yours if he has doubt and 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:33.690
 intends to shoot him in the chest for him 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:35.310
