00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.899
 It is a waste of sex very much Hello motor journalist 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.709
 It was April but it snowed in the morning 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:16.510
 So it's two cars that look like this 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:23.650
 Well fire this is 2.5 liters is an emblem of Alphard Blue 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:24.590
 In the car in the two but equivalent Oh is cold is a hybrid model is elegant in the ultra-luxurious 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.920
 I think I can move 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.920
 I would like to get in the car soon 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:49.930
 I 'm riding 2.5 liters of Vellfire right now , let me tell you a little 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:55.450
 Want to do is easy to match the seat position is Well this only 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:01:00.640
 When the ethyl and telescopic come with minivan and Iedo be such a little 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.190
 Come quite nicely even though there is in the upright seat position 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.000
 position 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:09.510
 Easy to be operated so high also I will take the US view the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:16.260
 I think this is one big attraction 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:21.990
 This time as a comprehensive seasoning this car so far to say that luxury cars and sedan 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.979
 Because the intention to take in is thought that this is made, all the riding taste is already 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.990
 It is a luxury car 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:31.630
 It is natural that there is a large indoor space 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:35.350
 Because it is a luxury car on the ride even more natural on the rear, so double on the rear 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:40.400
 As we put in wishbones and so do seasoning 2.5 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:46.310
 Nor to run to the very Shi run in the exclusive Gentle at Ritter 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.430
 There are three powertrains that I feel, and I think that I was able to quite characterize what to do this time 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.520
 think 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:56.550
 As an advice, I will join the 2.5 liter cv hand I'm riding now, tomorrow 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.860
 We think that it is easy to understand if we think based on this 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:05.570
 I am running very smoothly now 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:08.300
 Since it is already a matter of course the continuously variable transmission only trodden if stepping on to a no shift shock separately 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:15.050
 Got a strong family 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:20.880
 In I do not leave Nante dissatisfied with absolute if one-seater degree against this powerful acceleration 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:26.400
 But it feels like this is a travel position in a state where people are up to the third row 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.420
 Te climb the hill even after all those who are a little more family want Do Toka this perspective at that time 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.630
 I think you are welcome 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.670
 Like that 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:37.200
 I think that there is no choice of v6 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:40.030
 Furthermore, since many more attractive features are supposed to be hybrid hiding, it is necessary from now 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:46.230
 I want to ride a little 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:49.090
 I switched to the hybrid model The first thing I will tell you is that the vehicle weight is 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:54.160
 Is it about 200 kg? 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.420
 It is heavy to leave the in -line four-cylinder 2.5 liters About 100 kg against v6 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.020
 It will be heavy 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:05.060
 Slightly old Toka after all against it acceleration and deceleration say remember Well 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:11.720
 It will be, but it is very effective for riding comfort 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:14.090
 You can hold the car on the road surface with a weight that will move smoothly and smoothly 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:19.140
 Around which after all was said, 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:26.220
 If you want a ride If you seek comfort 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:31.440
 I think whether I can say a hybrid without hesitation a little 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.180
 In such speed range I think that I can say that almost certainly an engine 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.630
 In the state of stopping 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.480
 It can be said that it can run with only a motor 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:46.240
 Although it is an over 2.2 car 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:52.510
 Even if the engine is a very powerful engine, it is just 200 Newton a little 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:56.540
 Well the displacement is this 2.5 liters, but because it shakes in the direction of fuel consumption a little, it is considerable to hold 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:00.769
 Only kindergarten have issued a force in the motor further with respect to the bottom 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:04.180
 It is about 270 newtons, so in other words 2.5 liters over 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.209
 Front of the motor that demonstrates that power 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.260
 + Hybrid is the focus of attention 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:14.439
 The motor is loaded on the rear and this is about 140 newtons, about 1.5 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:19.000
 It corresponds to a child with a displacement equivalent to a liter 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:21.850
 Well it's a motor, so it comes to purple as well, and the fat comes in focus 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.220
 The movement is smooth 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:28.660
 Only really'm easy to tilt the car grabber to push the car behind to pull in just before after all 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.150
 I guess after all 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:40.350
 4 If it moves smoothly with the motor smoothly, it cuts and pulls from before it pushes from behind 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:46.710
 If this works well, the attitude change of the car can move very slowly and start moving 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:52.410
 It has become a finish to become a sensation Tteyuu hybrid definitely if the ride in the back 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:58.740
 V6 still between seek or only in speaking, still sporting run 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:05:00.370
 You can enjoy the automatic gear shift and enjoy it, and you can enjoy it in comfort 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.960
 Have room for acceleration 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:10.540
 Let's move to the luxury to the luxury at that kind of hybrid is already absolute 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:13.400
 To basic for you Yes as a 2.5 to choose first, to part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications viewpoint 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:18.729
 I wonder if it is good 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.729
 9 Do you think it's a child of the seat you are sitting now 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:27.490
 This car can not do without this car It is a seat of the passenger seat 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:31.030
 It is done to the place of the 2nd row now 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:37.330
 It may be said that this long slide is also a semantic feature 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:39.950
 Of course this laid-back attitude and say lowering the passenger seat behind and what can be improved 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:47.409
 Of course I can sit 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:52.659
 The it is not spread sense of unity I'm no longer the front seat after seat this fence-house by this 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:57.909
 The sea of ​​the reef which I have been driving seat and Joe until now is sitting in the back seat and the second row the third row 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:06:04.449
 I can not hear it, but when the passenger in the passenger seat lowers , that one child is riding behind 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:07.400
 The state but this triangular relationship can be established People in the second row of the driver's seat 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:13.280
 Even for such a detailed use environment 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:16.370
 It is this card 's card beauty that this has been done so that the room can be used comfortably and comfortably 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:20.870
 I think that is not a national bird of Vulfire 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:24.229
 Well , there are various sheet arrangements like this which can not be done by grade . 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:27.390
 There are many more kinds, so everyone 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:33.570
 I want to do or that sort of a use this car to Fu What say 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:34.620
 Select the most suitable one including the power train and the most suitable one after clearly stating 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:39.950
 When it matches 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.950
 I think that whether or not there in the give me the best of lifestyle
