dinosaurs<00:00:21.240> now<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.810> reason<00:00:22.109> for<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.619> is

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
dinosaurs now the reason for this is

some<00:00:43.770> description<00:00:43.920> now<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.850> don't<00:00:45.090> seem<00:00:45.600> like

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
some description now I don't seem like

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.540 
some description now I don't seem like
some<00:00:46.020> kind<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.320> killjoy<00:00:46.860> or<00:00:46.980> anything<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.489> I

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
some kind of killjoy or anything but I

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.790 
some kind of killjoy or anything but I
don't<00:00:47.969> think<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.110> actually<00:00:49.410> legit

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
don't think that this is actually legit

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.069 
don't think that this is actually legit
I<00:00:50.070> think<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.550> image<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.899> been

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
I think this image is it's been

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.319 
I think this image is it's been
fabricated<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:53.039> some<00:00:53.340> way<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> make<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.149> look

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
fabricated in some way to make it look

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.689 
fabricated in some way to make it look
like<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.780> been<00:00:54.840> got<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.800> legit<00:00:56.100> way<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.489> I

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
like it's been got in a legit way but I

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
like it's been got in a legit way but I
don't<00:00:57.239> think<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> actually<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.079> legit<00:00:58.440> I've

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
don't think it actually is legit I've

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.680 
don't think it actually is legit I've
got<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> couple<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.100> reasons<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
got a couple of reasons for that but a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.450 
got a couple of reasons for that but a
lot<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.899> people<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.469> been<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.920> fooled<00:01:02.280> by

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
lot of people have been like fooled by

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.100 
lot of people have been like fooled by
this<00:01:02.520> I'm<00:01:02.820> not<00:01:02.940> saying<00:01:03.180> for<00:01:03.390> certain<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.930> is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
this I'm not saying for certain that is

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.250 
this I'm not saying for certain that is
fakes<00:01:04.559> I've<00:01:04.739> got<00:01:04.949> no<00:01:05.100> proof<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.850> fake

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
fakes I've got no proof that it is fake

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.840 
fakes I've got no proof that it is fake
but<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.710> got<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.860> ask<00:01:08.070> yourself<00:01:08.220> does<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
but you got to ask yourself does it

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.399 
but you got to ask yourself does it
really<00:01:09.119> sound<00:01:09.450> likely<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.990> we're<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.290> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
really sound likely that we're going to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.219 
really sound likely that we're going to
have<00:01:10.770> dinosaurs<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.760> call<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.299> duty<00:01:12.390> doesn't

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
have dinosaurs in call of duty doesn't

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.649 
have dinosaurs in call of duty doesn't
sound<00:01:13.650> likely<00:01:14.070> also<00:01:14.580> another<00:01:15.060> reason<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.479> I

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
sound likely also another reason that I

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.539 
sound likely also another reason that I
don't<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.229> image<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.740> legit<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.280> did<00:01:17.520> a

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
don't in this image is legit I did a

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.700 
don't in this image is legit I did a
quick<00:01:17.820> google<00:01:17.939> search<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.780> bit<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.290> actual

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
quick google search a bit of the actual

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.609 
quick google search a bit of the actual
image<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.310> saw<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.210> wasn't<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:22.080> unique

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
image and saw that it wasn't a unique

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.289 
image and saw that it wasn't a unique
image<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.070> by<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.460> mean<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.909> had<00:01:24.090> been

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
image and by that I mean it had been

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.929 
image and by that I mean it had been
used<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.810> websites<00:01:25.320> before<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.220> I've<00:01:26.549> done<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
used on websites before so I've done a

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.090 
used on websites before so I've done a
search<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.810> popped<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.470> couple<00:01:28.950> of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
search for it a popped up on couple of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.490 
search for it a popped up on couple of
websites<00:01:29.310> before<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.299> date<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:31.170> teaser

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
websites before the date of this teaser

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.200 
websites before the date of this teaser
website<00:01:32.009> now<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.369> may<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.549> coincidence

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
website now that may be coincidence

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.330 
website now that may be coincidence
maybe<00:01:33.420> sledgehammer<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.170> used<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.920> image

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
maybe sledgehammer have used this image

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.850 
maybe sledgehammer have used this image
from<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> other<00:01:36.180> website<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.990> find<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
from the other website I find it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.010 
from the other website I find it
unlikely<00:01:38.040> though<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.150> find<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.840> a

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
unlikely though and I find it just a

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.660 
unlikely though and I find it just a
little<00:01:40.049> bit<00:01:40.290> weird<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:40.860> all<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.250> websites

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
little bit weird that all the websites

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.090 
little bit weird that all the websites
have<00:01:41.790> used<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.180> before<00:01:43.100> supposedly

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
have used it before supposedly

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.830 
have used it before supposedly
sledgehammer<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.880> used<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.240> doesn't<00:01:45.630> really

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
sledgehammer have used it doesn't really

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.480 
sledgehammer have used it doesn't really
add<00:01:46.110> up<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.380> doesn't<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:46.740> sound<00:01:47.009> right<00:01:47.310> so

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
add up it doesn't really sound right so

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.069 
add up it doesn't really sound right so
what<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.729> think<00:01:47.850> has<00:01:48.119> happened<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.750> people

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
what I think has happened and people

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.569 
what I think has happened and people
have<00:01:49.170> speculated<00:01:49.530> let's<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.159> forget<00:01:50.399> that

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
have speculated let's not forget that

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.550 
have speculated let's not forget that
dinosaurs<00:01:51.090> might<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.689> Call<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> Duty<00:01:52.409> for

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
dinosaurs might be in Call of Duty for

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.010 
dinosaurs might be in Call of Duty for
some<00:01:52.770> reason<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> long<00:01:53.640> time<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.180> also<00:01:54.899> in

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
some reason for a long time and also in

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.420 
some reason for a long time and also in
battlefield<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:55.740> well<00:01:55.890> let's<00:01:56.070> not<00:01:56.130> forget

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
battlefield as well let's not forget

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.060 
battlefield as well let's not forget
that<00:01:56.670> um<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.600> think<00:01:58.049> someone's<00:01:58.350> taken<00:01:58.829> that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
that um I think someone's taken that

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.219 
that um I think someone's taken that
speculation<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.210> thought<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.930> people

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
speculation that thought that people

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.410 
speculation that thought that people
have<00:02:01.380> always<00:02:01.590> always<00:02:01.829> had<00:02:02.280> kind<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.670> implanted

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
have always always had kind of implanted

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.690 
have always always had kind of implanted
in<00:02:03.630> them<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.049> kind<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:05.009> taking<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
in them and kind of taking it to the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.789 
in them and kind of taking it to the
next<00:02:05.790> level<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.329> tried<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.780> fabricate<00:02:07.259> some

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
next level and tried to fabricate some

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.339 
next level and tried to fabricate some
kind<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.220> fake<00:02:08.489> image<00:02:09.090> now<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.599> means<00:02:10.200> of

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
kind of fake image now the means of

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.900 
kind of fake image now the means of
which<00:02:10.500> you've<00:02:10.679> got<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.950> does<00:02:11.220> look<00:02:11.400> very<00:02:11.430> legit

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
which you've got it does look very legit

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.400 
which you've got it does look very legit
does<00:02:12.209> look<00:02:12.360> very<00:02:12.390> similar<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.050> fur

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
does look very similar to the fur

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.140 
does look very similar to the fur
image<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:13.800> I'm<00:02:13.890> not<00:02:14.070> saying<00:02:14.340> certainly<00:02:15.000> that

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
image so I'm not saying certainly that

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.120 
image so I'm not saying certainly that
it<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.390> fake<00:02:15.720> because<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.590> possible<00:02:16.860> that

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
it is fake because it is possible that

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.760 
it is fake because it is possible that
sledgehammers<00:02:17.760> used<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.240> image<00:02:18.630> which<00:02:19.500> was

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
sledgehammers used this image which was

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.250 
sledgehammers used this image which was
formed<00:02:20.370> on<00:02:20.550> another<00:02:20.910> website<00:02:21.480> by<00:02:21.990> another

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
formed on another website by another

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.500 
formed on another website by another
person<00:02:22.470> or<00:02:22.860> something<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.910> find<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.390> a

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
person or something I just find it a

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.420 
person or something I just find it a
little<00:02:24.720> bit<00:02:24.930> weird<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.230> if<00:02:25.530> they<00:02:25.830> if<00:02:26.070> that<00:02:26.310> is

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
little bit weird that if they if that is

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.040 
little bit weird that if they if that is
the<00:02:26.550> case<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.940> find<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.390> little<00:02:27.480> bit<00:02:27.660> strange

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
the case I find it a little bit strange

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.020 
the case I find it a little bit strange
that<00:02:28.140> they<00:02:28.320> have<00:02:28.620> done<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.190> also<00:02:29.820> if<00:02:29.940> you

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
that they have done that also if you

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.610 
that they have done that also if you
look<00:02:30.060> at<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.360> kind<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.690> colors<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> first

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
look at the kind of colors of the first

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.320 
look at the kind of colors of the first
image<00:02:32.040> compared<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.640> last<00:02:32.790> image<00:02:33.210> the

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
image compared to the last image the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.150 
image compared to the last image the
colors<00:02:33.690> are<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.900> lot<00:02:34.380> different<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.830> colors<00:02:35.130> in

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
colors are a lot different the colors in

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.770 
colors are a lot different the colors in
first<00:02:35.580> image<00:02:35.880> you're<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.000> lot<00:02:36.150> richer<00:02:36.450> and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
first image you're a lot richer and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.110 
first image you're a lot richer and
hotter<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.740> in<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.010> final<00:02:38.250> image<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.910> kind

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
hotter and in the final image that kind

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.600 
hotter and in the final image that kind
of<00:02:39.270> more<00:02:39.450> bland<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.200> grey<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:41.100> doesn't<00:02:41.490> really

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
of more bland and grey it doesn't really

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.270 
of more bland and grey it doesn't really
look<00:02:41.910> right<00:02:42.270> also<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.810> bits<00:02:43.110> in<00:02:43.470> Cana<00:02:44.070> at<00:02:44.190> the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
look right also this bits in Cana at the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.310 
look right also this bits in Cana at the
background<00:02:44.760> like<00:02:45.000> sticks<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.110> first

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
background like sticks in the first

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.200 
background like sticks in the first
image<00:02:46.710> that<00:02:46.740> aren't<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.490> final<00:02:47.820> image<00:02:47.880> I

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
image that aren't in the final image I

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.060 
image that aren't in the final image I
just<00:02:48.840> find<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.110> hard<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.410> believe<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.800> guy's

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
just find it hard to believe this guy's

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.580 
just find it hard to believe this guy's
actually<00:02:50.430> managed<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:50.910> kind<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.420> decode<00:02:52.140> this

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
actually managed to kind of decode this

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.950 
actually managed to kind of decode this
image<00:02:52.980> which<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.460> it<00:02:53.820> doesn't<00:02:54.330> sound<00:02:54.480> too

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
image which it it doesn't sound too

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.680 
image which it it doesn't sound too
likely<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.560> me<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:56.030> not<00:02:57.030> say<00:02:57.210> I'm<00:02:57.270> certain

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
likely to me and not say I'm certain

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.600 
likely to me and not say I'm certain
that<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.900> third<00:02:58.170> mode<00:02:58.410> won't<00:02:58.920> be<00:02:59.190> dinosaurs

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
that the third mode won't be dinosaurs

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.590 
that the third mode won't be dinosaurs
which<00:03:00.180> would<00:03:00.510> be<00:03:01.070> strangely<00:03:02.070> weird<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.120> epic

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
which would be strangely weird and epic

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.020 
which would be strangely weird and epic
but<00:03:04.110> i'm<00:03:04.320> not<00:03:04.350> really<00:03:04.830> i<00:03:05.130> just<00:03:05.160> don't<00:03:05.610> think<00:03:05.730> it

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
but i'm not really i just don't think it

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.250 
but i'm not really i just don't think it
would<00:03:06.120> happen<00:03:06.300> i<00:03:06.570> really<00:03:06.870> don't<00:03:07.020> think<00:03:07.080> it

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
would happen i really don't think it

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.530 
would happen i really don't think it
would<00:03:07.350> happen<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:08.030> yeah<00:03:09.030> they're<00:03:09.240> just<00:03:09.420> my

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540
