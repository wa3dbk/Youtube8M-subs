00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
yeah alright so first step is to dump

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.700 
yeah alright so first step is to dump
out<00:00:48.390> over<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.579> drop<00:00:50.579> liquid<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.870> dump<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.620> all

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
out over I drop liquid or dump it all

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.160 
out over I drop liquid or dump it all
the<00:00:52.890> glue<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.340> rinse<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.670> out<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.149> yeah<00:00:54.960> it's

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the glue and rinse it out so yeah it's

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:08.410 
the glue and rinse it out so yeah it's
going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.530> be<00:00:55.680> right<00:00:55.829> now

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.850 

all<00:01:09.420> right<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.750> next<00:01:09.960> step<00:01:10.229> you're<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.710> gonna

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
all right so next step you're just gonna

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.510 
all right so next step you're just gonna
basically<00:01:12.710> modify<00:01:13.710> your<00:01:14.700> screw<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.750> top<00:01:16.020> so

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
basically modify your screw on top so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.990 
basically modify your screw on top so
obviously<00:01:17.520> mine<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.890> ink<00:01:20.250> will<00:01:20.490> spread<00:01:20.820> out

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
obviously mine the ink will spread out

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.320 
obviously mine the ink will spread out
you<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.840> little<00:01:22.110> hole<00:01:22.380> so

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
you can have this little hole so

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.420 
you can have this little hole so
essentially<00:01:24.330> I'm<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.900> gonna<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.500> cut<00:01:26.250> off

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
essentially I'm just gonna do is cut off

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.859 
essentially I'm just gonna do is cut off
right<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.750> then<00:01:28.650> I'll<00:01:28.890> seal<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.869> all

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
right here and then I'll seal it all

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.690 
right here and then I'll seal it all
right<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.200> next<00:01:31.350> step<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.979> fill<00:01:32.340> your<00:01:32.490> mouth

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
right so next step is to fill your mouth

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.690 
right so next step is to fill your mouth
with<00:01:32.759> whatever<00:01:33.479> ink<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.990> want<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.590> yeah<00:01:35.430> make

in the ink I'm gonna put in this little

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:03.109 
in the ink I'm gonna put in this little
nut<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:54.840> mix<00:01:55.110> around<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:56.479> ink<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.759> don't

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
nut to mix around the ink and you don't

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.999 
nut to mix around the ink and you don't
to<00:02:03.270> fill<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> top<00:02:03.869> never<00:02:04.439> fill<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.860> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
to fill it to the top never fill it to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.389 
to fill it to the top never fill it to
the<00:02:05.040> top<00:02:05.630> because<00:02:06.630> your<00:02:07.290> nib<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:08.040> going<00:02:08.310> to

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the top because your nib is going to

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.570 
the top because your nib is going to
sink<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.820> there<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.530> go<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.950> overflow<00:02:11.549> I

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
sink in there and go just overflow I

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.979 
sink in there and go just overflow I
guess<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.330> yeah<00:02:13.280> all<00:02:14.280> right<00:02:14.489> once<00:02:15.209> our<00:02:15.510> mix<00:02:15.780> is

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
guess so yeah all right once our mix is

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.009 
guess so yeah all right once our mix is
in<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.739> ink<00:02:17.570> first<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:18.750> all<00:02:18.870> I'm<00:02:18.959> just

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
in and the ink first of all I'm just

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:28.540 
in and the ink first of all I'm just
gonna<00:02:19.260> cap<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:20.459> keep<00:02:20.579> it<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.060> spoon

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.500 

now<00:02:29.550> for<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.180> nab<00:02:30.690> show<00:02:30.720> piece<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.770> felt<00:02:32.070> and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
now for the nab show piece of felt and

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.750 
now for the nab show piece of felt and
going<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.710> bend<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.920> with<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:36.500> dinner<00:02:37.760> you

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
going to bend it with that dinner you

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.270 
going to bend it with that dinner you
can<00:02:38.910> squeeze<00:02:39.540> both<00:02:40.230> sides<00:02:40.970> like<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:44.040> just

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
can squeeze both sides like that so just

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:53.660 
can squeeze both sides like that so just
squeeze<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.880> in<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.890> twist<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:53.340> want<00:02:53.550> to

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
squeeze it in and twist you want to

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.440 
squeeze it in and twist you want to
really<00:02:54.330> snug<00:02:54.750> in<00:02:55.050> there<00:02:55.340> because<00:02:56.340> if<00:02:57.180> it's<00:02:57.360> not
