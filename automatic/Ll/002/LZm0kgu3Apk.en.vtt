going red we're gonna stay with the red
so<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.520> pretty<00:00:44.640> cool<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.150> get<00:00:45.300> three<00:00:45.600> rings

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
so it's pretty cool you get three rings

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.870 
so it's pretty cool you get three rings
by<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.830> way<00:00:46.980> inside<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.250> box<00:00:47.490> you<00:00:47.640> get<00:00:47.760> the

by the way inside the box you get the

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.490 
by the way inside the box you get the
white<00:00:48.060> get<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.630> blue<00:00:48.810> and<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.140> get<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> red

installed it push ball config for my
radiator<00:02:41.180> hopefully<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.420> would

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
radiator hopefully this would

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.350 
radiator hopefully this would
drastically<00:02:43.280> reduce<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.459> temperature<00:02:44.760> but

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
drastically reduce the temperature but

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.300 
drastically reduce the temperature but
not<00:02:45.540> drastically<00:02:45.750> I'm<00:02:46.200> not<00:02:46.320> really<00:02:47.130> looking

not drastically I'm not really looking
forward<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.850> but<00:02:48.110> reduce<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.230> noise<00:02:49.380> and

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
forward to it but reduce the noise and

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.410 
forward to it but reduce the noise and
you<00:02:51.060> know<00:02:51.180> increase<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.600> temperature<00:02:52.069> now

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420
