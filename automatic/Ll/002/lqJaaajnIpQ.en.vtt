00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.770
 my loves, how are you? some readers 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.170
 Dear children, they asked me to teach them how to do it. 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.779
 a kitten eyeliner eyeliner in a 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.210
 gel is it during the video I will teach 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.640
 some of people's cottages are practical and 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.960
 I'm sure you guys practice 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.699
 enough you will be able to make a 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.110
 perfect legacy 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:35.720
 we changed one for you to see the effect and 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.480
 Once again, everybody can do it. 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.309
 without practicing and it 's who you want to know and 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.110
 learn this step by step let's stay 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.000
 watching the good video first I want 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.620
 talk some important steps 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.900
 before you begin to do the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.320
 eyeliner kitten here the first thing 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.479
 is beveled brush're it can not be 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.460
 very special here 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.670
 also this dimension of it has to be 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.040
 very thin and the hardest hair 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.100
 than the normal brush I have use of 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.030
 machine and this one is nice frame 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.680
 the two super work out for me is okay 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.750
 because they have just the fur 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.360
 hard and are not so wide here 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.340
 tip brush thickness 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.770
 another thing the eyeliner israel has to 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.930
 be perfect to do it if he 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.930
 have hardened will not work 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.610
 Who has problem with the eyeliner? 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.410
 hardened as ever did the author is 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.780
 Teaching to recover I'll leave the link. 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.240
 here somewhere and then you leave it 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.790
 very exciting for you to do. 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.630
 who has no practice will put 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.940
 the ribbon here and feel the eyebrow 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.490
 Because there you get it right where the 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.100
 kitty has to stay who already has one 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.610
 little practice just wants to improve how 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.230
 I'll show you without the ribbon. 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.780
 well come on first, I'll go 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.659
 spend a lot neither too much 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.750
 little more than an average amount in the 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.700
 zinho brush and the brush must always okay 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.130
 clean no use try this 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.930
 compensates assume that does not work has 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.370
 two ways to start today off in 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.679
 inside out 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.170
 I'd rather start from the outside and 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.659
 I'll sort it later, but it goes from 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.590
 each one does not have a compulsory 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.200
 right sense 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.730
 Let's take one here for you to see now. 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.530
 I'll start by doing 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.900
 river that had made a mark of years 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.900
 but I had not made the tim're come 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.440
 note that it is not possible to use the only 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.790
 once I'm going to pull several rakes and 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.790
 uniting in the other 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.340
 I pulled the little dog that with but did not pull 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.570
 very much otherwise you lose the notion of 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.570
 thickness of such 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.480
 Now I'm going to pull an inner corner 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.480
 and we'll go to the kitten later 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.440
 always starts outlined here and thinner 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.440
 it thickens 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.370
 he still have the money because I just pulled 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.050
 several traits were the mistakes only now I go 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:28.300
 to pass a stroke only at once let him 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.300
 very straight and pretty old 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.650
 It is also now very upright 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.730
 Now we're going to the kitten that I 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.360
 there in my opinion is the most difficult 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.330
 do 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.860
 Who does not like a kitten, I finish here? 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.910
 Makeup done here in the eyes now 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.500
 kitten 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.870
 You have to imagine that the traffic 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.360
 of the lower or 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.670
 eyebrow never felt from now 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.190
 down or your eyes will fall 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.100
 It's in Ottawa, can I have leaned against it? 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.530
 brush that lower lashes and I'll 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.970
 pull the neighbor lawyer as well 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.620
 I'll bring a little hand here too, and I'll 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.100
 pulling up where I want the kitten 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.100
 stay 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:28.180
 It's full now I'm going to need a 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:32.090
 little more outlined in the product 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.190
 I got a little bit of 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.790
 I'm going to unite this little corner here with 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.790
 upside 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.590
 already Nikkei but still not right 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.590
 also 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:18.910
 I will correct the little things to let 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:20.680
 the little pussy here now saw with cotton swab and 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.930
 I 'll do the following to get one. 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:32.080
 snowflake let's get the rest of the year dirty 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:35.640
 I spent here last year and I pull the graph the little pussy 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.640
 very well too 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.790
 running the bidder here 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:55.040
 If you need to fix something 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:57.440
 correct important until the hand well 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.630
 young could be quite right 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.630
 If you want to pull the tip just by pulling 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.530
 Notice that I'm wearing the 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.530
 bevelled brush 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.940
 and now to stay here a finish 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.350
 perfect that takes some corrective 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.140
 any corrective and let's see if that 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:35.120
 It's your own otto mattress 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:37.480
 just soften the swab and end 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.480
 here o 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:06.480
 and an easy way out is ready. 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.120
 Girls and I always say something about 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.100
 connected to a question of practice you do not 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.560
 will be able to make a 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.690
 delineated perfect do not be deceived 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.750
 be who you are has a wonderful gift 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.430
 of makeup with five councilors and some 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.130
 some time to be able to do 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:26.010
 perfect fashion out other side did not go out 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:28.440
 but it's practical people with a lot of 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.810
 Make up, then practice. 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.820
 in front of the mirror trying several times 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.980
 An hour is going to come out, you will succeed. 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.450
 do and will stay perfect is an issue 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.820
 practice is ok 

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.930
 There's no mystery, the technique is that I 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.060
 I taught you 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:44.220
 now to get it right 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.660
 line does not get crooked is practical then the 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.010
 I advise you to practice 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.660
 just type 

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:51.890
 I hope you have enjoyed a 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.890
 Kiss to the next
