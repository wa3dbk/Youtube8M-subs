00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.720
 if then all the kitchen too 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.460
 have returned to the restaurant would like 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.260
 I warmly welcome you now 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.890
 seventh cocktail of the starfish 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.170
 welcome 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.050
 now that the platform is well established 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.430
 is as a stage for the innovative bosses 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.260
 we thought we dare the step 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.970
 also to Berlin and have 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.650
 actually the best people out of the 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.480
 We can also make a city together 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.879
 are immensely happy about it 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.530
 thanks that they are all there 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.809
 Of course, the first applies thanks to the 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.339
 sensational team here from the first floor 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.739
 you have been over the last three days 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.739
 already unimaginable accomplished 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.110
 the landlord , I think today launches 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.910
 insofar we will be enthusiastic 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.770
 leave from rabbit beer onions and 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.190
 help from matthias diether and his 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.380
 team 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.820
 and in this sense a great one 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:37.350
 looks hank and a great exchange 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:39.120
 Thank you very much for being there 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.620
 still a heap of magic magic coolers 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.080
 did not want to get rid of it 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.280
 that's why we have an album we have 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.430
 freshly ordered i like the hypo too 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.440
 because it is a part of fish 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.000
 because the outside is from the place 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.000
 actually pretty down 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.080
 Just as pure the celery in 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.539
 working in a good air cigarettes room 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.780
 just be consistent with that 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.280
 performer inside is at midnight 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.680
 Let's hope for three murders and 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.450
 The result is a raisin-like 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.170
 The winner of the celery has become 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.830
 reduced 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.860
 concentrated and saline naturally 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.410
 extremely intensified and the viscosity 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.390
 is also inconsistent with a type of cheese 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.400
 passed over and it possible that 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.520
 actually that we the sender is very 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.290
 thinly slice still cramming and 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.130
 What the court will you do with this time 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.080
 to join 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.880
 that then they still have vegetables 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.890
 never characterized that a glass of value 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.480
 So not only has a short time but 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.480
 just by this is showing ried becomes 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.430
 especially the before it all the way to all 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.530
 great found 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.450
 whatever is what is independent now 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.050
 of course, it has to give now 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.180
 authoritative 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.700
 that was just sensational though 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.860
 one has already noticed in the beginning of 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.250
 the products and we have together so 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.250
 continue 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.519
 and those are things that you can get in here as well 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.959
 Berlin, for example, also takes place 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.959
 before refreshing with this 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:24.400
 with this chicoree these these rose the 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:27.640
 By the way, in other words right le rose means so 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.379
 similar to the three musketeers and 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.489
 that's just a half wild rose and 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.260
 These are things that grow too 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.790
 actually here all over the parks 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.440
 but of course you always ask yourself 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.330
 Here you can call it so everything 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.860
 Can you reap the food you should eat 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.660
 because we live in a big city 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.440
 everything is very, very 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.420
 polluted but it works 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.579
 really about these ideas and about this 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.709
 input because we are dealing with 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.019
 the subject of berlin was very conscious of that 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.269
 openly formulated the worst 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.040
 approached 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.780
 I also do it in places 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.680
 sometimes a bit hard because 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.129
 I open 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.379
 I do not think Berlin is right now 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.660
 such a region in germany where you where 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.400
 you always pull something out permanently 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.290
 There are so many good ones here 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.930
 things are all still in change 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.579
 and in the morning and in the coming and and it 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.980
 are things that are very good but it 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.349
 It's not like a region where you are 365 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.880
 but days, sonja can do that 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.459
 main problem it actually with the 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.440
 with the products that are just there 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.210
 and once again not even the farmer has 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.130
 what and then I have nothing again 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.229
 and since there anything anyway or 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.820
 only the direct authorities or something 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.770
 So there is still missing at the 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.610
 continuity and that can also be 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.950
 I think just kind of pull in and 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.900
 tearing on both sides come about 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.520
 not the farmer the first after the 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.050
 his money with good quality pass away 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.270
 He can then continue if he 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.610
 that also continuously settle the surrounding area 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.479
 insanely many products 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.259
 but it is relatively difficult the 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.819
 reinzukriegen controlled by berlin 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.409
 somehow, quite a few are 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.810
 small farmers has in upstate to 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:00.090
 plants and many people are concerned with it 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.909
 A lot of effort is made by many farmers 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.409
 organic farmers work long and finish 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.870
 but that is why he is too 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.460
 that about the market halls has somehow 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.879
 that can sometimes be a point of view 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.879
 created 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.040
 be resume 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.790
 extremely positive totally surprised too 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.040
 still very impressed and enthusiastic 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:51.890
 because that's how it is now 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.590
 conclusive conclusion for me and that 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:58.010
 now have twice as people like the 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.620
 Chef of clearly shown that 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.250
 actually every participant and everyone 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.670
 cook has really exemplified 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:10.030
 Restaurant or employer and the kitchen 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.080
 of the house very beautifully presented 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.790
 represented and you could 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.740
 in places taste very good 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.580
 and there were really a few 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.169
 very very much see 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.169
 both of them have come across the air
