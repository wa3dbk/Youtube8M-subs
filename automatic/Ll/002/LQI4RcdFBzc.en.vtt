00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.190
 well it 

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:09.559
 [applause] 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:12.440
 Hello everyone, I sang this part 60 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.240
 minecraft mechanism in this part well it 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.480
 as if the anniversary part but you are not 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.130
 I worry every series which 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.890
 ends on your feet anyway 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.920
 call the pancakes this series will show you such 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.289
 here is the mechanism press the seal 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:31.430
 the door opens and the descent of the mystery yes 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.449
 but then the steps are normal blocks in 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.890
 In general, this door came up with 7b 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.440
 Well, I already did a tutorial on his 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.710
 the mechanism is a simple matter of their in Russian so 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.260
 it is necessary so it is necessary so cool and today 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.049
 I will teach you how to make a system like it 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.409
 the middle looks very compact very 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:55.879
 I do not know how he put it all so 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:57.799
 compact well, let's start all the same 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.820
 that we won't need it here 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:04.909
 will need to move a little bit all i 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.190
 ready means we will do what we do 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:13.789
 will we do will do this door 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:16.579
 it means just a block here is another block 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:20.229
 here is a repeater for 4 here for 1st abel 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:24.350
 here redstone here torch 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:27.439
 redstone here is a torch which is an inversion 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.479
 does like this there rises here two 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.640
 repeater 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:37.460
 here, too, the torch is delayed by 3 blocks 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.229
 put here the piston here the piston signal 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.429
 through the piston will be transmitted not 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.770
 hurting him 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.869
 that is, it will not activate this 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.249
 here it is a torch and then we put it here 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.770
 the piston here like this we go like this 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:57.049
 do then here so here we put on 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:00.920
 3 delay and Peter here for 2 here is how 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.940
 here here so here so here it is necessary 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.160
 do then 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:11.310
 here is sticky piston here is sticky 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.770
 piston and here block m ordinary piston 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.640
 ordinary piston 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:20.850
 sticky sticky sticky sticky sticky sticky 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:24.810
 then here still so with sticky now 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:29.010
 go and didn't want to sneeze me not 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.290
 it turns out so then here we dig here 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.510
 such a hole 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.080
 here so we conduct redstone here repeaters 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.390
 one delay here at 4 here we are all 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.320
 close the case so then we are here 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.130
 Redstone from this unit will be 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:52.010
 energize here delay for 3 here 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:56.700
 delay by 4 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:59.790
 here and here redstone then what to us 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.050
 still need yes like everything seems to be on 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:07.680
 really so here we close here 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:11.430
 so here then here, too, all 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.510
 close and we still need 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.450
 stairs well stairs steps stairs 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.290
 put here on the sticky piston and on this 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.300
 sticky plunger 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:27.930
 oh what's there is no good money 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.700
 do not make it so here we all enter 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.730
 there is this our will be the floor level and 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:41.160
 activation of the system well, let's say like this 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:46.220
 Now we look 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:51.510
 so i am dressed for the film clearly 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:54.180
 3:01 sorry by the way here 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.820
 the delay was accidentally exposed all 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.520
 it is very important not to make a mistake here 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.300
 the delay here when I first saw 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.890
 this door and I built it on the tutorial about 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.290
 first tried to build with me not 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.060
 it turned out then I built there was 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.520
 card description and 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.720
 The link in the map description was a link to 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.340
 map I downloaded it built by 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.720
 even built like that 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.920
 mechanism built then 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.750
 but I still got the Kirov but 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.440
 in general, over time, I learned this 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.140
 do and here you taught and everything is cool then 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.300
 there is like that for work and everything is like 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.300
 usually you can download the link from the map 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.430
 will be in the description if you something 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.390
 incomprehensible, I think you have something left 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.470
 so incomprehensible and not my 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.100
 unprofessional what's bad 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.170
 told the matter is that really 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.600
 a mechanism such a bunch of delays is necessary 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.180
 memorize where some delay costs me 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.480
 you remember you still have it all 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:01.919
 oh well in general as always with you 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:04.200
 I was singing to you today showed awesome 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.030
 the mechanism will continue to be awesome too 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.080
 mechanism and don't forget to subscribe 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:14.419
 if you are still not signed in general 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.419
 Thank you all for watching and all for now.
