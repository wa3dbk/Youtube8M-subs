you a little bit more about it what it
is<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.890> basically<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.430> could<00:01:02.640> run<00:01:02.879> a

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
is is basically you could run a

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.649 
is is basically you could run a
application<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> background<00:01:05.450> i'll<00:01:06.450> give

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
application at the background i'll give

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.140 
application at the background i'll give
you<00:01:06.780> two<00:01:06.990> examples<00:01:07.130> basically<00:01:08.130> plug<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.000> out

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
you two examples basically plug it out

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.780 
you two examples basically plug it out
like<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.780> go<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.200> application<00:01:10.860> log<00:01:11.430> out<00:01:11.670> of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
like so you go to application log out of

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.670 
like so you go to application log out of
that<00:01:11.909> application<00:01:12.090> they'll<00:01:12.630> shut<00:01:12.840> down<00:01:12.869> if

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
that application they'll shut down if

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.679 
that application they'll shut down if
you<00:01:13.799> go<00:01:13.950> back<00:01:14.130> into<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> application<00:01:14.850> you

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
you go back into the application you

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.859 
you go back into the application you
will<00:01:16.170> restart<00:01:17.000> its<00:01:18.000> background<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.720> could

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
will restart its background you could

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.429 
will restart its background you could
exit<00:01:19.259> application<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:20.759> back<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.080> leave

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
exit application go back to it and leave

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.850 
exit application go back to it and leave
off<00:01:23.340> where<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.820> were<00:01:23.939> previously<00:01:24.360> at<00:01:24.960> before

off where you were previously at before

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.710 
off where you were previously at before
you<00:01:25.950> exit<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.430> out<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.330> kind<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.600> like

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
you exit it out so it's kind of like

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.870 
you exit it out so it's kind of like
