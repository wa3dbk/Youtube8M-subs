00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.340
 the roof we have for a tile 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:18.790
 basically because of its low 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.020
 cost and easy application to facilitation 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.730
 her 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.359
 we run two metal scissors and 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.990
 orientation of the tile on the roof 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:35.730
 we will try to better suit the wind and 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.730
 solar orientation at this location 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.449
 in football the group chose the material is 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.559
 as the color of garlic which is the most 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.839
 cheap 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.670
 will be placed for channel enclosure 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.309
 and for dividing the area into an area 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.769
 vaccination and an idea area 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.299
 the yarns shall be placed with spacing 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.789
 of 20 centimeters 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:59.549
 the group also suggested the placement of 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.829
 three because it was made of wood and one 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:04.350
 direction and one at the end that will be the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.229
 vaccination for better management of 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.119
 animals and one in that direction to 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.119
 every skirt of milking 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.260
 due to the instability of the 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.170
 people chose to make a sidewalk in the 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.870
 I cry all over to try and hold 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.780
 a little rain water and also water 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.100
 that descends from the eaves of the roof on canvas to 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.190
 she has to be bigger than the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.770
 eyepiece and will accompany a woman had 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.729
 only in the front but they and the 40 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.710
 centimeters to help and the sidewalk 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.130
 half of this Mourinho does not fall because 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.500
 will have a foundation around which 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.090
 starts full of earth and chooses to plant 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.280
 to try to help this 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.410
 infiltration of water as and did not 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.570
 too much trouble with the flood 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.300
 remembering the corral will not have 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.979
 completed on laying floor will be the 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.030
 gives way here so we have to 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.140
 make these structures to achieve 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.090
 greater hygiene of the site 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.039
 is just after milking so the books 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.810
 be separated 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.709
 we suggest building 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:18.390
 hutch housing that this region of the back 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.670
 of the corral are those mistakes are ok is 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.580
 small constructions of wood and this 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.879
 wood it can be harvested from the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.390
 own property and within the 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:33.030
 of this heifer has drums of 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.180
 plastic that can be used as 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.299
 feeding and water thighs and for 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.150
 coverage for a better one is the best 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:46.170
 thermal comfort of the calf is to be 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.440
 done in the direction that is protecting the 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.349
 sun now only makes this movement and sets 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.730
 there then the coverage would be in that direction 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.709
 for the best comfort 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.920
 another thing to improve comfort 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.049
 to consider is the deployment of 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.150
 planting trees is among the 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.500
 warriors who over time will also 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.530
 provide better comfort and beyond 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.720
 should be done on average 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.519
 155 warriors with is can is to increase 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.470
 the number of warriors during the 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.470
 time because there is space for construction
