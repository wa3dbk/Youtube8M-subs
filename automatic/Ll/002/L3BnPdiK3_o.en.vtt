on<00:00:04.900> my<00:00:05.900> other<00:00:06.050> video<00:00:06.440> that<00:00:06.650> explains<00:00:07.100> how<00:00:07.250> to

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
on my other video that explains how to

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.010 
on my other video that explains how to
connect<00:00:07.970> your<00:00:08.060> power<00:00:08.360> system<00:00:08.630> on<00:00:08.900> your

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:09.020 
connect your power system on your

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.660 
connect your power system on your
multicopter<00:00:09.710> I've<00:00:09.889> had<00:00:10.100> a<00:00:10.130> question<00:00:10.309> about

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
multicopter I've had a question about

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.930 
multicopter I've had a question about
how<00:00:11.030> you<00:00:11.059> connect<00:00:11.660> Optio<00:00:12.320> speed<00:00:13.309> controllers

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
how you connect Optio speed controllers

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
how you connect Optio speed controllers
and<00:00:14.410> becs<00:00:15.410> to<00:00:15.770> the<00:00:15.860> boards<00:00:16.420> so<00:00:17.420> rather<00:00:17.660> than

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
and becs to the boards so rather than

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.050 
and becs to the boards so rather than
try<00:00:18.320> and<00:00:18.470> explain<00:00:18.830> it<00:00:18.890> in<00:00:19.220> words<00:00:19.340> I<00:00:19.850> thought

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
try and explain it in words I thought

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.939 
try and explain it in words I thought
I'd<00:00:20.240> make<00:00:20.390> a<00:00:20.420> very<00:00:20.720> quick<00:00:21.080> little<00:00:21.260> video<00:00:21.439> to

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
I'd make a very quick little video to

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.689 
I'd make a very quick little video to
explain<00:00:22.220> how<00:00:22.580> it's<00:00:22.760> done<00:00:23.679> the<00:00:24.679> power<00:00:24.949> for<00:00:25.640> the

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
explain how it's done the power for the

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.609 
explain how it's done the power for the
boards<00:00:26.090> whether<00:00:26.449> it's<00:00:26.689> something<00:00:26.990> like<00:00:27.080> a<00:00:27.140> KK

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
boards whether it's something like a KK

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.499 
boards whether it's something like a KK
2.0<00:00:28.339> or<00:00:28.609> a<00:00:28.910> multi<00:00:29.480> we<00:00:29.679> actually<00:00:30.679> comes<00:00:31.009> from

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
2.0 or a multi we actually comes from

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.459 
2.0 or a multi we actually comes from
the<00:00:32.950> receiver<00:00:33.950> or<00:00:34.220> from<00:00:35.150> the<00:00:35.480> B<00:00:35.660> EC<00:00:36.079> that's

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
the receiver or from the B EC that's

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.060 
the receiver or from the B EC that's
integrated<00:00:37.039> into<00:00:37.930> the<00:00:38.930> electronic<00:00:39.770> speed

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
integrated into the electronic speed

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.090 
integrated into the electronic speed
controller<00:00:40.520> that<00:00:40.910> run<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.239> motors<00:00:41.600> so<00:00:41.840> if<00:00:42.770> you

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
controller that run the motors so if you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.520 
controller that run the motors so if you
haven't<00:00:43.309> watched<00:00:43.730> my<00:00:43.940> other<00:00:44.270> video<00:00:44.600> about<00:00:44.870> how

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
haven't watched my other video about how

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.990 
haven't watched my other video about how
you<00:00:45.590> connect<00:00:46.100> power<00:00:46.340> systems<00:00:46.850> in

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
you connect power systems in

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000 
you connect power systems in
multicopters<00:00:47.719> have<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.260> look<00:00:48.440> at<00:00:48.590> that<00:00:48.739> first

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
multicopters have a look at that first

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.799 
multicopters have a look at that first
if<00:00:49.309> what<00:00:49.760> I've<00:00:49.879> just<00:00:49.910> said<00:00:50.270> doesn't<00:00:50.690> make

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
if what I've just said doesn't make

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.950 
if what I've just said doesn't make
sense<00:00:51.789> but<00:00:52.789> if<00:00:52.910> you<00:00:53.030> have<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:53.600> you're<00:00:53.719> looking

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
sense but if you have and you're looking

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.250 
sense but if you have and you're looking
at<00:00:54.079> this<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:55.160> way<00:00:55.190> that<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:56.230> machine<00:00:57.230> is

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
at this the way that the machine is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.849 
at this the way that the machine is
actually<00:00:57.530> powered<00:00:58.070> is<00:00:59.320> normally<00:01:00.320> from<00:01:00.680> the

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
actually powered is normally from the

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.040 
actually powered is normally from the
speed<00:01:01.070> controller<00:01:01.550> so<00:01:02.179> you<00:01:02.239> plug<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.899> battery

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
speed controller so you plug the battery

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.410 
speed controller so you plug the battery
in<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.590> one<00:01:03.769> side<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:04.370> then<00:01:04.970> this<00:01:05.239> little

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
in to one side and then this little

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.460 
in to one side and then this little
flying<00:01:05.870> lead<00:01:06.170> which<00:01:07.330> takes<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.720> control

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
flying lead which takes the control

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.890 
flying lead which takes the control
signal<00:01:10.009> from<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:10.610> board<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.450> it's<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.689> same

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
signal from the board and it's the same

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.060 
signal from the board and it's the same
on<00:01:12.110> both<00:01:12.369> down<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.580> little<00:01:13.700> white<00:01:14.090> wire<00:01:14.420> also

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
on both down the little white wire also

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.390 
on both down the little white wire also
supplies<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.610> board<00:01:16.880> itself<00:01:17.330> with<00:01:18.020> power

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
supplies the board itself with power

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.460 
supplies the board itself with power
using<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.640> black<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.180> red<00:01:20.210> wires<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.110> if<00:01:21.880> the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
using the black and red wires and if the

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.929 
using the black and red wires and if the
circuit<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:24.619> supplies<00:01:25.009> that<00:01:25.310> power<00:01:25.579> which

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
circuit that supplies that power which

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.999 
circuit that supplies that power which
is<00:01:26.090> called<00:01:26.299> a<00:01:26.390> battery<00:01:26.869> eliminator<00:01:27.170> circuit

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
is called a battery eliminator circuit

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.240 
is called a battery eliminator circuit
is<00:01:28.159> linear<00:01:29.090> in<00:01:29.540> these<00:01:29.840> things<00:01:30.140> then<00:01:30.740> you<00:01:31.009> just

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
is linear in these things then you just

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.789 
is linear in these things then you just
plug<00:01:31.460> them<00:01:31.610> all<00:01:31.790> in<00:01:32.000> if<00:01:32.380> they're<00:01:33.380> switched

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
plug them all in if they're switched

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.240 
plug them all in if they're switched
then<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:35.030> just<00:01:35.299> plug<00:01:35.600> one<00:01:36.200> of<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.799> leads<00:01:37.009> in

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
then you just plug one of the leads in

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.780 
then you just plug one of the leads in
and<00:01:37.520> in<00:01:37.939> all<00:01:38.210> of<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.570> other<00:01:38.720> leads<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.860> pick

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
and in all of the other leads you pick

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.469 
and in all of the other leads you pick
up<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.390> pin<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:41.930> withdraw<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.979> red<00:01:43.729> cable

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
up the pin and withdraw the red cable

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.690 
up the pin and withdraw the red cable
because<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:45.079> way<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.799> signal<00:01:46.100> is<00:01:46.430> still

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
because that way the signal is still

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.580 
because that way the signal is still
able<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:47.060> reach<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.600> speed<00:01:47.810> controller<00:01:48.259> on

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
able to reach the speed controller on

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.450 
able to reach the speed controller on
the<00:01:48.619> motor<00:01:48.939> but<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.810> power<00:01:51.259> isn't<00:01:51.680> been<00:01:52.009> taken

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
the motor but the power isn't been taken

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.639 
the motor but the power isn't been taken
just<00:01:52.729> from<00:01:52.850> one<00:01:53.030> of<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.180> controllers<00:01:53.750> however

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
just from one of the controllers however

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.880 
just from one of the controllers however
with<00:01:55.009> an<00:01:55.100> opto<00:01:55.729> speed<00:01:56.299> controller<00:01:56.750> there's<00:01:57.469> no

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
with an opto speed controller there's no

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.980 
with an opto speed controller there's no
battery<00:01:58.430> eliminator<00:01:58.579> circuit<00:01:59.420> so<00:01:59.659> although

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
battery eliminator circuit so although

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.590 
battery eliminator circuit so although
it<00:02:00.170> has<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.530> three<00:02:00.770> wires<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.850> doesn't<00:02:02.270> supply

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
it has the three wires it doesn't supply

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.490 
it has the three wires it doesn't supply
any<00:02:03.049> power<00:02:03.320> to<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.250> board<00:02:04.490> itself<00:02:05.170> so<00:02:06.170> what<00:02:06.380> do

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
any power to the board itself so what do

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.749 
any power to the board itself so what do
you<00:02:06.560> do<00:02:06.740> in<00:02:06.979> that<00:02:07.009> situation

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
you do in that situation

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.359 
you do in that situation
well<00:02:08.450> in<00:02:08.660> that<00:02:08.899> situation<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.800> need<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.190> use

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
well in that situation you need to use

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.960 
well in that situation you need to use
something<00:02:10.700> called<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.870> battery<00:02:12.470> eliminator

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
something called a battery eliminator

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.320 
something called a battery eliminator
now<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.300> has<00:02:14.630> yu-baek<00:02:15.410> written<00:02:15.830> on<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.070> or

eliminate<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.140> circuit<00:02:18.650> there's<00:02:18.890> lots<00:02:19.040> of

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
eliminate a circuit there's lots of

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.680 
eliminate a circuit there's lots of
different<00:02:19.430> names<00:02:19.610> for<00:02:19.910> them<00:02:20.090> but<00:02:20.270> they<00:02:20.360> all<00:02:20.510> do

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
different names for them but they all do

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.240 
different names for them but they all do
the<00:02:20.810> same<00:02:20.840> thing<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:22.280> thing<00:02:22.340> has<00:02:24.250> three

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
the same thing and this thing has three

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.339 
the same thing and this thing has three
wires<00:02:25.489> on<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.760> really<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.810> have<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.140> positive

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
wires on it really you have the positive

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.430 
wires on it really you have the positive
and<00:02:27.980> negative<00:02:28.550> on<00:02:28.819> one<00:02:29.090> side<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.810> goes<00:02:30.080> into

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
and negative on one side that goes into

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.020 
and negative on one side that goes into
your<00:02:30.709> power<00:02:30.950> system<00:02:31.430> on<00:02:31.580> your<00:02:31.670> model

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
your power system on your model

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.809 
your power system on your model
typically<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.050> battery<00:02:33.470> connection<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.220> on

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
typically the battery connection and on

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.449 
typically the battery connection and on
the<00:02:34.970> other<00:02:35.120> end<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.959> has<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.650> connector<00:02:37.190> that

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
the other end it has the connector that

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.300 
the other end it has the connector that
goes<00:02:37.730> into<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.510> equipment<00:02:39.019> so<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.980> question

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
goes into the equipment so the question

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.390 
goes into the equipment so the question
is<00:02:40.459> where<00:02:40.849> do<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.209> plug<00:02:41.420> this<00:02:41.690> bit<00:02:41.930> in<00:02:42.080> then<00:02:42.400> in

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
is where do you plug this bit in then in

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.509 
is where do you plug this bit in then in
all<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.940> these<00:02:44.030> different<00:02:44.209> bits<00:02:44.569> and<00:02:44.690> pieces

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
all of these different bits and pieces

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.479 
all of these different bits and pieces
the<00:02:46.519> answer<00:02:46.940> is<00:02:47.530> pretty<00:02:48.530> much<00:02:48.680> anywhere<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.370> be

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
the answer is pretty much anywhere to be

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.500 
the answer is pretty much anywhere to be
fair<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:50.569> can<00:02:51.049> connect<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.120> spare

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
fair you can connect it to a spare

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.370 
fair you can connect it to a spare
Channel<00:02:53.989> in<00:02:54.170> your<00:02:54.500> receiver<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.870> then<00:02:56.870> the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
Channel in your receiver and then the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.860 
Channel in your receiver and then the
other<00:02:57.530> cables<00:02:58.130> that<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.400> use<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:59.480> connect

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
other cables that you use to connect

other cables that you use to connect
your<00:03:00.230> receiver<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:01.130> your<00:03:02.090> board<00:03:02.690> will<00:03:03.620> then

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
your receiver to your board will then

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.289 
your receiver to your board will then
actually<00:03:04.310> transfer<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.209> power<00:03:05.950> or<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:08.000> can

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
actually transfer the power or you can

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.820 
actually transfer the power or you can
plug<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.410> B<00:03:09.590> EC<00:03:10.299> directly<00:03:11.299> into<00:03:12.200> one<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.739> the

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
used so for example on this kk 2.0

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.160 
used so for example on this kk 2.0
what<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:21.560> said<00:03:22.280> it's<00:03:22.850> a<00:03:22.970> multi-week<00:03:23.329> 2.5<00:03:23.870> board

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
what I said it's a multi-week 2.5 board

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.620 
what I said it's a multi-week 2.5 board
these<00:03:24.920> are<00:03:24.980> all<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.910> connectors<00:03:26.420> at<00:03:26.540> the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
these are all the connectors at the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.150 
these are all the connectors at the
bottom<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:28.459> can<00:03:28.640> see<00:03:28.880> that<00:03:29.090> it's<00:03:29.269> marked

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
bottom and you can see that it's marked

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.729 
bottom and you can see that it's marked
negative<00:03:31.160> positive<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.329> signal<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.200> those

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
negative positive and signal and those

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.280 
negative positive and signal and those
positive<00:03:34.069> and<00:03:34.730> negative<00:03:35.359> lines<00:03:35.660> are<00:03:35.930> all

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
positive and negative lines are all

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.620 
positive and negative lines are all
connected<00:03:36.920> together<00:03:37.069> so<00:03:37.910> it<00:03:38.060> doesn't<00:03:38.359> matter

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
connected together so it doesn't matter

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.530 
connected together so it doesn't matter
where<00:03:39.620> I<00:03:39.950> plug<00:03:40.250> this<00:03:40.400> in<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:41.150> long<00:03:41.180> as<00:03:41.420> I

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
where I plug this in so long as I

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.920 
where I plug this in so long as I
observe<00:03:41.900> polarity<00:03:42.109> I<00:03:42.739> can<00:03:43.700> plug<00:03:43.880> in<00:03:44.060> any<00:03:44.329> one

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
observe polarity I can plug in any one

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.770 
observe polarity I can plug in any one
of<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.200> connections<00:03:45.769> that<00:03:46.069> are<00:03:46.639> free<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.299> it

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
of the connections that are free and it

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.150 
of the connections that are free and it
will<00:03:47.959> supply<00:03:48.350> power<00:03:48.889> to<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.670> board<00:03:49.910> basically

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
will supply power to the board basically

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.979 
will supply power to the board basically
replacing<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.430> B<00:03:52.579> EC<00:03:52.970> that's<00:03:53.600> no<00:03:53.810> longer

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
replacing the B EC that's no longer

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.059 
replacing the B EC that's no longer
available<00:03:54.260> in<00:03:54.889> the<00:03:55.190> Optio<00:03:55.670> speed<00:03:56.090> controller

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.830 
available in the Optio speed controller
so<00:03:58.069> just<00:03:58.579> to<00:03:58.670> recap<00:03:58.850> on<00:03:59.180> that<00:03:59.359> if<00:03:59.480> we<00:03:59.569> do<00:03:59.690> that

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
so just to recap on that if we do that

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.590 
so just to recap on that if we do that
in<00:03:59.930> a<00:04:00.019> diagram<00:04:00.549> so<00:04:01.549> here's<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.880> diagram<00:04:02.090> from

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
in a diagram so here's the diagram from

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.990 
in a diagram so here's the diagram from
the<00:04:02.720> previous<00:04:03.290> video<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:03.799> again<00:04:04.400> if<00:04:04.579> this

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
the previous video and again if this

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.550 
the previous video and again if this
looks<00:04:05.209> complicated<00:04:05.359> to<00:04:05.900> you<00:04:06.049> don't<00:04:06.350> worry

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
looks complicated to you don't worry

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.099 
looks complicated to you don't worry
just<00:04:06.950> look<00:04:07.160> at<00:04:07.280> my<00:04:07.400> other<00:04:07.519> video<00:04:07.880> I'll<00:04:08.269> put<00:04:08.870> the

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
just look at my other video I'll put the

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.020 
just look at my other video I'll put the
clickable<00:04:09.980> link<00:04:10.190> at<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.400> bottom<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.819> the

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
clickable link at the bottom of the

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.590 
clickable link at the bottom of the
screen<00:04:11.269> here<00:04:11.389> so<00:04:11.900> you<00:04:11.959> get<00:04:12.350> to<00:04:12.530> it<00:04:13.269> here's<00:04:14.269> the

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
screen here so you get to it here's the

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.090 
screen here so you get to it here's the
B<00:04:14.959> EC<00:04:15.669> and<00:04:16.669> one<00:04:16.970> end<00:04:17.120> of<00:04:17.269> it<00:04:17.419> you<00:04:17.750> connect<00:04:18.229> into

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
B EC and one end of it you connect into

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.570 
B EC and one end of it you connect into
the<00:04:19.510> power<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:20.810> you<00:04:21.289> do<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.650> anywhere<00:04:22.370> on

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
the power and you do that anywhere on

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.950 
the power and you do that anywhere on
the<00:04:22.700> power<00:04:22.880> system<00:04:23.120> where<00:04:23.570> there<00:04:23.750> is<00:04:23.840> the

battery to the model or
it<00:04:31.370> could<00:04:31.580> be<00:04:31.900> jumping<00:04:32.900> off<00:04:33.139> one<00:04:33.710> of<00:04:33.980> the

board and then the other side is easiest

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.500 
board and then the other side is easiest
to<00:04:40.280> just<00:04:40.310> plug<00:04:40.700> it<00:04:40.850> into<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.260> receiver

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
to just plug it into the the receiver

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.990 
to just plug it into the the receiver
the<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:44.690> power<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.080> receiver<00:04:45.440> or<00:04:45.770> to<00:04:46.610> the

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
the to power the receiver or to the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.720 
the to power the receiver or to the

spare motor channel that you're not

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.360 
spare motor channel that you're not
using<00:04:53.260> so<00:04:54.260> hopefully<00:04:54.560> that<00:04:54.710> makes<00:04:54.740> sense

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370
