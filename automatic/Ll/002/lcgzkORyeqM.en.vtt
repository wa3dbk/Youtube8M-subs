00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
one spot goes to maps is the most

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.880 
one spot goes to maps is the most
important<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.079> weapons<00:02:36.409> how<00:02:36.530> they<00:02:36.680> feel

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
important and weapons how they feel

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
game learned from their mistakes and

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.829 
game learned from their mistakes and
it's<00:05:46.069> not<00:05:46.219> gonna<00:05:46.339> be<00:05:46.520> a<00:05:46.550> laser<00:05:46.879> beam<00:05:47.150> show<00:05:47.360> from

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:47.839 
it's not gonna be a laser beam show from

the people that played they told me that

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.339 
the people that played they told me that

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
code 3 ghost does have recoil and that's

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.379 
code 3 ghost does have recoil and that's
a<00:05:54.469> major<00:05:54.680> plus<00:05:54.949> for<00:05:55.069> me<00:05:55.279> know<00:05:55.909> it<00:05:56.000> sounds<00:05:56.210> crazy

everybody wants their laser weapons I
like<00:05:58.550> recoil<00:05:58.940> on<00:05:59.060> weapons<00:05:59.449> I<00:05:59.629> really<00:05:59.960> do<00:06:00.190> it

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
like recoil on weapons I really do it

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.800 
like recoil on weapons I really do it
gives<00:06:01.430> a<00:06:01.669> little<00:06:01.819> bit<00:06:01.969> more<00:06:02.150> challenge<00:06:02.629> and

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
gives a little bit more challenge and

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.029 
gives a little bit more challenge and
sometimes<00:06:03.169> if<00:06:03.349> you<00:06:03.440> can't<00:06:03.650> control<00:06:03.770> the

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
sometimes if you can't control the

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.730 
sometimes if you can't control the
recoil<00:06:04.610> the<00:06:05.360> blame<00:06:05.629> flag<00:06:06.050> or<00:06:06.289> something<00:06:06.589> else

in<00:06:06.830> the<00:06:06.889> hall<00:06:06.979> it's<00:06:07.159> just<00:06:07.430> the<00:06:07.520> recoil<00:06:07.879> you

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
in the hall it's just the recoil you

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.579 
in the hall it's just the recoil you
don't<00:06:08.509> know<00:06:08.569> how<00:06:08.659> to<00:06:08.690> control<00:06:08.900> it<00:06:09.139> and<00:06:09.379> that's

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:09.589 
don't know how to control it and that's

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:11.019 
don't know how to control it and that's
a<00:06:09.710> control<00:06:10.190> it<00:06:10.279> and<00:06:10.400> that's<00:06:10.550> a<00:06:10.639> cool<00:06:10.759> addition

section below guys what do you think
about<00:06:15.889> weapons<00:06:16.430> hopefully<00:06:17.240> they're<00:06:17.389> going<00:06:17.539> to

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
about weapons hopefully they're going to

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.240 
about weapons hopefully they're going to
be<00:06:17.690> balanced<00:06:18.169> hopefully<00:06:18.560> we<00:06:18.680> get<00:06:18.830> to<00:06:19.129> know

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
be balanced hopefully we get to know

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.309 
be balanced hopefully we get to know
each<00:06:19.460> weapon<00:06:19.879> and<00:06:20.270> we<00:06:20.779> can<00:06:20.900> use<00:06:21.050> them<00:06:21.199> all

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 
each weapon and we can use them all

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:24.339 
each weapon and we can use them all
because<00:06:21.560> they're<00:06:21.969> gonna<00:06:22.969> be<00:06:23.120> usable<00:06:23.539> and

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
because they're gonna be usable and
