00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.060
 One year 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.400
 Carried 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.579
 UN to research and develop 1819 wide hydrogen vehicles 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:18.850
 We have been uplifted hydride hydrogen car hydrogen and gasoline 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.550
 Use of mixed fuel to improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon dioxide emissions 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.849
 Can expect 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.849
 same 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.670
 Hydrogen is used in fuel cell vehicles but it is not associated with air 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.950
 To intensify when ignited by Kana-static electricity-2503 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.860
 It must be stolen and so on 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.280
 There was an aspect that handling was difficult 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.450
 In contrast to this 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.410
 It is a combined organic compound organic hydride in the water tank 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.630
 Because it can be stored even at room temperature evaporation, it is safe to produce hydrogen as well 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.490
 It is easy to separate 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.160
 Switzerland plays the role of the agent for many years Gasoline burns efficiently 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
 To do 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.930
 End 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.690
 What has been released this time to Ashiya leaders 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.740
 gasoline engine 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.689
 It will increase by 1 to 3% to 5% so far 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 About 30% low fuel consumption and low resonance may occur 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.990
 Digitized eco cars 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.619
 Mr. Masamichi was able to do during the two years that the House of Representatives constant number 45 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.720
 I think that 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.780
 Must arrive 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.420
 Mass-produced cars compared to fuel cell cars and hydrogen cars 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.100
 Next-generation fuel vehicles that can be used at low prices 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.100
 is 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:49.900
 Launched in the second half
