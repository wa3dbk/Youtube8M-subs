00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
I guess we can start off with the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.069 
I guess we can start off with the
Duelist<00:00:34.829> Genesis<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.510> little<00:00:36.510> bit<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.719> glare

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
Duelist Genesis a little bit of a glare

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.049
