wrap off of it and you can see basically
all<00:00:26.830> this<00:00:27.189> hardware<00:00:27.640> it's<00:00:27.789> already<00:00:28.240> puts<00:00:28.449> off

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
all this hardware it's already puts off

all this hardware it's already puts off
although<00:00:28.810> all<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.769> knobs<00:00:29.949> everything's

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
although all the knobs everything's

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.509 
although all the knobs everything's
connected<00:00:30.939> all<00:00:31.599> we<00:00:31.869> did<00:00:32.080> was<00:00:32.230> just<00:00:32.519> connect

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:33.519 
connected all we did was just connect

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:35.189 
connected all we did was just connect
the<00:00:33.610> shower<00:00:33.850> one<00:00:34.120> that<00:00:34.390> just<00:00:34.540> tightens<00:00:34.900> just

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
the shower one that just tightens just

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.759 
the shower one that just tightens just
like<00:00:35.410> that<00:00:35.710> and<00:00:36.600> these<00:00:37.600> faucet<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.620> just

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
like that and these faucet and just

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:40.670 
like that and these faucet and just
screws<00:00:39.070> that<00:00:39.190> right<00:00:39.430> on<00:00:39.640> and<00:00:39.910> probably<00:00:40.330> took

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
screws that right on and probably took

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.619 
screws that right on and probably took
approximately<00:00:41.680> maybe<00:00:42.520> 30<00:00:42.940> seconds<00:00:43.420> to

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
approximately maybe 30 seconds to

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.830 
approximately maybe 30 seconds to
connect<00:00:43.930> these<00:00:44.050> two<00:00:44.140> pieces<00:00:45.300> other<00:00:46.300> than<00:00:46.629> that

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
connect these two pieces other than that

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.020 
connect these two pieces other than that
that's<00:00:47.440> really<00:00:47.890> it<00:00:48.219> for<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.610> general
