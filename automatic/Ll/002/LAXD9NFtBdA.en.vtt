00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.280
 focus 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.080
 those needs that

 entrepreneurs have subsequently 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.880
 important of the job has been this 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.250
 collaboration with femsa because together with 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.500
 we have been able to build many of 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.110
 the dreams that as a community we have a 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.580
 social entrepreneur would be that person 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:33.940
 that takes away the fear of doing something that 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.580
 is going to support its congeners that is going to 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.040
 support your company a venture 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.840
 a social enterprise is also attacking 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.550
 a social problem but has a 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.700
 business model entrepreneurship 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.620
 social is to create a proposal 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.810
 of value only in your product but that the 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:55.270
 community take something from you and something that 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.980
 you are giving them the satisfactory 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.410
 that we look for how we have a 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.100
 sense of transcendence we can leave 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.100
 a fingerprint that can come to believe it 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.340
 that you can come to understand that you 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.400
 mission here is to leave a better world I think 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.739
 that there has to be a base like a 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.140
 foundation that you believe in something for 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.150
 start creating we believe that 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.900
 create those opportunities for 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.850
 social entrepreneurs will result in 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.709
 this transformation that we were 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.709
 looking for our communities
