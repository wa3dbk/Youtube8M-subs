00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.270
 thank u crisis who baby joy 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.110
 Have you heard about this game? 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.970
 called deter or the cinema 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.550
 I think it's probably not because 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.190
 it seems that there are only a few 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.830
 reports about this game over the web 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.739
 But anyway, there goes the story 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.040
 for those interested 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.730
 It seems that this one from you has been released in 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.309
 1993 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.980
 the few and discounted a game came with 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.739
 only a low quality sprite of 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.299
 one such ticket booklet printed a disc and 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.830
 nothing more enrolled 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.049
 although this ticket office does not have 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.420
 some expression says that in case you 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.909
 intentionally break the disc. 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.990
 face of the sport is to change with a 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.680
 angry expression but few confirm 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.229
 that 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.840
 the game seemed to have some difficulty 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.790
 to be installed since the reports 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.939
 always mention that the computer 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.040
 it was time to show the option 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.409
 you agree to the terms of use being that 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.720
 to move on would require 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.650
 restart with cd still inside the 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.079
 computer 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.030
 then everything is normally follow omd 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.840
 installation had stopped without problem 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.329
 some 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.280
 after installation the game would start 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:49.149
 alone and would already go to the main menu 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.090
 and apparent introduction - it would work well 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.179
 simple with just the new game options 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.249
 long game and a pichanchÃ£o present 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.560
 followed by an image showing the 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:02.249
 outside of a cinema a city 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.990
 apparently empty with plane b with a 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:07.299
 load game would not work and one 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.819
 would only stop and leave the 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:13.120
 game making nobody the only option 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.370
 used a strange thing is the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.130
 name of the producer of the game that 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.410
 was deleted from the menu. 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.180
 some say that the same thing happened in the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.630
 installation screen where the name of the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.500
 producer simply does not exist anymore 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.709
 returning 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.080
 they say the game was in first person 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.630
 your character would be inside the 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.940
 which seems to be the corridor that would take 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.770
 to the movie room behind you 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.230
 there is a glass door 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.830
 by walls there would be posters of 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.930
 movies 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.660
 and at the end of the corridor the ticket clerk 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.510
 would be waiting next to an entrance 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.550
 completely black come near the 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.890
 would make a clip 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.560
 low quality sound 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.350
 Saying thanks, I hope you enjoy it. 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.720
 movie to play and when entering the room 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.420
 side would take the player to the same place 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.330
 where the game had started early in the 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.690
 corridor and then this process is 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.030
 repeat over and over again 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.560
 although it seems repetitive, it is there that the 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.170
 things are strange 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.330
 those who played the game say that 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.350
 each time the player entered the room 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.400
 dark 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:28.480
 the game would have something around one in 400 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.890
 Sometimes for something different to happen 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.640
 this different 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.010
 was what made many players stay 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.070
 disturbed by what seems 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.020
 if the player was lucky and activated 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.260
 this special occasion when entering the room 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.060
 the player again would go back down the hall 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.880
 But the ticket would not be the 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.700
 you would then enter the room normally 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.310
 but instead of being taken to the beginning of the 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.709
 same runner you would always 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.290
 walking through apparently dark pack 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.780
 without end and feeling great discomfort 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.180
 until an hour would come when you 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.970
 would simply stop walking and more 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.670
 nothing seemed to happen after some 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.790
 seconds what the players called 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.280
 man swirl head man 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.730
 swirl that would apparently be the 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.590
 ticket office with spiral taste 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.810
 would appear in front of him with a 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.820
 extremely irritating sound 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.270
 the players tell that at that moment 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.550
 they were paralyzed feeling this 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.450
 that comes with a certain package in the 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.220
 stomach 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.310
 the swirling man was not going to do 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.500
 exactly nothing just standing still 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.080
 next to a sound that did not seem to end 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.690
 until a time comes when the screen 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.250
 it would turn black and the player would appear in the 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.890
 same place forever 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.120
 however, even the ticket clerk in his 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.729
 place 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.139
 everything would then continue normally 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:56.090
 although some people say what 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.449
 it would be common to see the man swirl 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.550
 appearing rapidly in the corner of the screen 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.050
 along with a kind of redhead or something 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.080
 like 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.749
 if the player was again lucky and 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.569
 I was able to activate a new event 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:13.520
 he would return to the same place as always 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:16.490
 but this time the express and ticket 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.159
 team and jumping in the middle of the 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.469
 posters would be exchanged for images of 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:24.710
 man of mine who according to the reports 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:27.529
 caused a certain nuisance in players 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.229
 when he got close to the ticket clerk he would 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:32.330
 produce a new sound clip that despite 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.050
 of not knowing exactly what 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.629
 treats 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.629
 because of the low quality many 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:41.770
 players agree that it says no scope 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:45.169
 the other levels or something of the type 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.569
 then it would turn black and the player 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.779
 would go back to the usual place again 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:54.169
 but this time at the end of the corridor 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:56.360
 there is only one brick wall and the 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.870
 playing the game would simply stop 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.789
 and shut strangely all 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.689
 players say they could not 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:08.060
 pass from that point but still if 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:10.520
 the agency's interpretation is correct and 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.439
 The ticket clerk actually said no 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.509
 reach the other levels 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.409
 he doubts what he would have in those other 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:17.569
 levels 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.620
 and because the ticket clerk would be giving you 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:21.409
 this abyss 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.960
 unless he and a whirlpool are 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:26.509
 different people and the ticket office is 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.159
 trying to avoid something 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:31.279
 some reports say that it is possible 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:33.860
 randomly access other rooms as 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:36.319
 one with a popcorn cart and another 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.379
 with a character smiling and looking 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:42.199
 bizarre but none of them would cause more 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:44.930
 damage than head-to-head encounters . 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:47.629
 swirl where only his presence 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.980
 would cause this strange sensation of 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:52.010
 players 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:55.100
 although apparently all copies 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.840
 originals of the game have been destroyed 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.750
 you never know what you can find 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:03.320
 on these benches out there or a camelot 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:05.150
 Anyway, if you can find 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.100
 some copy of this game 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.250
 I think you'd better think well before 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.800
 play because for some reason the 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.890
 players say that shortly after the 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.070
 game is very common to have the sensation of seeing 

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:22.300
 the image of the swirling man 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.300
 corner of your vision 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:34.620
 Wow, I kind of just got disconnected from the world. 

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:38.099
 Last week the fucking starr band and 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:40.710
 school period also began 

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:43.710
 How crappy of mine? 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:46.319
 If you liked or did not like this video, you can 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.270
 leave your criticism around here believe 

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:50.490
 It will be very good for me. 

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.559
 if you want you can also choose some 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:56.699
 thumbnail that will take you to 

00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:58.080
 other i channel videos i hope 

00:07:56.699 --> 00:08:01.169
 have enjoyed this video 

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.409
 that was the way land and even another 

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:03.409
 hour
