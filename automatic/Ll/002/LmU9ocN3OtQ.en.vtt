they're usually pretty bulky so what
focus<00:00:30.840> research<00:00:31.140> has<00:00:31.349> done<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.830> they<00:00:32.189> have

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
focus research has done is they have

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.940 
focus research has done is they have
taken<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.780> they<00:00:33.899> flattened<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.500> out<00:00:34.620> so

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
taken it and they flattened it out so

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.069 
taken it and they flattened it out so
that<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.280> fit<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.719> nice<00:00:36.840> and

that you can fit it really nice and
comfortably<00:00:37.500> behind<00:00:38.309> your<00:00:38.910> trauma<00:00:39.180> plate<00:00:39.480> now

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
comfortably behind your trauma plate now

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.479 
comfortably behind your trauma plate now
this<00:00:40.710> obviously<00:00:40.980> has<00:00:41.520> several<00:00:42.239> advantages

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
this obviously has several advantages

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.010 
this obviously has several advantages
number<00:00:44.489> one<00:00:44.730> you're<00:00:45.059> saving<00:00:45.420> real<00:00:45.570> estate<00:00:45.840> on

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
number one you're saving real estate on

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.840 
number one you're saving real estate on
the<00:00:46.050> front<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.379> your<00:00:46.440> carrier<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the front of your carrier it's going to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.790 
the front of your carrier it's going to
allow<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.539> lay<00:00:48.840> even<00:00:49.170> flatter<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.680> know

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
allow you to lay even flatter you know

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.459 
allow you to lay even flatter you know
to<00:00:49.860> get<00:00:50.070> under<00:00:50.280> cover<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.050> -<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> most

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
to get under cover and - and the most

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.650 
to get under cover and - and the most
significant<00:00:53.039> thing<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.329> behind

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
significant thing is is that it's behind

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.420 
significant thing is is that it's behind
your<00:00:54.899> plate<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.410> if<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.829> get<00:00:56.010> shot<00:00:56.250> or<00:00:56.399> you

your plate so if you get shot or you
take<00:00:56.699> rounds<00:00:57.149> then<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.890> medical<00:00:59.250> kit<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.699> not

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
take rounds then the medical kit is not

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.180 
take rounds then the medical kit is not
going<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.329> any<00:01:00.510> damage<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.859> and

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
carrier this is a great way to do it you

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.780 
carrier this is a great way to do it you
know<00:05:33.750> I<00:05:33.780> mean<00:05:33.900> it<00:05:34.890> doesn't<00:05:35.280> weigh<00:05:35.400> hardly

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
know I mean it doesn't weigh hardly

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.760 
know I mean it doesn't weigh hardly
anything<00:05:36.270> it's<00:05:36.480> very<00:05:36.810> lightweight<00:05:37.050> it's<00:05:37.530> all

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
anything it's very lightweight it's all

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.040 
anything it's very lightweight it's all
packed<00:05:38.130> up<00:05:38.370> and<00:05:38.550> sealed<00:05:38.850> up<00:05:39.060> so<00:05:39.690> that<00:05:39.900> it's

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
packed up and sealed up so that it's

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.980 
packed up and sealed up so that it's
waterproof<00:05:40.440> I<00:05:40.980> mean<00:05:41.970> it's<00:05:42.180> it's<00:05:42.420> combat<00:05:42.750> proof

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
waterproof I mean it's it's combat proof

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.050 
waterproof I mean it's it's combat proof
you<00:05:43.140> know<00:05:43.260> they've<00:05:43.440> had<00:05:43.620> these<00:05:43.860> things<00:05:44.130> tested

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
you know they've had these things tested

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.600 
you know they've had these things tested
and<00:05:45.270> used<00:05:45.660> in<00:05:45.960> Afghanistan<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:46.920> Iraq<00:05:47.130> and

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
and used in Afghanistan and Iraq and

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.190 
and used in Afghanistan and Iraq and
that<00:05:47.640> was<00:05:48.450> actually<00:05:48.840> part<00:05:49.050> of<00:05:49.140> the

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
that was actually part of the

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.320 
that was actually part of the
development<00:05:49.710> for<00:05:49.890> how<00:05:50.040> they<00:05:50.190> laid<00:05:50.430> it<00:05:50.460> out<00:05:50.640> so

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
development for how they laid it out so

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.540 
development for how they laid it out so
I<00:05:51.990> think<00:05:52.380> they've<00:05:52.620> done<00:05:52.650> an<00:05:52.920> outstanding<00:05:53.040> job

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
I think they've done an outstanding job

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.080 
I think they've done an outstanding job
I<00:05:53.940> haven't<00:05:54.150> seen<00:05:54.540> another<00:05:55.340> trauma<00:05:56.340> kit<00:05:56.640> layout

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
I haven't seen another trauma kit layout

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.290 
I haven't seen another trauma kit layout
you<00:05:58.080> know<00:05:58.200> or<00:05:58.380> setup<00:05:58.710> that<00:05:59.520> I<00:05:59.550> like<00:05:59.910> as<00:06:00.090> much

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
you know or setup that I like as much

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.000 
you know or setup that I like as much
you<00:06:00.930> know<00:06:00.960> and<00:06:01.320> it's<00:06:01.440> actually<00:06:01.770> kind<00:06:01.890> of

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
you know and it's actually kind of

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.130 
you know and it's actually kind of
difficult<00:06:02.370> to<00:06:02.430> find<00:06:02.730> some<00:06:03.000> blowout<00:06:03.330> kits<00:06:03.570> or

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
difficult to find some blowout kits or

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.320 
difficult to find some blowout kits or
trauma<00:06:04.440> kits<00:06:04.680> with<00:06:05.010> the<00:06:05.280> with<00:06:05.820> the<00:06:05.910> needle<00:06:06.180> in

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
trauma kits with the with the needle in

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.730 
trauma kits with the with the needle in
there<00:06:06.480> as<00:06:06.630> well<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.410> they<00:06:07.650> do<00:06:07.710> throw<00:06:08.040> that<00:06:08.220> in

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
there as well and they do throw that in

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.260 
there as well and they do throw that in
so<00:06:10.740> you<00:06:11.040> know<00:06:11.610> I<00:06:11.670> think<00:06:11.820> it's<00:06:12.000> pretty<00:06:12.210> awesome

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
so you know I think it's pretty awesome

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.480 
so you know I think it's pretty awesome
