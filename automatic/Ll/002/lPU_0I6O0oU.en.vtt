more cars there and it reminded me a lot

more cars there and it reminded me a lot
of<00:01:39.479> as<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.110> group<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.579> yeah<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.329> think<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.780> is

of as a group or the yeah I think it is
the<00:01:43.079> crew<00:01:43.350> where<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.040> kind<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.520> zoomed<00:01:44.759> out

and showed it different groups and cars
having<00:01:47.460> races<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.210> perhaps<00:01:48.450> that's<00:01:48.750> what<00:01:49.020> it

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
having races and perhaps that's what it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.160

similar kind of length of bar if you get

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.780 
similar kind of length of bar if you get
what<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.170> mean<00:02:19.260> they're<00:02:19.650> not<00:02:19.799> marrying<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:20.640> it

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
or anything I don't know I actually

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.250 
or anything I don't know I actually
don't<00:02:26.310> want<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.330> appear<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.140> me

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
bit of hellsing in the running and but

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.699 
bit of hellsing in the running and but
yeah<00:02:44.849> that<00:02:45.150> isn't<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.540> case<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.140> still

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
short clip and hey I'm fast-forwarding

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.030 
short clip and hey I'm fast-forwarding
and<00:02:51.870> realizing<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:52.769> you<00:02:52.859> can<00:02:52.980> see

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
that is a little bit flies past another

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.800 
that is a little bit flies past another
incorporating<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.269> hell<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.599> lot<00:02:57.780> more

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
incorporating a hell of a lot more

are all develop a game with tags and
it's<00:03:50.549> usually<00:03:50.700> what<00:03:51.030> developers<00:03:51.419> do<00:03:51.630> when

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
it's usually what developers do when

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.409 
it's usually what developers do when
they're<00:03:52.019> showing<00:03:52.290> trailers<00:03:52.709> as<00:03:52.919> hav<00:03:53.910> def<00:03:54.120> one

other game modes we know that how are
the<00:04:14.099> less<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.430> zoom<00:04:14.669> into<00:04:14.849> the<00:04:15.030> bottom

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
the less you zoom into the bottom

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.000 
the less you zoom into the bottom
left-hand<00:04:15.780> side<00:04:16.109> of<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.500> map<00:04:16.650> which<00:04:16.829> might

left-hand side of the map which might

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.979 
left-hand side of the map which might
tell<00:04:17.220> us<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.400> little<00:04:17.609> bit<00:04:17.820> more<00:04:18.150> about<00:04:18.419> this

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
tell us a little bit more about this

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.409 
tell us a little bit more about this
this<00:04:19.410> makes<00:04:19.709> me<00:04:19.919> think<00:04:19.949> that<00:04:20.250> this<00:04:20.519> mode<00:04:21.239> that

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
this makes me think that this mode that

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.899 
this makes me think that this mode that
we're<00:04:21.599> seeing<00:04:21.810> played<00:04:22.200> out<00:04:22.380> now<00:04:22.620> is<00:04:22.909> every

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
we're seeing played out now is every

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.640 
we're seeing played out now is every
game<00:04:24.120> mode<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:24.599> we've<00:04:24.750> seen<00:04:24.930> in<00:04:25.080> or<00:04:25.229> the<00:04:25.380> game

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
game mode that we've seen in or the game

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.600 
game mode that we've seen in or the game
says<00:04:25.860> raised<00:04:26.340> as<00:04:26.669> free<00:04:26.940> for<00:04:27.210> all<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.660> all

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
brought together in one game mode so the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.320 
brought together in one game mode so the
wideouts<00:04:32.009> i'm<00:04:32.280> guessing<00:04:32.729> are<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.090> players

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
wideouts i'm guessing are the players

finish<00:04:47.639> race<00:04:47.880> like<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:49.130> that's<00:04:50.130> where<00:04:50.639> that

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
finish race like and that's where that

if you're wanting to have a race you can

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.350 
if you're wanting to have a race you can
go<00:04:52.650> there<00:04:52.919> and<00:04:52.949> you<00:04:53.160> can<00:04:53.280> raise<00:04:53.520> people<00:04:53.940> in

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
go there and you can raise people in

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.960 
go there and you can raise people in
there<00:04:54.830> andrew<00:04:55.830> is<00:04:55.949> a<00:04:55.979> number<00:04:56.370> of<00:04:56.490> dots<00:04:56.699> which

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
there andrew is a number of dots which

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.279 
there andrew is a number of dots which
makes<00:04:57.210> me<00:04:57.360> believe<00:04:57.389> in<00:04:57.840> there's<00:04:57.990> a<00:04:58.020> little

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
makes me believe in there's a little

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.590 
makes me believe in there's a little
pointer<00:04:58.860> which<00:04:59.340> might<00:04:59.789> be<00:04:59.820> pointed<00:05:00.360> as<00:05:00.449> to

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
pointer which might be pointed as to

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.120 
pointer which might be pointed as to
where<00:05:00.780> they<00:05:00.960> are<00:05:01.110> going<00:05:01.139> are<00:05:01.620> heading<00:05:01.949> in<00:05:02.100> that

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
where they are going are heading in that

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.550 
where they are going are heading in that
direction<00:05:02.360> there's<00:05:03.360> also<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.780> star<00:05:04.139> which<00:05:04.410> I

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
direction there's also the star which I

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.170 
direction there's also the star which I
don't<00:05:04.889> know<00:05:05.039> what<00:05:05.190> that<00:05:05.340> is<00:05:05.370> perhaps<00:05:05.820> that's

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
don't know what that is perhaps that's

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.510 
don't know what that is perhaps that's
something<00:05:06.990> that<00:05:07.229> a<00:05:07.410> play<00:05:07.770> can<00:05:08.039> choose<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.400> put

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
something that a play can choose to put

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.430 
something that a play can choose to put
on<00:05:08.699> their<00:05:08.910> mini-map<00:05:09.300> just<00:05:09.810> a<00:05:09.960> favor<00:05:10.229> at<00:05:10.410> a

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
on their mini-map just a favor at a

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.740 
on their mini-map just a favor at a
location<00:05:10.830> or<00:05:11.190> a<00:05:11.220> waypoint<00:05:11.490> and<00:05:12.180> then<00:05:12.419> as<00:05:12.600> well

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
location or a waypoint and then as well

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.230 
location or a waypoint and then as well
there<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.139> a<00:05:13.229> parachute<00:05:13.800> now<00:05:14.400> a<00:05:14.430> parachutes

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
there is a parachute now a parachutes

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.750 
there is a parachute now a parachutes
are<00:05:15.510> could<00:05:16.020> be<00:05:16.169> this<00:05:16.800> could<00:05:16.860> be<00:05:17.099> a<00:05:17.130> pickup<00:05:17.430> and

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
are could be this could be a pickup and

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.430 
are could be this could be a pickup and
you<00:05:18.120> know<00:05:18.240> how<00:05:18.389> we<00:05:18.449> have<00:05:18.660> weapons<00:05:19.050> displayed

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
you know how we have weapons displayed

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.560 
you know how we have weapons displayed
on<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:19.650> map<00:05:19.800> there<00:05:20.370> is<00:05:20.520> no<00:05:20.669> weapons<00:05:21.120> and<00:05:21.270> no

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
on the map there is no weapons and no

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.560 
on the map there is no weapons and no
hang<00:05:22.470> on<00:05:22.650> locations<00:05:23.400> on<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.580> map<00:05:23.669> because

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
hang on locations on the map because

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.510 
hang on locations on the map because
again<00:05:24.960> we<00:05:25.259> are<00:05:25.410> looking<00:05:25.770> out<00:05:26.009> of<00:05:26.190> a<00:05:26.250> building

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
again we are looking out of a building

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.180 
again we are looking out of a building
so<00:05:26.910> I<00:05:26.940> I<00:05:27.120> don't<00:05:27.720> know<00:05:27.840> where<00:05:28.590> that<00:05:28.620> comes<00:05:28.949> in

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
so I I don't know where that comes in

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.620 
so I I don't know where that comes in
but<00:05:29.430> there<00:05:29.580> is<00:05:29.669> a<00:05:29.699> parachute<00:05:30.240> which<00:05:30.389> is

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
but there is a parachute which is

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.050 
but there is a parachute which is
located<00:05:31.560> on<00:05:32.039> the<00:05:32.099> bottom<00:05:32.340> half<00:05:32.669> of<00:05:32.789> the<00:05:32.910> map

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
located on the bottom half of the map

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.400 
located on the bottom half of the map
and<00:05:33.240> again<00:05:33.419> you<00:05:33.510> can<00:05:33.630> see<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:33.840> health<00:05:34.020> bar<00:05:34.229> you

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
and again you can see the health bar you

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.680 
and again you can see the health bar you
can<00:05:34.530> see<00:05:34.740> what<00:05:35.340> looks<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.669> be<00:05:35.760> I<00:05:35.849> reckon<00:05:36.270> is<00:05:36.479> the

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
can see what looks to be I reckon is the

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.200 
can see what looks to be I reckon is the
stamina<00:05:37.169> bar<00:05:37.320> and<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:38.280> if<00:05:38.370> we<00:05:38.520> look<00:05:38.729> back<00:05:39.000> to

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
stamina bar and and if we look back to

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.170 
stamina bar and and if we look back to
San<00:05:39.389> Andreas<00:05:39.539> and<00:05:40.080> if<00:05:40.710> you<00:05:40.949> i<00:05:41.370> think<00:05:41.970> it<00:05:42.060> was<00:05:42.120> in

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
San Andreas and if you i think it was in

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.850 
San Andreas and if you i think it was in
single<00:05:42.570> player<00:05:42.599> element<00:05:43.139> of<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.349> game<00:05:43.530> if<00:05:43.710> you

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
single player element of the game if you

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.399 
single player element of the game if you
did<00:05:44.460> wait<00:05:44.789> so<00:05:45.000> I<00:05:45.030> went<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:45.330> the<00:05:45.449> gym<00:05:45.630> a<00:05:45.690> lot<00:05:45.780> your

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
did wait so I went to the gym a lot your

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.980 
did wait so I went to the gym a lot your
stamina<00:05:46.650> would<00:05:47.039> go<00:05:47.460> up<00:05:47.729> and<00:05:48.539> you'd<00:05:48.690> be<00:05:48.780> able<00:05:48.900> to

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
stamina would go up and you'd be able to

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.649 
stamina would go up and you'd be able to
do<00:05:49.139> more<00:05:49.349> kind<00:05:49.680> of<00:05:49.740> running<00:05:50.159> and<00:05:50.510> sprint<00:05:51.510> along

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
do more kind of running and sprint along

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:53.420 
do more kind of running and sprint along
the<00:05:51.840> research<00:05:52.289> so<00:05:52.740> it's<00:05:52.889> like<00:05:52.949> carried<00:05:53.310> over

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
the research so it's like carried over

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.100 
the research so it's like carried over
into<00:05:53.580> monteclaro<00:05:54.180> grand<00:05:54.539> theft<00:05:54.659> auto<00:05:54.840> online

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.020 
into monteclaro grand theft auto online
that<00:05:55.470> would<00:05:55.590> be<00:05:55.710> pretty<00:05:55.889> neat<00:05:56.039> as<00:05:56.250> well<00:05:56.460> but<00:05:56.880> as

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
that would be pretty neat as well but as

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.610 
that would be pretty neat as well but as
we<00:05:57.090> zoom<00:05:57.180> out<00:05:57.479> you<00:05:57.539> can<00:05:57.780> see<00:05:57.960> that<00:05:57.990> just<00:05:58.530> a

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
we zoom out you can see that just a

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.680 
we zoom out you can see that just a
whole<00:05:58.770> perspective<00:05:59.070> of<00:05:59.520> this<00:05:59.729> and<00:05:59.970> we're<00:06:00.510> just

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
whole perspective of this and we're just

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.839 
whole perspective of this and we're just
zooming<00:06:01.020> into<00:06:01.199> the<00:06:01.470> mini-map<00:06:01.830> there<00:06:02.190> and<00:06:02.550> then

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
zooming into the mini-map there and then

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.240 
zooming into the mini-map there and then
again<00:06:03.150> I<00:06:03.180> has<00:06:03.360> change<00:06:03.659> from<00:06:03.780> a<00:06:03.810> circle<00:06:04.289> map<00:06:05.010> to

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
again I has change from a circle map to

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.310 
again I has change from a circle map to
a<00:06:05.280> scrubber<00:06:05.699> and<00:06:05.940> that's<00:06:06.690> one<00:06:06.840> thing<00:06:06.990> to<00:06:07.139> note

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
a scrubber and that's one thing to note

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.379 
a scrubber and that's one thing to note
as<00:06:07.470> well<00:06:07.650> but<00:06:08.370> as<00:06:08.460> for<00:06:08.520> what<00:06:08.760> the<00:06:08.909> other<00:06:09.150> thing

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
as well but as for what the other thing

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.510 
as well but as for what the other thing
is<00:06:09.630> i'm<00:06:09.960> just<00:06:09.990> guessing<00:06:10.440> with<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:10.800> star<00:06:11.099> and<00:06:11.430> I

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
is i'm just guessing with the star and I

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.990 
is i'm just guessing with the star and I
don't<00:06:11.820> know<00:06:12.030> and<00:06:12.419> I<00:06:12.930> do<00:06:13.260> reckon<00:06:14.010> the<00:06:14.280> the<00:06:14.610> flags

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
don't know and I do reckon the the flags

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.689 
don't know and I do reckon the the flags
red<00:06:15.659> flags<00:06:16.050> are<00:06:16.590> linked<00:06:17.039> with<00:06:17.190> the<00:06:17.340> icon<00:06:17.669> next

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
red flags are linked with the icon next

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:19.640 
red flags are linked with the icon next
room<00:06:18.090> so<00:06:18.120> I<00:06:18.270> reckon<00:06:18.570> one<00:06:18.750> will<00:06:18.930> be<00:06:19.080> a<00:06:19.110> star<00:06:19.440> race

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
room so I reckon one will be a star race

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.279 
room so I reckon one will be a star race
flag<00:06:19.919> and<00:06:20.460> there<00:06:20.610> will<00:06:20.849> be<00:06:21.000> a<00:06:21.210> and<00:06:21.599> raise<00:06:21.990> flag

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
flag and there will be a and raise flag

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.050 
flag and there will be a and raise flag
so<00:06:22.560> it<00:06:23.039> makes<00:06:23.220> me<00:06:23.370> think<00:06:23.580> that<00:06:23.699> there's<00:06:23.940> going

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
so it makes me think that there's going

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.760 
so it makes me think that there's going
to<00:06:24.150> be<00:06:24.180> these<00:06:24.360> huge<00:06:24.780> multiplayer<00:06:25.409> lobbies

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
to be these huge multiplayer lobbies

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.320 
to be these huge multiplayer lobbies
where<00:06:26.310> players<00:06:26.520> can<00:06:26.669> come<00:06:26.940> in<00:06:27.060> and<00:06:27.240> do<00:06:27.300> a

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
where players can come in and do a

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.149 
where players can come in and do a
variety<00:06:27.659> of<00:06:27.960> different<00:06:28.080> game<00:06:28.530> modes<00:06:28.560> what<00:06:29.010> do

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:29.159 
variety of different game modes what do

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:31.310 
variety of different game modes what do
you<00:06:29.250> want<00:06:29.400> to<00:06:29.490> do<00:06:29.610> and<00:06:29.940> but<00:06:30.510> again<00:06:30.780> they<00:06:30.960> those

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
you want to do and but again they those

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.020 
you want to do and but again they those
will<00:06:31.530> always<00:06:31.860> be<00:06:31.979> ruined<00:06:32.340> by<00:06:32.430> people<00:06:32.760> who<00:06:32.849> want

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
will always be ruined by people who want

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.820 
will always be ruined by people who want
to<00:06:33.090> kill<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.479> people

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
to kill the people

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.710 
to kill the people
and<00:06:34.400> they<00:06:34.610> always<00:06:34.730> are<00:06:35.030> in<00:06:35.060> games<00:06:35.360> like<00:06:35.510> this
