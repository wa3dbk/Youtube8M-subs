00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.250 
what we can do I think I'm going to
start<00:01:01.770> off<00:01:01.949> by<00:01:01.980> attacking<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:04.500> side<00:01:06.260> try

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
first just all the ones over there a

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.010 
first just all the ones over there a
couple<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.340> healers<00:01:17.820> throw<00:01:18.540> some<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.869> this

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
couple of healers throw some on this

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.929 
couple of healers throw some on this
side<00:01:19.080> doesn't<00:01:20.070> seem<00:01:20.340> like<00:01:20.520> there's<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.790> lot

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
side doesn't seem like there's a lot

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:29.300 
side doesn't seem like there's a lot
defense<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:25.220> healer<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:27.799> and<00:01:28.799> then<00:01:29.070> some

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
defense you healer here and then some

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.219 
defense you healer here and then some
wall<00:01:29.520> breakers

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.139 

now<00:01:33.070> we<00:01:33.130> just<00:01:33.399> watched<00:01:33.640> you<00:01:33.850> take<00:01:34.090> over<00:01:36.149> 36%

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
now we just watched you take over 36%

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.580 
now we just watched you take over 36%
damage<00:01:37.869> already

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
damage already

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.230 
damage already
that's<00:01:38.890> pretty<00:01:39.100> good<00:01:39.280> 42<00:01:40.270> or<00:01:40.479> 44<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.909> healers

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
that's pretty good 42 or 44 the healers

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.510 
that's pretty good 42 or 44 the healers
are<00:01:43.390> doing<00:01:43.539> pretty<00:01:43.750> good<00:01:43.960> I<00:01:44.229> used<00:01:45.189> to<00:01:45.369> use<00:01:45.490> a

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
are doing pretty good I used to use a

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.210 
are doing pretty good I used to use a
dragon<00:01:46.060> but<00:01:46.329> I<00:01:46.390> think<00:01:46.719> this<00:01:47.229> setup<00:01:47.500> cost<00:01:47.920> less

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
dragon but I think this setup cost less

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.069 
dragon but I think this setup cost less
using<00:01:49.060> 3<00:01:49.360> healers<00:01:49.689> instead<00:01:50.170> of<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.319> dragon<00:01:50.710> that

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
using 3 healers instead of a dragon that

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.510 
using 3 healers instead of a dragon that
also<00:01:53.079> depends<00:01:53.439> on<00:01:53.560> what<00:01:53.710> level<00:01:54.009> your<00:01:54.130> dragons

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
also depends on what level your dragons

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.969 
also depends on what level your dragons
are<00:01:54.700> because<00:01:54.969> I<00:01:55.000> did<00:01:55.270> upgrade<00:01:55.450> mine<00:01:55.869> so<00:01:56.679> you<00:01:56.829> do

are because I did upgrade mine so you do

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.319 
are because I did upgrade mine so you do

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329

gold and the iron for whenever the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.559 
gold and the iron for whenever the
tunnels<00:02:55.480> ready<00:02:55.690> which<00:02:55.930> will<00:02:56.139> be<00:02:56.260> in<00:02:56.380> 8<00:02:56.590> hours

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
tunnels ready which will be in 8 hours

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.559 
tunnels ready which will be in 8 hours
and<00:02:58.859> that's<00:02:59.859> about<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.160> I<00:03:00.579> can<00:03:01.150> show<00:03:01.269> you<00:03:01.329> what

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
and that's about it I can show you what

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.160 
and that's about it I can show you what
I<00:03:01.600> trained<00:03:02.049> if<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:02.380> want<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.799> see<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.190> I

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
I trained if you want to see that I

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.900 
I trained if you want to see that I
usually<00:03:05.170> train<00:03:05.410> up<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.590> an<00:03:05.829> hour<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.430> then

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
usually train up to an hour and then

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.599 
usually train up to an hour and then
around<00:03:07.209> there<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.569> should<00:03:07.780> be<00:03:07.930> good<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:12.459> then

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
around there it should be good and then

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.910 
around there it should be good and then
here<00:03:12.880> trained<00:03:13.299> only<00:03:13.450> Wizards<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:16.739> like<00:03:17.739> using

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
here trained only Wizards I like using

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.680 
here trained only Wizards I like using
Wizards<00:03:18.400> even<00:03:18.700> though<00:03:18.819> they<00:03:18.940> die<00:03:19.120> pretty<00:03:19.329> fast

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
Wizards even though they die pretty fast

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.059 
Wizards even though they die pretty fast
that's<00:03:20.139> why<00:03:20.319> you<00:03:20.380> got<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.590> use<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:20.799> couple

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
that's why you got to use a couple

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.910 
that's why you got to use a couple
healers<00:03:21.549> and<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:23.019> do<00:03:23.079> use<00:03:23.410> some<00:03:23.440> Walberg<00:03:25.889> not<00:03:26.889> a

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
healers and I do use some Walberg not a

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.599 
healers and I do use some Walberg not a
