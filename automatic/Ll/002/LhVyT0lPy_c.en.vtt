been
I<00:03:49.400> just<00:03:49.850> ran<00:03:50.090> my<00:03:50.330> fingers<00:03:50.390> through<00:03:50.960> the<00:03:51.890> hair

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
I just ran my fingers through the hair

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.720 
I just ran my fingers through the hair
and<00:03:54.740> I<00:03:54.860> get<00:03:55.010> nothing<00:03:56.650> that's<00:03:57.650> not<00:03:57.770> what<00:03:58.700> I

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
and I get nothing that's not what I

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.880 
and I get nothing that's not what I
normally<00:03:58.850> get<00:03:59.450> from<00:03:59.750> other<00:03:59.960> weaves<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.620> really

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
normally get from other weaves I really

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.800 
normally get from other weaves I really
don't<00:04:01.070> get<00:04:01.360> disentangled<00:04:02.360> right<00:04:02.480> there<00:04:02.660> at

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
don't get disentangled right there at

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.050 
don't get disentangled right there at
the<00:04:02.930> end<00:04:03.110> but<00:04:03.410> still<00:04:04.370> even<00:04:04.640> through<00:04:04.940> that<00:04:05.030> a

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
the end but still even through that a

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.840 
the end but still even through that a
little<00:04:05.300> tangle<00:04:05.780> there's<00:04:06.410> no<00:04:07.220> Jenny

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
little tangle there's no Jenny

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.870

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
so the shedding has been very minimal

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.540 
so the shedding has been very minimal
for<00:04:11.540> me<00:04:11.720> in<00:04:11.960> my<00:04:12.500> experience<00:04:12.680> with<00:04:13.190> this<00:04:13.310> hair
