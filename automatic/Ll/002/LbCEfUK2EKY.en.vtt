00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.230 
flowers I ended up using all of the
grass<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.650> mean<00:04:08.800> it's<00:04:08.980> obviously<00:04:09.490> a<00:04:09.610> lot<00:04:10.180> of

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
grass I mean it's obviously a lot of

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.060 
grass I mean it's obviously a lot of
grass<00:04:10.840> but<00:04:11.200> I'm<00:04:11.320> not<00:04:11.470> gonna<00:04:11.590> use<00:04:11.860> it<00:04:11.890> for

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
grass but I'm not gonna use it for

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.620 
grass but I'm not gonna use it for
anything<00:04:12.370> else<00:04:12.610> so<00:04:12.880> I<00:04:12.910> thought<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.210> would<00:04:13.360> just

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
anything else so I thought I would just

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.680 
anything else so I thought I would just
use<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:14.830> all<00:04:14.950> up<00:04:15.250> because<00:04:15.850> I<00:04:16.030> really<00:04:16.299> I'm<00:04:16.630> not

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
use it all up because I really I'm not

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.509 
use it all up because I really I'm not
gonna<00:04:16.900> make<00:04:17.110> another<00:04:17.320> Easter<00:04:17.799> basket<00:04:18.250> so<00:04:18.459> it

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519

gonna make another Easter basket so it
just<00:04:18.670> made<00:04:18.850> sense<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.420> use<00:04:19.750> all<00:04:19.989> of<00:04:20.170> it<00:04:20.290> up

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610
