00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
really figure it out so I think I've

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.380 
really figure it out so I think I've
settled<00:05:09.440> on<00:05:09.650> that<00:05:09.710> particular<00:05:10.220> kind<00:05:11.180> of<00:05:11.300> the

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
settled on that particular kind of the

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.020 
settled on that particular kind of the
cabinet<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.050> i'm<00:05:12.680> pretty<00:05:12.830> sure<00:05:13.160> that<00:05:13.490> that's

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
cabinet and i'm pretty sure that that's

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.460 
cabinet and i'm pretty sure that that's
the<00:05:14.270> right<00:05:14.300> speaker<00:05:14.780> for<00:05:15.140> what<00:05:15.260> we're<00:05:15.350> going

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
the right speaker for what we're going

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.140 
the right speaker for what we're going
to<00:05:15.590> do<00:05:15.710> and<00:05:16.220> i'll<00:05:16.340> probably<00:05:16.550> just<00:05:16.700> ditch<00:05:17.120> the

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
to do and i'll probably just ditch the

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.890 
to do and i'll probably just ditch the
75<00:05:18.110> watt<00:05:18.380> cabinet<00:05:18.890> cuz<00:05:19.040> since<00:05:19.910> it's<00:05:20.660> sort<00:05:20.780> of

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
75 watt cabinet cuz since it's sort of

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.590 
75 watt cabinet cuz since it's sort of
like<00:05:21.020> harsh<00:05:21.380> but<00:05:21.710> doesn't<00:05:21.979> really<00:05:22.040> go<00:05:22.370> as<00:05:23.360> high

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
like harsh but doesn't really go as high

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.110 
like harsh but doesn't really go as high
as<00:05:23.630> you<00:05:23.810> want<00:05:23.960> in<00:05:24.410> a<00:05:24.500> brilliant<00:05:24.919> way<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.940> then

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120
