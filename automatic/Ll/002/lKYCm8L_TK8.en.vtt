00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 the guys from bajaki games are starting 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.299
 but where do journalistic bridges 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.099
 news from vj and quoted not yet 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.960
 made the registration in the channel click on top 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.639
 or underneath to find out all about 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.799
 the world of games 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.839
 Yesterday, September 30th, Microsoft 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.230
 announced the new version of its system 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.150
 windows 10 because the galley 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.949
 but you call because it seems like it's not just 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.949
 in pcs that we will see changes not 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.510
 is xbox one also go into the package 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.640
 this image you are seeing now 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.929
 was released during the presentation of the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.850
 operational system 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.850
 And how can you see him in the corner? 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.680
 a tv with the kinect on the bottom and dashboard 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.860
 shown is different by understanding that the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.239
 people are accustomed to see currently 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.460
 say, however, that there may be a 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.219
 possibility to change background 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.200
 of this area but only at least until now 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.059
 that is until the recording of the program 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.120
 nothing was officially said by the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.980
 microsoft and nokia dog slowly goes 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.870
 more information about the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.430
 expected the day before yesterday 4 people 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.469
 can have a little more throw 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.799
 about the game thanks to the book of arts 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.960
 concepts that released and in total six 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.060
 addition of uncharted four appeared in the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.610
 collection of company design 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.320
 they are not as revealing as this but already 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.700
 you can get a sense of the scenarios that the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.770
 People are going to have the game. 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.810
 Georgian herself said she did not want 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.240
 spoiler but guaranteed that people 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.280
 will travel a lot of the title and there 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.619
 enjoyed one of the things that the galley 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.810
 most liked and hot dog was far from power 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.159
 walk and npcc and find out these things 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.329
 bizarre people to continue 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.240
 discovering who is playing the game 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.460
 game but call because in the second game 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.600
 and ubisoft that make it even bigger and 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.250
 best 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.710
 whoever said that was the creative director 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.470
 dj mother game commented that you will have 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.180
 full influence on the system now 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.549
 player will be able to give a robin hood 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.710
 and steal quite large from a corrupt 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.170
 for example and then transfer everything 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.360
 for a needy parent is more work 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.909
 with so much information so it can be a 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.110
 problem according to Amorim himself. 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.030
 the team is trying to find the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.280
 ideal balance in the resource to do with 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.100
 that it is organic enough and not 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.439
 just a few pinch in bayonetta two 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.520
 will be released for nintendo and the e 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.950
 different from what I 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.510
 we thought and hoped he would 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.460
 likely to continue to be 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.780
 exclusive then nothing playstation 4 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.180
 xbox year 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.770
 For those who do not know, I explain the platinum. 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.140
 games started the game development 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.930
 when at the time the harvest was still 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.120
 funds to help with a more 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.440
 with everything, however, due to a 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.320
 problem at harvest 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.750
 the game was halted 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.550
 That 's where Platinum spent five years, people. 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.400
 five years asking for help for several 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.870
 distributors and only happened only 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.660
 I understand that you have heard the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.580
 solidarity and should path is one of 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.200
 developers of the game and said that as 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.210
 was the nintendo that helped make the game 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.680
 it is up to it to decide whether or not to launch 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.900
 for the other consoles 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.180
 nothing is fairer people and how we 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.890
 knows the big n walks even joked and 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.140
 said that while we are asking for a 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.540
 version of bayonetta 2 playstation 4 and 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.330
 xbox the year we can enjoy and 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.170
 also ask mario and zelda hashtag people 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.000
 upset 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.800
 For those who like movies based on 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.810
 games is looking forward and for the 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.540
 access last movie resident evil movie 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.790
 How about a tetris movie? 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.770
 as incredible as it may sound like a movie 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.450
 Tetris is already in production 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.810
 that's right the project is coming to celebrate 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.400
 the 30 years of the game we still do not have 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.560
 information on who will direct the 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.120
 the actors who will participate but the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.580
 what we know so far is that it will be 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.560
 a science fiction movie 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.959
 I do not know, can you imagine the texas squares? 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.790
 to fall into ship form or the year month 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.760
 I do anything I can not anymore 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.830
 But we, but I'm talking about movies. 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.260
 i connects because the first scenes of 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.170
 today began to be recorded today 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.850
 it's only a wonder that although based 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.830
 In elements of the game the story goes 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.660
 an original tone and will present 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.120
 the story of four survivors the 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.830
 zombie apocalypse leave aside names 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.620
 known as West Wing Chicken 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.270
 example we already know in the matter you 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.310
 can read better that the movie is being 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.680
 made especially for fans of the series 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.390
 and games in general look at what a beautiful thing 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.970
 in a new drawing will be 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.920
 cross platform just look how amazing 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.900
 it is the joy of many people and will 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.400
 be launched for xbox one and even for 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.290
 other consoles 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.449
 wen to the creator of the game said in 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.160
 interview with hero gamer who daisy com 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.930
 sure will reach other 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.479
 platforms but he is still seeing 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.039
 what are they going to be hall also commented 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.870
 that we are likely to see a 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.669
 version of the 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.590
 playstation 4 but nothing has been confirmed 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.300
 even though the team is working hard 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.669
 to change the graphics engine of the game to 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.280
 version of the console and announcement of the 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.229
 to roll only in early 2015 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.729
 to close with some assured that all 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.250
 the platforms will have an experience 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.990
 itself or nothing on the menu that runs 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.150
 well on the console it 's on the pc side by 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.340
 example is for who has the playstation 4 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.770
 do not know which one is better if psn 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.300
 Brazilian offering American people 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.669
 made an article indicating which is the best 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.680
 option for you and it is this article that is 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.240
 unworthy of these people today I expect a lot 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.590
 that you have enjoyed editing the 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.300
 checkpoint today 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.250
 I hope you have already done that. 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.419
 on the channel but did not yet everything indicates 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.400
 that up or down we a little 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.410
 more of this subject is beauty gives a fan 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.910
 in the video also requires written benefit 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.860
 share on social networks we 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.860
 I'm very happy, too.
