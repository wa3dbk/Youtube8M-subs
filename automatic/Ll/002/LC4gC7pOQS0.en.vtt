though I thought I had a torque free
grip<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.320> mean<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:05.010> been<00:01:05.369> shooting<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.880> 22

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
grip I mean it's been shooting for 22

everything<00:01:09.540> right<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.650> come<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> find<00:01:11.010> out

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
everything right and come to find out

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340

every time I drew that boat its twisting

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.870 
every time I drew that boat its twisting
just<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.830> little<00:01:14.100> bit<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> when<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.610> pin

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
just a little bit and when that pin

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.310 
just a little bit and when that pin
floats<00:01:15.180> back<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.630> forth<00:01:15.840> when<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.140> move<00:01:16.290> that

was new which is understandable

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.479 
was new which is understandable
they<00:03:23.049> were<00:03:23.110> sporadic<00:03:23.470> around<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:23.980> target<00:03:24.190> but
