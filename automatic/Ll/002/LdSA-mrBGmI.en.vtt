the years you know there's been a lot of

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.030 
the years you know there's been a lot of
talk<00:02:54.090> about<00:02:54.270> how<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:55.230> program<00:02:55.800> has<00:02:56.010> been

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
talk about how this program has been

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.740 
talk about how this program has been
very<00:02:56.310> powerful<00:02:56.820> for<00:02:56.970> promoting<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.450> social

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750

very powerful for promoting the social
development<00:02:58.140> piece<00:02:58.260> but<00:02:58.440> there's<00:02:58.590> really

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
development piece but there's really

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.500 
development piece but there's really
never<00:02:59.010> been<00:02:59.340> any<00:02:59.580> kind<00:02:59.820> of<00:02:59.910> experimental

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
never been any kind of experimental

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.680 
never been any kind of experimental
research<00:03:00.690> done<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.980> verify<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.480> that's

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
research done to verify this so that's

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.690 
research done to verify this so that's
what<00:03:03.810> we<00:03:03.930> did<00:03:03.959> we<00:03:04.470> set<00:03:04.680> out<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.980> test<00:03:05.130> our<00:03:05.340> pilot

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
what we did we set out to test our pilot

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.210 
what we did we set out to test our pilot
project<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.660> take<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.770> kids<00:03:07.980> who<00:03:08.100> got

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
project and and take the kids who got

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.470 
project and and take the kids who got
the<00:03:08.370> program<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.820> compare<00:03:09.120> them<00:03:09.209> with<00:03:09.240> kids

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
the program and compare them with kids

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.790 
the program and compare them with kids
who<00:03:09.570> didn't<00:03:09.750> get<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.930> program<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.530> what<00:03:10.709> we

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
who didn't get the program and what we

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.979 
who didn't get the program and what we
were<00:03:10.890> able<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.160> determine<00:03:11.310> from<00:03:12.300> that<00:03:12.570> is<00:03:12.780> that

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
were able to determine from that is that

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.540 
were able to determine from that is that
the<00:03:13.140> kids<00:03:13.320> who<00:03:13.440> got<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.770> program<00:03:14.250> not<00:03:14.489> only

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
the kids who got the program not only

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.090 
the kids who got the program not only
felt<00:03:15.000> more<00:03:15.120> socially<00:03:15.540> supported<00:03:16.080> but<00:03:16.980> they

felt more socially supported but they

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.220 
felt more socially supported but they
also<00:03:17.280> felt<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.790> their<00:03:18.150> peers<00:03:18.570> were<00:03:18.810> treating

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
also felt that their peers were treating

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.100 
also felt that their peers were treating
them<00:03:19.380> significantly<00:03:19.980> better<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.840> they<00:03:21.840> felt

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
them significantly better and they felt

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.140
