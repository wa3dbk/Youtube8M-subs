ingalls<00:00:35.980> which<00:00:36.339> I<00:00:36.580> know<00:00:36.670> you<00:00:36.850> don't<00:00:37.120> have<00:00:37.330> to

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
ingalls which I know you don't have to

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:38.880 
ingalls which I know you don't have to
tell<00:00:37.690> me<00:00:37.720> that<00:00:38.110> I<00:00:38.170> shouldn't<00:00:38.440> be<00:00:38.589> doing<00:00:38.620> this

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
tell me that I shouldn't be doing this

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.280 
tell me that I shouldn't be doing this
I'm<00:00:39.280> well<00:00:39.519> aware<00:00:39.670> but<00:00:40.000> I<00:00:40.059> felt<00:00:40.360> like<00:00:40.449> it<00:00:40.750> so

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
I'm well aware but I felt like it so

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.860 
I'm well aware but I felt like it so
this<00:00:41.320> is<00:00:41.650> 2<00:00:41.920> 45<00:00:42.579> and<00:00:42.970> I<00:00:43.269> ended<00:00:43.449> up<00:00:43.600> managing

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
this is 2 45 and I ended up managing

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.820 
this is 2 45 and I ended up managing
eight<00:00:44.379> singles<00:00:45.449> the<00:00:46.449> bar<00:00:46.629> is<00:00:46.809> 35<00:00:47.350> so<00:00:47.619> it<00:00:47.680> was<00:00:47.769> a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
eight singles the bar is 35 so it was a

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.160 
eight singles the bar is 35 so it was a
lot<00:00:47.949> easier<00:00:47.979> to<00:00:48.400> grip<00:00:48.729> and<00:00:49.030> also<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:49.930> plates

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
lot easier to grip and also the plates

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.560 
lot easier to grip and also the plates
are<00:00:50.350> 35<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.309> I<00:00:51.369> also<00:00:51.519> worked<00:00:51.879> on<00:00:52.000> my<00:00:52.180> grip<00:00:52.390> I

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
are 35 and I also worked on my grip I

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.600 
are 35 and I also worked on my grip I
held<00:00:52.960> these<00:00:53.140> as<00:00:53.350> long<00:00:53.589> as<00:00:53.739> I<00:00:53.830> could<00:00:53.890> so<00:00:54.430> that

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
held these as long as I could so that

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.579 
held these as long as I could so that
was<00:00:54.729> good<00:00:54.909> that<00:00:55.600> I<00:00:55.629> moved<00:00:55.900> on<00:00:56.140> to<00:00:56.320> what<00:00:56.440> I<00:00:56.470> was

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
was good that I moved on to what I was

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.350 
was good that I moved on to what I was
actually<00:00:57.100> supposed<00:00:57.430> to<00:00:57.580> do<00:00:57.760> on<00:00:57.909> my<00:00:58.000> upper<00:00:58.119> body

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
actually supposed to do on my upper body

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.390 
actually supposed to do on my upper body
speed<00:00:58.780> day<00:00:58.989> which<00:00:59.260> was<00:00:59.530> 12<00:01:00.100> triples<00:01:00.820> at<00:01:01.299> I

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
speed day which was 12 triples at I

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.330 
speed day which was 12 triples at I
think<00:01:03.400> this<00:01:03.729> is<00:01:03.790> actually<00:01:05.340> sixty-five

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
think this is actually sixty-five

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.539 
think this is actually sixty-five
percent<00:01:06.700> of<00:01:07.000> my<00:01:07.150> one<00:01:07.689> rep<00:01:07.869> max<00:01:07.900> it's<00:01:08.409> 75<00:01:08.920> pounds

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
percent of my one rep max it's 75 pounds

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.330 
percent of my one rep max it's 75 pounds
i<00:01:09.729> use<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.299> 35<00:01:10.810> pound<00:01:11.140> bar<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:11.860> then<00:01:12.130> those

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
i use the 35 pound bar and then those

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.469 
i use the 35 pound bar and then those
are<00:01:12.369> ten<00:01:12.759> pound<00:01:13.030> clits<00:01:13.390> so<00:01:15.060> honestly<00:01:16.060> probably

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
are ten pound clits so honestly probably

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.290 
are ten pound clits so honestly probably
a<00:01:16.810> little<00:01:16.960> bit<00:01:17.140> too<00:01:17.410> heavy<00:01:17.650> for<00:01:18.460> speed<00:01:19.090> work

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
a little bit too heavy for speed work

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.830 
a little bit too heavy for speed work
but<00:01:20.230> it<00:01:20.470> just<00:01:20.500> it<00:01:20.980> felt<00:01:21.220> pretty<00:01:21.400> good

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
but it just it felt pretty good

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.390 
but it just it felt pretty good
obviously<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.020> time<00:01:23.230> in<00:01:23.440> between<00:01:23.590> sped<00:01:24.220> up

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
obviously the time in between sped up

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.300 
obviously the time in between sped up
but<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.000> actual<00:01:25.420> bench<00:01:26.110> clips<00:01:26.530> are<00:01:26.710> set<00:01:27.010> up<00:01:27.160> at

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
but the actual bench clips are set up at

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.830 
but the actual bench clips are set up at
all<00:01:27.460> so<00:01:27.700> it's<00:01:27.850> fairly<00:01:28.090> happy<00:01:28.480> with<00:01:28.540> how<00:01:28.810> my

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
all so it's fairly happy with how my

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.430 
all so it's fairly happy with how my
speed<00:01:29.320> was<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.330> theme<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.600> this<00:01:31.960> week<00:01:32.230> has

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
speed was but the theme of this week has

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.310 
speed was but the theme of this week has
kind<00:01:32.920> of<00:01:33.040> been<00:01:33.190> like<00:01:33.430> I've<00:01:33.670> had<00:01:33.820> trouble

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
kind of been like I've had trouble

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.780 
kind of been like I've had trouble
sticking<00:01:35.320> me<00:01:35.680> for<00:01:35.890> what<00:01:36.010> I'm<00:01:36.130> supposed<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:36.640> be

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
sticking me for what I'm supposed to be

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.120 
sticking me for what I'm supposed to be
doing<00:01:37.150> each<00:01:37.330> workout<00:01:38.110> and<00:01:38.409> actually<00:01:38.770> enjoying

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
doing each workout and actually enjoying

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.060 
doing each workout and actually enjoying
it<00:01:39.400> and<00:01:39.550> I<00:01:40.210> think<00:01:40.840> that's<00:01:41.020> really<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.409> result<00:01:41.860> of

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
it and I think that's really a result of

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.580 
it and I think that's really a result of
some<00:01:42.460> serious<00:01:42.970> stress<00:01:43.570> I've<00:01:43.750> had<00:01:43.960> at<00:01:44.110> work<00:01:44.350> I

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
some serious stress I've had at work I

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.410 
some serious stress I've had at work I
do<00:01:44.680> work<00:01:45.010> at<00:01:45.159> this<00:01:45.310> gym<00:01:45.550> that<00:01:45.729> I'm<00:01:45.880> lifting<00:01:46.060> at

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
do work at this gym that I'm lifting at

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.830 
do work at this gym that I'm lifting at
and<00:01:46.720> it's<00:01:47.080> just<00:01:47.470> been<00:01:48.370> pretty<00:01:48.880> stressful<00:01:49.390> for

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
and it's just been pretty stressful for

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.680 
and it's just been pretty stressful for
me<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.260> Cebu<00:01:50.920> I've<00:01:51.159> also<00:01:51.370> been<00:01:51.729> working

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
it's just been tough it's really messed

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.850 
it's just been tough it's really messed
with<00:02:15.129> my<00:02:15.280> mood<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.030> it's<00:02:16.930> been<00:02:17.200> kind<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.650> hard

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
with my mood and it's been kind of hard

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.350 
with my mood and it's been kind of hard
to<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.670> guess<00:02:18.849> recover<00:02:19.390> from<00:02:19.690> mentally

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
to I guess recover from mentally

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.860 
to I guess recover from mentally
so<00:02:20.930> I'm<00:02:20.990> trying<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.350> get<00:02:21.440> over<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.830> and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
so I'm trying to get over that and

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.340 
so I'm trying to get over that and
trying<00:02:23.870> not<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.260> let<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:24.410> affect<00:02:24.890> my<00:02:25.070> workouts

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
trying not to let it affect my workouts

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.280 
trying not to let it affect my workouts
so<00:02:27.350> this<00:02:27.380> was<00:02:28.190> my<00:02:28.370> upper<00:02:28.670> body<00:02:28.820> power<00:02:29.360> day<00:02:29.780> from

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
so this was my upper body power day from

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.490 
so this was my upper body power day from
last<00:02:30.320> week<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.160> this<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.580> 115<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.690> was<00:02:33.170> supposed

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
last week and this is 115 I was supposed

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.530 
last week and this is 115 I was supposed
to<00:02:33.620> hit<00:02:33.800> eight<00:02:34.040> triples<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.090> last<00:02:35.300> they

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
to hit eight triples and the last they

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.380 
to hit eight triples and the last they
think<00:02:35.750> like<00:02:35.900> three<00:02:36.320> I<00:02:36.710> can<00:02:37.340> only<00:02:37.490> do<00:02:37.790> double<00:02:38.000> so

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
think like three I can only do double so

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.330 
think like three I can only do double so
I<00:02:38.450> stuck<00:02:38.840> with<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.110> weight<00:02:39.530> for<00:02:39.860> this<00:02:40.010> week

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
I stuck with that weight for this week

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.970 
I stuck with that weight for this week
and<00:02:40.630> hopefully<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.930> guys<00:02:42.110> will<00:02:42.410> notice<00:02:42.770> in

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
this clip this saw some 115 I think my

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.180 
this clip this saw some 115 I think my
bar<00:02:46.880> speed<00:02:47.209> looks<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.690> lot<00:02:47.870> better<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.470> kind

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
bar speed looks a lot better and I kind

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.160 
bar speed looks a lot better and I kind
of<00:02:49.340> think<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.910> lot<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:50.390> student<00:02:50.870> speed

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
of think a lot of that student speed

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.660 
of think a lot of that student speed
work<00:02:51.380> that<00:02:51.590> I've<00:02:51.709> been<00:02:51.740> doing<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.400> I've<00:02:52.459> never

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
work that I've been doing so I've never

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.660 
work that I've been doing so I've never
really<00:02:53.000> done<00:02:53.209> speed<00:02:53.870> work<00:02:54.050> before<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:55.340> silly

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
really done speed work before so silly

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.290 
really done speed work before so silly
makes<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.360> felt<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:56.870> good<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.790> decided<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:59.150> go

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
makes that felt so good I decided to go

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.350 
makes that felt so good I decided to go
for<00:02:59.570> a<00:02:59.630> heavy<00:02:59.900> single<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:01.700> missed<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.120> and

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
for a heavy single and I missed it and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.650 
for a heavy single and I missed it and
that<00:03:02.420> really<00:03:03.260> didn't<00:03:03.620> contribute<00:03:04.330> very<00:03:05.330> well

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
that really didn't contribute very well

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.810 
that really didn't contribute very well
to<00:03:05.959> my<00:03:06.200> mood<00:03:06.380> getting<00:03:06.739> better<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:07.760> fact

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.539 
but i really tried to emphasize power
and<00:03:32.150> speed<00:03:32.480> for<00:03:32.510> these<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:33.140> this<00:03:33.320> is<00:03:33.470> 95<00:03:34.040> pounds

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549
