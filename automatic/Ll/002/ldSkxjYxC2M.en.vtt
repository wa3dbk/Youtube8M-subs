with this concept huh what if we did it

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.740 
with this concept huh what if we did it
with<00:05:30.969> the<00:05:31.120> e<00:05:31.150> hmm<00:05:32.080> later<00:05:32.620> c<00:05:32.889> major<00:05:33.099> seven<00:05:33.789> or<00:05:34.690> a

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
with the e hmm later c major seven or a

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.080 
with the e hmm later c major seven or a
c-major<00:05:35.229> scale<00:05:35.409> from<00:05:35.919> the<00:05:36.069> e<00:05:36.099> and<00:05:36.520> going<00:05:36.819> to<00:05:36.969> be

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
c-major scale from the e and going to be

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.930 
c-major scale from the e and going to be
so<00:05:37.629> God<00:05:37.960> C<00:05:38.680> major<00:05:38.860> scale<00:05:39.039> but<00:05:39.699> we're<00:05:39.819> gonna

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
so God C major scale but we're gonna

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.939 
so God C major scale but we're gonna
don't<00:05:40.780> play<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.110> first<00:05:41.319> two<00:05:41.440> minutes<00:05:41.620> just

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
motions so we can clear that same

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:10.909 
motions so we can clear that same
pattern<00:06:00.340> and<00:06:00.460> utilize<00:06:00.759> it

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919
