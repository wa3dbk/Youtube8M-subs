okay what I've got going on here is a
snow<00:00:10.469> anchoring<00:00:11.099> system<00:00:11.960> for<00:00:12.960> my<00:00:13.080> Kodiak

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
snow anchoring system for my Kodiak

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.829 
snow anchoring system for my Kodiak
canvas<00:00:13.830> tent

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
canvas tent

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.680 
canvas tent
it's<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.619> tents<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.130> knock<00:00:17.910> off<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> spring

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
it's the tents a knock off of the spring

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.960 
it's the tents a knock off of the spring
bar<00:00:18.869> tent<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.859> really<00:00:20.189> nice<00:00:20.369> tent<00:00:20.730> I

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
bar tent it's a really nice tent I

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.820 
bar tent it's a really nice tent I
really<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.480> using<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> winter<00:00:22.289> but

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
really like using it in the winter but

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.500 
really like using it in the winter but
the<00:00:22.949> only<00:00:23.160> problem<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:23.910> not<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.090> free

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
the only problem is it's not a free

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.730 
the only problem is it's not a free
standing<00:00:24.570> tent<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.070> has<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.340> be<00:00:26.460> anchored

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
standing tent so it has to be anchored

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.740 
standing tent so it has to be anchored
last<00:00:28.740> year<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.310> tried<00:00:29.609> using<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.000> tent<00:00:30.300> pegs

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
last year I tried using the tent pegs

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.990 
last year I tried using the tent pegs
and<00:00:32.239> that<00:00:33.239> came<00:00:33.450> with<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.350> snow<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.280> it

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and that came with it in the snow and it

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.290 
and that came with it in the snow and it
kind<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.360> worked<00:00:37.910> didn't<00:00:38.910> worked<00:00:39.059> real<00:00:39.270> well

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
kind of worked didn't worked real well

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.260 
kind of worked didn't worked real well
so<00:00:39.780> what<00:00:40.530> I've<00:00:40.649> done<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.890> I've<00:00:41.790> come<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.090> with

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
so what I've done is I've come up with

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.830 
so what I've done is I've come up with
this<00:00:42.390> anchoring<00:00:42.870> system<00:00:43.789> as<00:00:44.789> far<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.300> know<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
this anchoring system as far as I know I

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.200 
this anchoring system as far as I know I
haven't<00:00:46.350> seen<00:00:46.640> anything<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.030> on

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
haven't seen anything like this on

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.910 
haven't seen anything like this on
youtube<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.899> thought<00:00:49.140> I'd<00:00:49.289> share<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.710> I

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
youtube so I thought I'd share it I

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.799 
youtube so I thought I'd share it I
don't<00:00:50.219> like<00:00:50.370> being<00:00:50.850> redundant<00:00:51.180> there's<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.660> lot

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
don't like being redundant there's a lot

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.350 
don't like being redundant there's a lot
of<00:00:51.930> videos<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.730> you<00:00:53.730> see<00:00:53.760> over<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.300> over

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
of videos that you see over and over

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.279 
of videos that you see over and over
again<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.960> same<00:00:55.170> thing<00:00:55.969> I've<00:00:56.969> cut<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.289> 3/4

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
again of the same thing I've cut a 3/4

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.569 
again of the same thing I've cut a 3/4
inch<00:00:58.320> schedule<00:00:59.039> 40<00:00:59.660> PVC<00:01:00.660> pipe<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:02.129> foot<00:01:02.399> long

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
inch schedule 40 PVC pipe one foot long

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.740 
inch schedule 40 PVC pipe one foot long
and<00:01:03.049> that<00:01:04.049> will<00:01:04.290> go<00:01:04.470> down<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> snow

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.850 

basically<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.049> either<00:01:10.200> stomp<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> down

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
basically you can either stomp it down

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.830 
basically you can either stomp it down
into<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.189> snow<00:01:11.250> or<00:01:11.729> cut<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> little<00:01:12.330> trench<00:01:12.659> and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
into the snow or cut a little trench and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.719 
into the snow or cut a little trench and
bury<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.140> there's<00:01:13.680> videos<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.159> how<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.369> do<00:01:14.549> that

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
bury it there's videos on how to do that

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.870 
bury it there's videos on how to do that
and<00:01:15.020> then<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.799> part<00:01:17.130> mainly<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.820> was

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
and then the part mainly that I was

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.560 
and then the part mainly that I was
coming<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:21.060> with<00:01:21.270> was<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:22.880> line<00:01:23.880> tensioner

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
coming up with was this line tensioner

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.050 
coming up with was this line tensioner
now<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.189> piece<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:27.740> half<00:01:28.740> inch

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
now this is just a piece of half inch

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.910 
now this is just a piece of half inch
schedule<00:01:30.060> 40<00:01:30.270> PVC<00:01:30.930> pipe<00:01:32.840> cut<00:01:33.840> 5/8<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.650> an<00:01:34.799> inch

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
schedule 40 PVC pipe cut 5/8 of an inch

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.609 
schedule 40 PVC pipe cut 5/8 of an inch
for<00:01:35.880> width<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.590> then<00:01:37.590> there<00:01:37.860> were<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:39.439> got<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
for width and then there were I got the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.490 
for width and then there were I got the
idea<00:01:40.920> from<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.310> MSR<00:01:43.790> cam<00:01:44.790> tensioners<00:01:45.500> they're

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
idea from the MSR cam tensioners they're

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.870 
idea from the MSR cam tensioners they're
made<00:01:46.710> out<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.890> aluminum<00:01:47.430> they're<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> little

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
made out of aluminum they're a little

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.889 
made out of aluminum they're a little
bit<00:01:48.060> narrower<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:48.960> all<00:01:49.110> they've<00:01:49.290> done<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:50.899> put

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
bit narrower but all they've done is put

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.480 
bit narrower but all they've done is put
a<00:01:52.140> hole<00:01:52.380> straight<00:01:52.680> through<00:01:52.799> all<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> way

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
a hole straight through all the way

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.560 
a hole straight through all the way
through<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> drilled<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.090> holes

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
through with so I drilled the holes

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.649 
through with so I drilled the holes
there<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.140> then<00:01:58.439> 90<00:01:59.070> degrees<00:01:59.369> from<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.759> one

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
there and then 90 degrees from that one

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.319 
there and then 90 degrees from that one
hole<00:02:00.930> straight<00:02:01.229> down<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.880> then<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.149> got<00:02:03.299> a

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
hole straight down and then you got a

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.230 
hole straight down and then you got a
thread<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:05.630> what<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:06.869> that

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.950 

as<00:02:10.240> you<00:02:10.360> go<00:02:10.509> through<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.810> top<00:02:11.050> hole<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:12.960> then

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
as you go through the top hole and then

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.600 
as you go through the top hole and then
you<00:02:14.080> go<00:02:14.200> through<00:02:14.440> one<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.770> side<00:02:14.980> holes<00:02:15.310> it

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
you go through one of the side holes it

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.980 
you go through one of the side holes it
doesn't<00:02:15.880> matter<00:02:16.030> which<00:02:16.210> one<00:02:16.420> cuz<00:02:16.660> you'll<00:02:16.810> come

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
doesn't matter which one cuz you'll come

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.960 
doesn't matter which one cuz you'll come
around<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.500> use<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.770> other<00:02:17.920> one<00:02:18.130> it's<00:02:18.880> a

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
around and use the other one it's a

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.910 
around and use the other one it's a
little<00:02:19.180> bit<00:02:19.300> tricky<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.080> get<00:02:20.320> that<00:02:20.470> fed<00:02:20.770> in

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
little bit tricky to get that fed in

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.200 
little bit tricky to get that fed in
there<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.250> there<00:02:21.370> we<00:02:21.460> go<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:26.760> think<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:28.060> can

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
there and there we go so I think you can

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.430 
there and there we go so I think you can
yeah<00:02:29.490> okay<00:02:30.490> so<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.790> go<00:02:30.880> through<00:02:31.060> there<00:02:31.440> and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
yeah okay so you go through there and

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.120 
yeah okay so you go through there and
you<00:02:32.590> make<00:02:32.740> a<00:02:32.770> loop<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:34.600> come<00:02:35.290> back<00:02:35.320> in<00:02:35.740> the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
you make a loop and you come back in the

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:46.290 
you make a loop and you come back in the
last<00:02:36.370> hole<00:02:36.700> on<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.300> opposite<00:02:37.780> side<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:46.209> you

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
last hole on the opposite side and you

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.610 
last hole on the opposite side and you
just<00:02:46.450> bring<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.780> out<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.020> tie<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.200> knot<00:02:47.380> in<00:02:47.440> it

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
just bring it out and tie a knot in it

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.790 
just bring it out and tie a knot in it
pull<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.220> back<00:02:48.370> in<00:02:48.810> now<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.930> reason<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.290> come<00:02:50.680> up

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
pull it back in now the reason I come up

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.190 
pull it back in now the reason I come up
with<00:02:50.830> these<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.310> because<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:51.989> thought<00:02:52.989> they

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
with these is because I thought they

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.400 
with these is because I thought they
were<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.350> little<00:02:53.530> bit<00:02:53.680> steep<00:02:54.130> on<00:02:54.430> their<00:02:54.850> price

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
were a little bit steep on their price

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.410 
were a little bit steep on their price
there<00:02:56.410> were<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.530> few<00:02:56.800> video<00:02:57.180> reviews<00:02:58.180> saying

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
there were a few video reviews saying

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.300 
there were a few video reviews saying
that<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.690> MSR<00:02:59.170> ones<00:02:59.350> weren't<00:02:59.739> holding<00:02:59.920> very

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
that the MSR ones weren't holding very

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.010 
that the MSR ones weren't holding very
well

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
well

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.370 
well
so<00:03:02.020> then<00:03:03.690> there<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.810> have<00:03:05.020> it

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
so then there you have it

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.290 
so then there you have it
I'm<00:03:06.010> pulling<00:03:06.250> pretty<00:03:06.489> hard<00:03:06.580> on<00:03:06.850> this<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.239> it

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
I'm pulling pretty hard on this and it

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.460 
I'm pulling pretty hard on this and it
doesn't<00:03:07.540> seem<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.810> want<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.989> slide<00:03:08.200> but<00:03:08.440> you

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
doesn't seem to want to slide but you

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:18.720 
doesn't seem to want to slide but you
just<00:03:08.680> can<00:03:09.370> adjust<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:14.340> okay<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:17.310> they<00:03:18.310> they

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
just can adjust that okay so they they

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.750 
just can adjust that okay so they they
were<00:03:19.380> these<00:03:20.380> seem<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.830> hold<00:03:20.980> really<00:03:21.250> well<00:03:21.519> I

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
were these seem to hold really well I

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.670 
were these seem to hold really well I
can't<00:03:22.090> get<00:03:22.239> them<00:03:22.330> to<00:03:22.360> slip<00:03:23.160> so<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.310> idea<00:03:24.640> is

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
can't get them to slip so the idea is

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.960 
can't get them to slip so the idea is
what<00:03:26.680> I'm<00:03:26.799> gonna<00:03:26.920> do<00:03:27.190> is<00:03:27.430> probably<00:03:27.670> get<00:03:27.940> a

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
what I'm gonna do is probably get a

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.130 
what I'm gonna do is probably get a
wooden<00:03:28.269> dowel<00:03:30.060> basically<00:03:31.060> let's<00:03:31.269> use<00:03:31.900> this

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
wooden dowel basically let's use this

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.300 
wooden dowel basically let's use this
I'm<00:03:32.680> not<00:03:32.860> quite<00:03:33.100> finished<00:03:33.340> with<00:03:33.549> them<00:03:35.310> and

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
I'm not quite finished with them and

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.400 
I'm not quite finished with them and
we'll<00:03:36.519> use<00:03:36.730> that<00:03:36.880> as<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.060> toggle<00:03:37.390> and<00:03:38.049> you'll

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
we'll use that as a toggle and you'll

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.430 
we'll use that as a toggle and you'll
put<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:38.680> through<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.220> tent<00:03:40.120> tent<00:03:41.110> stake

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
put that through the tent tent stake

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.620 
put that through the tent tent stake
loop<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.840> tent<00:03:45.180> then<00:03:46.180> you'll<00:03:46.330> take<00:03:46.480> this

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
loop of the tent then you'll take this

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.420 
loop of the tent then you'll take this
other<00:03:46.870> end<00:03:47.140> and<00:03:47.380> bury<00:03:47.890> it<00:03:47.950> down<00:03:48.190> in<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.459> snow

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
other end and bury it down in the snow

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.009 
other end and bury it down in the snow
after<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.730> stomp<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:52.239> in<00:03:52.360> you'll<00:03:52.540> let<00:03:52.690> it<00:03:52.720> set

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
after you stomp it in you'll let it set

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.199 
after you stomp it in you'll let it set
up<00:03:53.049> for<00:03:53.170> a<00:03:53.440> while<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.950> then<00:03:54.610> you<00:03:54.730> can<00:03:54.910> come<00:03:55.090> and

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
up for a while and then you can come and

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:04.450 
up for a while and then you can come and
tighten<00:03:55.570> these<00:03:55.690> up<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:01.060> can<00:04:01.239> loosen

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.860 

anyway<00:04:05.460> you<00:04:05.520> leave<00:04:06.060> some<00:04:06.210> in<00:04:06.270> tighten<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.690> just

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
anyway you leave some in tighten it just

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.860 
anyway you leave some in tighten it just
like<00:04:07.020> any<00:04:07.290> tensioner<00:04:08.240> seems<00:04:09.240> to<00:04:09.420> work<00:04:09.600> pretty

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
like any tensioner seems to work pretty

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.590 
like any tensioner seems to work pretty
good<00:04:13.400> I've<00:04:14.400> got<00:04:14.670> 12<00:04:15.000> of<00:04:15.120> these<00:04:15.240> because

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
there's 12 tie out points on those

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.600 
there's 12 tie out points on those
canvas<00:04:17.700> tents<00:04:18.060> when<00:04:18.420> I've<00:04:18.570> got<00:04:18.780> two<00:04:18.930> 10<00:04:19.110> by<00:04:19.260> 10

like<00:04:20.610> I<00:04:20.730> said<00:04:20.940> it's<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.180> really<00:04:21.470> pretty<00:04:22.470> good

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
like I said it's a really pretty good

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.310 
like I said it's a really pretty good
tent<00:04:22.980> I<00:04:23.100> really<00:04:23.490> like<00:04:23.700> it<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:24.090> little<00:04:24.840> quite<00:04:25.290> a

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
tent I really like it a little quite a

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.050 
tent I really like it a little quite a
bit<00:04:25.530> at<00:04:26.280> least<00:04:26.520> I<00:04:27.920> wouldn't<00:04:28.920> say<00:04:29.040> half<00:04:29.280> is<00:04:29.490> half

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
bit at least I wouldn't say half is half

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.060 
bit at least I wouldn't say half is half
as<00:04:30.270> much<00:04:30.450> as<00:04:30.630> a<00:04:30.660> spring<00:04:31.260> bar<00:04:31.440> but<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:31.680> think<00:04:31.950> it

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
as much as a spring bar but I think it

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.310 
as much as a spring bar but I think it
pretty<00:04:32.250> much<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:32.700> for<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.090> same<00:04:33.300> size<00:04:36.320> but

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
pretty much is for the same size but

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.650 
pretty much is for the same size but
that's<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.650> little<00:04:38.630> little<00:04:39.630> cam<00:04:40.170> ring<00:04:41.660> line

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
that's the little little cam ring line

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.010 
that's the little little cam ring line

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
it I just drew some lines on here so I

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.090 
it I just drew some lines on here so I
could<00:05:41.720> know<00:05:42.720> where<00:05:42.900> to<00:05:42.990> put<00:05:43.140> my<00:05:43.169> holes<00:05:43.530> get
