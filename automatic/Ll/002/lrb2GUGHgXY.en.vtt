00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
little difficult to get the spline in be

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.590 
little difficult to get the spline in be
alright<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.280> place<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.520> piece<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:24.030> wood<00:02:24.150> on<00:02:24.330> top

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
alright to place a piece of wood on top

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.750 
alright to place a piece of wood on top
of<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.870> spline<00:02:25.200> gently<00:02:25.860> tap<00:02:26.130> down<00:02:26.490> into

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
of the spline gently tap down into

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.910 
of the spline gently tap down into
position<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:28.200> pretty<00:02:28.440> much<00:02:28.530> have<00:02:28.710> it

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
position and you pretty much have it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.640 
position and you pretty much have it
accomplished<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:30.780> takes<00:02:31.110> care<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
six-inch D logs and from here we're

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.190 
six-inch D logs and from here we're
going<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.340> move<00:02:35.520> on<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:36.030> show<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.630> some<00:02:36.960> of<00:02:37.080> the
