I'm<00:00:19.650> really<00:00:19.980> excited<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:20.640> thermal<00:00:21.539> circuit

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
I'm really excited for thermal circuit

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.960 
I'm really excited for thermal circuit
all<00:00:22.140> right<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.680> says<00:00:22.830> beyblade<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.730> metal

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
all right so it says beyblade that metal

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.730 
all right so it says beyblade that metal
feels<00:00:24.210> your<00:00:24.330> metal<00:00:24.570> masters<00:00:24.930> keep<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.380> simple

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740

found out so there's this little hole in
the<00:01:08.460> mini<00:01:08.670> beyblade<00:01:09.600> package<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.290> think<00:01:10.799> they

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the mini beyblade package I think they

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.800 
the mini beyblade package I think they
made<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.460> purpose<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.450> what<00:01:12.600> you're<00:01:12.720> gonna

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
made it on purpose so what you're gonna

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.380 
made it on purpose so what you're gonna
do<00:01:13.080> you're<00:01:13.680> gonna<00:01:13.799> use<00:01:14.040> epic<00:01:14.670> scissors<00:01:15.150> that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
do you're gonna use epic scissors that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.670 
do you're gonna use epic scissors that
are<00:01:15.540> worthy<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.939> these<00:01:18.650> and<00:01:19.650> you

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
are worthy of you like these and you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:46.069 
are worthy of you like these and you
should<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.369> able<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.640> somehow<00:01:44.869> don't<00:01:45.869> take<00:01:46.049> a

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
should be able to somehow don't take a

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:55.010 
should be able to somehow don't take a
week<00:01:46.470> or<00:01:46.680> anything<00:01:48.799> here's<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> paper<00:01:54.020> I'm

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
week or anything here's the paper I'm

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.420 
week or anything here's the paper I'm
going<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:55.560> most<00:01:55.770> boring<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> most

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
going for most boring to most

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.030 
going for most boring to most
interesting<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.149> here's<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.960> rip<00:01:58.140> cord<00:01:58.380> highly

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
interesting so here's a rip cord highly

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.310 
interesting so here's a rip cord highly
bent<00:01:59.340> but<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.630> cool<00:02:00.780> rip<00:02:00.960> cord

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.900 
color don't know how it goes with
thermal<00:02:13.730> assertive<00:02:14.209> but<00:02:14.530> yeah<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:15.830> really<00:02:16.459> like

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
thermal assertive but yeah I really like

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.680 
thermal assertive but yeah I really like
the<00:02:17.030> color<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.860> finally<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.370> thermal<00:02:20.060> assert

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
the color and finally a thermal assert

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.130

the spin track I'm on a mini beyblade

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.110 
the spin track I'm on a mini beyblade
will<00:02:54.680> be<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.830> circle<00:02:55.519> of<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.760> color<00:02:55.940> of<00:02:56.060> the

will be a circle of the color of the
spin<00:02:56.360> track<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:57.350> little<00:02:57.650> bit<00:02:57.800> of<00:02:57.950> the

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
spin track and a little bit of the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.210 
spin track and a little bit of the
whatever<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:59.569> on<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.900> spin<00:03:00.110> track<00:03:00.350> this<00:03:00.890> in

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
whatever is on the spin track this in

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.100 
whatever is on the spin track this in
this<00:03:01.459> case<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.970> wings<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:02.510> stick<00:03:02.720> out<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:02.900> it

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
this case the wings that stick out of it

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.430 
this case the wings that stick out of it
I<00:03:03.310> really<00:03:04.310> like<00:03:04.519> it<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:04.910> then<00:03:05.510> HF<00:03:05.989> tip<00:03:06.260> it's

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
I really like it and then HF tip it's

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.600 
I really like it and then HF tip it's
more<00:03:06.680> like<00:03:06.829> a<00:03:06.860> flat<00:03:07.130> tip<00:03:08.500> so<00:03:09.500> it'll<00:03:10.010> will<00:03:10.220> act<00:03:10.489> a

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
more like a flat tip so it'll will act a

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.780 
more like a flat tip so it'll will act a
little<00:03:10.730> aggressive<00:03:11.560> in<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.680> stadium<00:03:13.130> at

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
little aggressive in the stadium at

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.930 
little aggressive in the stadium at
least<00:03:14.030> for<00:03:14.239> a<00:03:14.269> mini<00:03:14.510> beyblade<00:03:14.989> after<00:03:15.320> all<00:03:15.940> so

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
least for a mini beyblade after all so

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.220 
least for a mini beyblade after all so
let's<00:03:17.360> put<00:03:17.720> on<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.900> stop<00:03:18.290> sign<00:03:20.079> including<00:03:21.079> my

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
let's put on the stop sign including my

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.840 
let's put on the stop sign including my
epic<00:03:21.680> this<00:03:21.799> is<00:03:21.950> odds<00:03:22.130> of<00:03:22.459> next<00:03:22.730> no.1<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:24.850> take

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
epic this is odds of next no.1 and take

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.870 
epic this is odds of next no.1 and take
out<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.209> bb10<00:03:26.600> stadium<00:03:27.519> maybe<00:03:28.519> I'll<00:03:28.700> get<00:03:28.820> a

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
out the bb10 stadium maybe I'll get a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.699 
out the bb10 stadium maybe I'll get a
mini<00:03:29.450> beyblade<00:03:29.870> stadium<00:03:30.320> there's<00:03:31.220> such<00:03:31.370> thing

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
mini beyblade stadium there's such thing

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.910 
mini beyblade stadium there's such thing
alright<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:35.079> check<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.200> recording<00:03:36.650> on<00:03:36.829> the

alright so check the recording on the
side<00:03:37.250> for<00:03:37.579> a<00:03:37.670> minute<00:03:37.730> beyblade<00:03:40.420> comes<00:03:41.420> out<00:03:41.600> on

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
side for a minute beyblade comes out on
