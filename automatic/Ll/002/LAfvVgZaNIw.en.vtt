00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.760
 well here's the processor inside the tiger 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:21.289
 key 1 well on the sides here is a connector named dima 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.289
 and yusbi headphone jack 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.740
 so the power button and volume rocker 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.550
 and micro sd cards but also in the tablet 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.879
 There is a stylus that allows in general 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.469
 very interesting to draw and special 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.640
 applications are not video gabler here and 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.160
 depending on the force of depression you can 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.899
 correspondingly varied denis 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.120
 will draw the whole application in it 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:58.350
 more to deal with mass 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:00.449
 all sorts of functions so turn off so 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.739
 we are the main feature more precisely 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.110
 the purpose of the tablet in general is 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.119
 there will probably be games here on this already 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.590
 The game Tranin 2 is launched on it 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.170
 connected gamepad which can 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.240
 purchased with the tablet's Well 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.250
 slightly adjust the graphics because 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.340
 very cool like right in computer 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.340
 the game 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.200
 gamepad in its form resembles in general 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.710
 then right there 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.300
 which is on the original shelby here 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.500
 about the location of the buttons all the same 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.200
 the very thing here is the only button plus 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.170
 there is a minus separation here 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.870
 microphone there are buttons for android these 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.160
 buttons here 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:58.490
 back play home here is for headset 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.840

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.320

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.860
 everything is like the bruises of himself ie if 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.430

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.459
 here it is all there are tons much easier 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.130
 because it's just that simple 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.050
 the controller is that just to manage 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.350
 by the way from the controller are also compatible with 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.410
 by the shield itself the next update should 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.540
 This option appears to connect 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.150
 It works not through bluetooth but through 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.940
 Wi-Fi direct, respectively, less 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.350
 Delay Well, as you clicked right away 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.350
