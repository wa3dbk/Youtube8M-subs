basically<00:01:28.610> ace<00:01:28.790> combat<00:01:29.120> assault<00:01:29.510> horizon

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
basically ace combat assault horizon

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.390 
basically ace combat assault horizon
legacy<00:01:30.440> Pretender<00:01:31.040> 3ds<00:01:31.570> is<00:01:32.650> actually<00:01:33.650> more<00:01:34.070> of

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
legacy Pretender 3ds is actually more of

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.220 
legacy Pretender 3ds is actually more of
an<00:01:34.790> ace<00:01:34.910> combat<00:01:35.120> game<00:01:35.480> how<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.720> mixin<00:01:36.080> is

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
an ace combat game how the mixin is

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.600 
an ace combat game how the mixin is
structured<00:01:36.620> the<00:01:36.710> men<00:01:36.860> music<00:01:37.130> structured<00:01:37.520> is

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
structured the men music structured is

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.970 
structured the men music structured is
more<00:01:38.060> of<00:01:38.120> a<00:01:38.180> classic<00:01:38.570> ace<00:01:38.930> combat<00:01:39.230> game<00:01:39.590> I<00:01:39.620> like

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
more of a classic ace combat game I like

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.360 
more of a classic ace combat game I like
the<00:01:40.520> design<00:01:40.730> on<00:01:40.940> this<00:01:41.390> one<00:01:41.660> a<00:01:41.690> lot<00:01:42.050> more<00:01:42.620> than

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
the design on this one a lot more than

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.310 
the design on this one a lot more than
the<00:01:43.730> 360<00:01:44.240> version<00:01:44.270> maybe<00:01:44.600> cuz<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:44.960> basically

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
the 360 version maybe cuz you basically

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.450 
the 360 version maybe cuz you basically
by<00:01:45.530> different<00:01:45.860> plane<00:01:45.980> to<00:01:46.100> unlock<00:01:46.310> different

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
by different plane to unlock different

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.830 
by different plane to unlock different
parts<00:01:46.790> you<00:01:46.850> can<00:01:46.880> upgrade<00:01:47.150> them<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.570> can<00:01:47.690> pre

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
parts you can upgrade them you can pre

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.050 
parts you can upgrade them you can pre
play<00:01:48.020> missions<00:01:48.440> and<00:01:48.620> it<00:01:49.130> just<00:01:49.310> feels<00:01:49.610> more

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
play missions and it just feels more

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.060 
play missions and it just feels more
like<00:01:50.120> an<00:01:50.360> ace<00:01:50.450> combat<00:01:50.750> game<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.680> visuals<00:01:52.010> are

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
like an ace combat game the visuals are

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.890 
like an ace combat game the visuals are
cool<00:01:52.310> in<00:01:52.400> 3d<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.760> like<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.300> of<00:01:53.450> course<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:53.750> does

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
cool in 3d I like that of course it does

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.090 
cool in 3d I like that of course it does
take<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.110> little<00:01:54.230> bit<00:01:54.409> getting<00:01:54.650> used<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.950> like

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
take a little bit getting used to like

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.090 
take a little bit getting used to like
it's<00:01:56.060> limited<00:01:56.600> control<00:01:56.960> wise<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:57.650> visualized

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
it's limited control wise and visualized

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.560 
it's limited control wise and visualized
with<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.640> limitations<00:01:59.090> of<00:01:59.300> a<00:01:59.390> hangnail

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
with the limitations of a hangnail

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.149 
with the limitations of a hangnail
that's<00:01:59.990> just<00:02:00.170> noticeable<00:02:00.590> but<00:02:00.800> it's<00:02:00.950> kind<00:02:01.130> of

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
that's just noticeable but it's kind of

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.380 
that's just noticeable but it's kind of
fun<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.400> definitely<00:02:01.729> has<00:02:01.820> like<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:01.970> dogfight

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
fun it definitely has like a dogfight

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.480 
fun it definitely has like a dogfight
mechanic<00:02:02.810> like<00:02:02.930> that<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.320> 3d<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:04.010> 360

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
mechanic like that the 3d the 360

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.250 
mechanic like that the 3d the 360
version<00:02:04.520> has<00:02:04.909> but<00:02:05.540> it<00:02:05.630> just<00:02:05.750> felt<00:02:05.870> more<00:02:06.080> like<00:02:06.200> a

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
version has but it just felt more like a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.139 
version has but it just felt more like a
true<00:02:06.770> ace<00:02:06.979> combat<00:02:07.280> game<00:02:07.610> like<00:02:07.760> ace<00:02:07.909> combat

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
true ace combat game like ace combat

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.540 
true ace combat game like ace combat
joint<00:02:08.539> assault<00:02:08.810> on<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:09.110> PSP<00:02:09.379> it's<00:02:10.099> sad<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.369> say

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
joint assault on the PSP it's sad to say

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.970 
joint assault on the PSP it's sad to say
those<00:02:10.789> games<00:02:10.970> are<00:02:11.060> probably<00:02:11.300> more<00:02:11.469> fun<00:02:12.469> in<00:02:12.709> a

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
those games are probably more fun in a

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.709 
those games are probably more fun in a
better<00:02:13.340> ace<00:02:13.519> combat<00:02:13.730> games<00:02:14.090> in<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:14.299> 360

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:14.719 
better ace combat games in the 360

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.330 
better ace combat games in the 360
