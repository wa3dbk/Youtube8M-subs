like a spiral curl it's not really a
body<00:00:17.940> wave<00:00:18.180> most<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.690> them<00:00:18.810> have<00:00:19.020> like<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> s<00:00:19.710> way

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
body wave most of them have like a s way

body wave most of them have like a s way
this<00:00:20.609> one<00:00:20.789> actually<00:00:20.939> has<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.300> spiral<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:22.109> it

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
you get a nice piece like this it's got

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.190 
you get a nice piece like this it's got
the<00:00:36.750> nice<00:00:36.870> spiral<00:00:37.940> wave<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:40.020> these<00:00:40.140> are

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
the nice spiral wave to it and these are

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.040 
the nice spiral wave to it and these are
20<00:00:40.890> inches<00:00:41.160> long<00:00:41.629> this<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.840> color<00:00:43.140> 6<00:00:43.649> 6<00:00:43.860> 13<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.989> I

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
20 inches long this is color 6 6 13 so I

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.479 
20 inches long this is color 6 6 13 so I
think<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.270> 7<00:00:48.270> inch<00:00:48.390> piece<00:00:49.489> then

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
think this is like the 7 inch piece then

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.270 
think this is like the 7 inch piece then
you<00:00:50.700> get<00:00:50.879> another<00:00:53.960> nice<00:00:54.960> wide<00:00:55.530> piece<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.250> think

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
you get another nice wide piece I think

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.660 
you get another nice wide piece I think
this<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.610> 7<00:00:57.030> inches<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:58.670> then<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:01.670> these

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
this is 7 inches and then you get these

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.350 
this is 7 inches and then you get these
smaller<00:01:03.420> pieces<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:04.290> your<00:01:04.379> face<00:01:04.589> there's<00:01:05.159> one

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:19.609 

two<00:01:15.020> three<00:01:16.020> four<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.930> then<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.990> whole<00:01:19.380> another

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
two three four and then a whole another

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.190 
two three four and then a whole another
big<00:01:20.100> settlement<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.030> I'm<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> pull

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
big settlement but I'm going to pull

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.929 
big settlement but I'm going to pull
apart<00:01:24.439> this<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.590> another<00:01:25.830> big<00:01:26.159> wide<00:01:26.400> piece<00:01:26.700> I

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
apart this is another big wide piece I

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.810 
apart this is another big wide piece I
think<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.240> eight<00:01:27.600> inches<00:01:28.430> see<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.490> has<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
think this eight inches see it has the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.770 
think this eight inches see it has the
clips

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.560 

and<00:01:35.780> more<00:01:36.110> I<00:01:36.500> think<00:01:37.160> that<00:01:37.310> there's<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:37.880> total<00:01:38.390> of

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
and more I think that there's a total of

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.250 
and more I think that there's a total of
twelve<00:01:38.930> pieces<00:01:39.230> here<00:01:39.620> so<00:01:39.860> it's<00:01:39.980> a<00:01:40.010> lot<00:01:40.100> of<00:01:40.130> hair

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
twelve pieces here so it's a lot of hair

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.900 
twelve pieces here so it's a lot of hair
this<00:01:42.260> is<00:01:42.500> I<00:01:43.240> think<00:01:44.240> a<00:01:44.950> six-inch<00:01:45.950> piece<00:01:46.250> another

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
this is I think a six-inch piece another

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.510 
this is I think a six-inch piece another
six<00:01:47.270> inch<00:01:47.450> piece<00:01:47.980> and<00:01:48.980> then<00:01:49.640> some<00:01:51.520> small

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
six inch piece and then some small

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.200 
six inch piece and then some small
pieces<00:01:52.760> these<00:01:53.120> are<00:01:53.300> nice<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.720> thick<00:01:53.900> too
