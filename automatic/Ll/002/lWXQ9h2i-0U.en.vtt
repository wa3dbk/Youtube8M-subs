you

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.070 

or<00:01:04.550> a<00:01:04.580> speak<00:01:05.059> tire<00:01:05.210> shootout<00:01:05.630> I<00:01:05.659> think<00:01:05.960> this

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
or a speak tire shootout I think this

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.740 
or a speak tire shootout I think this
perform<00:01:06.409> really<00:01:06.590> well<00:01:07.450> predictable<00:01:08.450> and<00:01:08.600> easy

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
perform really well predictable and easy

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.390 
perform really well predictable and easy
to<00:01:08.900> drive<00:01:09.020> I<00:01:09.200> rely<00:01:09.440> on<00:01:09.560> evasive<00:01:09.950> motorsports

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
to drive I rely on evasive motorsports

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.090 
to drive I rely on evasive motorsports
for<00:01:10.729> their<00:01:11.030> custom<00:01:11.540> shocks<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.140> coil<00:01:12.800> overs

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
for their custom shocks and coil overs

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.690 
for their custom shocks and coil overs
so<00:01:13.850> they<00:01:14.090> do<00:01:14.240> my<00:01:14.390> alignment<00:01:14.660> so<00:01:15.550> they<00:01:16.550> really

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
so they do my alignment so they really

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.310 
so they do my alignment so they really
set<00:01:16.940> my<00:01:17.060> car<00:01:17.270> open<00:01:17.510> it<00:01:17.630> was<00:01:17.750> really<00:01:17.990> easy<00:01:18.020> to

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
set my car open it was really easy to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.760 
set my car open it was really easy to
buy<00:01:18.470> it<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:18.830> 2004<00:01:19.790> on<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.210> s2000<00:01:20.780> it's<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.590> daily

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
buy it so 2004 on the s2000 it's a daily

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.640 
buy it so 2004 on the s2000 it's a daily
driven<00:01:22.040> car<00:01:22.340> basically<00:01:23.530> focuses<00:01:24.530> on

suspension<00:01:25.100> rather<00:01:25.400> than<00:01:25.550> part<00:01:25.790> so<00:01:26.030> it's

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
suspension rather than part so it's

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.300 
suspension rather than part so it's
really<00:01:26.300> reliable<00:01:26.660> and<00:01:27.050> it's<00:01:27.770> also<00:01:27.950> small

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
really reliable and it's also small
