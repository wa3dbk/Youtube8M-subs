go<00:01:30.420> ahead<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.720> jump<00:01:30.840> right<00:01:30.900> into<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.470> pinky

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
go ahead and jump right into this pinky

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.490 
go ahead and jump right into this pinky
in<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.979> brain<00:01:32.189> theory<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.360> theory<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.960> that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
in the brain theory the theory is that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.469 
in the brain theory the theory is that
pinky<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.340> actually<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.790> genius<00:01:36.150> whereas

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
pinky is actually the genius whereas

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.480 
pinky is actually the genius whereas
brain<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> one<00:01:38.159> that's<00:01:38.310> not

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
brain is actually the one that's not

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.109 
brain is actually the one that's not
smart<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.200> I<00:01:40.200> know<00:01:40.650> maybe<00:01:40.950> not<00:01:41.250> me<00:01:41.610> makes<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
smart and I know maybe not me makes the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.670 
smart and I know maybe not me makes the
most<00:01:42.240> sense<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.600> guys<00:01:42.780> right<00:01:43.049> away<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.350> mean

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
most sense to you guys right away I mean

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.530 
most sense to you guys right away I mean
his<00:01:44.100> name<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.399> brain<00:01:44.729> he<00:01:45.119> seems<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.450> doing

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
his name is brain he seems to be doing

his name is brain he seems to be doing
all<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> mathematical<00:01:46.229> calculations<00:01:46.829> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
all the mathematical calculations and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.249 
all the mathematical calculations and
pinky<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:48.570> seems<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> kooky

the world but um first of all let's get
a<00:01:56.100> little<00:01:56.219> background<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.820> what<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> show<00:01:57.240> is

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
a little background of what the show is

a little background of what the show is
I<00:01:57.420> know<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:57.630> kind<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.869> older<00:01:58.049> not<00:01:58.200> everyone

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
I know it's kind of older not everyone

the world on a daily basis and his plans

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.330 
the world on a daily basis and his plans
always<00:02:19.020> fail<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.500> course<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:19.980> it's<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> funny

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
always fail of course and it's a funny

always fail of course and it's a funny
whatever<00:02:20.970> show<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:21.810> um<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.620> theory<00:02:22.860> goes

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
whatever show but um this theory goes

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
whatever show but um this theory goes
into<00:02:23.520> why<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.420> totally<00:02:24.870> possible<00:02:24.900> that

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
into why it is totally possible that

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.850 
into why it is totally possible that
brain<00:02:27.120> was<00:02:27.360> actually<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.170> dumb<00:02:28.410> one<00:02:28.650> and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
brain was actually the dumb one and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.510 
brain was actually the dumb one and
pinky<00:02:29.310> was<00:02:29.430> actually<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.910> genius<00:02:30.360> now<00:02:31.520> this

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
pinky was actually the genius now this

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.910 
pinky was actually the genius now this
theory<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.180> completely<00:02:33.390> based<00:02:34.020> off<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
theory is completely based off of the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.030 
theory is completely based off of the
theme<00:02:35.670> song<00:02:35.700> for<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.450> cartoon<00:02:36.930> which<00:02:37.680> there's

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
theme song for the cartoon which there's

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.010 
theme song for the cartoon which there's
a<00:02:38.130> line<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.490> goes<00:02:38.550> quote<00:02:38.940> one<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.570> a<00:02:39.600> genius

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
a line that goes quote one is a genius

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.740 
a line that goes quote one is a genius
and<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.800> other<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.130> insane<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.510> doesn't

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
and the other is insane but it doesn't

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.390 
and the other is insane but it doesn't
specify<00:02:42.959> which<00:02:43.470> ones<00:02:43.709> which<00:02:43.980> doesn't<00:02:44.280> say

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
specify which ones which doesn't say

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.770 
specify which ones which doesn't say
which<00:02:44.580> one's<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:45.060> genius<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.510> which<00:02:45.600> ones

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
which one's a genius and which ones

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.530 
which one's a genius and which ones
insane<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.470> just<00:02:46.650> leads<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.510> presume<00:02:48.510> that

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
insane it just leads you to presume that

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.120 
insane it just leads you to presume that
the<00:02:48.900> one<00:02:49.050> with<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.230> giant<00:02:49.500> brain<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.980> ones

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
the one with a giant brain the ones

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.850 
the one with a giant brain the ones
doing<00:02:50.400> math<00:02:50.610> whole<00:02:50.820> time<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:52.170> one<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.709> is

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
doing math whole time is the one that is

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.970 
doing math whole time is the one that is
indeed<00:02:53.160> smart<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.000> one<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.840> know

thought<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.420> makes<00:03:09.660> sense<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.959> me<00:03:10.080> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
thought that makes sense to me the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
thought that makes sense to me the
person<00:03:10.470> that's<00:03:10.530> trying<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.800> take<00:03:10.890> over<00:03:11.010> the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
person that's trying to take over the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.010 
person that's trying to take over the
world<00:03:11.280> on<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.640> daily<00:03:11.940> basis<00:03:12.270> it's<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.780> little

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
world on a daily basis it's a little

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.990 
world on a daily basis it's a little
more<00:03:13.140> bit<00:03:13.530> more<00:03:13.800> insane<00:03:14.220> than<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.520> guy<00:03:14.670> that

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
more bit more insane than the guy that

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.140 
more bit more insane than the guy that
lets<00:03:15.780> say<00:03:16.020> says<00:03:16.920> weird<00:03:17.340> things<00:03:17.670> are<00:03:17.820> from<00:03:17.970> time

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
lets say says weird things are from time

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.259 
lets say says weird things are from time
to<00:03:18.269> time<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.860> by<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:20.100> logic<00:03:20.340> my<00:03:21.000> modus

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
to time and by that logic my modus

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.580 
to time and by that logic my modus
ponens<00:03:21.299> if<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.780> know<00:03:21.870> what<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.080> head<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.380> I

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
ponens if you know what the head is I

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.460 
ponens if you know what the head is I
doubt<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.310> but<00:03:23.489> if<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:23.910> do<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.180> funny<00:03:24.470> it

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
doubt it but if you do it's funny it

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.660 
doubt it but if you do it's funny it
follows<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.220> if<00:03:27.650> brain<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:28.860> indeed<00:03:29.190> insane

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
follows that if brain is indeed insane

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.920 
follows that if brain is indeed insane
then<00:03:30.660> therefore<00:03:31.280> pinky<00:03:32.280> must<00:03:32.790> be<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> genius

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
then therefore pinky must be a genius

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.150 
then therefore pinky must be a genius
because<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.350> says<00:03:34.470> right<00:03:34.500> then<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:34.799> theme<00:03:34.980> song

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
because it says right then a theme song

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.590 
because it says right then a theme song
one<00:03:35.519> two<00:03:35.700> genius<00:03:36.060> one's<00:03:36.739> insane<00:03:37.739> so<00:03:38.670> by<00:03:39.420> that

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
one two genius one's insane so by that

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.729 
one two genius one's insane so by that
logic<00:03:40.640> pinky<00:03:41.640> has<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.600> be<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:43.140> genius<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
logic pinky has to be the genius of the

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.210 
logic pinky has to be the genius of the
two<00:03:43.890> just<00:03:44.489> because<00:03:44.790> he's<00:03:45.209> not<00:03:45.420> insane<00:03:46.220> there's

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
two just because he's not insane there's

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.229 
two just because he's not insane there's
a<00:03:47.250> little<00:03:47.459> more<00:03:47.580> evidence<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:47.940> want<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.120> get

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
a little more evidence I want to get

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.850 
a little more evidence I want to get
into<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.720> I'll<00:03:48.780> show<00:03:49.260> some<00:03:49.410> pictures<00:03:49.530> here

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
little thing it shows up in front of

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.420 
little thing it shows up in front of
your<00:04:34.830> peeler<00:04:35.639> you're<00:04:35.729> standing<00:04:35.940> behind<00:04:36.060> and

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
your peeler you're standing behind and

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.430 
your peeler you're standing behind and
brain<00:04:38.430> wrote<00:04:38.669> his<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.240> it's<00:04:39.449> barely<00:04:40.259> legible

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
brain wrote his and it's barely legible

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.680 
brain wrote his and it's barely legible
and<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:41.520> can<00:04:41.669> barely<00:04:42.120> make<00:04:42.210> out<00:04:42.389> what<00:04:42.539> it<00:04:42.659> says

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
and you can barely make out what it says

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.140 
and you can barely make out what it says
so<00:04:43.680> that's<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.039> and<00:04:44.250> lead<00:04:44.759> me<00:04:44.909> to<00:04:45.030> believe

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
so that's the and lead me to believe

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.510 
so that's the and lead me to believe
that<00:04:45.300> if<00:04:45.569> you<00:04:45.629> can<00:04:45.780> barely<00:04:46.710> write<00:04:46.979> that<00:04:47.430> he

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
that if you can barely write that he

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.790 
that if you can barely write that he
probably<00:04:48.180> can't<00:04:48.659> read<00:04:48.840> because<00:04:49.020> pinky<00:04:49.500> had<00:04:49.650> to

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
probably can't read because pinky had to

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.730 
probably can't read because pinky had to
read<00:04:50.039> to<00:04:50.610> him<00:04:51.139> for<00:04:52.139> in<00:04:52.259> order<00:04:52.470> for<00:04:52.590> him<00:04:52.710> to

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
read to him for in order for him to

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.860 
read to him for in order for him to
study<00:04:53.009> for<00:04:53.340> that<00:04:53.490> so<00:04:54.360> that's<00:04:54.569> just<00:04:54.659> another

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
study for that so that's just another

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.330 
study for that so that's just another
thing<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.289> point<00:04:55.470> out<00:04:55.650> right<00:04:55.800> there<00:04:56.039> it<00:04:56.190> may

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
thing to point out right there it may

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.279 
thing to point out right there it may
not<00:04:56.460> be<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.699> best<00:04:56.879> but<00:04:57.569> if<00:04:57.750> another<00:04:58.080> thing<00:04:58.229> to

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
not be the best but if another thing to

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.080 
not be the best but if another thing to
look<00:04:58.379> at<00:04:58.560> is<00:04:58.800> that<00:04:58.830> every<00:04:59.370> episode<00:04:59.729> it

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
look at is that every episode it

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.450 
look at is that every episode it
basically<00:05:00.599> goes<00:05:00.720> like<00:05:00.810> this<00:05:01.080> brain<00:05:02.009> comes<00:05:02.340> up

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
basically goes like this brain comes up

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.730 
basically goes like this brain comes up
with<00:05:02.550> a<00:05:02.610> plan<00:05:03.020> pinky<00:05:04.020> makes<00:05:04.349> some<00:05:04.500> kind<00:05:04.650> of

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
with a plan pinky makes some kind of

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.159 
with a plan pinky makes some kind of
relevant<00:05:05.340> observation<00:05:06.030> but<00:05:06.360> brain<00:05:06.690> basically

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
relevant observation but brain basically

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.050 
relevant observation but brain basically
blows<00:05:07.620> it<00:05:07.830> off<00:05:07.949> saying<00:05:08.400> that<00:05:08.610> you<00:05:08.729> know<00:05:08.849> you're

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
blows it off saying that you know you're

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.170 
blows it off saying that you know you're
an<00:05:09.120> idiot<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.449> don't<00:05:09.509> talking<00:05:09.900> about<00:05:11.090> but<00:05:12.090> in

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
an idiot you don't talking about but in

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.620 
an idiot you don't talking about but in
the<00:05:12.270> end

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
the end

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.110 
the end
pinky<00:05:13.470> turns<00:05:13.650> out<00:05:13.770> to<00:05:13.860> be<00:05:13.889> right<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.400> brains

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
pinky turns out to be right and brains

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.050 
pinky turns out to be right and brains
idea<00:05:15.599> always<00:05:16.080> fails<00:05:16.710> because<00:05:17.220> he<00:05:17.520> ignored

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
idea always fails because he ignored

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.270 
idea always fails because he ignored
pinky's<00:05:18.569> suggestions<00:05:19.319> if<00:05:19.650> you<00:05:19.949> would<00:05:20.099> always

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
pinky's suggestions if you would always

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.950 
pinky's suggestions if you would always
just<00:05:20.580> listen<00:05:20.819> to<00:05:20.880> pinky<00:05:21.180> he<00:05:21.539> probably<00:05:21.750> would

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
just listen to pinky he probably would

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.300 
just listen to pinky he probably would
have<00:05:21.990> succeeded<00:05:22.319> in<00:05:22.590> taking<00:05:22.740> over<00:05:23.039> the<00:05:23.130> world

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
have succeeded in taking over the world

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.490 
have succeeded in taking over the world
because<00:05:23.580> pinky<00:05:24.389> makes<00:05:24.569> him<00:05:24.719> actually<00:05:25.169> some

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
because pinky makes him actually some

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.020 
because pinky makes him actually some
pretty<00:05:25.740> witty<00:05:25.949> suggestions<00:05:26.550> in<00:05:26.669> some<00:05:26.909> of<00:05:26.969> the

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
pretty witty suggestions in some of the

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.730 
pretty witty suggestions in some of the
episodes<00:05:27.419> they<00:05:27.659> make<00:05:27.810> a<00:05:27.840> lot<00:05:28.139> of<00:05:28.169> sense<00:05:28.440> and

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
episodes they make a lot of sense and

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.010 
episodes they make a lot of sense and
you<00:05:29.430> think<00:05:29.669> about<00:05:29.849> it<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.240> I<00:05:30.599> mean<00:05:30.780> they<00:05:30.900> may

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
you think about it and I mean they may

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.839 
you think about it and I mean they may
sound<00:05:31.229> dumb<00:05:31.560> when<00:05:31.860> you<00:05:31.919> first<00:05:32.190> listen<00:05:32.610> to<00:05:32.729> him

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
sound dumb when you first listen to him

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:34.850 
sound dumb when you first listen to him
but<00:05:33.479> apparently<00:05:34.380> he<00:05:34.560> knows<00:05:34.680> what<00:05:34.770> he's

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
but apparently he knows what he's

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.890 
but apparently he knows what he's
talking<00:05:35.190> about<00:05:35.250> because<00:05:35.550> he<00:05:36.419> always<00:05:36.630> seems

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
talking about because he always seems

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.120 
talking about because he always seems
right<00:05:37.259> at<00:05:37.409> the<00:05:37.469> end<00:05:37.560> of<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.680> episode<00:05:37.740> he's

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
right at the end of the episode he's

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.740 
right at the end of the episode he's
always<00:05:38.280> got<00:05:38.490> that<00:05:38.520> I<00:05:38.729> told<00:05:38.969> you<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:39.360> look<00:05:39.630> on

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
always got that I told you so look on

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.969 
always got that I told you so look on
his<00:05:39.870> face<00:05:40.050> but<00:05:42.229> basically<00:05:43.229> he<00:05:43.650> doesn't<00:05:43.889> really

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
his face but basically he doesn't really

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.230 
his face but basically he doesn't really
care<00:05:44.250> he's<00:05:44.520> not<00:05:44.639> trying<00:05:44.759> to<00:05:44.909> take<00:05:45.029> over<00:05:45.120> the

care he's not trying to take over the

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.320 
care he's not trying to take over the
world<00:05:45.360> so<00:05:45.509> it<00:05:45.569> doesn't<00:05:45.779> care<00:05:46.110> if<00:05:46.409> brain

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330

brain<00:06:26.159> had<00:06:26.400> basically<00:06:26.789> been<00:06:26.909> putting<00:06:27.630> him<00:06:27.750> off

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
brain had basically been putting him off

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.360 
brain had basically been putting him off
ignoring<00:06:28.409> him<00:06:28.560> wasn't<00:06:28.889> paying<00:06:29.009> attention

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
ignoring him wasn't paying attention

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.219 
ignoring him wasn't paying attention
when<00:06:29.789> he<00:06:29.909> was<00:06:30.000> he<00:06:30.599> told<00:06:30.840> me<00:06:30.930> I'm<00:06:30.990> trying<00:06:31.139> to

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
when he was he told me I'm trying to

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:32.390 
when he was he told me I'm trying to
study<00:06:31.440> don't<00:06:31.710> talk<00:06:31.889> right<00:06:32.099> now

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.309

when<00:06:32.940> pinky<00:06:33.330> was<00:06:33.479> in<00:06:33.599> fact<00:06:33.810> trying<00:06:34.110> to<00:06:34.199> tell

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 
when pinky was in fact trying to tell

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:36.939 
when pinky was in fact trying to tell
him<00:06:34.469> the<00:06:34.620> answer<00:06:34.949> because<00:06:35.250> he<00:06:35.279> knew<00:06:35.610> it<00:06:35.870> but

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:36.949 
him the answer because he knew it but

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:39.200 
him the answer because he knew it but
that's<00:06:37.949> that's<00:06:38.550> just<00:06:38.880> another<00:06:39.060> thing<00:06:39.120> to

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
that's that's just another thing to

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.260 
that's that's just another thing to
point<00:06:39.419> out<00:06:39.539> right<00:06:39.690> there

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
point out right there

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.760 
point out right there
and<00:06:40.930> I<00:06:41.020> actually<00:06:41.110> did<00:06:41.349> come<00:06:41.470> across<00:06:41.590> a

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
and I actually did come across a

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.680 
and I actually did come across a
screenshot<00:06:42.220> of<00:06:42.460> him<00:06:42.819> you<00:06:42.970> can<00:06:43.000> see<00:06:43.419> here<00:06:43.599> you

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
screenshot of him you can see here you

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.300 
screenshot of him you can see here you
can<00:06:43.840> barely<00:06:44.259> write<00:06:44.530> his<00:06:44.650> own<00:06:44.710> name<00:06:44.770> it<00:06:45.160> looks

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
can barely write his own name it looks

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.820 
can barely write his own name it looks
like<00:06:45.460> shit<00:06:45.729> so<00:06:46.080> if<00:06:47.080> a<00:06:47.169> genius<00:06:47.470> can't<00:06:47.650> write<00:06:47.740> his

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
like shit so if a genius can't write his

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.260 
like shit so if a genius can't write his
own<00:06:47.889> name<00:06:48.160> you<00:06:48.490> know<00:06:48.699> I<00:06:48.729> don't<00:06:48.970> think<00:06:49.030> he's

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
own name you know I don't think he's

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.379 
own name you know I don't think he's
quite<00:06:49.509> the<00:06:49.569> biggest<00:06:50.020> genius<00:06:50.259> ever<00:06:50.470> and<00:06:51.389> that's

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:52.389 
quite the biggest genius ever and that's

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:53.900 
quite the biggest genius ever and that's
basically<00:06:52.810> the<00:06:52.960> whole<00:06:52.990> theory<00:06:53.349> right<00:06:53.590> there

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
basically the whole theory right there

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.620 
basically the whole theory right there

start<00:07:02.710> doing<00:07:02.830> incentives<00:07:03.370> like<00:07:03.430> the<00:07:03.550> last
