00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.500
 this time I bring you the unboxing of 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.119
 the samsung galaxy s3 as you can see and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.990
 good friends then how can you see 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.600
 this is the box 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:34.250
 As you can see, it's white but there's 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:38.330
 three colors red or wine rather white 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.760
 blue and black 4 sorry 4 colors and good 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.010
 friends as you see that is the box in the 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.930
 house we do not find anything else that says 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.990
 samsung galaxy on one side the label 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:54.340
 from samsung galaxy 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:58.210
 and then the specifications as they can 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.420
 see this samsung is 16 gigs but 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.680
 remember that it is expandable up to 10 32 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.060
 I think 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.310
 it's four-core processor its 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.270
 4.8 inches your camera 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.750
 and good friends will be appearing 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.909
 The specifications of this samsung 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.700
 galaxy over here somewhere in the 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.450
 screen and well then there is nothing else in 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.979
 the box as you can see and well let's 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.979
 proceed then to open it 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.570
 As you can see, I was already open to 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.090
 see that they were not bad or not 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.070
 he lacked nothing more and good friends 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.560
 I decided to buy this samsung galaxy and 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.250
 that iphone 5 was not there yet 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.370
 here in Mexico and I wanted to try the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.680
 android since it is therefore more 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.060
 customizable and good the two then 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.920
 As you can see here we have the cell phone 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.899
 as you see let me tell you that it does not weigh 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.580
 absolutely nothing as you see is a color 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.220
 White 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.970
 and let's leave the cell phone here 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.050
 let's see what else contains the box 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.050
 and as you see 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.970
 we have 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.870
 the samsung manuals 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.870
 as you can see 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.020
 we have 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.300
 the wall cable or rather the 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.300
 charger wall connector 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.690
 the usb tablet 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.790
 and then you're good for hearing aids 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.910
 so that it suits us the best to the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.540
