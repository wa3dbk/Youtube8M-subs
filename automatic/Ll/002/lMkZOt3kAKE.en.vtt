00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.420 
way that the young guys fill in jabal
really<00:02:46.570> came<00:02:46.780> in<00:02:46.960> to<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.290> defense<00:02:47.860> as<00:02:48.010> rookies

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
really came in to the defense as rookies

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.730 
really came in to the defense as rookies
last<00:02:48.670> year<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.060> how<00:02:49.330> they<00:02:49.480> fit<00:02:49.690> in<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.840> last

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
last year and how they fit in the last

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.650 
last year and how they fit in the last
two<00:02:50.920> years<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.340> think<00:02:51.520> we<00:02:51.610> spent<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:51.940> top<00:02:52.390> four

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
two years I think we spent the top four

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.360 
two years I think we spent the top four
picks<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:53.140> defensive<00:02:53.590> players<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.340> a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
picks on defensive players to and a

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.130 
picks on defensive players to and a
secondary<00:02:54.790> with<00:02:54.970> me<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.210> Joe<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.720> we're

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
secondary with me and Joe and we're

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.090 
secondary with me and Joe and we're
feeling<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.530> ball<00:02:56.760> last<00:02:57.760> year<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.780> think<00:02:59.470> me

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
feeling the ball last year so I think me

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.280 
feeling the ball last year so I think me
missing<00:03:00.580> lat<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.210> last<00:03:01.450> eight<00:03:01.660> games<00:03:01.690> of<00:03:02.170> last
