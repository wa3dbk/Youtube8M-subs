00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.060
 work Sunday at the coverciano for the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.980
 antonio national count at two days 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.920
 from the first qualifying competition ad 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.389
 euro 2016 in view of the challenge against the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.340
 norway school supported in 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.260
 morning a session focused on 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.300
 tactical part in which the coach is 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.050
 count approved the eleven possible 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.359
 holder 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.789
 among the possible confirmations we could 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.439
 be emanuele Giaccherini returned to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.289
 national after the exclusion from the world 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.359
 Brazilian and eager to write a 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.739
 new chapter of his adventure 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:38.239
 blue if it's definitely a big one 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.370
 great rage a great rage of 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.670
 that turns it into energy in the field 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.719
 because we say that when I go to the field 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.690
 I go to the field I see the maximum 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:56.430
 definitely or even more experience e 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.770
 so I try to try to put a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.129
 my features available 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.799
 for the team the midfielder of 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.869
 sunderland count's protÃ©gÃ© from the times 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.790
 of juventus then spoke of the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.500
 Italy's next opponent 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.290
 norway a difficult team to 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.460
 facing is therefore absolutely not 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.770
 underestimate if definitely 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.020
 norway is a very tough team 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.720
 we saw the game against 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.970
 the england that england did 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.240
 a lot of effort and a team that does 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.750
 closes well in this king striker 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.909
 perhaps his best weapon 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.330
 with the inclusion of the externals they are 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.770
 good at coming in and pointing the 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.479
 defense then we will try to do the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.500
 our game as we are preparing it 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.720
 and not just don't underestimate but this 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.100
 it won't happen because with mister it is 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.600
 impossible 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.429
 as well as little lies among the returns of 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.289
 there is also this coverciano retreat 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.509
 that of davide astori holder 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.580
 in the friendly won against Holland and 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.369
 now competing for a jersey also for the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.320
 oslo match especially after the injury 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.830
 what happened to giorgio chiellini 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.680
 said yesterday greeted the blue clan 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.580
 obviously me with a great giorgio 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.640
 relationship 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.470
 also playing in the same role but me 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.269
 gave a hand and gave me some 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.100
 innovations that served me that 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.350
 been useful during the game so 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.200
 a world-class player 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.000
 we would always like to be with us in the afternoon 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.220
 then the team did not take the field for 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.290
 the usual video analysis in which 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.060
 mister conte has developed the last ones 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.040
 tactical dictates 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.079
 tomorrow then a day before sitting 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.079
 morning coverciano before the 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:47.600
 departure for oslo where at 19 at the 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.420
 ullevaal stadium will be held last 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.340
 then 48 hour finishing training 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.170
 is the wait for the first stage of the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.130
 European path of Italy of count 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.130
 will be terminated
