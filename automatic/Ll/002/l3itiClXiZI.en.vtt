00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.320 
layer and you can name this layer noise
adjustment<00:01:08.050> so<00:01:09.280> what<00:01:10.280> we<00:01:10.430> need<00:01:10.790> for<00:01:11.030> this<00:01:11.120> is<00:01:11.180> a

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
adjustment so what we need for this is a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.390 
adjustment so what we need for this is a
filter<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:11.990> go<00:01:12.110> to<00:01:12.170> filter<00:01:12.590> then<00:01:12.770> noise<00:01:13.040> and

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
filter so go to filter then noise and

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.750 
filter so go to filter then noise and
add<00:01:13.760> noise<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.860> what<00:01:15.860> this<00:01:15.980> does<00:01:16.190> is<00:01:16.400> it<00:01:16.550> adds

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
add noise and what this does is it adds

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.340 
add noise and what this does is it adds
a<00:01:16.880> nice<00:01:17.030> noise<00:01:17.330> in<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.780> background<00:01:17.990> of<00:01:18.320> your

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
a nice noise in the background of your

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.220 
a nice noise in the background of your
image<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:18.890> this<00:01:19.880> helps<00:01:20.180> add<00:01:20.360> to<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.020> realism

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
image and this helps add to the realism

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.920 
image and this helps add to the realism
of<00:01:21.710> like<00:01:21.980> a<00:01:22.010> film<00:01:22.370> look<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:22.880> it<00:01:23.480> also<00:01:23.630> can

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
of like a film look and it also can

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.510 
of like a film look and it also can
balance<00:01:24.350> out<00:01:24.500> some<00:01:24.740> of<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:24.920> colors<00:01:25.250> in<00:01:25.280> the

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
balance out some of the colors in the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.070 
balance out some of the colors in the
back<00:01:25.670> of<00:01:25.880> your<00:01:25.970> image<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.420> make<00:01:26.720> them<00:01:26.870> blend

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
back of your image and make them blend

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.170 
back of your image and make them blend
better<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:28.190> for<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.520> amount<00:01:28.820> you're<00:01:29.000> going<00:01:29.120> to

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
better so for the amount you're going to

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.690 
better so for the amount you're going to
want<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:29.360> go<00:01:29.480> with<00:01:29.630> 4%<00:01:30.050> it's<00:01:30.890> not<00:01:31.070> too<00:01:31.220> high<00:01:31.430> but

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
want to go with 4% it's not too high but

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.340 
want to go with 4% it's not too high but
not<00:01:31.970> too<00:01:32.120> little<00:01:32.270> at<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.570> same<00:01:32.600> time<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.260> it

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
not too little at the same time and it

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.910 
not too little at the same time and it
won't<00:01:34.150> over<00:01:35.150> impact<00:01:35.330> your<00:01:35.660> photo<00:01:35.870> for<00:01:36.860> the

too<00:01:41.110> bold<00:01:42.110> for<00:01:42.560> me<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.130> I<00:01:43.220> think<00:01:43.430> it<00:01:43.520> just

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
too bold for me and I think it just

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.640 
too bold for me and I think it just
looks<00:01:43.910> more<00:01:44.030> harsh<00:01:44.420> if<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:44.630> look<00:01:44.780> in<00:01:44.900> here<00:01:44.930> or

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
looks more harsh if you look in here or

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.870 
looks more harsh if you look in here or
as<00:01:45.770> uniform<00:01:46.130> is<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.280> little<00:01:46.460> more<00:01:46.550> spread<00:01:46.850> out

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880

as uniform is a little more spread out
and<00:01:47.210> condensed<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.140> then<00:01:48.830> finally<00:01:49.160> you're

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
and condensed and then finally you're

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.290

because without that the noise would be

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.500 
because without that the noise would be
red<00:01:54.020> green<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:54.440> blue<00:01:54.650> and<00:01:55.210> what<00:01:56.210> you<00:01:56.300> really

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
to go ahead and create a gradient map so

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.160 
to go ahead and create a gradient map so
right<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.130> click<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.610> little<00:02:08.330> icon<00:02:08.750> down<00:02:08.780> here

gradient<00:02:11.510> map<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.520> a<00:02:13.520> gradient<00:02:13.820> map<00:02:14.030> adds

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
gradient map and a gradient map adds

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
gradient map and a gradient map adds
like<00:02:14.750> a

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
like a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.200 
like a
overall<00:02:15.740> tone<00:02:16.010> or<00:02:16.220> look<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.490> your<00:02:16.610> photo<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.060> I

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
overall tone or look to your photo and I

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.790 
overall tone or look to your photo and I
really<00:02:17.660> think<00:02:17.870> they're<00:02:17.990> pretty<00:02:18.140> cool<00:02:18.260> because

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
really think they're pretty cool because

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.940 
really think they're pretty cool because
they're<00:02:19.790> very<00:02:20.030> flexible<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:21.050> if<00:02:21.320> you<00:02:21.440> if<00:02:21.860> you

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
they're very flexible so if you if you

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.800 
they're very flexible so if you if you
want<00:02:22.100> black<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.520> white<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:22.850> can<00:02:23.000> do<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.270> or

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
want black and white you can do that or

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.530 
want black and white you can do that or
if<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.410> want<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.890> more<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.790> vintage<00:02:26.060> tone<00:02:26.330> you

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
if you want a more of a vintage tone you

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.690 
if you want a more of a vintage tone you
can<00:02:26.570> work<00:02:26.870> with<00:02:27.020> that<00:02:27.050> so<00:02:27.950> we're<00:02:28.280> going<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.460> use

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.420 
close this and then you have your
gradient<00:03:20.420> map<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:20.989> now<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.739> adjust<00:03:21.860> this<00:03:22.250> we're

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
gradient map so now to adjust this we're

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.820 
gradient map so now to adjust this we're
going<00:03:22.520> to<00:03:22.610> double<00:03:22.940> click<00:03:23.030> it<00:03:23.239> and<00:03:23.680> change<00:03:24.680> the

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
going to double click it and change the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.280 
going to double click it and change the
blend<00:03:25.040> mode<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.250> overlay<00:03:25.750> so<00:03:26.750> this<00:03:26.900> just<00:03:27.050> adds

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
blend mode to overlay so this just adds

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.020 
blend mode to overlay so this just adds
like<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.560> nice<00:03:27.800> overlay<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.400> your<00:03:28.550> image<00:03:28.790> and

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
like a nice overlay to your image and

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.410 
like a nice overlay to your image and
right<00:03:29.660> now<00:03:29.840> we<00:03:29.900> could<00:03:30.200> stay<00:03:30.590> at<00:03:30.970> 100%<00:03:31.970> opacity

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
right now we could stay at 100% opacity

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.330 
right now we could stay at 100% opacity
but<00:03:32.870> it's<00:03:32.989> a<00:03:33.050> bit<00:03:33.260> too<00:03:33.290> harsh<00:03:33.620> for<00:03:33.680> my<00:03:33.920> liking

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
but it's a bit too harsh for my liking

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.100 
but it's a bit too harsh for my liking
so<00:03:34.970> I'm<00:03:35.030> going<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.209> go<00:03:35.270> and<00:03:35.390> drop<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:35.930> down<00:03:35.959> to

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
so I'm going to go and drop it down to

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.940 
so I'm going to go and drop it down to
30%<00:03:37.010> opacity<00:03:37.959> so<00:03:38.959> this<00:03:39.200> just<00:03:39.380> makes<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.709> a<00:03:39.800> lot

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
30% opacity so this just makes it a lot

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.920 
30% opacity so this just makes it a lot
more<00:03:40.010> subtle<00:03:40.550> but<00:03:40.670> it's<00:03:40.820> still<00:03:41.090> very<00:03:41.390> much

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
more subtle but it's still very much

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.800 
more subtle but it's still very much
there<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.230> adds<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.739> nice<00:03:42.890> tone<00:03:43.160> to<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.400> image

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
there and adds a nice tone to the image

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.960 
there and adds a nice tone to the image
so<00:03:44.810> after<00:03:45.110> that<00:03:45.230> click<00:03:45.410> OK<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.950> then<00:03:46.670> you<00:03:46.820> can

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
so after that click OK and then you can

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.860 
so after that click OK and then you can
go<00:03:47.090> ahead<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:47.570> create<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.260> curves<00:03:48.680> layer<00:03:49.870> this

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
go ahead and create a curves layer this

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.570 
go ahead and create a curves layer this
is<00:03:50.989> going<00:03:51.140> to<00:03:51.200> help<00:03:51.320> boost<00:03:51.800> the<00:03:52.190> light<00:03:52.550> a

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
is going to help boost the light a

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.979 
is going to help boost the light a
little<00:03:52.730> bit<00:03:52.940> in<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.180> image<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:53.540> make<00:03:53.660> it<00:03:53.840> look

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
little bit in the image and make it look

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.590 
little bit in the image and make it look
like<00:03:54.170> it<00:03:54.380> has<00:03:54.530> almost<00:03:55.100> a<00:03:55.250> glove<00:03:55.519> to<00:03:55.670> it<00:03:55.790> so

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
like it has almost a glove to it so

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.690 
like it has almost a glove to it so
first<00:03:56.930> click<00:03:57.200> right<00:03:57.530> up<00:03:57.680> in<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:58.160> 3rd<00:03:58.400> in<00:03:58.640> the

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
first click right up in the 3rd in the

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.699 
first click right up in the 3rd in the
top<00:03:59.150> right<00:03:59.390> quadrant<00:03:59.510> right<00:03:59.930> about<00:04:00.170> down<00:04:00.320> here

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
top right quadrant right about down here

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.460 
top right quadrant right about down here
and<00:04:00.860> then<00:04:01.760> drag<00:04:02.209> it<00:04:02.330> up<00:04:02.450> just<00:04:02.720> slightly<00:04:02.930> so<00:04:03.380> you

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
and then drag it up just slightly so you

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.979 
and then drag it up just slightly so you
can<00:04:03.590> see<00:04:03.739> a<00:04:03.769> slight<00:04:04.130> curve<00:04:04.370> form<00:04:04.750> actually<00:04:05.750> a

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
can see a slight curve form actually a

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.050 
can see a slight curve form actually a
little<00:04:06.260> bit<00:04:06.380> less<00:04:06.560> than<00:04:06.680> that<00:04:06.760> right<00:04:07.760> there

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
little bit less than that right there

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.750 
little bit less than that right there
and<00:04:09.050> this<00:04:09.530> just<00:04:09.739> helps<00:04:09.950> brighten<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.550> image

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
and this just helps brighten the image

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.580 
and this just helps brighten the image
up<00:04:10.880> a<00:04:10.970> little<00:04:11.150> bit<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.480> then<00:04:12.260> go<00:04:12.410> ahead<00:04:12.500> and

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
up a little bit and then go ahead and

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.990 
up a little bit and then go ahead and
come<00:04:12.800> down<00:04:12.980> here<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.519> bottom<00:04:13.820> left

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
come down here to the bottom left

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.390 
come down here to the bottom left
quadrant<00:04:14.150> right<00:04:14.540> at<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.690> top<00:04:14.870> of<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:15.110> and

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
quadrant right at the top of that and

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.030 
quadrant right at the top of that and
grab<00:04:16.400> this<00:04:16.790> and<00:04:17.150> then<00:04:17.959> drag<00:04:18.260> it<00:04:18.380> down<00:04:18.560> just<00:04:18.890> a

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
grab this and then drag it down just a

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.729 
grab this and then drag it down just a
little<00:04:19.070> bit<00:04:19.310> just<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.359> help<00:04:20.480> darken<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.410> image

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
little bit just to help darken the image

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.100 
little bit just to help darken the image
so<00:04:21.950> it's<00:04:22.070> not<00:04:22.220> too<00:04:22.490> bright<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:22.990> finally<00:04:23.990> we're

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
so it's not too bright and finally we're

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.840 
so it's not too bright and finally we're
going<00:04:24.200> to<00:04:24.260> click<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.800> very<00:04:25.100> bottom<00:04:25.550> point

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
going to click the very bottom point

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.250 
going to click the very bottom point
that's<00:04:26.120> already<00:04:26.270> there<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.690> bring<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:27.169> up

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
that's already there and bring it up

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.870 
that's already there and bring it up
about

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
about

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.080 
about
almost<00:04:28.360> halfway<00:04:29.430> right<00:04:30.430> about<00:04:30.670> there<00:04:30.910> and

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
almost halfway right about there and

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.180 
almost halfway right about there and
this<00:04:31.750> lightens<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.470> shadows<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.830> little<00:04:32.920> bit

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
this lightens the shadows a little bit

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.470 
this lightens the shadows a little bit
so<00:04:33.370> you<00:04:33.430> can<00:04:33.490> see<00:04:33.580> like<00:04:33.790> right<00:04:34.000> here<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.360> right

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
so you can see like right here and right

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.130 
so you can see like right here and right
here<00:04:34.720> so<00:04:35.160> they're<00:04:36.160> not<00:04:36.280> too<00:04:36.580> dark<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.180> they

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
here so they're not too dark and they

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.360 
here so they're not too dark and they
don't<00:04:38.320> look<00:04:38.440> like<00:04:38.500> we've<00:04:38.830> over<00:04:39.220> edited<00:04:39.580> them

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
don't look like we've over edited them

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.400 
don't look like we've over edited them
so<00:04:42.370> after<00:04:42.640> you<00:04:42.700> do<00:04:42.790> that<00:04:42.990> you<00:04:43.990> can<00:04:44.140> go<00:04:44.290> ahead

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
so after you do that you can go ahead

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.860 
so after you do that you can go ahead
and<00:04:44.740> go<00:04:45.550> to<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.730> adjustment<00:04:45.790> layer<00:04:46.210> again<00:04:46.600> and

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
and go to the adjustment layer again and

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.460 
and go to the adjustment layer again and
we're<00:04:47.140> going<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.320> now<00:04:47.470> use<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:48.160> photo<00:04:48.430> filter

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
we're going to now use the photo filter

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.680 
we're going to now use the photo filter
so<00:04:50.470> photo<00:04:50.740> filters<00:04:51.160> add<00:04:51.400> a<00:04:51.430> nice<00:04:51.700> look<00:04:52.090> to<00:04:52.360> your

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
so photo filters add a nice look to your

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.900 
so photo filters add a nice look to your
photo<00:04:52.900> they'll<00:04:53.350> make<00:04:53.560> it<00:04:53.680> warmer<00:04:54.130> colder<00:04:54.430> or

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
photo they'll make it warmer colder or

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.820 
photo they'll make it warmer colder or
any<00:04:55.660> color<00:04:55.930> so<00:04:56.170> you<00:04:56.230> have<00:04:56.350> all<00:04:56.470> these<00:04:56.590> options

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
any color so you have all these options

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.020 
any color so you have all these options
we're<00:04:57.310> going<00:04:57.430> to<00:04:57.490> go<00:04:57.580> ahead<00:04:57.670> and<00:04:57.850> click

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
we're going to go ahead and click

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.290 
we're going to go ahead and click
warming<00:04:58.630> filter<00:04:58.960> 81<00:04:59.820> this<00:05:00.820> is<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.060> nice

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
warming filter 81 this is a nice

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.300 
warming filter 81 this is a nice
yellowish<00:05:01.990> orange<00:05:02.260> tint<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:02.920> then<00:05:03.190> we're

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
yellowish orange tint and then we're

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.240 
yellowish orange tint and then we're
going<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.460> make<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.390> density<00:05:04.600> 10%<00:05:05.440> so<00:05:06.130> it's

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
going to make the density 10% so it's

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.430 
going to make the density 10% so it's
not<00:05:06.400> too<00:05:06.690> impacting<00:05:07.690> but<00:05:07.840> it<00:05:07.930> still<00:05:08.140> looks

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
not too impacting but it still looks

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.560 
not too impacting but it still looks
very<00:05:08.590> nice<00:05:08.950> so<00:05:09.910> then<00:05:10.030> you<00:05:10.120> can<00:05:10.240> go<00:05:10.330> ahead<00:05:10.390> and

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
very nice so then you can go ahead and

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.640 
very nice so then you can go ahead and
close<00:05:10.690> that<00:05:10.960> and<00:05:11.140> then<00:05:11.730> finally<00:05:12.730> to<00:05:13.410> finish<00:05:14.410> it

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
close that and then finally to finish it

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.290 
close that and then finally to finish it
off<00:05:14.800> we're<00:05:15.010> going<00:05:15.130> to<00:05:15.220> add<00:05:15.340> a<00:05:15.370> nice<00:05:15.640> exposure

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
off we're going to add a nice exposure

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.700 
off we're going to add a nice exposure
to<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:16.840> image<00:05:17.080> so<00:05:17.230> it's<00:05:17.350> already<00:05:17.560> pretty

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
to the image so it's already pretty

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.040 
to the image so it's already pretty
bright<00:05:18.010> but<00:05:18.970> to<00:05:19.390> give<00:05:19.570> it<00:05:19.600> a<00:05:19.690> little<00:05:19.840> more

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
bright but to give it a little more

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.990 
bright but to give it a little more
impact<00:05:20.440> I'm<00:05:20.620> going<00:05:20.770> to<00:05:20.860> up<00:05:21.010> the<00:05:21.280> exposure<00:05:21.700> to

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
impact I'm going to up the exposure to

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.600 
impact I'm going to up the exposure to
point<00:05:22.420> two<00:05:22.650> so<00:05:23.650> this<00:05:23.770> really<00:05:23.980> brightens<00:05:24.430> it<00:05:24.520> up

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
point two so this really brightens it up

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.640 
point two so this really brightens it up
up<00:05:24.790> here<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.210> up<00:05:25.300> here<00:05:25.570> and<00:05:26.200> it<00:05:26.260> can<00:05:26.380> really

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
up here and up here and it can really

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.350 
up here and up here and it can really
help<00:05:26.800> your<00:05:26.950> image<00:05:27.220> pop<00:05:27.490> if<00:05:27.790> you're<00:05:28.000> trying<00:05:28.270> to

help your image pop if you're trying to

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.830 
help your image pop if you're trying to
stand<00:05:28.840> out<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:30.880> offset<00:05:31.270> in<00:05:31.360> gamma<00:05:31.540> correction

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
stand out the offset in gamma correction

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.420 
stand out the offset in gamma correction
are<00:05:32.080> fine<00:05:32.260> as<00:05:32.470> they<00:05:32.620> are<00:05:32.740> so<00:05:32.950> just<00:05:33.100> leave<00:05:33.280> that

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
are fine as they are so just leave that

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.090 
are fine as they are so just leave that
and<00:05:33.870> that's<00:05:34.870> really<00:05:34.990> all<00:05:35.380> you<00:05:35.560> need<00:05:35.590> to<00:05:35.800> do<00:05:35.920> to

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
and that's really all you need to do to

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.350 
and that's really all you need to do to
get<00:05:36.220> this<00:05:36.370> effect<00:05:36.700> so<00:05:36.790> I'm<00:05:36.910> going<00:05:37.030> to<00:05:37.090> group<00:05:37.210> it

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
get this effect so I'm going to group it

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.060 
get this effect so I'm going to group it
together<00:05:37.450> just<00:05:37.720> so<00:05:37.990> you<00:05:38.110> can<00:05:38.230> see<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:38.530> impact

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
together just so you can see the impact

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.550 
together just so you can see the impact
it<00:05:39.220> makes<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:42.840> then<00:05:43.840> I'll<00:05:43.990> turn<00:05:44.140> it<00:05:44.290> on<00:05:44.380> and

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
it makes and then I'll turn it on and

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.530 
it makes and then I'll turn it on and
off<00:05:44.680> so<00:05:44.710> you<00:05:44.920> can<00:05:45.070> see<00:05:45.220> so<00:05:45.550> before<00:05:45.970> we<00:05:46.360> have

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
off so you can see so before we have

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.810 
off so you can see so before we have
this<00:05:46.780> image<00:05:47.230> which<00:05:47.980> looks<00:05:48.190> a<00:05:48.250> little<00:05:48.340> dull<00:05:48.640> in

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
this image which looks a little dull in

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.030 
this image which looks a little dull in
comparison<00:05:49.330> but<00:05:49.360> it's<00:05:49.660> still<00:05:49.780> great<00:05:49.990> well<00:05:50.770> lit

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
comparison but it's still great well lit

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.910 
comparison but it's still great well lit
well<00:05:51.520> exposed<00:05:51.940> and<00:05:52.210> all<00:05:52.480> the<00:05:52.660> above<00:05:52.770> but<00:05:53.770> then

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
well exposed and all the above but then

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.680 
well exposed and all the above but then
if<00:05:54.040> you<00:05:54.130> turn<00:05:54.280> on<00:05:54.340> the<00:05:54.490> soft<00:05:54.820> vintage<00:05:55.000> look<00:05:55.450> I

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
if you turn on the soft vintage look I

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.710 
if you turn on the soft vintage look I
think<00:05:56.590> it<00:05:56.800> adds<00:05:56.980> a<00:05:57.160> nice<00:05:57.400> glow<00:05:58.000> almost<00:05:58.510> like<00:05:58.600> an

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
think it adds a nice glow almost like an

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.780 
think it adds a nice glow almost like an
orange<00:05:59.080> like<00:05:59.470> sunlight<00:05:59.800> glow<00:06:00.190> to<00:06:00.250> your<00:06:00.520> image
