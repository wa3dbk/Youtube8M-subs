well the first step of getting imagery

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.030 
well the first step of getting imagery
into<00:02:09.280> Asus<00:02:09.700> is<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.630> essentially<00:02:11.500> normalize

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
into Asus is to essentially normalize

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.920 
into Asus is to essentially normalize
the<00:02:12.340> data<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.730> comes<00:02:12.880> out<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.210> camera<00:02:13.660> or

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
the data that comes out of a camera or

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.080 
the data that comes out of a camera or
from<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.200> visual<00:02:14.500> effects<00:02:14.770> pipeline<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.730> Asus

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
from a visual effects pipeline so Asus

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.800 
from a visual effects pipeline so Asus
provides<00:02:17.550> transforms<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.790> go<00:02:19.210> from<00:02:19.480> camera

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
provides transforms to go from camera

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.920 
provides transforms to go from camera
native<00:02:20.080> formats<00:02:20.500> into<00:02:20.800> Asus<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:21.940> any<00:02:22.240> camera

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
native formats into Asus so any camera

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.110 
native formats into Asus so any camera
can<00:02:23.470> be<00:02:23.590> compatible<00:02:23.950> with<00:02:24.250> Asus<00:02:24.730> there's<00:02:24.970> some

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
can be compatible with Asus there's some

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.000 
can be compatible with Asus there's some
technical<00:02:25.390> work<00:02:25.660> at<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.900> manufacturer<00:02:26.530> or<00:02:26.980> a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
technical work at the manufacturer or a

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.770 
technical work at the manufacturer or a
third<00:02:27.310> party<00:02:27.520> would<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.150> but<00:02:28.660> there

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
third party would have to do but there

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.420 
third party would have to do but there
are<00:02:28.840> very<00:02:28.990> clear<00:02:29.170> specifications<00:02:30.070> from<00:02:30.250> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
are very clear specifications from the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.520 
are very clear specifications from the
Academy<00:02:30.850> about<00:02:31.030> how<00:02:31.330> exactly<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.990> do<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.320> and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
Academy about how exactly to do that and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.290 
Academy about how exactly to do that and
technical<00:02:33.310> metrics<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.940> know<00:02:34.060> if<00:02:34.180> they're

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
technical metrics to know if they're

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.340 
technical metrics to know if they're
doing<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.600> good<00:02:34.750> job<00:02:34.810> or<00:02:35.200> not

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
doing a good job or not

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.860 
doing a good job or not
so<00:02:35.980> if<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.130> look<00:02:36.280> for<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.490> Asus<00:02:36.850> logo<00:02:37.030> or<00:02:37.480> an
