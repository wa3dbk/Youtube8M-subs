00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
TouchWiz so I thought I'd give it a

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.410 
TouchWiz so I thought I'd give it a
comparison<00:00:22.650> against<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> iPhone<00:00:23.490> 6<00:00:23.880> which<00:00:24.390> is

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
comparison against the iPhone 6 which is

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.570 
comparison against the iPhone 6 which is
known<00:00:24.840> for<00:00:24.869> its<00:00:25.170> great<00:00:25.560> responsiveness<00:00:26.279> and

known for its great responsiveness and
real-life<00:00:27.090> performance<00:00:27.689> let's<00:00:28.170> see<00:00:28.380> which

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
real-life performance let's see which

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.349 
real-life performance let's see which
one<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:28.949> these<00:00:29.130> two<00:00:29.340> phones<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.789> faster<00:00:30.240> in

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
one of these two phones is faster in

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.450 
one of these two phones is faster in
real<00:00:30.599> life<00:00:30.859> for<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> purpose<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.340> this

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
real life for the purpose of this

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.190 
real life for the purpose of this
comparison<00:00:32.700> we've<00:00:33.270> prepared<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.809> set<00:00:34.079> of

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
comparison we've prepared a set of

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.750 
comparison we've prepared a set of
applications<00:00:34.890> which<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.370> are<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.670> to

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
applications which we are going to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.880 
applications which we are going to
launch<00:00:35.969> at<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.420> same<00:00:36.630> time<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.469> will<00:00:37.620> see

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
launch at the same time and we will see

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.799 
launch at the same time and we will see
which<00:00:38.219> one<00:00:38.640> which<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> two<00:00:39.570> phones

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
which one which was of the two phones

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.350 
which one which was of the two phones
performs<00:00:40.440> faster<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.489> let's<00:00:41.670> start<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
performs faster so let's start with the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.979 
performs faster so let's start with the
phone<00:00:42.510> application<00:00:43.789> three<00:00:44.789> two<00:00:45.059> one

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
phone application three two one

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.299 
phone application three two one
well<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:47.829> galaxy<00:00:48.190> s6<00:00:48.550> edge<00:00:49.680> had<00:00:50.680> a<00:00:50.710> slight<00:00:51.010> lag

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
well the galaxy s6 edge had a slight lag

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.119 
well the galaxy s6 edge had a slight lag
here<00:00:51.760> while<00:00:51.969> opening<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.949> phone<00:00:53.949> application

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
here while opening the phone application

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.210 
here while opening the phone application
let's<00:00:54.910> give<00:00:55.329> it<00:00:55.360> another<00:00:55.449> try

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
let's give it another try

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.110 
let's give it another try

and<00:00:58.210> this<00:00:58.750> time<00:00:59.110> around<00:00:59.350> it<00:00:59.559> was<00:00:59.649> a<00:00:59.710> tie

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
and this time around it was a tie

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.439 
and this time around it was a tie
probably<00:01:00.309> because<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.760> app<00:01:00.879> was<00:01:01.090> already

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
probably because the app was already

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.840 
probably because the app was already
loaded<00:01:01.809> in<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.020> phone's<00:01:02.320> memory<00:01:02.829> let's<00:01:03.699> move

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
loaded in the phone's memory let's move

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.609 
loaded in the phone's memory let's move
on<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.210> contacts<00:01:04.690> application<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:05.409> see

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
on to the contacts application and see

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:06.480 
on to the contacts application and see
what<00:01:05.860> happens

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
what happens

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.190 
what happens
three<00:01:07.299> two<00:01:07.780> one<00:01:09.330> well<00:01:10.330> this<00:01:10.540> time<00:01:10.690> around<00:01:10.960> the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
three two one well this time around the

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.649 
three two one well this time around the
guard<00:01:11.409> see<00:01:11.619> s6<00:01:11.950> edge<00:01:12.159> was<00:01:12.640> faster<00:01:13.479> than<00:01:13.509> the

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
guard see s6 edge was faster than the

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.480 
guard see s6 edge was faster than the
iPhone<00:01:13.900> 6<00:01:14.940> let's<00:01:15.940> give<00:01:16.240> it<00:01:16.270> one<00:01:16.570> more<00:01:16.840> try

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.620 

and<00:01:19.579> this<00:01:20.210> time<00:01:20.479> it<00:01:21.140> was<00:01:21.439> a<00:01:21.619> tie

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
and this time it was a tie

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.520 
and this time it was a tie
next<00:01:24.260> step<00:01:24.440> is<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.830> messaging<00:01:25.340> application

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
next step is the messaging application

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.490 
next step is the messaging application

well<00:01:30.100> this<00:01:30.610> might<00:01:31.180> have<00:01:31.480> been<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:32.110> tie<00:01:32.470> because

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
well this might have been a tie because

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.460 
well this might have been a tie because
of<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.940> transitions<00:01:34.600> that<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.930> two<00:01:35.110> phones

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
of the transitions that the two phones

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.370 
of the transitions that the two phones
use<00:01:35.980> let's<00:01:36.760> have<00:01:37.150> another<00:01:37.540> go<00:01:38.730> three<00:01:39.730> two<00:01:40.030> one

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
use let's have another go three two one

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.630 
use let's have another go three two one
okay<00:01:41.979> this<00:01:42.280> one<00:01:42.580> was<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.240> tight

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
okay this one was a tight

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.350 
okay this one was a tight
the<00:01:46.060> next<00:01:46.300> stop<00:01:46.510> is<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.750> music<00:01:47.260> application

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
the next stop is the music application

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.230 
the next stop is the music application

it<00:01:51.810> seems<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.530> iPhone<00:01:53.100> 6<00:01:53.490> was<00:01:53.759> faster<00:01:54.210> at

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
it seems like the iPhone 6 was faster at

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.539 
it seems like the iPhone 6 was faster at
loading<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> music<00:01:55.049> application<00:01:55.710> let's<00:01:56.430> give

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
loading the music application let's give

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.190 
loading the music application let's give
it<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.700> more<00:01:56.939> go<00:01:57.170> three<00:01:58.170> two<00:01:58.530> one<00:01:59.299> and<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
it one more go three two one and the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.649 
it one more go three two one and the
second<00:02:01.560> test<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.460> tie

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
second test was a tie

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.990 
second test was a tie
the<00:02:05.110> next<00:02:05.350> application<00:02:05.710> we'll<00:02:06.100> try<00:02:06.369> is<00:02:06.729> the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
the next application we'll try is the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.359 
the next application we'll try is the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
okay the galaxy s6 edge was slightly

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.400 
okay the galaxy s6 edge was slightly
faster<00:02:14.740> this<00:02:14.920> time<00:02:15.100> around<00:02:16.200> let's<00:02:17.200> give<00:02:17.350> it

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
faster this time around let's give it
