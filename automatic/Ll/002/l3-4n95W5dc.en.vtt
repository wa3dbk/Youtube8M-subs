style<00:03:58.570> and<00:03:59.310> with<00:04:00.310> that<00:04:00.430> in<00:04:00.610> mind<00:04:00.640> I'd<00:04:01.210> like<00:04:01.240> to

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
style and with that in mind I'd like to

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.670 
style and with that in mind I'd like to
prepare<00:04:02.910> some<00:04:03.910> tracks<00:04:04.300> that<00:04:04.540> I<00:04:04.600> think<00:04:05.020> people

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
prepare some tracks that I think people

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.680 
prepare some tracks that I think people
who<00:04:05.980> usually<00:04:06.280> might<00:04:06.730> not<00:04:06.940> listen<00:04:07.510> to

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
who usually might not listen to

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.870 
who usually might not listen to
industrial<00:04:08.350> will<00:04:08.650> actually<00:04:09.070> think<00:04:09.550> is<00:04:09.640> really

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
industrial will actually think is really

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.120 
industrial will actually think is really
cool<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.090> also<00:04:10.990> some<00:04:11.350> tracks<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:11.800> people

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
cool and also some tracks that people

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.220 
cool and also some tracks that people
who<00:04:12.190> are<00:04:12.340> more<00:04:12.790> used<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.240> style<00:04:13.570> will<00:04:13.840> find

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
who are more used to the style will find

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.760 
who are more used to the style will find
a<00:04:14.350> bit<00:04:14.470> more<00:04:14.620> challenging<00:04:16.500> obviously<00:04:17.500> because

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
a bit more challenging obviously because

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.620 
a bit more challenging obviously because
I'm<00:04:18.010> in<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:19.330> second<00:04:19.720> room<00:04:19.989> so<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:20.470> speak

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
I'm in the the second room so to speak

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.000 
I'm in the the second room so to speak
I'm<00:04:22.630> going<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:22.900> be<00:04:22.990> pushing<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.620> boundaries<00:04:23.890> a

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
I'm going to be pushing the boundaries a

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.830 
I'm going to be pushing the boundaries a
bit<00:04:24.100> more<00:04:24.430> than<00:04:24.640> I<00:04:24.760> would<00:04:25.000> if<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.510> was<00:04:25.660> in<00:04:25.750> the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
bit more than I would if I was in the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.710 
bit more than I would if I was in the
mainstream<00:04:26.280> probably<00:04:27.280> this<00:04:27.490> year<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.390> I<00:04:28.540> mix

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
mainstream probably this year and I mix

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.430 
mainstream probably this year and I mix
it<00:04:28.810> up<00:04:28.960> with<00:04:29.020> some<00:04:29.530> I<00:04:30.840> hope<00:04:31.840> we<00:04:32.020> can<00:04:32.140> start<00:04:32.380> a

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
it up with some I hope we can start a

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.550 
it up with some I hope we can start a
bit<00:04:32.590> flower<00:04:32.850> because<00:04:33.990> there's<00:04:34.990> a<00:04:35.080> lot<00:04:35.230> of<00:04:35.260> fast

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
bit flower because there's a lot of fast

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.670 
bit flower because there's a lot of fast
hardcore<00:04:36.010> nowadays<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.730> I<00:04:37.210> do<00:04:37.630> miss<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.380> the

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
hardcore nowadays and I do miss the the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.320 
hardcore nowadays and I do miss the the
slower<00:04:38.950> industrial<00:04:39.550> sound<00:04:39.730> a<00:04:39.880> bit<00:04:39.910> so
