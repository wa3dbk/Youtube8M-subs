00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700
 so hello people greet you i have 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:11.190
 again a sony ericsson xperia x10 mini 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:16.560
 As you can see it was only embossed 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:20.039
 still in the good loop I will 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.720
 now disassemble take 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.990
 to restore the ball 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.349
 you just have to do this today 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.090
 Battery cover then open 46 screws 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.059
 Loosen and then expose the motherboard 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.309
 mind game the phone pretty easy 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.800
 I do not have a check up so I have to 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.390
 then sign up for it then 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.710
 to join in the end in their box 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.520
 I'll do that until now 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.090
 I have the case now 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.260
 open 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.640
 I can see that up here 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.969
 to renovate the house now that I want 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.610
 to close percent 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.230
 I will do that now and shows 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.820
 then you like me 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.830
 connected with the hypo sees here 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.680
 you look nice the pattern how to do that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.210
 here must solve the signals from three to 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.190
 ten and the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:18.720
 I'll do that with the positive pole 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:24.000
 everything looks nicely numbered 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:30.869
 yes, and now I have that 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.580
 everything connected to the box sees me 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:41.460
 quite the connections and the 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:45.170
 different signals distinct pressure 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.170
 million in resort action 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:56.330
 the instructions how it works in the near future usb 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.360
 we have connected data cables 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:04.229
 in the wii must also be connected 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.610
 and the avm be expressed 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:12.250
 that would do it now 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:14.680
 is closed immediately 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.330
 pushes me departmental action because the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:24.330
 just close the instructions above 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:27.490
 selection settings then by boot respect 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.560
 and then that goes through and then as 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.630
 Success message is then there that the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.950
 dead body braid was and thus 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.750
 should be normal again 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.250
 start, the so many is 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.750
 again nice to press together building 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.750
 of keys up here 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.500
 without it should be the cell phone 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.500
 start 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.450
 wonderfully the repair was successful 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.830
 if you liked me 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.830
 just a thumb 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.850
 I will still other models in the future 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.850
 Post the later
