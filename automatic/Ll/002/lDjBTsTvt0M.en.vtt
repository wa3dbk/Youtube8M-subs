00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
was in this space of kind of imagining

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.060 
was in this space of kind of imagining
not<00:00:32.730> only<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> moon<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.780> into<00:00:34.050> Pisces<00:00:34.559> but

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
not only the moon going into Pisces but

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.190 
not only the moon going into Pisces but
then<00:00:35.250> coming<00:00:35.640> up<00:00:35.760> eventually<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.660> Neptune

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
then coming up eventually to Neptune

there's<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.980> sense<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.520> like<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:39.270> weekend

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
there's this sense of like this weekend

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.090 
there's this sense of like this weekend
begins<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.989> permission<00:00:42.989> slip<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.350> totally

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
begins with a permission slip to totally

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.970 
begins with a permission slip to totally
spaced<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.640> yeah<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.930> that's<00:00:46.230> for<00:00:46.710> sure<00:00:46.950> and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
spaced out yeah that that's for sure and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.520 
spaced out yeah that that's for sure and
we<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.399> use<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.090> number<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.420> ways<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:49.379> be

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
we can use it in a number of ways to be

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.430 
we can use it in a number of ways to be
irresponsible<00:00:49.950> which<00:00:50.850> might<00:00:51.300> get<00:00:51.629> us<00:00:51.899> into

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
irresponsible which might get us into

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.500 
irresponsible which might get us into
trouble<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.190> kind<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.579> thing<00:00:53.820> where<00:00:54.360> you

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
trouble it's the kind of thing where you

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.850 
trouble it's the kind of thing where you
don't<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:54.960> you're<00:00:55.260> creating<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
don't know that you're creating a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.160 
don't know that you're creating a
problem<00:00:56.309> now<00:00:56.550> by<00:00:56.850> ignoring<00:00:57.329> something<00:00:57.899> or

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
problem now by ignoring something or

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.200 
problem now by ignoring something or
doing<00:00:58.320> something<00:00:58.710> sloppily<00:00:59.309> but<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.059> may

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
doing something sloppily but you may

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.810 
doing something sloppily but you may
have<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.390> pay<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.870> price<00:01:01.020> later<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:02.670> it's

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
have to pay the price later I think it's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.000 
have to pay the price later I think it's
a<00:01:02.940> little<00:01:03.059> bit<00:01:03.210> wiser<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.019> invest<00:01:04.739> this

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
a little bit wiser to invest this

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.030 
a little bit wiser to invest this
magical<00:01:05.750> Pisces<00:01:06.750> moon<00:01:07.080> energy<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.890> its

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
magical Pisces moon energy in its

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.990 
magical Pisces moon energy in its
conjunction<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:08.760> dreamy<00:01:09.270> Neptune<00:01:09.840> into<00:01:10.650> art

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
conjunction with dreamy Neptune into art

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.670 
conjunction with dreamy Neptune into art
inspiration<00:01:12.000> romance<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.930> spirituality

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
inspiration romance and spirituality

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.920 
inspiration romance and spirituality
yeah<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> think<00:01:14.909> you're<00:01:15.180> right<00:01:15.240> Jeff<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.869> I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
yeah I think you're right Jeff and I

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.289 
yeah I think you're right Jeff and I
also<00:01:16.170> think<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.680> what<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.610> into<00:01:17.939> it

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
also think that what we do going into it

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.510 
also think that what we do going into it
is<00:01:18.479> important<00:01:19.080> meaning<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.860> before<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
is important meaning that before the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.219 
is important meaning that before the
moon<00:01:20.700> moves<00:01:20.939> into<00:01:21.240> Pisces<00:01:21.659> while<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.049> still

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
moon moves into Pisces while it's still

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.560 
moon moves into Pisces while it's still
an<00:01:22.350> Aquarius<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.189> while<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.909> buzzing<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
an Aquarius and while it's buzzing the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.660 
an Aquarius and while it's buzzing the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
tension of the uranus pluto square that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.789 
tension of the uranus pluto square that
we've<00:01:26.850> been<00:01:27.000> talking<00:01:27.180> about<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:27.960> days<00:01:28.470> weeks

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
we've been talking about for days weeks

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.600

years that while this is going on it's

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.969 
years that while this is going on it's
important<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> use<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.720> energy<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.470> some<00:01:34.770> way

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979
