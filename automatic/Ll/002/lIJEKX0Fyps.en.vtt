00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
up this is going to work the whole

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.710 
up this is going to work the whole
shoulder<00:00:45.670> it<00:00:45.850> loosens<00:00:46.180> this<00:00:46.270> up<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:46.600> gets

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
shoulder it loosens this up and gets

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.390 
shoulder it loosens this up and gets
blood<00:00:46.960> flow<00:00:47.170> then<00:00:47.380> it<00:00:47.440> opens<00:00:47.710> up<00:00:47.770> that<00:00:47.829> capsule

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
blood flow then it opens up that capsule

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.069 
blood flow then it opens up that capsule
where<00:00:48.550> you're<00:00:48.670> not<00:00:48.730> doing<00:00:49.000> any<00:00:49.150> overhead<00:00:49.630> so

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
where you're not doing any overhead so

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
shoulder but it's a great way to get

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.870 
shoulder but it's a great way to get
blood<00:00:55.420> flow<00:00:55.630> in<00:00:55.840> there<00:00:56.370> work<00:00:57.370> I<00:00:57.610> hand

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
blood flow in there work I hand

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.400 
blood flow in there work I hand
coordination<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:58.660> you<00:00:58.780> just<00:00:58.930> spin<00:00:59.170> it<00:00:59.290> around

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
coordination and you just spin it around

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.760 
coordination and you just spin it around
and<00:01:00.660> then<00:01:01.660> you<00:01:01.750> slow<00:01:01.960> it<00:01:01.989> down<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.500> do<00:01:02.649> the

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.840 
tight this is a good rehab exercise as
well<00:01:43.830> maybe<00:01:44.830> even<00:01:45.130> using<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.430> lighter<00:01:45.610> can

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
well maybe even using the lighter can

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.490 
well maybe even using the lighter can
about<00:01:46.060> one<00:01:46.330> that<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.600> can<00:01:46.720> handle<00:01:47.080> but

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
about one that you can handle but

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.750 
about one that you can handle but
ideally<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:48.010> want<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.220> come<00:01:48.400> all<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.670> way

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
ideally you want to come all the way

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.399 
ideally you want to come all the way
around<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.299> once<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:49.689> get<00:01:49.900> it<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.229> want<00:01:50.380> to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
around and once you get it you want to

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.060 
around and once you get it you want to
speed<00:01:50.650> it<00:01:50.770> up<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.510> do<00:01:52.510> 10<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.900> 15<00:01:52.990> reps<00:01:53.260> slow<00:01:53.950> it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
speed it up and do 10 to 15 reps slow it

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.679 
speed it up and do 10 to 15 reps slow it
down<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.549> then<00:01:55.299> take<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.659> other

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
down and then take it the other

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.830 
down and then take it the other
direction<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.549> as<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:57.850> can<00:01:57.939> see<00:01:58.000> is<00:01:58.390> working

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
direction and as you can see is working

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.770 
direction and as you can see is working
both<00:01:59.049> shoulders<00:01:59.520> simultaneously<00:02:00.549> and<00:02:00.780> it's

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
both shoulders simultaneously and it's

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.080 
both shoulders simultaneously and it's
really<00:02:02.140> opening<00:02:02.409> up<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.619> capsules

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
really opening up the capsules

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.460 
really opening up the capsules
