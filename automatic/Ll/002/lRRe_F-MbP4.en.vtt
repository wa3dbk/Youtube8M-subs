00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.130
 Greetings be great teacher Miguel Illescas 

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:08.809
 director of the magazine where root and 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.900
 I want to present you the copy of 1 of 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.870
 March the number 115 wrong to be searched in 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.019
 the cover and below it beside him 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.660
 five young people who achieved a magnificent 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:24.259
 result in the Dutch tournament the 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.460
 magazine where King 115 is dedicated 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.740
 fundamentally however to the 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.439
 sections more than half of their 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.900
 content is geared to everyone 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.460
 those who want to improve their game 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.100
 with training sections 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.950
 learning among which good I'm going to 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.020
 mention more all but for me it highlights 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.240
 especially the course that is 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.820
 directing bolis slonik this is the 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.700
 third delivery in this case the second 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.280
 part of everything that is dedicated to the game 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.140
 tactical in the next copy 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.750
 will tackle is longing everything that has 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.920
 what to do with the positional fire and what 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.460
 doubt it is a material of 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.070
 first level because slonik was a 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.950
 coach of great reputation in the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.600
 Soviet school and in this section 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.189
 he overturns all his knowledge 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.770
 most examples that is the only thing that 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.759
 uses are very posts are very 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.990
 didactic the course as you see 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.079
 we have slightly changed the 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.289
 layout now the sources are a lot 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.520
 clearer the diagrams there my colleague 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.219
 Carlos is also doing a great 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.509
 work and the course then with a 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.429
 room as I always tell you very 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.100
 island practice after the 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:37.399
 explanations as the page comes with 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.840
 in this case nine exercises that from 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.670
 then they are not the only ones who present 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.890
 where there are because almost all the sessions 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.500
 or at least several of them have that 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.350
 practical guidance for example 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.820
 greatest gain to the series d talks to 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.820
 your pieces with anti vision 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.850
 also at the end of the article 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.120
 including a series of exercises 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.730
 for my part to see 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.030
 always lately I include the test 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.950
 tactics that you see 15 positions and you 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.320
 I assure you that they are well selected they are 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.670
 very didactic exercises in this case 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.000
 are classified by level of 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.370
 difficulty the magazine as regards the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.910
 hedges focuses mostly on the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.430
 tapas tournament that as you know it was 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.890
 called by magnus carlsen although such 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.050
 as it says of 8 at boot as 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.330
 always spectacular I'm dissatisfied 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.170
 with my game go to where you can 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.340
 get this guy not then enough 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.620
 commented games of that tournament 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.890
 even a section like that was played so that 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.569
 You can test a selection of 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.030
 positions made by olga 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.280
 where you can test our 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.260
 knowledge and then as to the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.049
 currently we have an article of 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.969
 come bachet on the tournament and the altar 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.280
 and of course the tournament they believe that 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:59.430
 Notice that make it spectacular 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.730
 double page with photographs of 4 years 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.109
 in this case about the game tournament in 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.000
 baden baden who also saw victory 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.250
 de magnus this time a little more 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.269
 tight because he had to resort to tie 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.280
 break against him and the great surprise of 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.269
 tournament that was in haiti and other 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.919
 sections that for me also give to 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.989
 the magazine a great quality and variety 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.849
 for example the tallarico article its 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.120
 Majesty the pawn tells us funny 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:30.329
 anecdotes mario tádic or about this 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.879
 little clamp but so important and a 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.439
 very curious article by Alberto Bañón 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.840
 the final tables 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.120
 Alberto presents us with a position 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.260
 that really is amazing because it is 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.140
 mate in 238 inches then called my 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.660
 Attention and I wanted to contribute my granite 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.379
 sand and you will see how I analyze s mart in 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.120
 238 so we can understand the logic 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.549
 of the tides evidently only 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.379
 a machine can predict that mate and 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.510
 In this article we bring you a little closer to 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.580
 thinking of the machines there are more 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.540
 sections I really liked introducing you 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.680
 play-by-play in this case an analysis 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.380
 very happy with a game so that the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.069
 you understand perfectly the duel that 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.130
 he faced here they already ran into 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.820
 and nothing more and nothing less than eight pages 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.519
 paint as the section says 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.430
 play-by-play explaining each of 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.220
 the plays of course to fix with 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.310
 letter 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.560
 few variants many explanations 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.860
 so that any fan can 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.990
 understand 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.819
 how these great players are handled 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.689
 then we have also the article of 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:38.729
 Oscar de la Riva 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.929
 the opening is an end article 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:45.419
 very interesting Jesus of the villa and 

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:48.289
 basically that is the body that forms 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:51.629
 this left king pawn as a novelty 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.909
 and very remarkable I would like to mention the 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.979

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:59.879
