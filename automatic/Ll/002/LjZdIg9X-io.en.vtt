00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
see here I have a lighter socket now

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.470 
see here I have a lighter socket now
what<00:00:07.620> was<00:00:07.740> happening<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.490> factory<00:00:09.059> one<00:00:09.269> we

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
what was happening is the factory one we

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.169 
what was happening is the factory one we
had<00:00:09.690> here<00:00:09.719> would<00:00:10.650> always<00:00:11.070> groundout<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:11.880> short

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
had here would always groundout in short

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.060 
had here would always groundout in short
she's<00:00:12.630> replaced<00:00:13.110> three<00:00:13.380> or<00:00:13.500> four<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.830> them<00:00:13.920> so

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
she's replaced three or four of them so

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.519 
she's replaced three or four of them so
I<00:00:14.130> thought<00:00:14.309> I'd<00:00:14.460> help<00:00:14.580> her<00:00:14.790> out<00:00:14.849> today<00:00:15.179> and

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
I thought I'd help her out today and

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.470 
I thought I'd help her out today and
instead<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:17.670> replacing<00:00:18.150> with<00:00:18.270> another

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
instead of just replacing with another

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.519 
instead of just replacing with another
factory<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.050> short

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
factory to short

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.880 
factory to short
I<00:00:19.560> cut<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.550> old<00:00:20.820> mechanism<00:00:21.810> out<00:00:22.320> for<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.740> old

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
I cut the old mechanism out for the old

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.830 
I cut the old mechanism out for the old

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
hand is fun so there we go

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.499 
hand is fun so there we go
as<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.700> can<00:01:37.820> see<00:01:38.000> we're<00:01:38.180> just<00:01:38.329> going<00:01:38.479> to

as you can see we're just going to

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.969 
as you can see we're just going to
sandwich<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:38.899> and<00:01:39.259> then<00:01:39.439> it<00:01:39.590> becomes<00:01:39.829> very

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
wire which is just it'll go on the pin

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.309 
wire which is just it'll go on the pin
and<00:01:52.310> then<00:01:52.939> off<00:01:53.119> of<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.360> pin<00:01:53.600> that'll<00:01:54.200> go<00:01:54.289> to

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
and then off of the pin that'll go to

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.169 
and then off of the pin that'll go to
your<00:01:54.500> positive<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:55.250> then<00:01:55.700> you'll<00:01:55.850> see<00:01:56.030> right

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.350 
here all you need is a set of blades
which<00:01:58.880> is<00:01:59.679> this<00:02:00.679> right<00:02:01.579> there<00:02:01.819> a<00:02:02.000> blade

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
which is this right there a blade

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.929 
which is this right there a blade
connector<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.469> you<00:02:03.500> slide<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.159> blade<00:02:04.369> on<00:02:04.579> the

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
connector and you slide the blade on the

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.149 
connector and you slide the blade on the
blade<00:02:05.240> connector<00:02:06.229> that<00:02:06.500> goes<00:02:06.560> on<00:02:06.799> here<00:02:06.829> goes

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
blade connector that goes on here goes

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.460 
blade connector that goes on here goes
to<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:08.030> ground<00:02:08.299> you<00:02:08.690> ground<00:02:08.989> it<00:02:09.170> on<00:02:09.319> the

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
to the ground you ground it on the

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.580 
to the ground you ground it on the
chassis<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.099> then<00:02:10.580> right<00:02:10.789> here<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.569> pin<00:02:12.110> goes

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
chassis and then right here the pin goes

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.860 
chassis and then right here the pin goes
to<00:02:12.620> positive<00:02:12.920> which<00:02:13.849> is<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.120> red<00:02:14.360> wire<00:02:14.569> and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
to positive which is that red wire and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.569 
to positive which is that red wire and
as<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.530> can<00:02:15.620> see<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.799> also<00:02:15.980> have<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.160> black<00:02:16.340> wire

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
as you can see I also have a black wire

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.430 
as you can see I also have a black wire
so<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:16.819> can<00:02:17.030> just<00:02:17.180> use<00:02:17.329> that<00:02:17.420> as<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.599> ground<00:02:17.780> also

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
so I can just use that as a ground also

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.100 
so I can just use that as a ground also
and<00:02:18.709> then<00:02:19.370> by<00:02:19.640> doing<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.180> then<00:02:20.540> you'll<00:02:20.750> have<00:02:21.049> a

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
and then by doing so then you'll have a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.390 
and then by doing so then you'll have a
cigarette<00:02:21.410> lighter<00:02:21.739> again<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.310> don't

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
cigarette lighter again and you don't

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.979 
cigarette lighter again and you don't
have<00:02:22.519> to<00:02:22.640> worry<00:02:22.790> about<00:02:22.940> trying<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.209> find<00:02:23.420> an

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
have to worry about trying to find an

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.050 
have to worry about trying to find an
old<00:02:24.140> factory<00:02:24.440> one<00:02:24.890> or<00:02:25.130> if<00:02:25.370> you're<00:02:25.519> adding<00:02:25.880> one

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
old factory one or if you're adding one

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.080 
old factory one or if you're adding one
and<00:02:26.299> you<00:02:27.290> have<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.530> cigarette<00:02:27.890> new<00:02:28.220> leather<00:02:28.940> in

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
and you have a cigarette new leather in

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.210 
and you have a cigarette new leather in
your<00:02:29.180> clothes<00:02:29.510> like<00:02:30.110> this<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:30.950> can<00:02:31.099> always
