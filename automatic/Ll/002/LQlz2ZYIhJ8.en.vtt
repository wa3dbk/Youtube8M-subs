00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.599 
first Drake joins and it's pretty
harmless<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:01.140> when<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.409> second<00:02:01.799> one<00:02:01.920> joins

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
harmless but when the second one joins

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.300 
harmless but when the second one joins
in<00:02:02.819> which<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.539> at<00:02:03.689> 80<00:02:03.929> seconds<00:02:04.409> that's<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.280> guy

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
in which is at 80 seconds that's the guy

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.429 
in which is at 80 seconds that's the guy
that<00:02:05.429> makes<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.909> boss<00:02:06.149> immune<00:02:06.539> you<00:02:07.109> need<00:02:07.319> to

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
that makes the boss immune you need to

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.930 
that makes the boss immune you need to
go<00:02:07.560> into<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.829> portal<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.460> kill<00:02:08.610> something

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
go into a portal and kill something

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.690 
go into a portal and kill something
inside<00:02:09.270> on

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
inside on

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.449 
inside on
while<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.270> come<00:02:10.390> back<00:02:10.539> out<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:12.129> drops

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
while and come back out and that drops

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.339 
while and come back out and that drops
the<00:02:12.640> shield<00:02:12.910> but<00:02:13.720> that's<00:02:13.930> not<00:02:14.080> an<00:02:14.230> option

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
the shield but that's not an option

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.020 
the shield but that's not an option
because<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.950> can't<00:02:15.190> use<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.550> for<00:02:15.760> loop<00:02:15.970> if

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
because you can't use the for loop if

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.000 
because you can't use the for loop if
you<00:02:16.090> use<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.360> portal<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:17.260> resets<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.830> rate

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
you use the portal it resets the rate

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.610 
you use the portal it resets the rate
and<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.640> know<00:02:18.790> what<00:02:18.970> that<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:20.080> is<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.319> one

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
and you know what that this is a one

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.970 
and you know what that this is a one
hundred<00:02:20.920> percent<00:02:21.000> drop<00:02:22.000> chance<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:23.590> basically

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
hundred percent drop chance so basically

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.619 
hundred percent drop chance so basically
you<00:02:24.190> do<00:02:24.400> get<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.760> mount<00:02:24.940> if<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.300> kill<00:02:25.480> the

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
you do get the mount if you kill the

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.990 
you do get the mount if you kill the
boss<00:02:25.810> without<00:02:26.080> killing<00:02:26.709> any<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:27.340> those<00:02:27.550> three

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
boss without killing any of those three

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.640 
boss without killing any of those three
