00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
suggest doing to the side so it looks

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.830 
suggest doing to the side so it looks
more<00:02:29.860> natural<00:02:30.130> as<00:02:30.519> if<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:30.850> keeps<00:02:31.299> on<00:02:31.480> going

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
more natural as if it's keeps on going

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.690
