00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
 points and this practice was your squad 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.500
 found something 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.270
 at lunch, he said good 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.209
 share on trends and again them 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.209
 again unnoticed 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.810
 Meet those stations in those years 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.130
 then when you almost never want how 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.239
 only 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.539
 how to study stations from the south and north 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.539
 we marked the application 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.699
 regarding his story 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.599
 I have a feeling that I am gradually starting 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.550
 but 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.360
 very little 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.250
 itv just kill time 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.250
 proved impossible 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.160
 but 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
 that is, money 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
 four have already met in the book 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.640
 I don’t know that 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.400
 in the clip froze in his tracks with a book in 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.980
 hands 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.550
 they wrote out the library 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.040
 cards and tried ignoring while doing so 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.970
 endless calls like it goes 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.970
 it was difficult 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.070
 day of work in the field is over we 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.470
 really spent time and 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.890
 money didn't find anything at all 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.250
 but just before parting 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.600
 eminent want to ask China 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.250
 Washington she's in my ear 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.000
 not bad damn it 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.570
 if at all what did you do 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.240
 apparently the same as 3 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.310
 so what did you find something 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.020
 interesting 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.710
 but as you can see the situation is that 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.130
 here and now your interlocutor is not so 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.430
 defenseless 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.630
 when order 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.930
 will be the day after tomorrow at school 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.930
 she said them well 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.780
 n and sleep 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.570
 the beginning of the week was still dreaming 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.840
 the rainy season entered the class Haruqi that 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.400
 strange just before the calls 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.869
 defeat by the same best 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.529
 over the weekend I do not know said 7 4 6 4 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.269
 what became 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.259
 in general, nothing special 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:20.679
 it's very scary harbin everywhere 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:22.359
 bombarded my back with rays 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.169
 depressed 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.369
 in the end, our club won like a field 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:29.719
 mouse bosh and forest fire 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.299
 I would need to talk to someone 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.760
 baby and you don't want to say nothing 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.759
 by the embassies 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:40.429
 you said karpin 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:43.429
 so the other two chiles are already approaching 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.659
 How much do you know I understand 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.549
 sillamäe is not an ordinary person ah 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.989
 then it will be easier for me 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.589
 for so it is 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.119
 but then tell me your story 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:56.870
 of course you understand that I 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.029
 psychic 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:01.139
 so far we will call me that 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.379
 in fact, I did not plan 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:03.959
 translate so hastily behind 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.409
 semester one circumstance 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:07.779
 who could have imagined that these 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.400
 two just like your family 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.769
 that's the thing 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.969
 maybe someday I'll share with you 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.180
 details and all this is better once 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.389
 see what to hear a hundred times and what I 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.909
 I will show you in no comments 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.099
 needs 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.829
 there are others in our organization 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.689
 psychics except me 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.339
 several agents succeeded quite 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:29.529
 successfully infiltrate this school we 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:31.859
 We've been watching Suzumiya for three years now. 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.749
 that is, the very beginning 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:35.899
 three years ago just didn't happen 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:37.559
 nothing 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:39.619
 when I myself passed the strength of all 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:40.859
 natural strength 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.619
 psychic three years ago it is clear but 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:44.839
 as often happens 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:46.339
 organization leadership not 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:47.650
 excludes that our world 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.549
 it's all just a dream that sees and 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.610
 shows us did not exist 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.919
 but since it is a dream 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.959
 the creation of destruction with which 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.420
 we exist which is then a reality 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.200
 his treatment and for normal 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.269
 of existence 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.790
 we even know that it could be 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.219
 carried out 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:04.449
 of course 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.179
 defined in a similar way there 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.859
 humanity but this whole body 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.809
 rub violated you are already considered by the bank 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:13.699
 after thinking about it please 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.939
 since psychics kurass serial 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:16.499
 the numbers are really 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.439
 exist in the world doesn't it mean that 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:21.029
 just appeared not by chance and then 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.090
 to come together revenge here 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.889
 and also under the slogans 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:26.990
 three years ago 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.790
 laid upon 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.610
 especially since three years ago, well 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.090
 as established by the investigation 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.880
 not crossed varivod correctly speak 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.810
 that three years ago this world arose 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.779
 Anyway, I don’t think so 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:39.779
 that is, this is our working hypothesis 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.809
 what then want to do with short 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:46.300
 we want to make it so deeper destroyed 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.520
 this world to save 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.410
 also new when he has a bad 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.189
 mood 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.759
 data not only I test for the tournament 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.689
 the most tender feelings why not then 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:56.569
 I will say good in samara 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.170
 frankly in the organization 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.090
 Today 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.139
 just like you 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.990
 There are those who think that we need 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.249
 go further 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:04.939
 however, most believe that we are not 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:05.889
 we have not the slightest right 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.490
 experimenting is too great and the answer 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.520
 she is still far from aware of her 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.600
 true power 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.210
 let it be so clear 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.789
 let it not guess anything 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.620
 dropping down will be calm 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.580
 you won't sleep god yes 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.770
 just so what if this is actually 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.419
 humiliating 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.490
 while there is such a probability 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.250
 m however we strive to prevent 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.250
 deterioration acting on the basis of the most 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.930
 dangerous screenplay 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.120
 the main thing is now st 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.150
 show me something psychic 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.330
 new policy here its strength 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.740
 so how can I believe by their words 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.930
 that's the case so here's this coffee again 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.789
 became hot my village is not so manifest 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.219
 primitive way 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.239
 besides, I usually have no 

00:05:49.239 --> 00:05:50.309
 there is no power 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:52.409
 it comes to an end only if they converge 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:54.539
 together certain conditions 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.949
 as she said once i will share with you 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.749
 details 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:01.069
 I'm sorry you had so much time from him 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.069
 and today is allowed to bow out 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.720
 by the way the biggest mystery is you forgive me 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.099
 please but I investigate in detail 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.550
 myself in many different countries I guarantee 3 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.430
 ordinary man 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.430
 hmm 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.599
 decision 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.639
 and perform and Caspian 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.639
 without question 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:38.629
 that day however 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:41.629
 the boxes in the club never seemed 

00:07:55.789 --> 00:07:56.610
 dmitry costume
