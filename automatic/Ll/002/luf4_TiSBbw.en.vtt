really<00:03:17.950> basic<00:03:18.730> but<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.030> could<00:03:19.180> definitely

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
really basic but you could definitely

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.960 
really basic but you could definitely
wear<00:03:20.440> like<00:03:20.680> maybe<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:20.980> chambray<00:03:21.370> shirt<00:03:21.610> under

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
wear like maybe a chambray shirt under

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.400 
wear like maybe a chambray shirt under
them<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.300> make<00:03:22.480> them<00:03:22.630> a<00:03:22.750> little<00:03:22.870> more<00:03:22.989> like

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
them to make them a little more like

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.410 
them to make them a little more like
dressed<00:03:23.680> up<00:03:23.890> or<00:03:24.550> you<00:03:24.850> can<00:03:25.030> wear<00:03:25.120> them<00:03:25.360> with

like<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.810> puffer<00:03:26.170> vest<00:03:26.440> so<00:03:26.980> i<00:03:27.280> think<00:03:27.700> that<00:03:27.910> these

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
like a puffer vest so i think that these

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.759 
like a puffer vest so i think that these
are<00:03:28.330> definitely<00:03:28.600> something<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:29.440> everyone

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
are definitely something that everyone
