everyone so today I'm going to be
showing<00:00:03.000> you<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.720> project<00:00:04.290> I've<00:00:04.470> been

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
showing you the project I've been

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.710 
showing you the project I've been
working<00:00:05.040> on<00:00:05.130> for<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.430> last<00:00:05.460> two<00:00:06.089> weeks<00:00:06.120> which

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
working on for the last two weeks which

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.440 
working on for the last two weeks which
is<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:07.080> miniature<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.220> st.<00:00:08.580> Basil's

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
is a miniature of the st. Basil's

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.990 
is a miniature of the st. Basil's
Cathedral<00:00:09.960> which<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:11.099> Moscow<00:00:11.639> Russia<00:00:14.000> so

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
Cathedral which is in Moscow Russia so

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.210 
Cathedral which is in Moscow Russia so
I've<00:00:15.330> been<00:00:15.570> intrigued<00:00:16.049> by<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.320> architectural

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
I've been intrigued by the architectural

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.460 
I've been intrigued by the architectural
design<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.090> Cathedral<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.840> architect

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
design of the Cathedral the architect

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.670 
design of the Cathedral the architect
said<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.220> each<00:00:21.210> tower<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.840> different<00:00:22.380> if<00:00:22.560> you

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
said that each tower is different if you

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.830 
said that each tower is different if you
see<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:22.949> real<00:00:23.160> life<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.210> nobody<00:00:24.570> can

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
see in real life so that nobody can

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.259 
see in real life so that nobody can
replicate<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.590> but<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.279> ironic<00:00:26.430> because<00:00:26.880> I

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
replicate it but it's ironic because I

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.800 
replicate it but it's ironic because I
am<00:00:27.810> kind<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.710> replicating<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.330> way<00:00:30.449> which

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
am kind of replicating it in a way which

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.810 
am kind of replicating it in a way which
is<00:00:30.840> making<00:00:31.410> miniature

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.150 

so<00:00:34.820> this<00:00:35.239> is<00:00:35.449> the<00:00:35.629> process<00:00:35.899> of<00:00:36.379> how<00:00:36.500> I<00:00:36.530> made<00:00:37.129> it

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
so this is the process of how I made it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.869 
so this is the process of how I made it
I<00:00:37.550> first<00:00:38.269> researched<00:00:38.960> on<00:00:39.260> google<00:00:40.100> images<00:00:40.820> and

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
I first researched on google images and

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.110 
I first researched on google images and
Sketch<00:00:41.629> up<00:00:41.870> to<00:00:42.170> see<00:00:42.409> the<00:00:42.860> rough<00:00:43.219> outlook<00:00:43.789> of

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
Sketch up to see the rough outlook of

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.340 
Sketch up to see the rough outlook of
the<00:00:44.960> Cathedral<00:00:46.000> then<00:00:47.000> I<00:00:47.739> got<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.949> floor<00:00:49.219> plan

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
the Cathedral then I got the floor plan

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.889 
the Cathedral then I got the floor plan
next<00:00:51.350> I<00:00:51.559> used<00:00:52.070> some<00:00:52.339> aluminium<00:00:52.519> foil<00:00:53.180> for<00:00:53.839> the

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
next I used some aluminium foil for the

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.219 
next I used some aluminium foil for the
base<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.559> I<00:00:55.519> covered<00:00:56.000> it<00:00:56.149> with<00:00:56.199> polymer<00:00:57.199> clay

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.229 
base and I covered it with polymer clay

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:03.100 
base and I covered it with polymer clay
I<00:00:59.920> then<00:01:00.920> started<00:01:01.909> to<00:01:01.969> make<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.449> tear<00:01:02.780> for<00:01:03.049> the

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
I then started to make a tear for the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.130 
I then started to make a tear for the
center<00:01:03.500> Tower

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
center Tower

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.730 
center Tower
after<00:01:06.140> that<00:01:06.470> I<00:01:06.770> worked<00:01:07.250> on<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:08.509> sides<00:01:09.020> of<00:01:09.440> the

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
after that I worked on the sides of the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.969 
after that I worked on the sides of the
building<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.880> detail<00:01:11.330> was<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:12.280> so<00:01:13.280> much

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
building and the detail was so so much

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.330 
building and the detail was so so much
then<00:01:15.979> I<00:01:16.399> made<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.509> four<00:01:17.960> small<00:01:18.409> towers<00:01:19.039> which

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
then I made the four small towers which

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.760 
then I made the four small towers which
I<00:01:19.550> ended<00:01:19.880> up<00:01:19.970> having<00:01:20.360> to<00:01:20.509> cut<00:01:20.539> because<00:01:21.289> it<00:01:21.619> was

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
I ended up having to cut because it was

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.510 
I ended up having to cut because it was
too<00:01:22.039> tall<00:01:23.000> when<00:01:23.300> I<00:01:23.330> arranged<00:01:23.780> them<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:25.310> these

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
too tall when I arranged them so these

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.210 
too tall when I arranged them so these
are<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.789> pieces<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.569> I<00:01:26.929> faked<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.590> afterwards

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
are the pieces and I faked it afterwards

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.410 
are the pieces and I faked it afterwards
I<00:01:29.110> started<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.799> paint<00:01:31.039> everything<00:01:31.580> using<00:01:32.299> a

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
I started to paint everything using a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.080 
I started to paint everything using a
Philippine

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.290 

these<00:01:40.090> are<00:01:40.300> the<00:01:40.420> pieces<00:01:40.690> I<00:01:41.850> arranged<00:01:42.850> the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
these are the pieces I arranged the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.090 
these are the pieces I arranged the
places<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.350> group<00:01:44.650> them<00:01:44.830> together

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
places and I group them together

00:01:45.100 --> 00:02:58.100 
places and I group them together
afterwards<00:01:45.820> I<00:01:46.120> glazed<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:46.930> I<00:01:47.170> was<00:01:47.350> done

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110
