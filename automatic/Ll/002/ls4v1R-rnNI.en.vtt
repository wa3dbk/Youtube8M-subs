00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
you're the designer

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.990 
you're the designer
during<00:00:55.109> the<00:00:55.199> engineer<00:00:55.710> you're<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.579> welders

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
during the engineer you're the welders

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.959 
during the engineer you're the welders
you're<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.899> electrician<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:59.579> for<00:00:59.789> some

I did that

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.200

nobody<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.259> take<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.440> away<00:01:10.619> from<00:01:10.830> him

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:26.090 

I<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:18.659> blank<00:01:19.659> canvas<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.729> car<00:01:22.000> is<00:01:22.210> I

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.980 

like<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.990> challenge<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:30.540> building<00:01:31.540> it<00:01:31.869> into

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
like the challenge of building it into

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.960 
like the challenge of building it into
something<00:01:32.290> that<00:01:32.440> it<00:01:32.650> wasn't<00:01:32.680> or<00:01:33.250> making<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:33.820> do

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
something that it wasn't or making it do

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.399 
something that it wasn't or making it do
something<00:01:34.300> that<00:01:34.600> it<00:01:34.720> didn't<00:01:34.930> do<00:01:34.990> very<00:01:35.020> well

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
something that it didn't do very well

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.080 
something that it didn't do very well
from<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.619> factory<00:01:38.430> how<00:01:39.430> much<00:01:39.610> were<00:01:39.759> designed

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
from the factory how much were designed

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.290 
from the factory how much were designed
as<00:01:40.270> grocery<00:01:40.690> getters<00:01:41.050> something<00:01:41.860> for<00:01:42.300> your

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
as grocery getters something for your

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.260 
as grocery getters something for your
wife<00:01:43.479> to<00:01:43.780> run<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.770> store<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:45.310> pick<00:01:46.030> up<00:01:46.149> the

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
wife to run to the store and pick up the

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.410 
wife to run to the store and pick up the
kids<00:01:46.450> from<00:01:46.570> school<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.820> we're<00:01:49.000> completely

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
kids from school and we're completely

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.830 
kids from school and we're completely
changing<00:01:49.960> all<00:01:50.080> of<00:01:50.229> that<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:51.610> car<00:01:51.880> will<00:01:52.060> have

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
changing all of that this car will have

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.650 
changing all of that this car will have
high<00:01:53.289> amounts<00:01:53.619> of<00:01:53.800> horsepower<00:01:54.660> incredible

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
high amounts of horsepower incredible

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.540 
high amounts of horsepower incredible
braking<00:01:56.020> performance<00:01:56.369> they'll<00:01:57.369> have<00:01:57.520> a

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
braking performance they'll have a

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.190 
braking performance they'll have a
six-speed<00:01:57.850> transmission<00:01:58.600> so<00:01:58.780> it'll<00:01:58.960> still

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
six-speed transmission so it'll still

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.139 
six-speed transmission so it'll still
get<00:01:59.320> probably<00:02:00.070> better<00:02:00.310> mileage<00:02:00.580> than<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:01.030> did

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
get probably better mileage than it did

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.600 
get probably better mileage than it did
when<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.390> was<00:02:01.479> new<00:02:01.570> so<00:02:03.450> we're<00:02:04.450> taking<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.899> stock

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
when it was new so we're taking a stock

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.090 
when it was new so we're taking a stock
1965<00:02:06.610> Mercury<00:02:07.060> Comet<00:02:07.270> Caliente<00:02:08.019> and<00:02:08.350> we're

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
1965 Mercury Comet Caliente and we're

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.469 
1965 Mercury Comet Caliente and we're
gonna<00:02:09.190> build<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.610> into<00:02:09.759> an<00:02:09.880> ultimate<00:02:10.119> street

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
gonna build it into an ultimate street

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.009 
gonna build it into an ultimate street
car<00:02:11.940> then<00:02:12.940> we're<00:02:13.060> gonna<00:02:13.209> race<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.840> out

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
car then we're gonna race the out

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:24.460 
car then we're gonna race the out
of<00:02:14.050> it

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470
