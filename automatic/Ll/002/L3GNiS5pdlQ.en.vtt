power amplifier it's got a 30 decibel
gain<00:00:16.250> amplifier<00:00:17.270> which<00:00:18.270> means<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.720> can<00:00:18.869> pick

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
gain amplifier which means you can pick

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.380 
gain amplifier which means you can pick
up<00:00:19.730> challenge<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:20.970> weren't<00:00:21.150> getting

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
up challenge that you weren't getting

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.769 
up challenge that you weren't getting
before<00:00:21.900> maybe<00:00:22.789> and<00:00:23.789> get<00:00:23.939> better<00:00:24.090> receptions

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
before maybe and get better receptions

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.410 
before maybe and get better receptions
with<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.170> ones<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:26.010> getting<00:00:26.730> if<00:00:27.300> you

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
with the ones you are getting if you

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.689 
with the ones you are getting if you
have<00:00:27.689> some<00:00:28.109> problems<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.980> manner<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
have some problems in that manner and a

have some problems in that manner and a
lot<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.970> people<00:00:30.240> are<00:00:30.390> these<00:00:30.570> days<00:00:30.800> because<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
lot of people are these days because the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.590 
lot of people are these days because the
change<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.520> digital<00:00:33.000> now<00:00:33.149> I'm<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.480> show

you just ran into a problem here
one<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.200> problems<00:00:37.860> with<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.250> antenna

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
one of the problems with this antenna

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.970 
one of the problems with this antenna
you<00:00:38.910> get<00:00:39.090> around<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.020> end<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.530> cycle<00:00:40.890> it

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
you get around to the end of a cycle it

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.479 
you get around to the end of a cycle it
goes<00:00:41.010> 360<00:00:41.940> degrees<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:43.440> tends<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.860> stop

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
goes 360 degrees and it tends to stop

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.190 
goes 360 degrees and it tends to stop
you<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.000> give<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> little<00:00:45.420> nudge<00:00:45.570> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
you have to give it a little nudge to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.869 
you have to give it a little nudge to
get<00:00:46.860> them<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.219> back<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> other

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
get them going back in the other

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.670 
get them going back in the other
direction

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.300 

okay<00:00:52.020> that's<00:00:53.020> my<00:00:53.230> experience<00:00:53.620> with<00:00:53.980> it<00:00:54.130> I'm

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
okay that's my experience with it I'm

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.770 
okay that's my experience with it I'm
just<00:00:54.520> being<00:00:54.790> honest<00:00:55.090> with<00:00:55.180> you<00:00:55.390> here<00:00:57.630> but<00:00:58.630> I<00:00:58.660> do

just being honest with you here but I do
I<00:00:59.230> am<00:00:59.470> getting<00:00:59.770> better<00:00:59.890> reception<00:01:00.400> with<00:01:00.760> this

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
I am getting better reception with this

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.070 
I am getting better reception with this
okay<00:01:03.130> now<00:01:03.430> it's<00:01:03.760> yes<00:01:04.120> it's<00:01:04.330> got<00:01:04.660> a<00:01:04.720> plastic

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
tubes sit on - and you have to assemble

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.660 
tubes sit on - and you have to assemble
that<00:01:11.800> it<00:01:12.490> comes<00:01:12.850> in<00:01:13.060> this<00:01:13.210> box<00:01:14.910> okay<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.670> it

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
that it comes in this box okay so it

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.410 
that it comes in this box okay so it
comes<00:01:18.910> in<00:01:19.090> this<00:01:19.150> box<00:01:19.540> I<00:01:20.020> bought<00:01:20.440> it<00:01:20.560> on<00:01:20.650> eBay

comes in this box I bought it on eBay

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.750 
comes in this box I bought it on eBay
they<00:01:22.420> sent<00:01:23.260> it<00:01:23.320> ups<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.950> box<00:01:27.220> was<00:01:27.430> inside

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
they sent it ups and this box was inside

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.630 
they sent it ups and this box was inside
another<00:01:28.030> box<00:01:28.530> okay<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.800> as<00:01:29.920> I<00:01:30.070> said<00:01:30.130> I<00:01:30.280> had<00:01:30.490> to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
another box okay and as I said I had to

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
another box okay and as I said I had to
assemble<00:01:31.090> this<00:01:31.300> it<00:01:32.020> comes<00:01:32.500> with<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:34.330> power

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
assemble this it comes with the power

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.450 
assemble this it comes with the power
amplifier<00:01:35.700> coax<00:01:36.700> cable<00:01:37.300> which<00:01:37.900> that<00:01:38.590> ties

amplifier coax cable which that ties

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.510 
amplifier coax cable which that ties
into<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:40.060> main<00:01:40.630> stalk<00:01:41.020> here<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:42.040> comes

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
into the main stalk here it comes

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.520 
into the main stalk here it comes
already<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.479> there<00:01:43.690> you<00:01:43.869> just<00:01:43.900> plug<00:01:44.290> it<00:01:44.410> into

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
already in there you just plug it into

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.550 
already in there you just plug it into
the<00:01:44.710> amplifier<00:01:44.979> endures<00:01:45.869> 45<00:01:46.869> for<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.140> cable

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560

uh if you need any more help figuring it
out<00:02:36.239> okay<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.569> then<00:02:37.720> there's<00:02:37.870> their<00:02:38.230> straps

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
out okay and then there's their straps

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.610 
out okay and then there's their straps
here<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.610> attach<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.209> amplifier<00:02:40.750> just<00:02:41.349> some

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
here to attach the amplifier just some

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.539 
here to attach the amplifier just some
aluminum<00:02:42.129> straps<00:02:43.349> it's<00:02:44.349> not<00:02:44.650> difficult<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.340> did

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
aluminum straps it's not difficult I did

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.530 
aluminum straps it's not difficult I did

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
suggested using drill bit to screw these

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.069 
suggested using drill bit to screw these
some<00:02:53.739> of<00:02:53.829> these<00:02:53.920> holes<00:02:54.430> for<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.060> straps<00:02:55.390> but<00:02:56.019> I

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
some of these holes for the straps but I

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.170 
some of these holes for the straps but I
didn't<00:02:56.500> do<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.860> just<00:02:57.129> use<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.489> screws<00:02:57.849> and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
didn't do that I just use the screws and

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.300 
didn't do that I just use the screws and
I<00:02:58.269> got<00:02:58.450> through<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.810> okay<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.950> then<00:03:02.950> like<00:03:03.190> I

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
I got through it okay and then like I

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.890 
I got through it okay and then like I
said<00:03:03.370> I'm<00:03:03.609> using<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:04.030> same<00:03:04.239> doors<00:03:04.510> I've<00:03:04.720> got

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
said I'm using the same doors I've got

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.149 
said I'm using the same doors I've got
this<00:03:05.049> on<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:07.049> like<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:08.290> rotor<00:03:08.590> fan<00:03:09.930> stand<00:03:11.159> okay

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
this on it like a rotor fan stand okay

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.610 
this on it like a rotor fan stand okay
you're<00:03:12.579> probably<00:03:12.790> familiar<00:03:13.000> with<00:03:13.329> that

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
here you attach to a pole and that's how

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.800 
here you attach to a pole and that's how
you<00:03:22.150> hold<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.720> on<00:03:23.760> I'm<00:03:24.760> using<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.420> indoors

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
you hold that on I'm using it indoors

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.539 
you hold that on I'm using it indoors
I'm<00:03:26.140> getting<00:03:26.500> channels<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:26.980> wasn't<00:03:27.310> getting

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
I'm getting channels I wasn't getting

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.909 
I'm getting channels I wasn't getting
before<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:28.530> if<00:03:29.530> it<00:03:29.739> gets<00:03:29.919> stuck<00:03:30.310> in<00:03:30.730> that<00:03:31.299> last

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
before and if it gets stuck in that last

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.289 
before and if it gets stuck in that last
position<00:03:32.919> going<00:03:33.310> around<00:03:33.549> that<00:03:33.669> circle<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:34.269> can

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
position going around that circle I can

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.440 
position going around that circle I can
nudge<00:03:34.840> it<00:03:35.049> indoors<00:03:35.760> okay<00:03:36.760> that's<00:03:37.000> not<00:03:37.180> so

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
nudge it indoors okay that's not so

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.599 
nudge it indoors okay that's not so
that's<00:03:38.380> something<00:03:38.889> that<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.069> had<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.370> consider

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
that's something that I had to consider

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.970 
that's something that I had to consider
that<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.269> fact<00:03:40.569> I'm<00:03:41.079> putting<00:03:41.410> in<00:03:41.560> doors<00:03:41.799> also

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
that the fact I'm putting in doors also

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.610 
that the fact I'm putting in doors also
because<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:43.209> skeletal<00:03:43.900> structure<00:03:44.200> is

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
because the skeletal structure is

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.640 
because the skeletal structure is
plastic<00:03:45.599> okay

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.720 

okay<00:03:50.650> I'm<00:03:50.800> going<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:50.980> show<00:03:51.069> you<00:03:51.220> this<00:03:51.400> rotor

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
okay I'm going to show you this rotor

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.660 
okay I'm going to show you this rotor
here<00:03:52.000> for<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.180> second<00:03:52.599> okay<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.349> I<00:03:53.379> gotta<00:03:53.670> unplug

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
here for a second okay so I gotta unplug

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:02.009 
here for a second okay so I gotta unplug
this<00:03:58.830> here's<00:03:59.830> the<00:03:59.890> road<00:04:00.450> not<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.480> rotor<00:04:01.780> but

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
this here's the road not the rotor but

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.020 
this here's the road not the rotor but
the<00:04:02.760> amplifier<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:05.190> notice<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.489> you<00:04:06.760> can

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
the amplifier and notice that you can

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.809 
the amplifier and notice that you can
you<00:04:07.569> plug<00:04:07.840> this<00:04:08.049> in<00:04:08.319> this<00:04:08.590> is<00:04:08.799> like<00:04:09.190> RCA<00:04:09.700> to

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
we're 60 miles from television some of

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.550 
we're 60 miles from television some of
these<00:04:40.030> tell<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.479> stations<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.260> wanted<00:04:41.500> to

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
these tell the stations that I wanted to

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.100 
these tell the stations that I wanted to
get<00:04:41.800> so<00:04:42.729> I<00:04:42.760> am<00:04:43.150> pretty<00:04:43.419> much<00:04:43.660> happy<00:04:44.139> with<00:04:44.289> this

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
but we had to put this narrow window

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.329 
but we had to put this narrow window
indoors

00:04:50.329 --> 00:04:50.339 
indoors

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:59.210 
indoors
you<00:04:51.339> know<00:04:51.960> but<00:04:52.960> I<00:04:52.990> don't<00:04:53.439> mind<00:04:54.300> because

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.650 

I<00:04:59.280> can<00:05:00.060> see<00:05:00.590> which<00:05:01.590> way<00:05:01.800> it's<00:05:01.980> pointed<00:05:02.520> if<00:05:03.420> it

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
I can see which way it's pointed if it

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.200 
I can see which way it's pointed if it
does<00:05:03.840> get<00:05:04.050> stuck<00:05:04.700> which<00:05:05.700> it<00:05:05.820> doesn't<00:05:06.090> always

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
does get stuck which it doesn't always

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.930 
does get stuck which it doesn't always
get<00:05:06.450> stuck<00:05:06.570> but<00:05:06.900> if<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.110> does<00:05:07.290> get<00:05:07.470> stuck<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:08.040> can

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
get stuck but if it does get stuck I can

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.750 
get stuck but if it does get stuck I can
just<00:05:09.210> give<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:09.870> little<00:05:09.930> nudge<00:05:10.290> and<00:05:10.490> we're<00:05:11.490> fine

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
just give a little nudge and we're fine

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.120 
just give a little nudge and we're fine
I'm<00:05:12.120> happy<00:05:12.450> with<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.930> eBay<00:05:13.290> seller<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.920> gave

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
I'm happy with the eBay seller I gave

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.200 
I'm happy with the eBay seller I gave
them<00:05:14.310> all<00:05:14.580> positive<00:05:15.270> marks<00:05:16.670> there's<00:05:17.670> one<00:05:17.910> cap

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
them all positive marks there's one cap

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.330 
them all positive marks there's one cap
missing<00:05:18.480> one<00:05:18.840> red<00:05:19.050> cap<00:05:19.350> missing<00:05:19.770> from<00:05:19.950> this<00:05:20.130> I

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
missing one red cap missing from this I

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.700 
missing one red cap missing from this I
think<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:20.970> might<00:05:21.240> lost<00:05:21.540> that<00:05:21.750> myself<00:05:21.990> so<00:05:22.590> I'm

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710

still looking for that it's not

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.880 
still looking for that it's not
difficult<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:26.190> assemble<00:05:26.700> you<00:05:27.630> might<00:05:28.500> I'm<00:05:28.770> not

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
difficult to assemble you might I'm not

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.980 
difficult to assemble you might I'm not
saying<00:05:29.100> you<00:05:29.190> can<00:05:29.550> do<00:05:29.790> it<00:05:29.820> most<00:05:30.570> people<00:05:30.930> I<00:05:30.960> think
