00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
maybe it's the maybe they are dads who

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:08.660 
maybe it's the maybe they are dads who
want<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.010> spend<00:00:08.160> more<00:00:08.250> time<00:00:08.309> with<00:00:08.550> their<00:00:08.639> kids

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
maybe it's a mom who doesn't want to

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.839 
maybe it's a mom who doesn't want to
drop<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.349> kids<00:00:10.530> off<00:00:10.650> at<00:00:10.830> daycare<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.670> that's

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
drop the kids off at daycare so that's

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.640 
drop the kids off at daycare so that's
