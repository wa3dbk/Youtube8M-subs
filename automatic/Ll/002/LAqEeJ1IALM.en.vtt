00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.930
 the 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:11.449
 9 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:13.679
 a row 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.679
 but when the wedding 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.329
 the government 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.460
 the employee 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.460
 the only thing i can do 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.610
 on the contrary, elia 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.320
 it is no longer possible in that period last year 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.140
 on January 13 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.470
 the 13 and 15 24 hours 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.770
 that has a reason 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.770
 the accident happened 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.760
 before his departure for space 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.140
 that's stuck 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.680
 in that 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.430
 nico stolwijk 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.430
 for comparison with a year earlier 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.220
 a struggle ungrateful 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.090
 at the second post 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.000
 the subject 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.920
 both cards 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.920
 on the contrary 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.420
 used to be 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.330
 fortuna fade 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.610
 work the week 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.610
 this must be 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.270
 Mrs. Years of Vancouver with third parties 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.610
 the effective approach 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.950
 we were a generation ten years younger than the telegraaf 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.100
 the debate lindy an identical 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.880
 only they become 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.250
 the kids 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.180
 source becoming 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.280
 van gaal 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.710
 I don't care about the family 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.710
 no longer keep up afterwards 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.650
 nothing known 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.390
 I find it shocking 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.280
 the fact that there is an it earlier 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.249
 the 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.089
 the stand anyway 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.609
