this<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.350> one<00:02:17.500> of<00:02:17.590> my<00:02:17.710> favorite<00:02:18.130> changes<00:02:18.520> in

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
this is one of my favorite changes in

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.180 
this is one of my favorite changes in
the<00:02:18.730> patch<00:02:18.880> look<00:02:19.540> at<00:02:19.690> how<00:02:19.870> close<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.560> get<00:02:20.800> with

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
the patch look at how close I get with

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.309 
the patch look at how close I get with
my<00:02:21.220> guys<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.880> they're<00:02:22.090> still<00:02:22.420> not<00:02:22.630> able<00:02:22.930> to

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
my guys and they're still not able to

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.110 
my guys and they're still not able to
catch<00:02:23.709> them<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.459> would<00:02:24.610> probably<00:02:24.640> be<00:02:25.090> a

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
catch them so it would probably be a

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.390 
catch them so it would probably be a
good<00:02:25.330> idea<00:02:25.450> if<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.840> have<00:02:26.050> some<00:02:26.350> some<00:02:26.980> javelins

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
good idea if I have some some javelins

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.900 
good idea if I have some some javelins
left<00:02:27.640> too<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.380> could<00:02:29.620> fire<00:02:29.890> in<00:02:30.190> really

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
left too so that I could fire in really

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.620 
left too so that I could fire in really
close<00:02:31.150> here<00:02:32.160> but<00:02:33.160> I'm<00:02:33.340> also<00:02:33.490> trying<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.940> tire

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630
