00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
the easy part actually which you know

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.070 
the easy part actually which you know
hey<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.900> rest<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.470> pretty<00:02:19.920> easy<00:02:20.250> so

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
hey the rest of it is pretty easy so

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.949 
hey the rest of it is pretty easy so
next<00:02:22.080> thing<00:02:22.260> we<00:02:22.470> need<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.680> do<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.549> image<00:02:24.030> view

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
next thing we need to do the image view

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.890 
next thing we need to do the image view
dot<00:02:25.700> animation<00:02:27.590> there<00:02:28.590> tation<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.780> is

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
dot animation there tation so this is

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.449 
dot animation there tation so this is
just<00:02:30.989> how<00:02:31.200> long<00:02:31.379> do<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.590> want<00:02:31.769> each<00:02:31.980> image<00:02:32.280> to

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
just how long do we want each image to

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.119 
just how long do we want each image to
be<00:02:32.579> up<00:02:32.700> there<00:02:32.849> or<00:02:33.150> do<00:02:33.299> three<00:02:33.720> seconds<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.799> three

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
be up there or do three seconds so three

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.110 
be up there or do three seconds so three
equals<00:02:35.519> three<00:02:35.610> seconds<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.629> then<00:02:37.049> image<00:02:38.120> view

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
equals three seconds and then image view

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.699 
equals three seconds and then image view
dot<00:02:39.829> start<00:02:40.829> animating<00:02:41.989> all<00:02:42.989> right<00:02:43.230> pretty

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
dot start animating all right pretty

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.180 
dot start animating all right pretty
easy<00:02:43.860> straightforward<00:02:44.790> um<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.650> love<00:02:47.069> it

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
easy straightforward um so I love it

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.860 
easy straightforward um so I love it
we're<00:02:48.060> gonna<00:02:48.180> go<00:02:48.329> ahead<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.660> we're<00:02:48.750> just

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
we're gonna go ahead and we're just

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.170 
we're gonna go ahead and we're just
gonna<00:02:49.019> run<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.349> in<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.590> 5s<00:02:50.010> load<00:02:50.879> it<00:02:51.359> and

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
gonna run this in the 5s load it and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.520 
gonna run this in the 5s load it and
okay<00:02:54.180> it's<00:02:54.510> upside-down<00:02:54.780> would<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.349> look<00:02:55.440> at

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
okay it's upside-down would you look at

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.229 
okay it's upside-down would you look at
that<00:02:57.530> yeah<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.829> don't<00:02:59.069> know<00:02:59.250> well<00:02:59.700> it's<00:02:59.970> upside

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
that yeah I don't know well it's upside

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:11.780 
that yeah I don't know well it's upside
down<00:03:08.150> again<00:03:09.150> there<00:03:09.690> we<00:03:09.810> go<00:03:10.280> so<00:03:11.280> wallah<00:03:11.489> its

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
down again there we go so wallah its

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.110 
down again there we go so wallah its
animating<00:03:12.299> a<00:03:12.359> couple<00:03:12.599> of<00:03:12.690> images<00:03:13.700> now<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.730> mean

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
animating a couple of images now I mean

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.879 
animating a couple of images now I mean
these<00:03:15.419> are<00:03:15.660> just<00:03:15.810> random<00:03:15.959> images<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.590> pull<00:03:16.769> off

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
these are just random images I pull off

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.409 
these are just random images I pull off
the<00:03:17.069> internet<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.430> they're<00:03:17.669> scaled<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.389> the

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
the internet so they're scaled to the

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.710 
the internet so they're scaled to the
iPhone<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:20.730> mean<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.150> can<00:03:21.269> do<00:03:21.359> a<00:03:21.389> smaller

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
iPhone so I mean you can do a smaller

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.089 
iPhone so I mean you can do a smaller
image<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:22.109> can<00:03:22.230> do<00:03:22.290> whatever<00:03:22.470> images<00:03:22.980> you

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
image you can do whatever images you

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.759 
image you can do whatever images you
want<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.790> source<00:03:24.000> code<00:03:24.269> for<00:03:24.660> this<00:03:24.840> will<00:03:25.230> be<00:03:25.530> in

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
want the source code for this will be in

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.250 
want the source code for this will be in
the<00:03:26.419> description<00:03:27.419> so<00:03:29.569> yeah<00:03:30.569> it<00:03:30.780> might<00:03:30.930> take<00:03:31.139> me

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
the description so yeah it might take me

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.129 
the description so yeah it might take me
a<00:03:31.290> while<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.530> get<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.829> source<00:03:32.040> code<00:03:32.130> up<00:03:32.459> but

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
a while to get the source code up but

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.020 
a while to get the source code up but
yeah<00:03:34.139> so<00:03:34.590> that's<00:03:34.829> about<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.099> thank<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.790> so
