00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.160
 in the year 2030 we will pass sitting or 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.650
 lying down most of the time 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.110
 according to statistics but the only 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.920
 Real statistics is that one hundred percent 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.000
 of the statistics we make 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.000
 and we are going to change them 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.310
 I do not believe that the team is progressing 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.720
 in a first time where the game has 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.030
 been that will take we can have the ball 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.130
 but in areas where we do not do 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.170
 danger and good the second time I 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.660
 I think the team has been superior to 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.520
 rival we have done things well we have to have 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.160
 the ball in areas of risk we have had 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.780
 Many arrival times and good draw 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.000
 against a result against a team 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.050
 forgiveness of the premier limit the table 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.150
 so well I think the team has 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.650
 more and this is the way the aspect 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.260
 physical also a step forward today is 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.910
 has seen and you take freshness if it is 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.680
 what we are looking for, I think that I especially 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.210
 the attack people the second time or 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.180
 be this with a lot of sparkle 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.860
 verticality and good there has been a lot 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.840
 people that with 90 minutes too and good 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.490
 at the end in that aspect also the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.380
 team to more and that was the idea a 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.149
 little bit and getting used to playing 90 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.740
 minutes what we always say is a 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.220
 friendly but the fact of having tied 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.070
 and not to keep the 10 because it gives 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.080
 another air to the team 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.370
 if we are talking about preseason but 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.470
 well yes it is true that there is 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.850
 start to compete butt and the result 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.070
 although it is not important everything 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.750
 matter the result and especially win 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.880
 and now the feeling the costumes is of 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.070
 that from winning above all at 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.080
 final but good the team I think that 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.790
 has done things well and that is the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.090
 way as I said before then I'll 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.590
 it fit what worries good we have 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.900
 to see the images how it has been 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.280
 little did we know that this team 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.290
 since the game equal is not superior to 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.670
 us but that still dominated the 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.119
 aspects of the direct game of the ball 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.259
 for wii it is a virtue of them and 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.369
 we have to see a little bit of the images 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.649
 how it has been because today in the morning 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.990
 we have also worked and will analyze and 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.420
 we will correct in the last minutes 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.789
 good in the second part we have seen a 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.910
 very good candle I do not know if it's because it was a 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.400
 already intense match and has been released having 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.260
 so to sail is to have a great trick 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.480
 I think that if not for us to play 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.659
 very important and as I have already commented 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.549
 the idea was to come here and put a 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.560
 little bit of the set-up and you've seen 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.110
 that carlos vela has a spark 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.870
 better and if carlos vela is better then 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.450
 the team manages to make other players 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.670
 as markel griezmann and short you can 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.579
 count on them but you hope to be able to 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.159
 count on them and a match already if the 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:43.010
 idea is not to count on everyone already for the 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.900
 Saturday not so much dani estrada as markel 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.150
 like as antoine I think that past 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.099
 they will be also and well then a 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.549
 little if we can count on everything is 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.549
 much better
