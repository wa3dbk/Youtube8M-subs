00:00:00.121 --> 00:00:01.117
 Hello everyone. 

00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:02.133
 My name is Tyler Oakley 

00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.941
 and i'm in london 

00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:05.952
 together with the one and only 

00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:07.943
 I don't know why I'm clapping, Tanya Burr! 

00:00:07.943 --> 00:00:09.122
 - Hi everybody! 

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:10.727
 - And we just hung around a bit. 

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:11.986
 We actually had to film today. 

00:00:11.986 --> 00:00:13.185
 But what have we done? 

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:15.562
 - Tyler has slept all day. 

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:17.269
 - I literally woke up at 4 in the afternoon. 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:19.057
 - I had to go outside, 

00:00:19.057 --> 00:00:20.154
 and I explained yesterday 

00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:21.779
 that I had a 3-hour meeting, 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.836
 and then a sports appointment 

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:24.176
 and I thought: I am leaving at 5 a.m. 

00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:25.822
 I feel so guilty that I leave you alone all day. 

00:00:25.822 --> 00:00:26.818
 Then I came home 

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.910
 and Jim said he was sleeping. 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.698
 - Still snoring, apparently I'm snoring! 

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:31.491
 - Snoring, yes 

00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:33.177
 - Great, I am happy to hear 

00:00:33.177 --> 00:00:35.635
 that I am just a wonderful night person. 

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:36.306
 How do you sleep 

00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:37.586
 I apparently sleep like that 

00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:40.369
 - I sleep with my legs on the side 

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:43.559
 one below and one above the blanket. 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.245
 Okay, I kinda the same 

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:46.119
 - When it is very hot. 

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:47.053
 It is so hot in my room. 

00:00:47.053 --> 00:00:48.557
 - Now we just have it 

00:00:48.557 --> 00:00:49.837
 a small sleep party. 

00:00:49.837 --> 00:00:51.259
 We just got food, 

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:52.255
 and then we came back. 

00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:53.535
 We were watching "Modern Family". 

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:54.611
 - Yes. - And just chilling a little, 

00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:55.749
 Drink red wine. 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:56.867
 We had a little red wine. 

00:00:56.867 --> 00:00:58.228
 I can't believe we're filming this 

00:00:58.228 --> 00:01:01.031
 because I just told Jim that I was going to put Tyler in bed. 

00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:01.682
 That sounds weird - 

00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:03.713
 Well I said so on hold, I have to make a video 

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:04.973
 because Friday is coming 

00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:05.806
 and I thought you know what, 

00:01:05.806 --> 00:01:06.903
 I have to say hello to the people 

00:01:06.903 --> 00:01:07.980
 and see how they are doing 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.134
 So i said i want to talk and say hello, 

00:01:10.134 --> 00:01:11.170
 do you want to come in that video? 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.246
 And Jim, where is Jim? 

00:01:12.246 --> 00:01:13.486
 - (Jim) I'm here. 

00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:14.420
 - Jim is there. 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.578
 - Jim, did you hear that we really do 

00:01:15.578 --> 00:01:16.960
 are filming a video for Tyler's channel now? 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.874
 (Tyler laughs) 

00:01:17.874 --> 00:01:19.114
 - During bedtime. 

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:21.897
 I don't wear makeup and Tyler is weird. 

00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:22.669
 - It does not matter. 

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:24.782
 This is a safe space. 

00:01:24.782 --> 00:01:26.367
 You can come here without makeup. 

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:27.626
 You can come in ... 

00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:28.967
 Jim, come in, Jim. 

00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:29.597
 - You should... 

00:01:29.597 --> 00:01:31.162
 - Okay, so Jim is here. -Hey. 

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:31.670
 - Hey, Jim! 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.295
 - Jim and Tanya let me stay with them. 

00:01:33.295 --> 00:01:35.266
 I'm filming a lot of videos here in London, 

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.054
 and chilling 

00:01:37.054 --> 00:01:38.394
 and travel. 

00:01:38.394 --> 00:01:39.735
 But we are going to have a sleep party 

00:01:39.735 --> 00:01:41.279
 and Tan wanted ... 

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.909
 What is it? 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.047
 Face mask. 

00:01:43.047 --> 00:01:44.164
 I come from behind 

00:01:44.164 --> 00:01:44.937
 I'm going to see you in ... 

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:46.135
 (Tyler laughs) 

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:46.928
 Oh God. 

00:01:46.928 --> 00:01:48.309
 - Oh, it's cold! 

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:49.061
 (Tanya laughs) 

00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:50.178
 Oh my God, 

00:01:50.178 --> 00:01:51.743
 - Do I have to do it to myself? - Yes. 

00:01:51.743 --> 00:01:52.698
 - Don't worry, I want to participate 

00:01:52.698 --> 00:01:53.266
 All right. 

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:54.851
 This is going to be so good for your skin, Tyler. 

00:01:54.851 --> 00:01:56.680
 And I want you to drink more water. 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.310
 I know. 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.565
 She gave me a sermon that I don't drink enough water 

00:01:59.565 --> 00:02:00.967
 - What did I do when you woke up today? 

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:02.348
 - You brought me a glass of water. 

00:02:02.348 --> 00:02:03.831
 - Every morning 

00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:05.254
 Tanya wakes up with a glass of water. 

00:02:05.254 --> 00:02:06.493
 - It's like sleeping with my parents. 

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:09.703
 Um so yes, I am here in London, as I said, 

00:02:09.703 --> 00:02:12.649
 and i'm staying here for a few days, 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:14.416
 and I think I'll go to Brighton for a few days, 

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:18.907
 and just filming, I have a lot of fun things 

00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:19.800
 come your way. 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.198
 And yes, we are going to enjoy our little sleep party. 

00:02:22.198 --> 00:02:25.347
 Tan just made tea for me, that --- it was tasty. 

00:02:25.347 --> 00:02:26.932
 The first time she did it, it wasn't that tasty. 

00:02:26.932 --> 00:02:27.826
 (Jim laughs) 

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:29.045
 - I was so offended 

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:30.955
 - And I had to give her a few tips. 

00:02:30.955 --> 00:02:32.377
 I said, I know better how to be British 

00:02:32.377 --> 00:02:33.961
 than you apparently. 

00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:36.054
 So yes, we are going to drink tea, 

00:02:36.054 --> 00:02:38.411
 maybe look a little more "Modern Family". 

00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:39.996
 And let our faces dry. 

00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:40.950
 Indeed yes. 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.987
 This feels a bit burning. 

00:02:41.987 --> 00:02:42.737
 Is it supposed to burn? 

00:02:42.737 --> 00:02:44.851
 - No, are you okay? 

00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:46.111
 - mine isn't burning. 

00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:47.289
 - Tyler, I would take it off. 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:48.305
 - It's a little hot. - How 

00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:49.443
 Okay, so we have to go 

00:02:49.443 --> 00:02:50.682
 (laughter) 

00:02:50.682 --> 00:02:51.800
 I'll see you later 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.120

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.355

 Yes, bye friends! 

00:03:09.862 --> 00:03:11.426
 - Bye. 

00:03:11.426 --> 00:03:16.297
 (music) 

00:03:23.738 --> 00:03:24.612
 - You look good. 

00:03:24.612 --> 00:03:27.375
 - I have my glasses on 

00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:28.188
 - That's fine. 

00:03:28.188 --> 00:03:29.041
 - You also have your glasses on. 

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:30.483
 - Yes, I also wear glasses. 

00:03:30.483 --> 00:03:32.917
 and people accept me for who I am. 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.411
 I'm just going to talk. - All right. 

00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:38.565
 OK, ready? - Yes
