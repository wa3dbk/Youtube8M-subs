00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
middle to make our PD chest part and
then<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.530> need<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> iron<00:01:35.130> ingot<00:01:35.400> across<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
iron to make the pants then you need to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
iron to make the pants then you need to
lever<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.259> iron<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.979> boots<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.400> then

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
lever and to iron for the boots and then

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.039 
lever and to iron for the boots and then
what<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.759> need<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.970> do<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.270> pop<00:01:42.509> these<00:01:42.689> parts

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
what you need to do is pop these parts

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.780 
what you need to do is pop these parts
into<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.290> crafting<00:01:43.680> table<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.130> by<00:01:44.280> themselves

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
into a crafting table just by themselves

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.039 
into a crafting table just by themselves
and<00:01:44.850> they<00:01:44.939> will<00:01:45.060> create<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.479> normal<00:01:45.810> arms

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and they will create the normal arms

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
and they will create the normal arms
let's<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.619> actually<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.820> can

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
let's do that actually just so I can

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.780 
let's do that actually just so I can
show<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> armor<00:01:49.220> so<00:01:50.220> we'll<00:01:50.399> pop<00:01:50.729> a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
show you the armor so we'll pop a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.539 
show you the armor so we'll pop a
crafting<00:01:51.180> table<00:01:51.360> down<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.170> then<00:01:52.860> grab

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
crafting table down here and then grab

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.490 
crafting table down here and then grab
these<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.119> then<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.869> pop<00:01:55.049> them<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
these and then you pop them in the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.319 
these and then you pop them in the
crafting<00:01:55.950> table<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.310> normal<00:01:56.729> animal<00:01:57.000> creates

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
crafting table as normal animal creates

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.810 
crafting table as normal animal creates
the<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.500> would<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.979> exactly<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.399> same<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.759> I'm

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
the it would be exactly the same so I'm

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.859 
the it would be exactly the same so I'm
not<00:01:59.909> sure<00:01:59.969> why<00:02:00.270> he<00:02:00.509> does<00:02:00.689> it

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
not sure why he does it

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.569 
not sure why he does it
maybe<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.710> do<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:01.860> resident<00:02:02.280> evil

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
maybe it's to do with resident evil

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.950 
maybe it's to do with resident evil
apparently<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.329> boots<00:02:03.479> don't<00:02:03.600> want<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> work

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
apparently the boots don't want to work

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.539 
apparently the boots don't want to work
but<00:02:04.409> if<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.590> put<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.369> doesn't

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
but if you put this in and that doesn't

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.709 
but if you put this in and that doesn't
want<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> work<00:02:05.850> either<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.390> that's<00:02:06.509> awesome

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
want to work either so that's awesome

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.670 
want to work either so that's awesome
but<00:02:07.469> let's<00:02:08.039> see<00:02:08.160> how<00:02:08.280> much<00:02:08.989> armor<00:02:09.989> they<00:02:10.110> give

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
but let's see how much armor they give

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.110 
but let's see how much armor they give
if<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.189> can<00:02:12.370> type<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:15.340> they<00:02:15.430> give<00:02:15.610> decent<00:02:15.939> armor

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
if I can type so they give decent armor

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.330 
if I can type so they give decent armor
I<00:02:16.150> think<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.659> would<00:02:16.930> possibly<00:02:17.530> be<00:02:17.620> iron<00:02:18.099> or

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
I think it would possibly be iron or

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.280 
I think it would possibly be iron or
maybe<00:02:18.640> even<00:02:18.790> diamond<00:02:19.599> I'm<00:02:19.780> not<00:02:20.019> sure<00:02:20.200> because

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
maybe even diamond I'm not sure because

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.770 
maybe even diamond I'm not sure because
that<00:02:20.470> is<00:02:20.650> just<00:02:20.829> with<00:02:21.010> pants<00:02:21.280> on<00:02:21.489> so<00:02:21.819> yeah

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
that is just with pants on so yeah

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.300 
that is just with pants on so yeah
really<00:02:23.140> cool<00:02:23.379> armor<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.950> it's<00:02:24.069> really

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
really cool armor and it's really

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.710 
really cool armor and it's really
cool-looking<00:02:24.579> actually<00:02:25.120> as<00:02:25.239> well<00:02:25.390> let's<00:02:25.569> just

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
cool-looking actually as well let's just

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.300 
cool-looking actually as well let's just
take<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.900> look<00:02:26.049> at<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.290> yeah<00:02:26.650> yeah<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.159> it's

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
take a look at it yeah yeah that it's

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.929 
take a look at it yeah yeah that it's
cool<00:02:27.519> so<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.019> how<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.170> works<00:02:29.519> yeah<00:02:30.549> onto

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
cool so that is how that works yeah onto

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.729 
cool so that is how that works yeah onto
some<00:02:31.120> weapons<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:32.200> before<00:02:32.439> I<00:02:32.470> get<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.650> the

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
some weapons so before I get to the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.580 
weapons I need to show you two more ores
I've<00:02:34.450> been<00:02:34.599> added<00:02:34.840> into<00:02:35.049> this<00:02:35.140> mod<00:02:35.349> and<00:02:35.530> the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
I've been added into this mod and the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.410 
I've been added into this mod and the
first<00:02:35.769> one<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.159> Ruby<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.849> next<00:02:37.060> one<00:02:37.209> is

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
first one is Ruby and the next one is

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.300 
first one is Ruby and the next one is
steel<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.230> steel<00:02:38.439> kind<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.739> looks<00:02:38.859> like<00:02:38.920> iron

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
steel so steel kind of looks like iron

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.190 
steel so steel kind of looks like iron
but<00:02:39.519> a<00:02:39.549> little<00:02:39.790> bit<00:02:39.939> what<00:02:40.209> kind<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.510> white<00:02:40.750> yeah

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
but a little bit what kind of white yeah

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.809 
but a little bit what kind of white yeah
pretty<00:02:41.439> much<00:02:41.560> white<00:02:41.859> and<00:02:42.129> then<00:02:42.340> Ruby<00:02:42.640> just

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
pretty much white and then Ruby just

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.430 
pretty much white and then Ruby just
looks<00:02:43.030> like<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.239> Chaos<00:02:43.540> Emerald<00:02:43.930> film<00:02:44.109> Sonic

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
looks like the Chaos Emerald film Sonic

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.869 
looks like the Chaos Emerald film Sonic
and<00:02:44.739> these<00:02:44.950> are<00:02:45.129> the<00:02:45.250> tools<00:02:45.579> that<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:45.849> need

and you mind them and you simply get

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.960 
and you mind them and you simply get
these<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:47.799> need<00:02:47.980> them<00:02:48.159> to<00:02:48.579> create<00:02:48.849> the
