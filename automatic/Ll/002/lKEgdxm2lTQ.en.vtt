enough<00:02:40.020> for<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.740> system<00:02:41.640> then<00:02:41.850> pick<00:02:42.209> out<00:02:42.330> the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
enough for the system then pick out the

still then the targeting computer is

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.680 
still then the targeting computer is
pretty<00:02:46.950> good<00:02:47.130> about<00:02:47.340> distinguishing<00:02:48.090> those

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
pretty good about distinguishing those

precisely sure how that works on the

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.080 
and acquire target is done so by the gut
by<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.200> gunner<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.709> that<00:03:59.220> would<00:03:59.340> be<00:03:59.370> Hellfire

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
by the gunner and that would be Hellfire

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.960 
by the gunner and that would be Hellfire

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
missiles or the chain gun that's all

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.000 
missiles or the chain gun that's all
under<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.510> purview<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.110> gunner<00:04:04.500> now

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
under the purview of the gunner now

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.380 
under the purview of the gunner now
that's<00:04:05.220> not<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.519> say<00:04:05.670> that<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.910> pilot<00:04:06.239> doesn't

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
that's not to say that the pilot doesn't

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.910 
that's not to say that the pilot doesn't
have<00:04:06.600> an<00:04:06.690> override<00:04:07.170> mode<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:07.650> should

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
have an override mode and should

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.080 
have an override mode and should
something<00:04:08.130> happen<00:04:08.280> in<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.670> gunner<00:04:08.910> be

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
something happen in the gunner be

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.870 
something happen in the gunner be
incapacitated<00:04:09.450> or<00:04:10.170> otherwise<00:04:10.920> killed<00:04:11.370> during

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
incapacitated or otherwise killed during

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.580 
incapacitated or otherwise killed during
action<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.540> believe<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.049> gunner<00:04:13.290> are<00:04:13.470> the

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
action I believe that the gunner are the

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.770 
action I believe that the gunner are the
pilot<00:04:13.950> can<00:04:14.549> take<00:04:14.760> over<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.090> Gunners<00:04:15.359> duties

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
pilot can take over the Gunners duties

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.759 
pilot can take over the Gunners duties
and<00:04:16.310> basically<00:04:17.310> slave<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:18.180> gun<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.900> his

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
and basically slave the gun to his

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.229 
and basically slave the gun to his
helmet<00:04:20.160> mounted<00:04:20.459> display<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:20.970> things<00:04:21.120> like

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
helmet mounted display and things like

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.090 
helmet mounted display and things like
that<00:04:21.299> so<00:04:21.630> in<00:04:21.720> an<00:04:21.810> emergency<00:04:22.049> type<00:04:22.440> situation

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
that so in an emergency type situation

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.460 
that so in an emergency type situation
yes<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:24.090> pilot<00:04:24.419> can<00:04:24.539> be<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.720> one<00:04:24.900> aiming<00:04:25.380> the

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
yes the pilot can be the one aiming the

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.770 
yes the pilot can be the one aiming the
gun<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.830> stuff<00:04:26.010> like<00:04:26.099> that<00:04:26.160> but<00:04:26.970> that's<00:04:27.539> not

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
gun and stuff like that but that's not

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.570 
gun and stuff like that but that's not
kind<00:04:28.260> of<00:04:28.380> par<00:04:28.650> for<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.890> course<00:04:28.950> as<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:29.430> comes

kind of par for the course as it comes

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.800

systems<00:04:34.139> go<00:04:34.760> now<00:04:35.760> another<00:04:36.240> interesting<00:04:36.450> fact

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
systems go now another interesting fact

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.520 
systems go now another interesting fact
is<00:04:37.230> why<00:04:38.330> these<00:04:39.330> duties<00:04:39.630> are<00:04:39.900> separated<00:04:40.350> into

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
is why these duties are separated into

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.620 
is why these duties are separated into
two<00:04:40.680> separate<00:04:41.070> individuals<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.880> this<00:04:42.510> gets

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
two separate individuals and this gets

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.960 
two separate individuals and this gets
to<00:04:42.840> be<00:04:43.050> known<00:04:43.710> as<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:44.010> phenomenon<00:04:44.639> or<00:04:44.940> a

it's<00:04:49.440> literally<00:04:49.830> gotten<00:04:50.130> to<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.430> point<00:04:50.639> where

it's literally gotten to the point where

it's literally gotten to the point where

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
in a lot of cases there's too much

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.700 
in a lot of cases there's too much
information<00:04:54.330> there<00:04:54.450> for<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:54.750> pilot<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.200> focus

in<00:04:55.830> on<00:04:55.950> that's<00:04:56.820> a<00:04:56.970> lot<00:04:57.180> of<00:04:57.210> reasons<00:04:57.690> why

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
in on that's a lot of reasons why

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.800 
in on that's a lot of reasons why

responsible of the rear cedar again I

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.150 
responsible of the rear cedar again I
think<00:05:18.600> they're<00:05:18.870> still<00:05:19.020> called<00:05:19.260> Rios<00:05:19.590> radar

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
think they're still called Rios radar

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.530 
think they're still called Rios radar
intercept<00:05:20.550> officers<00:05:20.970> but<00:05:21.210> they're<00:05:21.389> also

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
intercept officers but they're also

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.540 
intercept officers but they're also
responsible<00:05:21.780> for<00:05:22.229> making<00:05:22.590> sure<00:05:22.740> Jaden's<00:05:23.430> are

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
responsible for making sure Jaden's are

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.400 
responsible for making sure Jaden's are
programmed<00:05:23.940> essentially<00:05:24.900> correct<00:05:25.050> and

programmed essentially correct and

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.560 
programmed essentially correct and
that's<00:05:25.889> because<00:05:26.040> you<00:05:26.310> start<00:05:26.580> getting<00:05:26.669> a<00:05:26.880> pilot

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
that's because you start getting a pilot

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.540 
that's because you start getting a pilot
doing<00:05:27.870> an<00:05:28.020> individual<00:05:28.740> pilot<00:05:29.040> doing<00:05:29.160> too<00:05:29.430> many

doing an individual pilot doing too many

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.760 
doing an individual pilot doing too many
things<00:05:29.669> at<00:05:30.060> one<00:05:30.270> time<00:05:30.300> and<00:05:30.990> it<00:05:31.410> becomes

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
things at one time and it becomes

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.190 
things at one time and it becomes
sensory<00:05:32.220> overload<00:05:32.729> and<00:05:32.970> actually<00:05:33.870> parts<00:05:34.110> of

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
sensory overload and actually parts of

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.960 
sensory overload and actually parts of
the<00:05:34.260> brain<00:05:34.350> just<00:05:34.650> start<00:05:34.979> shutting<00:05:35.370> down<00:05:35.640> and

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
the brain just start shutting down and

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.420 
the brain just start shutting down and
that<00:05:36.450> can<00:05:36.660> have<00:05:36.930> very<00:05:37.590> deadly<00:05:38.070> consequences

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
that can have very deadly consequences

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.090 
that can have very deadly consequences
to<00:05:39.000> a<00:05:39.030> pilot<00:05:39.479> let's<00:05:40.200> take<00:05:40.350> the<00:05:40.590> ah-64

awareness what's going to happen is when

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.510 
awareness what's going to happen is when
you're<00:06:00.810> focused<00:06:01.590> on<00:06:01.680> shooting<00:06:02.100> a<00:06:02.190> target

especially precise aiming at a target a

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.100 
especially precise aiming at a target a
lot<00:06:05.669> of<00:06:05.760> your<00:06:05.880> mental<00:06:06.030> energy<00:06:06.300> is<00:06:06.570> going<00:06:06.720> to<00:06:06.990> go

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
lot of your mental energy is going to go

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.920 
lot of your mental energy is going to go
into<00:06:07.289> that<00:06:07.470> and<00:06:07.770> as<00:06:07.950> a<00:06:07.979> result<00:06:08.280> it<00:06:09.090> creates<00:06:09.810> I

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
into that and as a result it creates I

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.210 
into that and as a result it creates I
forget<00:06:10.169> the<00:06:10.260> name<00:06:10.350> of<00:06:10.530> this<00:06:10.590> effect<00:06:11.039> but

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
forget the name of this effect but

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.610 
forget the name of this effect but
essentially<00:06:11.729> you<00:06:12.389> get<00:06:12.600> tunnel<00:06:12.960> vision<00:06:13.080> where

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
essentially you get tunnel vision where

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.670 
essentially you get tunnel vision where
it's<00:06:13.889> like<00:06:14.039> looking<00:06:14.370> through<00:06:14.430> a<00:06:14.610> paper<00:06:15.000> tube

it's like looking through a paper tube
this<00:06:16.680> phenomenon<00:06:16.830> happens<00:06:17.700> in<00:06:17.910> just<00:06:18.150> about

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
you're a pilot and focus got that tunnel

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.970 
you're a pilot and focus got that tunnel
vision<00:07:02.100> by<00:07:02.610> the<00:07:02.670> time<00:07:03.000> you're<00:07:03.410> basically<00:07:04.410> come

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
vision by the time you're basically come

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.560 
vision by the time you're basically come
out<00:07:05.190> of<00:07:05.370> it<00:07:05.490> and<00:07:05.640> your<00:07:06.060> peripheral<00:07:06.420> vision

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
out of it and your peripheral vision

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.970 
out of it and your peripheral vision
picks<00:07:06.870> up<00:07:07.200> that<00:07:07.320> there's<00:07:07.530> a<00:07:07.650> threat<00:07:07.950> that

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:07.980 
picks up that there's a threat that

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.040 
picks up that there's a threat that
you're<00:07:08.280> about<00:07:08.430> to<00:07:08.580> fly<00:07:08.760> into<00:07:09.000> a<00:07:09.030> building<00:07:09.090> it

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
you're about to fly into a building it

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.770 
you're about to fly into a building it
could<00:07:10.350> very<00:07:10.620> well<00:07:10.710> be<00:07:11.010> too<00:07:11.280> late<00:07:11.580> so<00:07:12.480> that's

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 
could very well be too late so that's

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.480 
could very well be too late so that's
another<00:07:13.020> reason<00:07:13.290> why<00:07:13.620> they<00:07:13.920> separate<00:07:14.370> the

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
another reason why they separate the

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.880 
another reason why they separate the
