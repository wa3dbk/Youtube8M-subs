00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:04.100 

at<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.270> beginning<00:00:03.629> I<00:00:03.689> just<00:00:03.899> knew<00:00:03.990> the

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
at the beginning I just knew the

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.269 
at the beginning I just knew the
pictures<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.620> didn't<00:00:04.830> really<00:00:04.980> know<00:00:05.100> much<00:00:05.130> about

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
pictures I didn't really know much about

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.550 
pictures I didn't really know much about
her<00:00:05.700> so<00:00:05.879> those<00:00:06.029> kind<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.330> iconic<00:00:06.870> images<00:00:07.259> and

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
her so those kind of iconic images and

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.530 
her so those kind of iconic images and
that<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:08.040> amazing<00:00:08.400> face<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.030> nose<00:00:09.240> that

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
that the amazing face and the nose that

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.089 
that the amazing face and the nose that
kind<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.840> strength<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.679> get<00:00:10.830> from<00:00:11.010> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
kind of strength that you get from the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.589 
kind of strength that you get from the
images<00:00:11.429> but<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.670> think<00:00:11.910> because<00:00:12.090> I've<00:00:12.240> sort<00:00:12.509> of

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
images but I think because I've sort of

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.140 
images but I think because I've sort of
learned<00:00:12.870> more<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:14.070> suppose<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.670> she's<00:00:15.120> the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
learned more I suppose it she's the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.120 
learned more I suppose it she's the
ultimate<00:00:15.360> survivor<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.830> think<00:00:17.010> that's

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
ultimate survivor and I think that's

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.029 
ultimate survivor and I think that's
really<00:00:17.550> interesting<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:18.380> find<00:00:19.380> her<00:00:19.619> completely

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
really interesting I find her completely

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.250 
really interesting I find her completely
fascinating<00:00:20.730> find<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.390> clothes<00:00:21.630> fascinating

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
fascinating find the clothes fascinating

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.050 
fascinating find the clothes fascinating
but<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.410> find<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.710> history<00:00:23.100> fascinating<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.880> I

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
but I find the history fascinating and I

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.450

woman<00:01:00.700> I<00:01:00.820> think<00:01:03.300> I've<00:01:04.300> worked<00:01:04.540> with<00:01:04.660> quite<00:01:04.809> a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
woman I think I've worked with quite a

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.480 
woman I think I've worked with quite a
few<00:01:04.990> people<00:01:05.290> who<00:01:05.500> say<00:01:05.680> oh<00:01:05.710> they<00:01:05.920> can<00:01:06.100> only<00:01:06.220> work

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
few people who say oh they can only work

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.219 
few people who say oh they can only work
from<00:01:06.640> conflict<00:01:07.150> and<00:01:07.240> I'm<00:01:07.390> absolutely<00:01:07.660> the

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
from conflict and I'm absolutely the

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.620 
from conflict and I'm absolutely the
opposite<00:01:08.560> I<00:01:08.800> find<00:01:09.520> that<00:01:09.759> very<00:01:09.820> jarring<00:01:10.360> I

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
opposite I find that very jarring I

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.210 
opposite I find that very jarring I
think<00:01:11.170> that's<00:01:11.320> probably<00:01:11.500> why<00:01:11.800> you<00:01:11.860> know<00:01:12.100> I've

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
think that's probably why you know I've

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.710 
think that's probably why you know I've
worked<00:01:12.400> with<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.670> same<00:01:12.850> people<00:01:13.240> quite<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.479> few

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
worked with the same people quite a few

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.930 
worked with the same people quite a few
times<00:01:13.930> particularly<00:01:14.410> Joe<00:01:14.770> is<00:01:14.979> because<00:01:15.910> I

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
times particularly Joe is because I

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.570 
times particularly Joe is because I
don't<00:01:16.330> perform<00:01:16.630> well<00:01:17.350> if<00:01:17.680> it's<00:01:17.950> in<00:01:18.070> that<00:01:18.280> kind

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
don't perform well if it's in that kind

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.810 
don't perform well if it's in that kind
of<00:01:18.729> tense<00:01:19.119> atmosphere<00:01:20.080> I<00:01:20.290> find<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.400> I<00:01:21.460> tense

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
of tense atmosphere I find that I tense

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.850 
of tense atmosphere I find that I tense
up<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.270> I<00:01:22.360> think<00:01:22.570> if<00:01:22.690> you're<00:01:22.810> acting<00:01:23.200> from<00:01:23.770> a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
up and I think if you're acting from a

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.639 
up and I think if you're acting from a
place<00:01:24.070> of<00:01:24.100> tension<00:01:24.700> then<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:26.020> can<00:01:26.259> only<00:01:26.410> add

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
place of tension then you can only add

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.620 
place of tension then you can only add
tension<00:01:27.190> or<00:01:27.340> you<00:01:27.460> can<00:01:27.640> only<00:01:27.790> act<00:01:28.030> rage<00:01:28.330> it's

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
tension or you can only act rage it's

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.900 
tension or you can only act rage it's
very<00:01:28.840> difficult<00:01:29.259> to<00:01:29.440> act<00:01:29.680> relaxation<00:01:30.520> or

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
very difficult to act relaxation or

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.120 
very difficult to act relaxation or
happiness<00:01:31.600> or<00:01:31.960> anything<00:01:32.290> like<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:32.590> unless

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
happiness or anything like that unless

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.380 
happiness or anything like that unless
you're<00:01:33.310> actually<00:01:33.460> coming<00:01:33.970> from<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.180> place<00:01:34.300> of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
you're actually coming from a place of

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.969 
you're actually coming from a place of
calm<00:01:34.750> I<00:01:35.020> think<00:01:35.410> if<00:01:35.500> you're<00:01:35.590> coming<00:01:35.740> from<00:01:35.890> a

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
calm I think if you're coming from a

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.380 
calm I think if you're coming from a
place<00:01:36.040> of<00:01:36.160> calm<00:01:36.399> you<00:01:36.550> can<00:01:36.580> go<00:01:36.850> anywhere<00:01:37.210> it

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
place of calm you can go anywhere it

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.890 
place of calm you can go anywhere it
doesn't<00:01:37.539> matter<00:01:37.750> for<00:01:38.619> me

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.320 

it's<00:01:43.560> very<00:01:43.800> difficult<00:01:44.190> when<00:01:44.370> it<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.610> me

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
it's very difficult when it is me

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.440 
it's very difficult when it is me
looking<00:01:46.140> back<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.530> me<00:01:46.740> I'm<00:01:47.730> very<00:01:48.210> bad<00:01:48.390> at

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
looking back at me I'm very bad at

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.140 
looking back at me I'm very bad at
watching<00:01:48.900> myself<00:01:49.050> on<00:01:49.410> screen<00:01:49.910> I'm<00:01:50.910> my

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
watching myself on screen I'm my

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.030 
watching myself on screen I'm my
harshest<00:01:51.660> critic<00:01:52.050> so<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.710> never<00:01:52.950> a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
harshest critic so it's never a

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.640 
harshest critic so it's never a
particularly<00:01:53.490> pleasant<00:01:53.790> experience

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.650 

Mario<00:01:58.650> Testino<00:01:58.860> shot<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.210> photographs

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
Mario Testino shot the the photographs

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.510 
Mario Testino shot the the photographs
for<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.470> I've<00:02:01.950> worked<00:02:02.130> with<00:02:02.220> Mario

quite a lot and that was lovely again I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.440 
quite a lot and that was lovely again I
think<00:02:04.830> it's<00:02:05.100> about<00:02:05.280> worlds<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.060> creating

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
think it's about worlds and creating

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.320 
think it's about worlds and creating
fantasies<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.950> see<00:02:08.280> his<00:02:08.640> fantasy<00:02:09.179> world

fantasies and you see his fantasy world
it's<00:02:09.570> a<00:02:09.690> specific<00:02:10.290> one<00:02:10.500> but<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:10.979> one<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.340> I

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
it's a specific one but it's one that I

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.100 
it's a specific one but it's one that I
always<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:12.210> always<00:02:12.600> kind<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.870> want<00:02:13.020> to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
always I always kind of want to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.900 
always I always kind of want to
disappear<00:02:13.500> into<00:02:13.710> for<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.070> moment<00:02:14.340> or<00:02:14.430> two<00:02:14.460> but

disappear into for a moment or two but

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.520 
disappear into for a moment or two but
what<00:02:15.030> was<00:02:15.150> quite<00:02:15.270> interesting<00:02:15.870> was<00:02:15.990> he'd

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
what was quite interesting was he'd

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.870 
what was quite interesting was he'd
created<00:02:16.920> because<00:02:17.220> they<00:02:17.340> were<00:02:17.430> sort<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.700> going

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
created because they were sort of going

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.670 
created because they were sort of going

lighting<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:21.090> was<00:02:21.209> very<00:02:21.420> bright<00:02:21.720> around<00:02:22.260> me<00:02:22.320> so

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
lighting it was very bright around me so

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.250 
lighting it was very bright around me so
I<00:02:22.470> couldn't<00:02:22.680> actually<00:02:22.920> see<00:02:23.520> anybody<00:02:24.390> around

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
I couldn't actually see anybody around

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.860 
I couldn't actually see anybody around
me<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.620> couldn't<00:02:25.860> really<00:02:26.160> see<00:02:26.520> him<00:02:26.820> so<00:02:27.570> it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
me and I couldn't really see him so it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.380 
me and I couldn't really see him so it
was<00:02:28.110> very<00:02:28.440> much<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:29.160> was<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:29.580> my<00:02:29.790> own<00:02:29.940> world<00:02:30.030> I

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
was very much I was in my own world I

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.630

character in my head nobody else knows

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.690 
character in my head nobody else knows

kind of just go away in my own sort of

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:48.600 
kind of just go away in my own sort of
fantasy<00:02:40.380> world

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.580

can I can do that and I've worn it ever

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.820 
can I can do that and I've worn it ever
since<00:03:17.370> it's<00:03:18.370> not<00:03:18.610> overpowering<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.630> it's<00:03:20.620> not

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
since it's not overpowering and it's not

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.660 
since it's not overpowering and it's not
sweet<00:03:21.390> it's<00:03:22.390> just<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:23.500> right<00:03:23.710> mixture<00:03:24.310> of

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
sweet it's just the right mixture of

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.699 
sweet it's just the right mixture of
strength<00:03:25.210> but<00:03:26.140> also<00:03:26.970> hmm<00:03:28.060> but<00:03:28.530> strength<00:03:29.530> and

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
strength but also hmm but strength and

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.890 
strength but also hmm but strength and
subtlety<00:03:30.190> at<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.430> same<00:03:30.610> time<00:03:30.910> possibly

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
subtlety at the same time possibly

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.570 
subtlety at the same time possibly
doesn't<00:03:32.230> make<00:03:32.350> sense<00:03:32.650> but<00:03:33.010> for<00:03:33.250> me<00:03:33.370> that's

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
doesn't make sense but for me that's

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.540 
doesn't make sense but for me that's
that's<00:03:33.910> what<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.209> is<00:03:34.240> it<00:03:34.600> doesn't<00:03:35.200> overpower

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
that's what it is it doesn't overpower

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.830 
that's what it is it doesn't overpower
but<00:03:36.550> it<00:03:36.700> just<00:03:36.880> makes<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.240> feel<00:03:37.270> that<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:37.660> can

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
but it just makes you feel that you can

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.630 
but it just makes you feel that you can
stand<00:03:38.110> up<00:03:38.260> straight<00:03:38.590> have<00:03:39.250> anything<00:03:39.459> that's

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
stand up straight have anything that's

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.900 
stand up straight have anything that's
important<00:03:40.150> for<00:03:40.990> me
