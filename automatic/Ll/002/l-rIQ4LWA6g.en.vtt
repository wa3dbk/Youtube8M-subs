00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.980

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.530
 bags in such a flash for five euros 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.900
 50 and then there is a special 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.260
 sticker so to speak with buy and that me 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.070

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.520

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.579

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.750
 I'm curious I can definitely 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.850
 the names are not so good yet me 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.740
 do not think even better than that of the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.380
 Please he was not so men 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.270
 too tragically so theresa just yes 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:41.600
 I do not know any idea 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:44.360

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.700
 stadium exactly stadium sticker so to speak 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.450
 the number 10 very nice I have to 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.460
 somehow the saudis ticker album 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.659
 because that's not the way it is here now 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.390
 just so humming mattress so I 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.100
 also from a german monica 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.700
 ocampo 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.229
 then I have her simone laudehr me 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.390
 I have a bet that I completed 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.670
 they pull very nicely i find them 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.280
 in the wm so far actually so to speak 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.360
 my dear 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:22.600
 player except of course the really 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.319
 others so nico fabian alana kelly me 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.819
 I probably have one more 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.640
 a little tired but yesterday I still have 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.940
 the women looked wm Germany against 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.940
 Sweden 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.670
 then have the team of 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.190
 Canada is a bit different this time 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.050
 It is not always built like that 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.120
 Team photos are just like that 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.800
 in the middle 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.110
 usually you know that differently 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.940
 then we have here 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.500
 saskia bartusiak i think that still has 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.720
 at least I did not play at all 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.790
 I have not heard of it yet 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.900
 just gabriel 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.790
 then we have another player out 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.870
 australia exactly my mother gartner 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.060
 meanwhile called 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.480
 as it looked to be another way, it is 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.030
 somehow always very short little cape 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.050
 set so then we continue 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.540
 here we have a woe where I have 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:24.120
 the gallardo know the players correctly 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.120
 summer and tie maria or so egmont 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.180
 we exaggerate the names everyone can 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.930
 but I really only watch the 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:36.010
 German games do not play the other animals 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.160
 alexandra popp very nice 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:47.079
 then we have here in the media 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:49.540
 or sarah christin granados stokes then 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:54.970
 we still have five stickies that we have 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.890
 Do not open linzer piece of gear in one 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.829
 stickers i think so or so 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:08.230
 at the latest the logos espinosa elodie 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.700
 thomis guru probably does not advise 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.130
 idea 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.130
 isabella stefanie and that's it 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.000
 this my name is not mine 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.010
 case 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.940
 to be honest and so valeria 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.320
 Miranda does not know anything about the 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:37.460
 I can do that at all 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:50.510
 not garcia carolina probably 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:53.350
 or so we have stephanie mayor s 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:05:02.020
 elias very nice 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:04.970
 martha corridor angela triana bay 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.570
 so injured captain and then we 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.400
 even by still it is still 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:17.620
 I'm not really a critic 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:28.900
 well over no fun as niculescu clear 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:28.900
 Anthony Clark took over business for Sabine 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:38.720
 theresa polyas and the last sticker 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:41.450
 sachets just as little as klop photos 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.979
 also used and the team photos yes 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.950
 from the netherlands 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.440
 then we have pauline drama here 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:53.080
 Germany very nice 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:58.400
 melissa tancredi kathrin or katherine 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.650
 alvarado clock and that was it then 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.870
 also seem to divorce well 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.460
 Diagnostics be very valuable or very 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.620
 rarely or just lucky 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.120
 but many would have been 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.039
 German pulled that starts a lot of fall 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.599
 cool and if you still have more 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.680
 want to see openings of the sticker 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.539
 then just let me do a thumb 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.570
 above there and then I will still the 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.860
 sticker this the thick shopped and 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.110
 maybe a few more booster 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.909
 and then they stick, so to speak 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.689

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:27.080
