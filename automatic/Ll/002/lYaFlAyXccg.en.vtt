time it floods and it does a pretty good
job<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:51.059> reshaping<00:00:51.600> itself

almost<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> headwaters<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.650> then<00:01:07.650> in

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
almost to the headwaters and then in

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.940 
almost to the headwaters and then in
those<00:01:08.100> years<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.000> fishing<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.420> very<00:01:09.450> good<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
those years the fishing is very good the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.550 
those years the fishing is very good the
fish<00:01:11.159> will<00:01:11.310> come<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.610> into<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> creek<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
fish will come up into the creek and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.780 
fish will come up into the creek and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
unique geological feature at the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.830 
unique geological feature at the
headwaters<00:01:29.460> where<00:01:30.060> two<00:01:30.270> creeks<00:01:30.600> come

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
headwaters where two creeks come

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.590 
headwaters where two creeks come
together<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.470> form<00:01:31.710> Jardel<00:01:32.310> there's<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.210> big

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
together to form Jardel there's a big

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.410 
together to form Jardel there's a big
sandstone<00:01:34.409> ridge<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.220> Ridge<00:01:35.670> runs<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
sandstone ridge that Ridge runs all the

sandstone ridge that Ridge runs all the
way<00:01:36.630> down<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.110> south<00:01:37.350> side<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> lake<00:01:37.950> you

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
way down the south side of the lake you

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.510 
way down the south side of the lake you
can<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.210> at<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.390> dam<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:40.020> Ridge<00:01:40.829> forms<00:01:41.400> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
can see it at the dam that Ridge forms a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.999 
can see it at the dam that Ridge forms a
barrier<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.810> far<00:01:43.049> as<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.350> fish<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.829> go

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
barrier that's as far as the fish can go

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.520 
barrier that's as far as the fish can go
up<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.520> Creek<00:01:45.020> there's<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.079> big<00:01:46.290> pool

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
up in that Creek there's a big pool

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.380 
up in that Creek there's a big pool
above<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.159> then<00:01:47.340> there's<00:01:47.520> some<00:01:47.670> fishing<00:01:48.090> net

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
above it then there's some fishing net

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.100 
above it then there's some fishing net
but<00:01:48.920> from<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.100> point<00:01:50.430> down<00:01:50.729> stream<00:01:51.540> all<00:01:51.840> the

but from that point down stream all the
way<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.710> lake<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.130> only<00:01:53.310> about<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.700> mile<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
way to the lake it's only about a mile I

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.109 
way to the lake it's only about a mile I
can't<00:01:55.740> tell<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.040> how<00:01:56.189> many<00:01:56.250> times<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.820> fished

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
can't tell you how many times I fished

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.870 
can't tell you how many times I fished
this<00:01:57.299> Creek<00:01:58.159> especially<00:01:59.159> when<00:01:59.430> everybody

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
this Creek especially when everybody
