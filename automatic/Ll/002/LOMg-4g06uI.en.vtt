control<00:00:44.760> yeah<00:00:45.530> clean<00:00:46.530> batteries<00:00:46.890> and

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
control yeah clean batteries and

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.620 
control yeah clean batteries and
toolbars<00:00:47.490> but<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.820> always<00:00:47.940> says<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.240> some

toolbars but it always says that some
reason<00:00:49.700> gotta<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:51.300> Valletta<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.900> is<00:00:52.050> me

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
reason gotta in Valletta this is me

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.730 
reason gotta in Valletta this is me
holding<00:00:52.470> that<00:00:52.830> it's<00:00:53.070> my<00:00:53.220> 300<00:00:53.670> 300<00:00:54.329> watts<00:00:54.740> so

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
holding that it's my 300 300 watts so

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.200 
holding that it's my 300 300 watts so
it's<00:00:56.010> not<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.160> good<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.700> wanted<00:00:57.120> it

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
it's not really good for I wanted it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.140 
it's not really good for I wanted it
faster<00:00:57.860> got<00:00:58.860> a<00:00:58.890> free<00:00:59.100> kilowatt<00:00:59.610> one<00:00:59.760> instead

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
faster got a free kilowatt one instead

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.050 
faster got a free kilowatt one instead
with<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.720> bag<00:01:00.989> now<00:01:01.260> Phoebe<00:01:01.970> so<00:01:02.970> I<00:01:03.030> would<00:01:03.360> steal

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
let's chat now it's got some good power

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:22.459 
let's chat now it's got some good power
factor<00:01:17.990> show<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:19.259> what<00:01:19.499> it<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.799> do<00:01:21.469> well

factor show you what what it can do well

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.340 
factor show you what what it can do well
I'll<00:01:22.560> let<00:01:22.649> you<00:01:22.710> call<00:01:22.889> fire<00:01:23.990> electrical<00:01:24.990> fires

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
I'll let you call fire electrical fires

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.370 
I'll let you call fire electrical fires
around<00:01:26.149> think<00:01:27.149> is<00:01:27.499> 2025<00:01:28.499> watts<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:31.020> were

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
around think is 2025 watts and I were

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.050 
around think is 2025 watts and I were
talking<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.859> solar<00:01:32.159> power<00:01:32.399> guy<00:01:32.639> or<00:01:33.030> did

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
talking to a solar power guy or did

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.389 
talking to a solar power guy or did
solar<00:01:33.450> panels<00:01:33.749> and<00:01:33.840> he<00:01:33.959> said<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:35.189> can't

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
solar panels and he said you can't

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.309 
solar panels and he said you can't
possibly<00:01:35.759> run<00:01:35.969> one<00:01:36.179> of<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:37.139> type<00:01:37.380> system<00:01:37.889> and

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
possibly run one of this type system and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.780 
possibly run one of this type system and
poor<00:01:40.319> prove<00:01:40.530> him<00:01:40.649> wrong<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:41.159> now

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.800 

now<00:01:44.360> coolly<00:01:44.660> from<00:01:44.930> come<00:01:45.260> on<00:01:45.380> over<00:01:45.830> slip

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
now coolly from come on over slip

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.399 
now coolly from come on over slip
battery's<00:01:47.680> getting<00:01:47.829> drained<00:01:48.070> like<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:49.409> or

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
battery's getting drained like that or

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.580 
battery's getting drained like that or
it<00:01:50.770> should<00:01:51.189> come<00:01:51.490> on

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:08.669 

sometime<00:01:58.460> this<00:01:58.609> year

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:24.900 

iowa

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:34.530 

yeah<00:02:25.450> McGorry<00:02:25.810> slight<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.200> know<00:02:26.290> what<00:02:26.410> now

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.509 

so<00:02:35.230> which<00:02:35.379> for<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.590> solar<00:02:35.829> guy<00:02:36.069> saying<00:02:36.370> it

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
so which for the solar guy saying it

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.630 
so which for the solar guy saying it
won't<00:02:36.640> even<00:02:36.939> boil<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.360> kettle<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:38.400> think<00:02:39.400> if<00:02:39.519> it

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
won't even boil a kettle I think if it

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.089 
won't even boil a kettle I think if it
can<00:02:39.760> power<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.209> type<00:02:40.510> of<00:02:40.739> electrical<00:02:41.739> fire

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
can power this type of electrical fire

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:49.640 
can power this type of electrical fire
think<00:02:42.519> you<00:02:42.579> can<00:02:42.730> boil<00:02:42.909> a<00:02:42.939> kettle<00:02:43.120> quite<00:02:43.450> easily

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.450 

so<00:02:50.250> here<00:02:50.610> we<00:02:50.730> go<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:51.000> us

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
so here we go on us

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.550 
so here we go on us
obviously<00:02:53.300> batches<00:02:53.630> getting<00:02:53.870> genders<00:02:54.320> gonna

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
obviously batches getting genders gonna

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.470 
obviously batches getting genders gonna
join<00:02:54.980> hundred<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.550> ten<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:55.970> our<00:02:56.120> budget

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.509 

when<00:02:59.080> I<00:02:59.140> get<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.290> new<00:02:59.349> system<00:02:59.830> rigged<00:03:00.040> up<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.459> I'm

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
when I get a new system rigged up so I'm

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:09.020 
when I get a new system rigged up so I'm
not<00:03:00.670> gonna<00:03:00.849> go<00:03:01.030> in<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.239> corner

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:17.170 

we've<00:03:10.030> Liam<00:03:10.270> warm<00:03:10.480> now

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.420 

let's<00:03:18.170> turn<00:03:18.349> it<00:03:18.469> off<00:03:18.560> Roger<00:03:18.859> is<00:03:19.040> actually<00:03:19.400> a

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
let's turn it off Roger is actually a

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.110 
let's turn it off Roger is actually a
complete<00:03:21.250> but<00:03:22.250> then<00:03:22.370> all<00:03:22.519> of<00:03:22.700> all<00:03:22.909> tidge

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120

complete but then all of all tidge
coming<00:03:23.420> on<00:03:23.540> go<00:03:24.260> back<00:03:24.439> up<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.680> till<00:03:24.890> now<00:03:25.069> regular

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.449 

yeah<00:03:39.139> it's<00:03:39.530> only<00:03:39.709> temporary<00:03:40.010> for<00:03:40.250> now<00:03:40.280> I'm

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
yeah it's only temporary for now I'm

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.709 
yeah it's only temporary for now I'm
going<00:03:40.639> to<00:03:40.700> get<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:40.819> bigger<00:03:41.030> system<00:03:41.269> soon

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:41.719 
going to get a bigger system soon

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:48.300 
going to get a bigger system soon
hopefully<00:03:42.109> hopefully<00:03:42.829> six<00:03:43.310> batteries<00:03:43.760> and

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.509 

castrate<00:03:49.310> panels<00:03:49.639> so<00:03:50.260> these<00:03:51.260> are<00:03:51.530> 60<00:03:52.370> watt

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
castrate panels so these are 60 watt

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.960 
castrate panels so these are 60 watt
panels<00:03:52.970> have<00:03:53.060> got<00:03:53.299> I<00:03:53.989> got<00:03:54.079> these<00:03:54.379> off<00:03:54.530> ebay<00:03:54.970> by

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
panels have got I got these off ebay by
