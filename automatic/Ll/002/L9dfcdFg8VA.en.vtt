break it down even finer then we have

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.780 
break it down even finer then we have

fine<00:01:19.250> we<00:01:19.550> want<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:19.880> grind<00:01:20.180> our<00:01:20.570> material<00:01:21.080> this

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
fine we want to grind our material this

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.260 
fine we want to grind our material this
is<00:01:21.290> about<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.830> medium<00:01:22.250> grit<00:01:22.580> in<00:01:22.880> there<00:01:23.060> right

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
is about the medium grit in there right

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.020 
is about the medium grit in there right
now<00:01:23.330> there's<00:01:24.080> a<00:01:24.170> finer<00:01:24.530> mesh<00:01:24.920> but<00:01:25.550> it<00:01:25.700> takes<00:01:25.880> a

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
now there's a finer mesh but it takes a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.310 
now there's a finer mesh but it takes a
little<00:01:26.180> longer<00:01:26.420> to<00:01:26.690> get<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.930> material

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
little longer to get the material

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.499 
little longer to get the material
through<00:01:27.470> it<00:01:27.649> this<00:01:28.040> is<00:01:28.190> a<00:01:28.220> good<00:01:28.490> compromise<00:01:29.030> on

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
through it this is a good compromise on

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.140 
through it this is a good compromise on
both<00:01:30.100> productivity<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.340> effectiveness<00:01:31.549> so

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
both productivity and effectiveness so

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.969 
both productivity and effectiveness so
we're<00:01:32.690> getting<00:01:32.930> good<00:01:33.049> results<00:01:33.590> with<00:01:33.770> our

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
we're getting good results with our

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.340 
we're getting good results with our
medium<00:01:34.340> screen<00:01:34.729> and<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:35.630> we'll<00:01:35.990> turn<00:01:36.200> this

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
medium screen and so we'll turn this

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.860 
medium screen and so we'll turn this
material<00:01:36.830> loose<00:01:36.979> in<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.250> landscape<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.659> here

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
material loose in the landscape so here

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.240 
material loose in the landscape so here
we<00:01:38.960> are<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:39.229> is<00:01:39.290> what<00:01:39.530> we're<00:01:39.710> making<00:01:39.860> out<00:01:40.130> of

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
we are this is what we're making out of

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.230 
we are this is what we're making out of
all<00:01:40.370> this<00:01:40.580> brush

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
all this brush

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.930 
all this brush
we've<00:01:42.229> tarp<00:01:42.590> them<00:01:42.740> up<00:01:42.890> in<00:01:43.010> our<00:01:43.130> seven<00:01:43.460> by<00:01:43.580> seven

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940

we've tarp them up in our seven by seven
burlap<00:01:44.299> tarps<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:44.930> you<00:01:45.530> can<00:01:45.710> see<00:01:45.920> what<00:01:46.340> we've

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
burlap tarps and you can see what we've

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.030 
burlap tarps and you can see what we've
ground<00:01:46.820> this<00:01:47.030> down<00:01:47.270> into<00:01:47.540> it's<00:01:48.500> pretty<00:01:48.799> nice

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
ground this down into it's pretty nice

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.280 
ground this down into it's pretty nice
stuff<00:01:49.479> sometimes<00:01:50.479> will<00:01:50.659> even<00:01:50.690> shovel<00:01:51.200> it

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
stuff sometimes will even shovel it

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.810 
stuff sometimes will even shovel it
through<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.500> second<00:01:51.920> time<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.400> get<00:01:52.549> a<00:01:52.580> double

grind a fine grind out of it but this is

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.920 
grind a fine grind out of it but this is
pretty<00:01:55.340> good<00:01:55.549> this<00:01:56.030> is<00:01:56.240> good<00:01:56.390> enough<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.720> use

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
pretty good this is good enough to use

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.710 
pretty good this is good enough to use
his<00:01:56.960> mulch<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:57.710> compost<00:01:57.740> around<00:01:58.430> trees<00:01:58.909> to

we've<00:02:03.140> recycled<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:03.860> materials<00:02:04.310> back<00:02:04.580> into

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
we've recycled the materials back into

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.789 
we've recycled the materials back into
the<00:02:05.060> landscape<00:02:05.390> we're<00:02:06.260> making<00:02:06.680> these

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
the landscape we're making these

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
nutrients available to the trees so they

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.650 
nutrients available to the trees so they
can<00:02:08.929> rise<00:02:09.140> up<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.769> this<00:02:10.610> will<00:02:10.790> also<00:02:11.000> suppress

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
can rise up and this will also suppress

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.979 
can rise up and this will also suppress
weeds<00:02:12.019> by<00:02:12.950> putting<00:02:13.400> this<00:02:13.489> down<00:02:13.700> around<00:02:14.390> the
