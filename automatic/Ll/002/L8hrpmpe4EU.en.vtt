00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
time I don't have exact measurements but

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.819 
time I don't have exact measurements but
it<00:00:56.539> doesn't<00:00:56.780> have<00:00:56.899> to<00:00:56.989> be<00:00:57.079> exact<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.500> be<00:00:57.620> good

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
it doesn't have to be exact to be good

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.290 
it doesn't have to be exact to be good
so<00:00:58.070> if<00:00:58.160> you<00:00:58.249> can<00:00:58.370> kind<00:00:58.550> of<00:00:58.609> see<00:00:58.760> that<00:00:58.879> Cup<00:00:59.120> and

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
so if you can kind of see that Cup and

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.060 
so if you can kind of see that Cup and
how<00:00:59.359> big<00:00:59.539> it<00:00:59.660> is<00:00:59.690> that's<00:01:00.559> how<00:01:00.710> much<00:01:00.859> brown

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
how big it is that's how much brown

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.759 
how big it is that's how much brown
sugar<00:01:01.429> it's<00:01:01.640> not<00:01:01.820> packed<00:01:02.120> down<00:01:02.410> so<00:01:03.410> it

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
sugar it's not packed down so it

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.439 
sugar it's not packed down so it
probably<00:01:03.949> like<00:01:04.189> half<00:01:04.430> that<00:01:04.610> if<00:01:04.909> it<00:01:05.089> was<00:01:05.180> packed

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
probably like half that if it was packed

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.490 
probably like half that if it was packed
but<00:01:06.020> after<00:01:06.259> you<00:01:06.320> got<00:01:06.470> it<00:01:06.590> in<00:01:06.770> go<00:01:07.700> ahead<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.060> uh

but after you got it in go ahead and uh

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.890 
but after you got it in go ahead and uh
add<00:01:09.500> your<00:01:09.799> vinegar<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:11.090> what<00:01:11.299> I<00:01:11.329> usually<00:01:11.540> do

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
is just enough to where it all kind of

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:23.499 
is just enough to where it all kind of
dissolves<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:15.970> come<00:01:16.970> on<00:01:18.490> like<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:23.360> then
