 interactive ayo work of those well 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.869
 packaged absolution looks like 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.279
 an excellent stealth game sandbox with the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.170
 precise focus on interaction 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.870
 environmental that will allow the player 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:39.420
 to act in many different ways of 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.860
 return from the long lethargy 47 will be found 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.239
 immediately dealing with the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.920
 worst of situations 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.410
 his new contract provides 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.870
 the murder of daiana bar wood her 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.149
 historical through work the woman has 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.670
 deserted by segregating the identities of 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.680
 lots of agents all to kidnap one 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.469
 victoria girl object of 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.940
 the agency's attentions only after having 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.670
 killed the woman is read her last 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.010
 will 47 will realize having to 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.570
 do something by defecting in turn e 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.210
 promising to protect the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.189
 little girl at any cost 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.020
 the story will see our space between 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.700
 the roles of prey and predator in a 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.740
 narrative continuum that does not shine 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.900
 for originality and inventiveness 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.729
 however, the strength of the plot lies in the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.979
 characterization of the characters ad 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.840
 start right from the protagonist 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.390
 we will experience a more intimate dimension 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.710
 of 47 intent for the first time ad 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.770
 tap into that bit of humanity 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.840
 still there we will dig in part the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.220
 surface of his past recovering 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.960
 dormant memories and learning 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.880
 interesting news 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.740
 we will finally meet new and old friends 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.200
 and antagonists whose personalities 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.329
 murky and desecrating they will be felt 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.700
 like a border, the ancienne un 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.049
 at the end winning mix capable of 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.500
 keep the interest of the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.500
 video player 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.050
 in playful terms the progression is 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.060
 structured in a linear manner 20 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.950
 missions firmly linked to each other by 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.020
 carry out without too many interruptions 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.729
 now eliminating designated targets now 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.429
 fleeing unnoticed from the scene of the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.350
 crime to carry out the tasks 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.020
 we will have the classic available 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.360
 set of 47 composed of silver 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.430
 balls and fiber cable as well as all 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.540
 a series of weapons and objects 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.630
 improvised picture available later 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.790
 framework will go from knives to books 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.810
 passing through proximity mines and weapons 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.250
 by fire 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.110
 all with a view to giving to 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.300
 player the opportunity to act with 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.280
 good freedom allowing him to create 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.489
 diversions or attack more or 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.690
 enemies are less silent 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.880
 i also strongly return 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.560
 disguises to use to move 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.570
 freely but not too much in the areas 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.030
 patrolled but the most interesting part 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.400
 and controversial of hitman absolution is 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.200
 certainly linked to level design 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.269
 many times the targets will appear 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.100
 in paintings by countless 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.200
 environmental interaction useful for 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.390
 snatch their secrets and improvise 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.980
 accidental killings that keep it 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.510
 state of absolute in visibility of the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.340
 protagonist 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.140
 others, however, will be longer 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.239
 guided though they will not be missing 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.160
 shortcuts and similar to maintain 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.350
 consistently low profile 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.850
 acting in the shadows at extreme evils 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.280
 of course it will always be possible 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.200
 extract the trusty guns or collect 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.510
 some firearms from the corpses of the 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.579
 enemies throwing us overwhelmingly into the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.560
 fra fra transits in the other 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.269
 however we will notice a certain malady 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.100
 mechanical shooter operation 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.350
 linked to a concept from the third 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.190
 rather dated person shooter and to a 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.570
 animations compartment still a bit woody 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.190
 head down anyway not 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.570
 it will never be the best solution 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.910
 especially if they want to do it 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.980
 the best score possible for 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.040
 unlock new abilities at the end of the mission 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.200
 among these we point out the present instinct 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.060
 from the beginning but upgradeable to 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.690
 help us overcome situations more 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.090
 intricately 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.220
 it is a feature borrowed in 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.010
 part from assassin's creed that will allow 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.900
 47 to exploit his innate gifts for 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.430
 sniff out the presence of enemies too 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.930
 through the walls 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.100
 getting closer to consuming more 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.960
 quickly the bar 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.030
 we can also predict the routines of 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.740
 patrolling as well as hiding the 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.680
 face to make it more effective 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.690
 camouflage helps to make the game 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.160
 more engaging and difficult a good one 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.110
 intelligence programming 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.959
 artificial especially for how much 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.730
 concerns the user patrolling breaks 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.980
 prolonged and various problems not 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.770
 they will be missing but ultimately nothing 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.780
 so serious as to affect usability 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.100
 of the adventure thus prefigures a 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.870
 great stealth game 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.400
 one of only two to interpret 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.730
 genuinely genre in this 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.730
 generation 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.710
 from the technical point of view in it mid cap 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.510
 solutions are not lacking ups and downs 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.190
 polygonal modeling of protagonists 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.100
 and second place satisfies and fully convinces 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.080
 but the three extras do not do the same 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.180
 or four more steps carried out under 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.890
 not always with the stencil 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.390
 level fluid animations and 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.000
 realistic in most of the situations 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.370
 woody completely out of context in 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.770
 others where some appear reiterated 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.050
 historical defects of the saga 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.400
 texturing is excellent 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.350
 environmental that shader units of high 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.390
 level and a wise management of 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.000
 lighting sources gives paintings 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.410
 with excellent visual cues at the level 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.450
 sound record at soundtrack 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.180
 addictive to which is added 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.500
 the excellent dubbing in the original language 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.060
 perfectly synchronized the lip is 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.570
 capable of giving something extra 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.570
 to identification 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:35.750
 of grates and solar assofoodtec aspi team 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.439
 often hitman absolution is not a game 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.990
 for everyone 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:40.939
 slow reasoning obsessive and often 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.379
 punitive will probably not attract 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:44.990
 all fans of the action 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:47.419
 gaming who will give a chance however 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.639
 in will be amazed captured by the 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:52.580
 typical story able to tell more 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.110
 intimately involved with gameplay 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.030
 features not always 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.680
 perfect but able to express to 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.289
 better the potential of a structure 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.080
 stealth type sandbox for freedom 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:05.300
 uncommon decision making a headline from non 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.069
 let yourself be absolutely able to escape 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.139
 to literally bring you back into the 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:11.139
 time the purists of stealth gaming
