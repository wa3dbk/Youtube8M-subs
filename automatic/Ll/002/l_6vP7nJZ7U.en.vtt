00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.980
 she is tender the delicate 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:14.820
 she is sometimes difficult but she is 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:19.289
 mellow and without good she is blonde 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.869
 she is golden then she is sick 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.890
 good it's an old one it's a 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.869
 classic but also modern 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:34.380
 we have pleasure to find it in front of a 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:36.620
 cup of tea I am I am I am 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.620
 modern 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 1 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.170
 at 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.760
 hahaha 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.550
 so we will start by mixing the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.170
 eggs with both sugars and pinch 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.170
 of salt for five minutes 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.690
 during that time I mix with the 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.310
 flour the baking powder with an x this 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.860
 who avoids the sieve and I get the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.080
 so now a very sparkling mixture 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.750
 and I'll be able to add to the mix 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.250
 flour and baking powder that 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.280
 so I incorporate with a spoon 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.280
 wood 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.240
 here we go by incorporating the 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.220
 melted butter at 35 degrees honey 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.870
 so if your honey and hard you have that 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.510
 to pass it a little in the microwave 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.850
 to liquefy it and so we incorporate 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.700
 all this here it goes it's muls youn and 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.300
 and we're going to get a smooth mix and 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:10.430
 very creamy shine and so well 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.170
 emulsify we will let our 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.600
 mixing for at least two hours at 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.490
 fridge and even I would say in the ideal 12 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.300
 hours 12 hours to have 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.710
 madeleines well inflated here after my 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.590
 little two-hour break I turn on my 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.020
 oven at 230 degrees the bear the mussels 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.370
 with a cold melted butter the 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.570
 I use metal molds because 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.800
 that they drive the heat better but 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.020
 you can also use the molds in 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.280
 silicone it works very well 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.890
 I wait until the butter is frozen before 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.170
 to fill the small cavities 1 for 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.810
 have a little insulating layer and I 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.550
 can bake in a 230 degree oven 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.440
 for about 10 minutes will have that 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.940
 depends a lot on your oven and 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.360
 immediately after avon fauna and I 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.360
 drop to 180 Â° and I admire the show 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.290
 and when the models are cooked frozen 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.290
 still hot mussels on a rack 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.800
 so I did not tell you she 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.800

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:27.830
