hey everyone its Caleb from Caleb the

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.760 
hey everyone its Caleb from Caleb the
video<00:00:02.850> maker<00:00:03.030> and<00:00:03.330> in<00:00:03.870> this<00:00:04.020> video<00:00:04.350> I'm<00:00:04.560> going

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
video maker and in this video I'm going

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.740 
video maker and in this video I'm going
to<00:00:04.890> be<00:00:04.980> talking<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.640> you<00:00:05.790> telling<00:00:06.420> you<00:00:06.480> how<00:00:06.540> to

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
to be talking to you telling you how to

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.310 
to be talking to you telling you how to
easily<00:00:07.350> convert<00:00:08.179> decimals<00:00:09.179> like<00:00:09.389> this<00:00:09.690> into

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
easily convert decimals like this into

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.209 
easily convert decimals like this into
binary

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
binary

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.459 
binary
alright<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.420> just<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.780> follow<00:00:13.200> the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
alright so this is just a follow the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.810 
alright so this is just a follow the
step<00:00:13.679> pattern<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.280> don't<00:00:14.429> really<00:00:14.519> need<00:00:14.700> to

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
step pattern so you don't really need to

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.640 
step pattern so you don't really need to
understand<00:00:15.179> anything<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:15.780> if<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:15.990> want<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.440> I

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
understand anything but if you want to I

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.099 
understand anything but if you want to I
created<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.460> super<00:00:17.640> in-depth<00:00:18.090> 45-minute<00:00:18.840> video

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
created a super in-depth 45-minute video

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.260 
created a super in-depth 45-minute video
over<00:00:19.560> decimals<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.189> binary<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.880> be<00:00:21.000> sure<00:00:21.029> to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
over decimals in binary so be sure to

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.029 
over decimals in binary so be sure to
check<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.449> out<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.470> first<00:00:22.500> thing<00:00:22.890> that

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
check that out so the first thing that

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.439 
check that out so the first thing that
you<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.279> basically<00:00:24.060> you're<00:00:24.240> just<00:00:24.269> gonna

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
you do basically you're just gonna

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.670 
you do basically you're just gonna
follow<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.810> pattern<00:00:25.140> you're<00:00:25.260> going<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.560> need

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
follow this pattern you're going to need

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.380 
follow this pattern you're going to need
a<00:00:25.710> calculator<00:00:25.980> unless<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.300> do

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
a calculator unless you can do

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.300 
a calculator unless you can do
everything<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.779> your<00:00:27.840> head<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.199> me<00:00:28.380> alright

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
everything in your head like me alright

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.870 
everything in your head like me alright
so<00:00:30.529> basically<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.040> take<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.550> number

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
so basically you just take the number

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.510 
so basically you just take the number
you<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.829> you<00:00:34.829> multiply<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.660> Kappa<00:00:37.520> you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
you have and you multiply it Kappa you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.979 
you have and you multiply it Kappa you
multiply<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.030> by<00:00:39.239> 2<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:41.180> 0.78<00:00:42.180> 1<00:00:42.780> 2<00:00:43.290> 5<00:00:44.989> multiply

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
multiply it by 2 so 0.78 1 2 5 multiply

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.160 
multiply it by 2 so 0.78 1 2 5 multiply
that<00:00:46.170> by<00:00:46.230> 2<00:00:46.410> says<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.840> yeah<00:00:48.840> right

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
that by 2 says what we have yeah right

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.520 
that by 2 says what we have yeah right
there<00:00:49.520> and<00:00:50.520> equals<00:00:51.360> or<00:00:51.510> whatever<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.960> then

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
there and equals or whatever and then

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.720 
there and equals or whatever and then
you<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:55.969> 1.5625<00:00:58.129> now<00:00:59.129> we're<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
you get 1.5625 now we're going to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.459 
you get 1.5625 now we're going to
continue<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.480> process<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:01.170> every

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
continue to do this process but every

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.979 
continue to do this process but every
time<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:02.340> look<00:01:02.550> at<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.789> first<00:01:03.239> number<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
time we look at this first number to the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.399 
time we look at this first number to the
left<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.450> decimal<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.900> case<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
left of the decimal in this case and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.620 
left of the decimal in this case and
we're<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> append<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.240> add<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
we're going to append that or add that

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.940 
we're going to append that or add that
to<00:01:09.869> our<00:01:09.900> binary<00:01:10.890> numbers<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.000> start<00:01:12.270> with

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
to our binary numbers so we start with

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
to our binary numbers so we start with
0.1<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.189> then<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.060> rid<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.270> that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
0.1 and then we can get rid of that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.539 
0.1 and then we can get rid of that
we're<00:01:16.110> going<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.380> work<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:17.070> right<00:01:17.310> here

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
we're going to work with this right here

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.910 
we're going to work with this right here
once<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.869> as<00:01:19.020> decimal<00:01:19.759> we<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:21.920> take

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
once we have just as decimal we can take

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.670 
once we have just as decimal we can take
that<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.430> once<00:01:23.939> again<00:01:24.090> multiply<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.290> by<00:01:25.350> 2

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
that and once again multiply that by 2

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.649 
that and once again multiply that by 2
that's<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.640> pattern<00:01:26.939> we're<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.479> follow

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
that's a pattern we're going to follow

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.530 
that's a pattern we're going to follow
each<00:01:27.990> time<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:28.979> take<00:01:29.159> point<00:01:29.549> 5<00:01:29.820> 6<00:01:30.180> 2<00:01:30.329> 5

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
each time so we take point 5 6 2 5

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.530 
each time so we take point 5 6 2 5
multiply<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.259> by<00:01:31.320> 2<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.299> here's<00:01:33.299> what<00:01:33.450> we

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
multiply that by 2 and here's what we

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.539 
multiply that by 2 and here's what we
get<00:01:34.400> one<00:01:35.400> one<00:01:36.110> one<00:01:37.110> point<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.770> two<00:01:37.950> five<00:01:37.979> there

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
get one one one point one two five there

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:38.990 
get one one one point one two five there
we<00:01:38.640> go

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
we go

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.780 
we go
okay<00:01:40.040> 1<00:01:41.840> 0.125<00:01:42.979> all<00:01:43.979> right<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.310> once<00:01:44.490> again<00:01:44.610> we

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
okay 1 0.125 all right so once again we

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.990 
okay 1 0.125 all right so once again we
take<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.119> one<00:01:45.560> add<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.860> our<00:01:47.040> binary<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
take this one add it to our binary and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.630 
take this one add it to our binary and
then<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.299> get<00:01:48.420> rid<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:50.520> we

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
then just get rid of it and then what we

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.600 
then just get rid of it and then what we
do<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.060> take<00:01:51.299> point<00:01:52.079> 1<00:01:52.320> 2<00:01:52.530> 5<00:01:55.399> multiply<00:01:56.399> that

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
do is we take point 1 2 5 multiply that

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
do is we take point 1 2 5 multiply that
by<00:01:56.670> 2<00:01:57.380> we<00:01:58.380> get<00:02:00.439> 0.25<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.979> we<00:02:02.040> take<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> 0<00:02:02.670> put<00:02:03.509> it

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
by 2 we get 0.25 so we take the 0 put it

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.330 
by 2 we get 0.25 so we take the 0 put it
down<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.200> bottom<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.649> even<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.159> not<00:02:05.219> a

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
down to the bottom so even if it's not a

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.240 
down to the bottom so even if it's not a
1<00:02:05.610> we<00:02:05.909> still<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.509> put<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.840> 0<00:02:07.140> there

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
1 we still have to put that 0 there

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.529 
1 we still have to put that 0 there
basically<00:02:08.250> that's<00:02:08.429> saying<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.239> didn't

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
basically that's saying it it didn't

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.150 
basically that's saying it it didn't
reach<00:02:09.690> 1<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.080> time<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.800> don't<00:02:10.950> have

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
reach 1 that time so we don't have

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.010 
reach 1 that time so we don't have
enough<00:02:11.489> therefore<00:02:12.239> we<00:02:12.390> add

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
enough therefore we add

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.950 
enough therefore we add
a<00:02:13.080> zero<00:02:13.740> so<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.310> take<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.490> zero<00:02:14.910> move<00:02:15.870> it

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
a zero so just take that zero move it

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.530 
a zero so just take that zero move it
down<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.320> bar<00:02:16.730> or<00:02:17.730> move<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.120> your<00:02:18.300> binary

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
down to the bar or move to your binary

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.080 
down to the bar or move to your binary
and<00:02:19.200> then<00:02:19.380> take<00:02:19.560> point<00:02:19.830> 25<00:02:20.250> multiply<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.030> by

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
and then take point 25 multiply that by

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.220 
and then take point 25 multiply that by
two<00:02:21.300> again<00:02:22.640> zero<00:02:23.640> point<00:02:24.180> five<00:02:24.600> once<00:02:25.020> again

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
two again zero point five once again

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.170 
two again zero point five once again
take<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.440> zero<00:02:25.920> move<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.030> bottom

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
take that zero move it to the bottom

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.040 
take that zero move it to the bottom
bolt<00:02:28.790> then<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.880> can<00:02:29.970> get<00:02:30.090> rid<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.750> then

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
bolt then you can get rid of it and then

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.630 
bolt then you can get rid of it and then
once<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.320> have<00:02:31.410> point<00:02:31.620> five<00:02:31.920> that's<00:02:32.250> that's

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
once you have point five that's that's

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.490 
once you have point five that's that's
the<00:02:32.850> answer<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.210> you<00:02:33.660> would<00:02:33.780> want<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.350> get

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
the answer that you would want to get

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.700 
the answer that you would want to get
you<00:02:34.800> will<00:02:35.010> take<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:36.290> anything<00:02:37.290> that's<00:02:37.440> going

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
you will take that anything that's going

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.820 
you will take that anything that's going
to<00:02:37.830> evenly<00:02:38.330> multiply<00:02:39.330> into<00:02:39.510> one<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.710> end

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
to evenly multiply into one in the end

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.160 
to evenly multiply into one in the end
is<00:02:41.130> what<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.490> want<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.760> get<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.690> multiply

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
is what you want to get so you multiply

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.860 
is what you want to get so you multiply
that<00:02:43.320> by<00:02:43.380> two<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.910> will<00:02:45.030> get<00:02:45.240> one<00:02:45.570> point

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
that by two and you will get one point

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.380 
that by two and you will get one point
zero<00:02:46.140> take<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:47.010> one<00:02:47.190> move<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.000> down<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.300> the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
zero take that one move it down to the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.420 
zero take that one move it down to the
bottom<00:02:48.710> and<00:02:49.710> then<00:02:49.830> get<00:02:49.980> rid<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.250> now

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
bottom and then get rid of it now

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.010 
bottom and then get rid of it now
obviously<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:51.240> have<00:02:51.330> zero<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.720> if<00:02:51.930> you

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
obviously we have zero and if you

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.440 
obviously we have zero and if you
multiply<00:02:52.170> 0<00:02:52.800> by<00:02:53.220> 2<00:02:53.730> you're<00:02:54.090> going<00:02:54.210> to<00:02:54.360> have

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
multiply 0 by 2 you're going to have

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.020 
multiply 0 by 2 you're going to have
zero<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:55.050> this<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.380> as<00:02:55.530> far<00:02:55.590> as<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.280> can<00:02:56.430> go<00:02:56.730> and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
zero so this is as far as you can go and

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.610 
zero so this is as far as you can go and
this<00:02:57.570> is<00:02:57.780> our<00:02:57.900> final<00:02:58.200> answer<00:02:59.360> and<00:03:00.360> we<00:03:00.840> can<00:03:01.050> talk

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
this is our final answer and we can talk

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.720 
this is our final answer and we can talk
a<00:03:01.650> little<00:03:01.830> bit<00:03:01.950> more<00:03:01.980> about<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.400> how<00:03:02.580> long

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
a little bit more about that how long

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.000 
a little bit more about that how long
we've<00:03:02.940> three<00:03:03.600> minutes<00:03:03.990> so<00:03:04.620> that's<00:03:04.860> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
we've three minutes so that's the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.800 
we've three minutes so that's the
process<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.490> can<00:03:05.610> do<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.820> for<00:03:06.000> more<00:03:06.180> complex

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
process you can do it for more complex

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.890 
process you can do it for more complex
things<00:03:07.460> in<00:03:08.460> some<00:03:08.730> cases<00:03:08.970> you're<00:03:09.270> not<00:03:09.480> going<00:03:09.780> to

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
things in some cases you're not going to

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.330 
things in some cases you're not going to
get<00:03:09.990> an<00:03:10.080> answer<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.560> quickly<00:03:10.830> if<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.190> have

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
get an answer that quickly if you have

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.690 
get an answer that quickly if you have
it<00:03:11.490> really<00:03:11.730> like<00:03:12.060> if<00:03:12.240> you<00:03:12.360> had<00:03:12.540> 78<00:03:15.230> 126<00:03:16.230> 7<00:03:17.040> well

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
it really like if you had 78 126 7 well

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.500 
it really like if you had 78 126 7 well
that's<00:03:17.880> going<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.240> be<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.450> much<00:03:18.860> longer<00:03:20.510> example

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
that's going to be a much longer example

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.840 
that's going to be a much longer example
obviously<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:22.110> farther<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:23.010> go<00:03:23.610> in<00:03:23.730> your

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
obviously the farther you go in your

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.480 
obviously the farther you go in your
binary<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.810> farther<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.410> go<00:03:25.560> right<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.190> more

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
binary the farther you go right the more

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.730 
binary the farther you go right the more
precise<00:03:27.150> your<00:03:27.450> answer<00:03:27.810> but<00:03:28.080> in<00:03:28.200> some<00:03:28.500> cases

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
precise your answer but in some cases

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.860 
precise your answer but in some cases
you<00:03:29.490> will<00:03:29.520> never<00:03:29.910> reach<00:03:30.270> an<00:03:30.480> end

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
you will never reach an end

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
you will never reach an end
for<00:03:31.560> example<00:03:31.950> 0.1<00:03:32.660> well<00:03:33.660> it'll<00:03:34.380> just<00:03:34.470> keep

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
for example 0.1 well it'll just keep

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.530 
for example 0.1 well it'll just keep
repeating<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.640> you'll<00:03:35.730> have<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:36.060> pattern

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
repeating and you'll have this pattern

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.230 
repeating and you'll have this pattern
of<00:03:36.660> like<00:03:36.840> 0<00:03:37.250> see<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.280> don't<00:03:38.670> remember<00:03:38.850> batter

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
of like 0 see I don't remember batter

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.980 
of like 0 see I don't remember batter
but<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.870> think<00:03:40.230> it's<00:03:40.320> zero<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:45.660> I'll<00:03:45.780> keep

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
but I think it's zero and I'll keep

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.810 
but I think it's zero and I'll keep
going<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.410> keep<00:03:46.560> going<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.890> keep<00:03:46.980> going<00:03:47.370> and

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
going and keep going and keep going and

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.900 
going and keep going and keep going and
you'll<00:03:47.970> never<00:03:48.090> reach<00:03:48.360> an<00:03:48.540> end<00:03:49.160> so<00:03:50.160> there<00:03:50.640> is<00:03:50.760> at

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
you'll never reach an end so there is at

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.140 
you'll never reach an end so there is at
some<00:03:51.180> point<00:03:51.420> you'll<00:03:51.540> need<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.840> either<00:03:51.870> stop<00:03:52.440> or

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
some point you'll need to either stop or

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.610 
some point you'll need to either stop or
figure<00:03:54.150> out<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.330> pattern<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:55.410> keeps

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
figure out a pattern that keeps

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.560 
figure out a pattern that keeps
repeating<00:03:55.860> some<00:03:56.520> some<00:03:56.940> will<00:03:57.060> just<00:03:57.209> keep<00:03:57.330> going

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
repeating some some will just keep going

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.680 
repeating some some will just keep going
forever<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.320> you'll<00:03:58.440> get<00:03:58.560> tired<00:03:59.300> but<00:04:00.300> that<00:04:00.480> is

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
forever and you'll get tired but that is

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.480 
forever and you'll get tired but that is
how<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:00.900> do<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.290> if<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.040> want<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.280> look<00:04:02.370> at

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
how you do that if you want to look at

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.260 
how you do that if you want to look at
this<00:04:02.610> fraction<00:04:03.180> wise<00:04:03.330> this<00:04:03.930> first<00:04:04.230> number<00:04:04.650> is

this fraction wise this first number is

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.800 
this fraction wise this first number is
1/2<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:07.470> second<00:04:08.010> number<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.690> 1/4

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
1/2 the second number is 1/4

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.530 
1/2 the second number is 1/4
this<00:04:10.739> is<00:04:10.950> 1/8<00:04:11.550> we<00:04:11.790> don't<00:04:11.940> have<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.209> one

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
this is 1/8 we don't have it one

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.170 
this is 1/8 we don't have it one
sixteenth<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.370> 1/32<00:04:14.570> so<00:04:15.570> here<00:04:15.810> are<00:04:16.020> our<00:04:16.049> total

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
sixteenth and 1/32 so here are our total

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.270 
sixteenth and 1/32 so here are our total
fractions<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.390> we<00:04:18.570> have<00:04:18.780> if<00:04:19.140> you<00:04:19.709> want<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:19.980> do

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
fractions that we have if you want to do

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.480 
fractions that we have if you want to do
the<00:04:20.430> math<00:04:20.640> add<00:04:20.910> these<00:04:21.150> fractions<00:04:21.390> up<00:04:22.250> we<00:04:23.250> could

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
the math add these fractions up we could

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.030 
the math add these fractions up we could
look<00:04:23.669> at<00:04:24.500> 1/2<00:04:25.500> that's

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
look at 1/2 that's

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.820 
look at 1/2 that's
same<00:04:26.220> thing<00:04:26.520> as<00:04:26.760> 0.5<00:04:27.980> 1/4<00:04:28.980> is<00:04:29.190> point<00:04:29.550> 25<00:04:29.820> and

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
same thing as 0.5 1/4 is point 25 and

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:42.230 
same thing as 0.5 1/4 is point 25 and
then<00:04:34.880> 1/32<00:04:35.880> what<00:04:36.180> is<00:04:36.300> that<00:04:36.980> 1/32<00:04:37.980> and<00:04:41.000> you<00:04:42.000> get

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
then 1/32 what is that 1/32 and you get

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.860 
then 1/32 what is that 1/32 and you get
Oh<00:04:43.220> point<00:04:44.220> 0<00:04:44.940> 3<00:04:45.390> 1<00:04:46.260> 2<00:04:46.890> 5<00:04:47.700> now<00:04:48.510> when<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:48.720> add<00:04:48.840> that

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
Oh point 0 3 1 2 5 now when you add that

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.940 
Oh point 0 3 1 2 5 now when you add that
up<00:04:49.260> when<00:04:49.440> you<00:04:49.530> add<00:04:49.650> all<00:04:49.800> these<00:04:49.980> up<00:04:51.230> so<00:04:52.230> point<00:04:52.710> 0

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
up when you add all these up so point 0

00:04:52.950 --> 00:05:00.290 
up when you add all these up so point 0
3<00:04:53.010> 1<00:04:53.310> 2<00:04:53.520> 5<00:04:53.760> plus<00:04:54.450> point<00:04:54.900> 25<00:04:56.540> plus<00:04:57.540> point<00:04:57.900> 5<00:04:59.300> you

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
3 1 2 5 plus point 25 plus point 5 you

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.660 
3 1 2 5 plus point 25 plus point 5 you
get<00:05:00.710> who<00:05:01.710> would<00:05:01.860> he<00:05:01.920> get<00:05:02.040> 7<00:05:02.670> 8<00:05:02.940> 1<00:05:03.840> 2<00:05:04.250> 5<00:05:05.250> which

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
get who would he get 7 8 1 2 5 which

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.400 
get who would he get 7 8 1 2 5 which
that<00:05:05.940> was<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.210> original<00:05:06.660> number<00:05:06.930> we<00:05:07.020> started

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
that was the original number we started

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.210 
that was the original number we started
with<00:05:07.530> before<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:07.890> screwed<00:05:08.820> up<00:05:09.270> so<00:05:09.930> yeah<00:05:10.080> that<00:05:11.010> is

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
with before I screwed up so yeah that is

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.950 
with before I screwed up so yeah that is
how<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:11.460> easily<00:05:12.030> convert<00:05:12.630> from<00:05:13.760> decimal

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
how to easily convert from decimal

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.190 
how to easily convert from decimal
decimal<00:05:16.730> fractions<00:05:17.730> or<00:05:17.820> whatever<00:05:18.200> basically

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
decimal fractions or whatever basically

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.840 
decimal fractions or whatever basically
when<00:05:19.290> you<00:05:19.380> have<00:05:19.410> a<00:05:19.530> decimal<00:05:20.040> number<00:05:20.100> you<00:05:20.730> want

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
when you have a decimal number you want

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.820 
when you have a decimal number you want
to<00:05:20.880> convert<00:05:21.150> it<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.270> binary<00:05:21.840> that<00:05:22.380> is<00:05:22.590> how<00:05:22.770> you

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
to convert it to binary that is how you

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.370 
to convert it to binary that is how you
do<00:05:23.010> it<00:05:23.040> everything<00:05:23.730> right<00:05:24.270> of<00:05:24.420> the<00:05:24.540> decimal<00:05:24.690> is

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
do it everything right of the decimal is

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.740 
do it everything right of the decimal is
considered<00:05:25.980> to<00:05:26.100> be<00:05:26.130> fractions<00:05:26.820> rather<00:05:27.330> than

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
considered to be fractions rather than

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.460 
considered to be fractions rather than
whole<00:05:28.380> numbers<00:05:28.800> multiples<00:05:29.310> of<00:05:29.400> 2<00:05:29.610> its

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
whole numbers multiples of 2 its

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:37.370 
whole numbers multiples of 2 its
division<00:05:31.470> of<00:05:31.650> two<00:05:31.830> 1/2<00:05:32.840> 1/4<00:05:33.840> 1/8<00:05:34.380> 1/16<00:05:35.130> 1/32<00:05:36.380> so

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
division of two 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 so

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.870 
division of two 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 so
yeah<00:05:37.470> if<00:05:37.590> that<00:05:37.710> was<00:05:37.770> useful<00:05:38.070> be<00:05:38.430> sure<00:05:38.640> to
