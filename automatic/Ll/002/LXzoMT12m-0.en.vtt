00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:09.350
 occupational safety accidents 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.350
 causes and prevention 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.670
 hey because you do not care anymore I'll tell you 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.820
 one thing you have your job and I will do the 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.820
 my own 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.730
 and now 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.670
 but 201 accident 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.420
 it was an accident a simple sentence true 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.070
 this was very close to occur but 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.140
 When an accident happened at work 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.600
 the consequences might not be so 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.869
 simple the financial costs are 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.240
 huge over 27 million dollars 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.520
 compensations more than 11 billion in 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.220
 medical expenses and another 7 million 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.170
 dollars in fire losses so 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.180
 incredible how are these calculations not 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.040
 truly show physical pain and 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.800
 emotional of accident victims 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.479
 or their families and friends and nobody 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.810
 puts to think about the consequences that 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.860
 feel the companions of the victims 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.110
 interruption of procedures 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.360
 normal loss of productive time 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.840
 and the absence of a vital member of the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.030
 equipment basically an accident is a 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.760
 unforeseen event that usually has 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.160
 more than one cause some of these 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.989
 accidents can be unpredictable but 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.150
 most accidents in the 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.370
 work are caused by factors that 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.769
 we can control these factors 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:30.500
 include negligence neglect stress 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.780
 exhaustion and fatigue knowing about 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.990
 Potential causes can lead us to 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.360
 understand how to prevent accidents in a 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.850
 moment or another the tension affects us 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.040
 almost everyone one of the first ads 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.420
 is that the problems seem outside of 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.970
 control
