go turkey instead of ground beef well
turkey<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> little<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.360> leaner<00:01:15.600> meat

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
turkey is a little bit of a leaner meat

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.570 
turkey is a little bit of a leaner meat
but<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.290> could<00:01:16.470> definitely<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:17.100> ground<00:01:17.369> beef

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
but you could definitely do ground beef

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.280 
but you could definitely do ground beef
as<00:01:17.729> well<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.210> you're<00:01:18.570> doing<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.900> ground<00:01:19.110> beef

triangle for the extra lean or lean and
then<00:01:21.720> give<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.530> rinse<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.189> drain

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
then give it a rinse in a drain

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.160 
then give it a rinse in a drain
