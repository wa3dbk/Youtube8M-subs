00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:15.020
 U to introduce today 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:16.279
 The fate of the pancake lens is called the fs 13 days 2.8 stm 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.240
 It's three touches. 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:25.279
 Sexy salmon 14 I'm hot in November 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:30.560
 Price canister company 179,000 won Naver shopping authentic volume 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:34.879
 I think it's as big as the size of 9640 yen in Chilsan . 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.020
 This is the nickname Pancake Did I learn Ã‚ attached to one, compared with 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:41.570
 I'll see. 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:47.179
 This length of the phone in advance to 22.8 slept significantly also old and 100 won 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:51.740
 To promote the fact that I do not see it, I'm a little larger 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:57.630
 Still, I 'll take something compared to other lenses . 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:01:03.900
 Well, you might think it's a pretty small one. 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:05.700
 Besides, the weight is about 125 grams, of course. 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:12.840
 It's pretty light. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:15.780
 This is what I really mean that UV appeal if I am what you mean is that is 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.430
 Lighter and makes malindeyo yakgo 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.210
 If you look here, you've experienced a solid metal note, not plastic . 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.960
 Do you have written it seems stm indeyo stands expressionless settings 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.680
 It is a pillar lens with no lens-driven noise . 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.700
 I do not even have a sound . 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.960
 You can also focus on autofocus and manual focus. 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:45.060
 So here you see twice a crop body oil Do you only look subtitle is displayed indeyo 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:51.420
 I'll get it faster with the full plan card to help you understand seungpyo Mr. White Goods 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:55.380
 I try to guess Mr. but I can see you stop 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.680
 Please do not forget that you can not use it in the gear field. 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:04.500
 This time I'll bring the chrome buddy and compare it. 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.940
 2 Match the white mark with the certification mark and turn it so tightly. 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.319
 You can see 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:15.480
 So let 's use the lens as a real vehicle. 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:17.760
 Overall, the screen is well suppressed's foreign language and how to shoot more landscapes 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.990
 You were right. 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.870
 The gentle sprout that you want to use beautifully as a bibimbap that can be used next to soft portals 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:30.060
 John de can use this stamp . 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:36.599
 More due to the very short distance of about 16cm from the subject of the gas lens 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:39.900
 I'm looking to shoot a subject other then Harry also shot clean on the mum 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:45.329
 I can enjoy violent love. 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.170
 If you are a beginner of the picture, I think that it can be easily used together with the view 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:52.129
 It's possible 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.129
