00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello people zac with you today 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.990
 summarize our winter competition 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.269
 fan art sorry for taking so long 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.070
 we i just didn't expect communication with 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.590
 the managers of the steelseries hotel so 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.389
 for a long time next time I will write to them 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.250
 a little bit ahead of time and I hope waiting 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.699
 the end of our second competition will be 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.740

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.980
 participation 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.880
 I understand that it was necessary to choose everything 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.489
 only one job and art is always 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.629
 some subjective opinion is always 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.739
 some kind of subjectivism and choose 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.920
 definitely one straight best 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.180
 work is almost impossible and 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.590
 anyway someone will be offended 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.030

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.270
 different approaches to drawings there are different 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.040
 ways there are different drawing styles and 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.049

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.150
