00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:58.570
 I would ultimately So what say 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:01.180
 under the claim seth womack that 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.329
 extremely cool and there are already 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.280
 again has also need how long well 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.700
 Let's go then we have the project 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.950
 16 has 86 times ok not so good that we 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.950
 the pack will be translated 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.520
 okay there was the field already good 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:30.650
 I was looking forward to it and if 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:33.909
 I see that then I think so 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:38.240
 alone in front of the movements I would say 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.670
 normal and to and from the movement and 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:51.910
 just everything so far now everything 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:51.910
 was that because who is so sexy 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.920
 that's the perfect example for 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.730
 hacker aiming yes one is always beautiful 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.780
 over the head that one that the shots 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:12.860
 just turn things on your head 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:17.420
 Ask yourself then it has the obvious 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.640
 not learned that you learn in weapons 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.920
 fight training before getting the mid-engine 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.420
 athletes there is clearly you can 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.000
 I will give you here this line one 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.560
 stays standing again and that you always 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.120
 already has to pull it over the head 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.500
 so that the shots precisely on the head 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.440
 Okay, everything is ok 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.980
 possible 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:46.360
 soon it will be up and so on 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.360
 definitely purely okay because it is one of 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:58.010
 the round clearly china we erichsen 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.690
 all the person the this one 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.750
 Aspects of this class have been waiting for her 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.860
 definitely have your closeness here 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.300
 I thank you I spend here now 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.030
 the next five groups of my pc 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:20.080
 look around some player of the 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.080
 obviously tail to 25 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.360
 to 1 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.000
 there you come with happy 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:42.040
 very nice that millions have 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:46.340
 he is missing the car and bus or hahaha 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:50.780
 that was just this in his 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.170
 long or is long and there are 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.170
 two long 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.870
 i think people this is the first time 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.740
 that at the very end of this episode, something 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.730
 unbelievable what is just something here 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.410
 that has never been so since 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:17.850
 probably already know what I am 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:20.800
 but mine does not dissolve 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.020
 that is definitely reaction of the 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.770
 offender as soon as the enemy does not come 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.920
 shoot 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:34.150
 that would be too obvious so easy 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:36.040
 wait times or soon conclude by 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.650
 you can show how not to do that 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.150
 He has seen that through the wall 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.650
 everything just about his team it too 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.650
 show that he does not have 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.660
 everything is perfectly all wonderful one 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:59.180
 Praise for the player a praise many people 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.180
 The reporters are great 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.010
 double double and triple 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.520
 No, unfortunately not that would be too much of that 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.920
 have been good 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.860
 Now you just have to be a hacker 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.000
 you have to set limits yes 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.710
 one must not exceed 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.870
 otherwise something like this happens 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.150
 case here , the opponents have stopped 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.130
 set a little too little limits 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:32.600
 that's why this title is 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:39.600
 Pilots are already incredibly beautiful 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:44.930
 that is paprika can look at norbert 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.930
 Wolter 2 and the third 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:53.310
 one third can not be bad 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:57.420

00:05:53.310 --> 00:06:00.270
 format so first time here poste

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.999
 10 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:07.680
 while windows process was safe 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:07.680
