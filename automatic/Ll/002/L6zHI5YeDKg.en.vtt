 Hi my name is Claudia 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.480
 I dedicate myself to sum 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.799
 summit means 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:17.159
 It is a noble art 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.259
 and goes through lara 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.119
 Korea 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.329
 to Japan 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.329
 with mud 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.380
 has as 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.380
 has to do 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.860
 the shenzhen 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.550
 but how are we going to 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.480
 mulder if I do not know 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.480
 themselves if we do not know and we enter 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.550
 in which there are emotions 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.700
 turbid 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.200
 i could you do not see 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.010
 take your mind off those thoughts that are pulling us 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.140
 show what we are 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.360
 and that lies is one of the 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.130
 of the way 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.910
 I am going to propose to you we are going to be something simple something simple 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.020
 with a paper 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.660
 very simple white 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.110
 its empty space is the grand universe 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.440
 in which the plan because black or black based the plan 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.590
 let's put our 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.580
 this is a tape the di 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.760
 the traditional beach 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.730
 pregnant 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.070
 what is known as mo 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.299
 but let's do it with something that we have 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.530
 ease immediate access 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.400
 I'm going to wet McKinsey 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.590
 undergo 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.540
 I dry it because moisture is very important to know it controls 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.120
 if I do not control lumpini humidity 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.800
 percent bases 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.790
 that my painting 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.290
 have 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.510
 a lot of accidents 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.290
 that somehow they can take advantage but when they are too much 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.239
 Water 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.429
 it is no longer lost in 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.049
 a quality if it is not done 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.969
 already a question more p 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.039
 perfect for the Japanese 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:22.849
 I am going to be a 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.399
 managua dpa 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.379
 always controlled 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.449
 this is a gray baez 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.449
 deep 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:38.459
 i am looking for 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.459
 clarified 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.059
 the dry tip the thinnest 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.379
 lovely 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.009
 it's simple simple 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.009
 I do not know if it is so much that you will do 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:25.999
 the perfect 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:30.109
 This is a path that should be used in a step-by-step way so that the 

00:04:30.109 --> 00:04:32.069
 brush stroke every time 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.800
 more perfect 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.860
 I make a 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.919
 course 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.159
 not so much that the brushstroke is perfect is 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.339
 when you are more focused on yourself 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.069
 you brushstroke based on a reflection 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.430
 in Japanese it says cocorota brazil 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.770
 they are something like that for other 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.309

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.529
 I can not live 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:08.839
 by the way to the city of Mexico or the city of Toluca 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.719
 a point where a group of ten people meets 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.750
 He also drove groups around here in Cuernavaca and soon I will give a 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.939
 workshop 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.569

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.490
 it takes in to find 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.889
