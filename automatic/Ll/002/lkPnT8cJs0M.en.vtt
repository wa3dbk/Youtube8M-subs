00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.500 
with in design an experiment on how to
answer<00:01:50.160> that<00:01:50.310> question<00:01:50.460> think<00:01:51.150> you<00:01:51.210> know<00:01:51.360> we

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
answer that question think you know we

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.360 
answer that question think you know we
should<00:01:51.690> make<00:01:51.870> a<00:01:51.900> graph<00:01:52.290> listing<00:01:52.950> all<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.100> these

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
should make a graph listing all of these

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.710 
should make a graph listing all of these
properties<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.940> they<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.150> to<00:01:54.300> also<00:01:54.420> find

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
properties and they have to also find

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.720 
properties and they have to also find
the<00:01:54.900> formulas<00:01:55.440> that<00:01:55.680> support<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
the formulas that support the

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.430 
the formulas that support the
calculations<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.540> they<00:01:57.780> need<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.320> they

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
calculations that they need so that they

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.820 
calculations that they need so that they
can<00:01:58.620> come<00:01:58.830> up<00:01:59.010> with<00:01:59.250> the<00:02:00.000> appropriate<00:02:00.420> data

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
can come up with the appropriate data

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.490 
can come up with the appropriate data
it<00:02:02.430> takes<00:02:02.730> a<00:02:02.880> lot<00:02:03.090> yeah<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.930> takes<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.350> lot

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
it takes a lot yeah it takes a lot

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.230 
it takes a lot yeah it takes a lot
because<00:02:04.710> they<00:02:04.980> not<00:02:05.160> only<00:02:05.220> have<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.700> conduct

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
because they not only have to conduct

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.420 
because they not only have to conduct
the<00:02:06.390> experiment<00:02:06.840> that's<00:02:07.020> design<00:02:07.440> it<00:02:07.620> as<00:02:07.740> well

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
the experiment that's design it as well

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.330 
the experiment that's design it as well
we<00:02:08.759> think<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.270> managed<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.110> get<00:02:10.410> finished<00:02:11.160> all

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
we think we managed to get finished all

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.680 
we think we managed to get finished all
the<00:02:11.370> thing<00:02:11.610> with<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:11.940> about<00:02:12.180> five<00:02:12.420> minutes

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
the thing with like about five minutes

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.840 
the thing with like about five minutes
left<00:02:12.900> time<00:02:13.320> always<00:02:13.650> seems<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.250> be<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.550> short

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
about 50 minutes to be able to process

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.230 
about 50 minutes to be able to process
this<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.440> took<00:02:28.590> me<00:02:28.650> several<00:02:29.610> weeks<00:02:29.910> for

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
this and it took me several weeks for

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.380 
this and it took me several weeks for
together<00:02:30.830> so<00:02:31.830> um<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:32.940> going<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.150> be<00:02:33.240> really

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
together so um it's going to be really

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.630 
together so um it's going to be really
interesting<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:34.020> see<00:02:34.290> how<00:02:34.470> far<00:02:34.500> they<00:02:35.130> get<00:02:35.370> and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
interesting to see how far they get and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.740 
interesting to see how far they get and
if<00:02:35.880> they<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.210> make<00:02:36.390> some<00:02:36.570> positive

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
in the preparation has to be hands-on so

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.600 
in the preparation has to be hands-on so

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.660 
from having to to research and learn
about<00:03:31.350> rocks<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.890> minerals<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.400> being<00:03:32.580> able

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
about rocks and minerals and being able

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
to see them themselves and classify them

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.430 
to see them themselves and classify them
to<00:03:35.130> having<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.120> build<00:03:36.300> their<00:03:36.540> own<00:03:36.570> tower<00:03:36.959> where

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
to having to build their own tower where

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.199 
to having to build their own tower where
they<00:03:37.590> have<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:37.950> find<00:03:38.160> out<00:03:38.310> what<00:03:38.580> what<00:03:38.880> makes<00:03:39.090> a

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
they have to find out what what makes a

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.759 
they have to find out what what makes a
good<00:03:39.360> tower<00:03:39.600> so<00:03:39.900> they<00:03:40.019> begin<00:03:40.350> with<00:03:40.410> some

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
good tower so they begin with some

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.440 
good tower so they begin with some
research<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.430> then<00:03:41.850> they<00:03:41.970> have<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.209> get<00:03:42.330> the

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
research and then they have to get the

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.910 
research and then they have to get the
materials<00:03:42.930> after<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.230> actually<00:03:43.560> build<00:03:43.709> it

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
materials after to actually build it

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.860 
materials after to actually build it
they<00:03:44.040> have<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.370> test<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.790> it's<00:03:44.970> real<00:03:45.360> life

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
they have to test it it's real life

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.100 
they have to test it it's real life
inquiry<00:03:46.800> type<00:03:47.070> science<00:03:47.630> trial<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:48.780> error<00:03:48.930> if

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
inquiry type science trial and error if

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.330 
inquiry type science trial and error if
it<00:03:49.200> doesn't<00:03:49.440> work<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.650> first<00:03:49.680> time<00:03:49.950> they've

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
it doesn't work the first time they've

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.770 
it doesn't work the first time they've
to<00:03:50.430> go<00:03:50.519> back<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:50.850> figure<00:03:50.970> out<00:03:51.120> what<00:03:51.269> it<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:51.570> and

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
to go back and figure out what it is and

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.509 
to go back and figure out what it is and
in<00:03:52.260> doing<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.709> they're<00:03:52.860> also<00:03:53.010> working<00:03:53.220> with<00:03:53.459> a

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
in doing it they're also working with a

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.729 
in doing it they're also working with a
partner<00:03:53.730> which<00:03:54.150> is<00:03:54.330> very<00:03:54.390> real<00:03:54.900> world<00:03:55.170> when

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
partner which is very real world when

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.120 
partner which is very real world when
they<00:03:55.920> get<00:03:56.130> out<00:03:56.340> into<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:57.239> real<00:03:57.480> world<00:03:58.070> out<00:03:59.070> of

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
they get out into the real world out of

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.890 
they get out into the real world out of
school<00:03:59.700> that<00:04:00.180> they're<00:04:00.420> going<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.570> work<00:04:00.750> in
