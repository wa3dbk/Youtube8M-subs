a lot of Curly's and naturals come and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.910 
a lot of Curly's and naturals come and
do<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.449> now<00:00:24.630> long<00:00:25.050> as<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> proper

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.060 
doing I think it's a good route to go
because<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.660> don't<00:00:33.660> go<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.350> hair<00:00:34.649> salon<00:00:34.680> to

old<00:01:43.020> hair<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:43.409> well<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.040> about<00:01:44.540> it's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
about maybe four or five days old so the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.899 
about maybe four or five days old so the

can see have it all forward in two parts

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.750 
can see have it all forward in two parts
and<00:02:22.220> just<00:02:23.090> make<00:02:23.300> sure<00:02:23.600> it's<00:02:23.900> even<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.890> parted<00:02:25.580> in

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
and just make sure it's even I parted in

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.370 
and just make sure it's even I parted in
the<00:02:25.880> middle<00:02:26.209> just<00:02:26.360> because<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.720> do<00:02:26.900> I'm

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
the middle just because I do I'm

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.590 
the middle just because I do I'm
starting<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.800> like<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.220> middle<00:02:28.520> part<00:02:28.760> but<00:02:29.570> I

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
starting to like that middle part but I

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.690 
starting to like that middle part but I
usually<00:02:30.140> have<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.380> kind<00:02:30.680> of<00:02:30.800> in<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.040> side<00:02:31.310> part

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
usually have it kind of in a side part

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.330 
usually have it kind of in a side part
as<00:02:31.820> well<00:02:32.060> but<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:32.720> think<00:02:32.959> it'll<00:02:33.110> work<00:02:33.230> just<00:02:33.410> just

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
as well but I think it'll work just just

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.960 
as well but I think it'll work just just
it's<00:02:34.489> fine

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
it's fine

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.820 
it's fine
what<00:02:35.209> I'm<00:02:35.300> looking<00:02:35.420> for<00:02:35.810> like<00:02:36.020> I<00:02:36.050> said<00:02:36.200> are

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
what I'm looking for like I said are

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.250 
what I'm looking for like I said are
four<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.459> those<00:02:37.550> dead<00:02:37.910> pieces<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.050> you're

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
four of those dead pieces so you're

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.500 
four of those dead pieces so you're
probably<00:02:39.500> it's<00:02:39.980> gonna<00:02:40.100> take<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.489> long<00:02:40.820> private

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
probably it's gonna take a long private

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.479 
probably it's gonna take a long private
longer<00:02:42.020> time<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.650> regular<00:02:42.980> cut<00:02:43.310> just

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
longer time in a regular cut just

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.550 
longer time in a regular cut just
because<00:02:43.760> you're<00:02:43.970> going<00:02:44.209> through<00:02:44.330> your<00:02:45.200> hair

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
the hair so I'm taking the say for

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:48.260 
the hair so I'm taking the say for
example<00:03:40.200> this<00:03:40.320> one<00:03:42.290> going<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.620> ends<00:03:47.270> and

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
example this one going to it ends and

00:03:48.270 --> 00:04:01.839 
example this one going to it ends and
thinking<00:03:48.690> now

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.020 

and<00:04:02.689> because<00:04:03.109> I<00:04:03.230> have<00:04:03.409> curly<00:04:03.709> hair<00:04:03.890> it's<00:04:04.879> not

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
and because I have curly hair it's not

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.809 
and because I have curly hair it's not
like<00:04:05.480> as<00:04:05.780> precise<00:04:06.439> as<00:04:06.769> if<00:04:06.920> I<00:04:07.099> had<00:04:07.340> straight

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.110 
like as precise as if I had straight
hair<00:04:07.879> so<00:04:08.780> I'm<00:04:09.019> not<00:04:09.200> really<00:04:09.379> scared<00:04:09.920> about

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.699 
hair so I'm not really scared about
different<00:04:11.120> lengths<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:11.689> stuff<00:04:11.959> because<00:04:12.230> as

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
different lengths and stuff because as

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.160 
different lengths and stuff because as

long as it's like Tibet I it looks even
I'm<00:04:16.039> not<00:04:16.310> worried<00:04:16.699> about<00:04:16.789> like<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:17.539> know<00:04:17.690> if
