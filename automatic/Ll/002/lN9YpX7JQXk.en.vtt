Greek exit would cost the eurozone about
250<00:02:48.840> billion<00:02:49.200> euros<00:02:50.190> but<00:02:50.990> providing<00:02:51.990> greece

with a 50-percent haircut on its debt
would<00:02:55.860> cost<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.490> creditors<00:02:56.940> only<00:02:57.210> about<00:02:57.390> half

that about a hundred and twenty billion
so<00:03:00.810> my<00:03:01.350> latest<00:03:01.950> sense<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:03.440> Gallo<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.800> well<00:03:05.040> tied

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
so my latest sense is Gallo is well tied

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.710

eurozone needs Greece in order to
survive<00:03:44.130> just<00:03:44.820> as<00:03:44.970> much<00:03:45.150> as<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.510> Greeks<00:03:45.750> need

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
survive just as much as the Greeks need

that's<00:03:49.500> from<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.010> eurozone<00:03:50.220> perspective<00:03:51.150> in

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
that's from the eurozone perspective in

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.830 
that's from the eurozone perspective in
my<00:03:51.480> in<00:03:51.900> my<00:03:51.980> estimate<00:03:52.980> Greece<00:03:53.610> has<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.240> exit<00:03:54.720> the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
my in my estimate Greece has to exit the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.360 
my in my estimate Greece has to exit the
eurozone<00:03:55.140> at<00:03:55.500> some<00:03:55.740> point<00:03:56.100> or<00:03:56.310> another

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
eurozone at some point or another

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.410 
eurozone at some point or another
because<00:03:57.180> they<00:03:57.630> they<00:03:57.990> will<00:03:58.200> never<00:03:58.530> learn<00:03:59.420> the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
because they they will never learn the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.940 
because they they will never learn the
necessary<00:04:02.060> austerity<00:04:03.060> by<00:04:03.810> having<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.440> imposed

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
necessary austerity by having it imposed

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.120 
necessary austerity by having it imposed
on<00:04:05.310> them<00:04:05.760> they<00:04:06.210> have<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.840> be<00:04:07.590> put<00:04:07.920> in<00:04:08.040> a

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
on them they have to be put in a

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
on them they have to be put in a
position<00:04:08.160> where<00:04:08.640> their<00:04:09.030> nation<00:04:09.480> can<00:04:09.810> fail<00:04:10.200> and

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
position where their nation can fail and

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.060 
position where their nation can fail and
so<00:04:12.150> but<00:04:12.390> really<00:04:12.450> going<00:04:13.230> out<00:04:13.380> getting<00:04:13.650> off<00:04:13.890> the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
so but really going out getting off the

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.350 
so but really going out getting off the
euro<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.430> going<00:04:14.640> back<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.060> drachma

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
euro and going back to the drachma

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.229 
euro and going back to the drachma
having<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.930> drachma<00:04:16.400> go<00:04:17.400> way<00:04:17.609> down<00:04:17.790> in<00:04:18.090> value

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
having the drachma go way down in value

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.050 
having the drachma go way down in value
is<00:04:18.690> really<00:04:19.080> not<00:04:19.230> that<00:04:19.440> bad<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:20.130> thing<00:04:20.489> because

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
is really not that bad a thing because

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.180 
is really not that bad a thing because
of<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.600> results<00:04:22.440> for<00:04:22.620> example<00:04:23.040> would<00:04:23.130> be

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
of the results for example would be

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.330 
of the results for example would be
Greece<00:04:23.970> would<00:04:24.180> no<00:04:24.420> longer<00:04:24.690> be<00:04:24.930> able<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.560> import

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
Greece would no longer be able to import

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.760 
Greece would no longer be able to import
so<00:04:26.580> many<00:04:26.730> BMWs<00:04:27.480> from<00:04:27.720> Germany<00:04:28.200> they'd<00:04:28.410> have<00:04:28.620> to

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
so many BMWs from Germany they'd have to

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.070 
so many BMWs from Germany they'd have to
start<00:04:29.070> manufacturing<00:04:29.760> most<00:04:30.480> of<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.840> goods

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
start manufacturing most of the goods

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.120 
start manufacturing most of the goods
that<00:04:31.410> they<00:04:31.440> use<00:04:32.190> on<00:04:32.730> a<00:04:32.790> daily<00:04:33.479> basis

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
that they use on a daily basis

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.560 
that they use on a daily basis
internally<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.760> believe<00:04:36.090> if<00:04:36.270> Greece

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
internally and I believe if Greece

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.540 
internally and I believe if Greece
withdrew<00:04:37.260> from<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.530> euro<00:04:37.830> with

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
withdrew from the euro with
