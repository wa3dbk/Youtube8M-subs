00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.120
The wolf drifting effortlessly
Silently watching absorbing everything calmly

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.960
Strides with a purpose and acts elegantly
Can't be caged

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.699
Let him roam free
let him be

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.760
Who he wants to be
Free him from this society

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.260
That's had him domesticated with chains around
his neck

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.879
The wolf is trapped
The wolf is depressed

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.300
can't you see the pain
That resonates in his eyes

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.000
Cant you feel the longing
Drawn out in his sighs

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.680
Can't you hear the distress in his silent
cries

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.830
The wolf howls and the wolf tries
Despite it all he's silent cuz he can't speak

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.380
his mind
Even if he's surrounded by his own kind

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.880
There's no sign of the shine diminished by
the time spent locked in his mind.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.600
Cuz the wolf feels the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.000
Isolation of elation promoting the migration
in hopes of quenching the starvation through

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.500
this lyrical narration
of expression and frustration not for the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.000
admiration its for the mental rehydration
and search of any sensation

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
An escape from the damnation.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The wolf walks alone
At home and comfortable in his zone

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.400
And as he is on his own he's

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.460
Roaming around aimlessly
From the mountains to the seas

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.220
Making passes through the trees
The lone wolf walks privately

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.720
Behind the facade a deceptively dynamic life
form

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.000
Taking soft steps while inside rages the brainstorm
Walk away, let it go, and alienate from the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.500
swarm
A million thoughts on his mind how can he

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.000
hope to inform

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Locked away inside the cage are secrets that
he won't share

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.020
Cuz the others out there
Really don't care

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.340
So with his eyes he pierces their soul a cold
stare

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.270
In the hopes of communicating the despair

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.620
The saddest part to the wolf is that they
won't know

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.000
The reason for his state of mind being like
the cold snow

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Fluffy, white, and nice at sight but colder
than an ice flow

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.250
So he fights it with apathy, he decides to
let go

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.420
So he searches for comfort
Within the winds breeze

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.940
But the wind is cold and makes his bones freeze

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.350
He searches for comfort
Within the sun's rays

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.470
But the sun beats back and puts him in a daze

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.760
He searches for comfort
Within the cool sea

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.700
But the sea rejects him and acts salty

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.890
He searches for comfort
In the grand mountain range

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.490
But they just echo back what he has to say,
he's feeling estranged.
