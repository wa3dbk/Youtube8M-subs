keep<00:00:04.110> ever<00:00:04.380> this<00:00:05.100> is<00:00:05.339> my<00:00:05.609> gaming<00:00:06.540> one<00:00:06.810> at<00:00:06.930> our

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
keep ever this is my gaming one at our

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.390 
keep ever this is my gaming one at our
the<00:00:07.259> Asus<00:00:07.680> VW<00:00:08.370> 2<00:00:08.760> 4<00:00:08.970> 6<00:00:09.150> H<00:00:10.460> HDMI<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.880> 23<00:00:12.780> 4<00:00:12.960> and

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
the Asus VW 2 4 6 H HDMI in 23 4 and

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.240 
the Asus VW 2 4 6 H HDMI in 23 4 and
this<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.580> my<00:00:14.759> dell<00:00:15.570> mini<00:00:15.740> now<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.770> thought<00:00:17.130> I'd

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
this is my dell mini now I thought I'd

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.200 
this is my dell mini now I thought I'd
do<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.400> lag<00:00:17.640> test<00:00:18.439> to<00:00:19.439> see<00:00:19.640> what<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.789> comes<00:00:20.970> up

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
do a lag test to see what it comes up

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.130 
do a lag test to see what it comes up
like<00:00:21.390> now<00:00:21.720> basically<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.289> way<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.439> works<00:00:22.769> is

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
like now basically the way this works is

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.560 
like now basically the way this works is
you<00:00:25.140> run<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.560> timer<00:00:26.029> as<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.119> can<00:00:27.269> see<00:00:27.390> that

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
you run this timer as you can see that

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.060 
you run this timer as you can see that
about<00:00:27.779> displaying<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.380> same<00:00:28.590> screen

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
about displaying the same screen

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.659 
about displaying the same screen
you<00:00:29.400> run<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.730> timeout<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.269> both<00:00:30.449> screens<00:00:30.810> and

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
you run this timeout on both screens and

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.090 
you run this timeout on both screens and
basically<00:00:32.669> pause<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.450> video<00:00:33.829> after<00:00:34.829> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
basically pause the video after a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.350 
basically pause the video after a
certain<00:00:35.340> intervals<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.180> see<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:38.059> this<00:00:39.059> part

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
certain intervals to see if this part

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.680 
certain intervals to see if this part
and<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:40.140> part<00:00:40.200> correspond<00:00:41.149> or<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.360> see<00:00:42.510> how

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
and this part correspond or to see how

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.869 
and this part correspond or to see how
much<00:00:42.840> leg<00:00:43.140> they<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.460> I'm<00:00:44.550> basically

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
much leg they have so I'm basically

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.119 
much leg they have so I'm basically
going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.149> let<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.329> run<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.539> two<00:00:45.809> minutes

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
going to let this run for two minutes

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.830 
going to let this run for two minutes
just<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.820> give<00:00:48.090> anyone<00:00:48.390> interested<00:00:48.780> in

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
just to give anyone interested in

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.569 
just to give anyone interested in
purchasing<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.629> an<00:00:51.629> idea<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.579> how

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
purchasing and one it's a an idea of how

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.160 
purchasing and one it's a an idea of how
much<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.149> has<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:54.989> wondering

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
much like it has what I'm wondering

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.520 
much like it has what I'm wondering
though<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:56.239> if<00:00:57.239> any<00:00:57.600> lag<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.020> actually<00:00:58.289> caused

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
though is if any lag is actually caused

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.709 
though is if any lag is actually caused
by<00:00:58.559> the<00:01:00.199> actual<00:01:01.670> socket<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.940> HDMI<00:01:03.329> socket<00:01:03.629> on

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
by the actual socket that HDMI socket on

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.450 
by the actual socket that HDMI socket on
the<00:01:03.780> laptop<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.010> laptop<00:01:05.339> can

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
the laptop or if the laptop can

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.160 
the laptop or if the laptop can
introduce<00:01:05.790> any<00:01:06.090> lag<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:07.640> purely<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
introduce any lag or is it just purely a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.520 
introduce any lag or is it just purely a
good<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.350> test<00:01:10.619> we'll<00:01:10.860> find<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:12.350> maybe<00:01:13.350> we

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
good like test we'll find out maybe we

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.320 
good like test we'll find out maybe we
weren't<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:13.979> anyway<00:01:14.220> two-minute<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:14.970> test

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
weren't but anyway two-minute like test

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.530 
weren't but anyway two-minute like test
so<00:01:16.430> probably<00:01:17.430> pause<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.909> closer<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> end

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
so probably pause it closer to the end

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.020 
so probably pause it closer to the end
of<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> video<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.259> see<00:01:20.189> how<00:01:20.400> far<00:01:20.640> away<00:01:20.790> they

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
of the video and see how far away they

00:01:21.030 --> 00:02:12.550 
of the video and see how far away they
are<00:01:21.060> from<00:01:21.180> each<00:01:21.390> other

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.230 

if<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.190> want<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.430> get<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.700> software<00:02:14.000> by<00:02:14.180> the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
if you want to get the software by the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.990 
if you want to get the software by the
way<00:02:14.420> just<00:02:14.690> Google<00:02:17.350> monitor<00:02:18.350> lag<00:02:18.530> test<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:19.190> think

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
way just Google monitor lag test I think

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:36.000 
way just Google monitor lag test I think
it's<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.180> first<00:02:20.420> link<00:02:26.709> this<00:02:27.709> is<00:02:28.069> delicious

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.930 

I'm<00:02:37.010> not<00:02:37.220> sure<00:02:37.310> how<00:02:37.430> long<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:37.640> should<00:02:37.670> let<00:02:37.850> this

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
I'm not sure how long I should let this

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.660 
I'm not sure how long I should let this
go<00:02:38.090> on<00:02:38.209> for<00:02:39.880> two<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.000> half<00:02:41.090> minutes<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:42.670> don't

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
go on for two and a half minutes I don't

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.040 
go on for two and a half minutes I don't
think<00:02:43.850> it's<00:02:44.000> relevant<00:02:44.270> when<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.600> get<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.870> like

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
think it's relevant when you get to like

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.400 
think it's relevant when you get to like
ten<00:02:45.260> minutes<00:02:45.560> or<00:02:45.680> five<00:02:45.920> minutes<00:02:45.950> really
