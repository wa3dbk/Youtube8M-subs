00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello my friend flavio simonetti here 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.660
 This video is about vacation 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.350
 good or not you can get that 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.030
 save money 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.849
 with me it's like that every year 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.349
 Holiday yeast several weeks on the one hand 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.790
 basically because i print here in cala 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.369
 Here's a little insight 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.590
 here around the corner quite simple 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.460
 cheap cheap village has been around 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.789
 400 years 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.109
 My father has such a small one 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.970
 You can see a little house here but 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.630
 nothing earth-shattering quite easy 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.279
 also built very very easy for them 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.320
 you get so super cheap in villages 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.410
 So I believe my father at that time 8000 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.899
 Teachers paid that are 8000 mark 4000 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.969
 euro was run down and 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.270
 that's why we have this little one 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.450
 cottage with about 14 2 rooms and 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.129
 At that time he had his own kitchen 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.440
 parents, so to speak, and his 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.449
 Siblings paid off what to say 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.260
 I want to be very cheap 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.239
 accommodation for payments flight and den 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.039
 flight and food and when I go to more than 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.149
 20 kilometers that means he gets 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.220
 relatively cheap way 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.270
 and that's why it's never one for me 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.310
 alternative 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.900
 The only disadvantage I have on vacation 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.970
 It is very natural that it costs money 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.010
 to the left is at home in comparison 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.380
 what advantage does it have that I vacation 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.810
 First and foremost I have to get away from it 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.310
 come home that means I 'll get something 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.869
 other when I'm at home then 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.360
 I get my regular computer 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.009
 one still has my everyday life 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.960
 I still have to deal with stress 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.659
 on vacation when I'm on vacation 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.790
 then I can not do the things 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.860
 repair those incurred and so on 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.320
 and so I have a really good one 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.090
 holiday is not for me that change 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.710
 I go somewhere and from early till 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.960
 evening party makes me with alcohol 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.310
 full vacation is for me if I am 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.299
 go somewhere where I'm so kind 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.600
 can relax 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.770
 I'm a guy and I'll tell if 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.200
 I make vacation then I want too 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.460
 something about 10 against that is me 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.380
 go through the area for a while 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.740
 Let's look at all the stuff around too 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.950
 to catch something cultural and 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.110
 That's why I think it's important something 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.369
 distance to the whole and in the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.250
 holiday power I think is also quite 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.560
 important that you have at least a minimum of ten 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.170
 days makes you because one too short 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.760
 can make holidays you do not get down 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.920
 I notice that I'm about 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.330
 one and a half to two weeks needs around 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.640
 to really get down to 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.050
 forget everyday stress and that is 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.330
 very important I win a new one 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.030
 Perspective when I'm on vacation 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.890
 that is, I think about my whole 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.600
 situation in life where I am at the moment 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.940
 what I'm doing if I keep going 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.069
 want what I'm doing and that's 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.750
 very important because I think so 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.910
 we always move in circles only when 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.380
 We are always at home and working 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.180
 work and maybe holiday home 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.560
 then I do not get a new one 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.660
 Perspective and I believe many people 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.209
 make a profession of today 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.700
 not quite fit with them that is 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.019
 For example, they make a layer 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.970
 show the whole life long 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.680
 At some point I want to stop with but on 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.180
 they still have the end of life 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.010
 Keep it up there because it's easy 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.560
 habit was and I come here in 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.660
 vacation time and again read a lot 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.549
 books now have five books here 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.590
 vacation taken really nice 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.450
 to come down to another 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.890
 to get perspective then I am 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.410
 here in the evening also with friends on the way 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.769
 and that is something completely different 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.989
 I recommend everyone at least everyone 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.090
 to put away coal once a month 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.130
 year for at least ten days on vacation 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.170
 to go down to really nice 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.150
 come and you will notice it has so 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.859
 a massive value that you can 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.760
 with the euros thilo on vacation 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.230
 You have not invested at all 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.670
 so , if they all count towards me 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.079
 says I have the possibility to me only 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.470
 to buy a tv or vacation too 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.790
 go 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.530
 then I do not even think about it myself 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.200
 I want to buy a new TV 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.850
 rather go on vacation because vacation says 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.350
 yes that 's a huge difference 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.180
 you will come back as another person 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.250
 if you have a really good relaxed 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.660
 holiday fits so if you really nice 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.180
 comes down when you are with yourself 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.709
 if you think about it like that 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.420
 my current situation what do I want 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.030
 I'm happy with that 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.280
 Just let me question it completely 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.420
 that is only on vacation outside of the 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.079
 own four walls 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.000
 Best of all and I would 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.500
 never exchange that for money 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.829
 I once a year at least 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.689
 vacation because people are never in 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.080
 Holiday are the burn out sometime 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:25.720
 They are exposed to stress forever 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.069
 that is my opinion on the subject me 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.300
 would be interested in what you say 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:31.000
 Schreip is just under the 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.039
 comments give the video a like and 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.099
 Share it with your friends when you come 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.110
 hate who is not ready on vacation 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:42.030
 So go ahead and take care of yourself 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.030
 video your flavio simonetti 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.680
 times
