followed and potential litigation I

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.719 
followed and potential litigation I
think<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> best<00:01:55.380> way<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.710> do<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.189> actually

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
think the best way to do that actually

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.760 
think the best way to do that actually
is<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.090> anticipate<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.350> kinds<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.710> things

is to anticipate the kinds of things

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
that you think they happen and then try

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.660 
that you think they happen and then try
to<00:02:00.869> reduce<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.500> possibility<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.490> much

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
to reduce the possibility of it as much

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.090 
to reduce the possibility of it as much
as<00:02:02.820> possible<00:02:03.290> for<00:02:04.290> instance<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.920> have
