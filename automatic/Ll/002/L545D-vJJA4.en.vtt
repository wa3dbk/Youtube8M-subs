all<00:00:04.259> right<00:00:04.680> you<00:00:05.069> got<00:00:05.190> almost<00:00:05.460> four<00:00:06.000> minutes<00:00:06.330> to

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
all right you got almost four minutes to

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.280 
all right you got almost four minutes to
kill<00:00:07.490> watching<00:00:08.490> this<00:00:08.730> track<00:00:09.090> go<00:00:09.480> backwards

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.499 

although<00:00:13.290> oddly<00:00:13.559> enough<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.549> seems<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.420> go

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
although oddly enough it seems to go

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.950 
although oddly enough it seems to go
faster<00:00:16.320> backwards<00:00:16.980> than<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.340> does<00:00:17.520> for<00:00:18.000> words

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.040 

yeah<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:23.269> you<00:00:24.269> would<00:00:24.390> think<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.019> would

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
yeah and you would think that it would

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.560 
yeah and you would think that it would
be<00:00:25.289> easier<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.980> dodge<00:00:26.250> those<00:00:26.670> chain<00:00:27.060> chomps

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
be easier to dodge those chain chomps

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.530 
be easier to dodge those chain chomps
while<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:28.199> forward<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:31.700> they're<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:33.300> well

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
while going forward and they're not well

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.360 
while going forward and they're not well
going<00:00:33.750> forward<00:00:34.079> if<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.620> was<00:00:34.770> going<00:00:34.950> forward

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
going forward if I was going forward

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.639 
going forward if I was going forward
than<00:00:35.760> lake<00:00:36.030> there<00:00:37.610> laddie<00:00:38.610> coup<00:00:38.940> or<00:00:39.649> that's

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
than lake there laddie coup or that's

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
not writing like you do would be a not

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.380 
not writing like you do would be a not

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
flying above me holding a sign with

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.020 
flying above me holding a sign with
reverse<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.260> what<00:00:49.559> looks<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.219> be<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.550> he's

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
reverse and what looks to be like he's

negative comments concerning this

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.660 
negative comments concerning this
because<00:01:19.210> i<00:01:19.810> was<00:01:20.380> recording<00:01:20.710> with<00:01:21.100> essentially

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
because i was recording with essentially

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.430 
because i was recording with essentially
the<00:01:21.790> same<00:01:21.970> thing<00:01:22.030> as<00:01:22.360> playstation<00:01:22.990> controller

or an equivalent roller to it and that's

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.120

the<00:02:07.230> part<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.800> suggest<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.340> keeping<00:02:08.820> all

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
the part that I suggest you keeping all

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.390 
the part that I suggest you keeping all
of<00:02:09.060> your<00:02:09.210> mushrooms<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.259> they<00:02:10.649> seem<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.280> make

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
of your mushrooms for they seem to make

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.500 
of your mushrooms for they seem to make
it<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.670> little<00:02:11.850> easier<00:02:13.100> gosh<00:02:14.100> make<00:02:14.610> my<00:02:14.820> forearm

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
it a little easier gosh make my forearm

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.070 
it a little easier gosh make my forearm
sore<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:16.170> watching<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:20.690> yeah<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.720> actually

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
sore just watching it yeah I actually

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.890 
sore just watching it yeah I actually
pause<00:02:22.740> during<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.430> recording<00:02:23.850> just<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:24.870> that

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
pause during the recording just so that

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.850 
pause during the recording just so that
I<00:02:25.080> can<00:02:25.200> take<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.590> little<00:02:25.800> bit<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.250> break<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:28.560> is

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
I can take a little bit of a break it is

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.170 
I can take a little bit of a break it is
that<00:02:29.280> hard<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.940> get<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.709> slope<00:02:35.180> although

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
that hard to get a the slope although

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.390 
that hard to get a the slope although
interestingly<00:02:36.510> enough<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.380> doesn't<00:02:37.890> count

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
interestingly enough it doesn't count

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.030 
interestingly enough it doesn't count
this<00:02:38.880> as<00:02:40.550> like<00:02:41.600> vertical<00:02:42.600> cliff<00:02:43.050> or<00:02:43.350> driving

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
this as like vertical cliff or driving

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.610 
this as like vertical cliff or driving
into<00:02:44.490> a<00:02:44.520> wall<00:02:44.970> or<00:02:45.390> steep<00:02:46.050> slope<00:02:48.200> territory<00:02:49.200> so

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
into a wall or steep slope territory so

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.130 
into a wall or steep slope territory so
you<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.310> actually<00:02:50.459> drive<00:02:51.120> up<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:51.990> just

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
you can actually drive up it you just

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.240 
you can actually drive up it you just
need<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.530> bounce<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:53.280> lot<00:02:53.760> or<00:02:54.450> otherwise

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
need to bounce a lot or otherwise

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.670 
need to bounce a lot or otherwise
that'll<00:02:56.250> happen<00:02:56.430> you'll<00:02:57.180> slide<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.560> you'll

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
that'll happen you'll slide and you'll

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.740 
that'll happen you'll slide and you'll
be<00:02:58.860> wanting<00:02:59.220> deposit<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.390> can<00:03:00.540> take<00:03:00.720> a

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
be wanting deposit so you can take a

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.479 
be wanting deposit so you can take a
little<00:03:00.930> bit<00:03:01.110> of<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.320> break<00:03:03.500> but<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:05.160> didn't

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
little bit of a break but that didn't

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.430 
little bit of a break but that didn't
seem<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.700> work<00:03:05.850> very<00:03:06.000> well<00:03:06.360> for<00:03:06.690> me<00:03:06.930> because<00:03:07.260> I

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
seem to work very well for me because I

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.820 
seem to work very well for me because I
slid<00:03:07.739> down<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.010> few<00:03:08.400> color<00:03:09.560> bars<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.980> guess
