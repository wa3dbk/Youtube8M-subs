here<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.650> situation<00:02:40.950> where<00:02:41.780> we've<00:02:42.780> won<00:02:42.959> down

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
here is a situation where we've won down

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.620 
here is a situation where we've won down
in<00:02:43.709> their<00:02:43.890> head<00:02:44.070> we've<00:02:44.880> got<00:02:45.030> one<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.269> our<00:02:45.329> bowls

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
in their head we've got one of our bowls

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.170 
in their head we've got one of our bowls
on<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> way<00:02:46.049> in<00:02:46.519> three<00:02:47.519> bowls<00:02:47.760> sitting<00:02:48.060> there

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
on the way in three bowls sitting there

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.900 
on the way in three bowls sitting there
catching<00:02:48.390> waiting<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.220> what<00:02:50.220> I'd<00:02:50.340> call<00:02:50.609> mark

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
catching waiting so what I'd call mark

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.680 
catching waiting so what I'd call mark
is<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.239> come<00:02:51.450> down<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:52.350> over<00:02:52.500> over<00:02:53.010> draw<00:02:53.220> away

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
is to come down just over over draw away

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.259 
is to come down just over over draw away
promoting<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.230> ideally<00:02:55.739> underneath

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
promoting that that ideally underneath

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.840 
promoting that that ideally underneath
to<00:02:57.269> try<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.600> fail<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.930> jack<00:02:58.579> through<00:02:59.579> to<00:02:59.670> our

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
to try and fail the jack through to our

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.600 
to try and fail the jack through to our
bowls

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.280 

so<00:03:05.610> obviously<00:03:05.849> here's<00:03:06.120> our<00:03:06.330> head<00:03:06.569> at<00:03:07.200> the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
so obviously here's our head at the

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.440 
so obviously here's our head at the
moment<00:03:07.560> we're<00:03:07.650> holding<00:03:07.920> shot<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:09.000> blue<00:03:09.150> team

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
moment we're holding shot the blue team

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.479 
moment we're holding shot the blue team
the<00:03:09.690> opposition<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.680> second<00:03:11.040> shot<00:03:11.250> and

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
the opposition to a second shot and

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.630 
the opposition to a second shot and
we've<00:03:11.790> got<00:03:12.140> four<00:03:13.140> third<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:13.680> ideally<00:03:14.130> I'd<00:03:14.340> call

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
we've got four third so ideally I'd call

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.449 
we've got four third so ideally I'd call
Aaron<00:03:15.060> on<00:03:15.750> his<00:03:15.870> forehand<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.739> replace<00:03:17.220> that

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
Aaron on his forehand to replace that

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.500 
Aaron on his forehand to replace that
ball<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:19.470> give<00:03:19.680> us<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.890> maximum<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.760> six<00:03:21.360> shots
