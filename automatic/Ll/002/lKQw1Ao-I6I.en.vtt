00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.069
 then today we do the tigelle thing 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.899
 are the tigelle for those who are not 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.600
 emilian the tigelle are some bread 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.330
 rounds are normally characterized by 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.870
 I'll have a flower on it . I'll also explain 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.269
 after why stuffed ones are eaten 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.339
 with cheeses salami normally together 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.570
 at the crescentine we make you but today 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:26.689
 let's pan-fry 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.689
 so without calliera ciao 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:40.540
 same joke here takes me yes bye bye 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.860
 but a jump from less flour the baking powder 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.110
 yeast you can use brewer's yeast 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.670
 the cube or I took the sachet 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.100
 of dry yeast simply because 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.809
 it lasts longer and so I use this milk 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.090
 double zero sugar and salt flour 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.910
 I add the yeast considered one 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.620
 leavening for about two hours 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.809
 ok to activate this yeast must 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.420
 put the sugar then add 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.780
 immediately two small teaspoons of sugar 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.540
 and then we obviously put salt milk 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.550
 let's get started in passing the dough 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.060
 the best ones come anyway with their hands 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.930
 so let's do with the car 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.300
 add about 3 tablespoons of oil 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.270
 ready to serve I put it to rise for 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.940
 about two hours covered and then we have it 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.200
 made to leaven before I told you two 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.810
 hours 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.310
 actually basic at least an hour 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.579
 we leavened an hour and a half 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.229
 we go and get a piece of the dough 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.119
 and rest you can also cover leave 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.880
 raise the genres and we must go to 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.310
 then appears with a pastry cutter we go 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.110
 to form their own first shots 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.240
 what are we going to roll out the dough then 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.549
 we will not roll it out too much 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.789
 thin considered a thickness of 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.799
 about 1 cm because then the tigella when 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.570
 it is in slight cooking from yeast also a 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.920
 quite a bit this size is fine this 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.920
 thick then we go to steal 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.789
 and this is the disk that will become 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.140
 after our tigella know what I do 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.510
 now I have been able to do so after 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.470
 we all do directly in the pan e 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.110
 then we eat them 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.420
 then the tigelle are already made cup 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.760
 you then the dough worried pan 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.820
 non-stick possibly as wide as in 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.830
 this case so we put more 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.420
 normally it can be in the on-border tg 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.010
 not having it because it 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.600
 therefore in induction it does not work 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.220
 this thing also recommended to everyone 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.720
 those who not only do not have the pija 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.300
 liera because it is not found except in 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.980
 emilia actually for sale you can 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.680
 do it safely at home with one 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.690
 good non-stick pan we said 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.900
 then it would take heat even above 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.070
 so instead of using the lid 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.380
 exactly the same size as us 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.269
 let's use a little bit smaller like 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.459
 this so as to create heat 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.680
 absolutely above then how you can 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.450
 see I'm already leavened and quite a lot 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.519
 they grow a lot so don't worry 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.350
 if you do them even a little thinner 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.209
 I'm going to turn them now 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.250
 obviously those used to seeing the 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.500
 tigelle in emilia sees them with above 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.510
 that flower-shaped mold but that one 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.100
 it is typical of the CGIL HA in this case 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.840
 you won't have it but the tigelle come 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.140
 very well the perfect cooking at 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.810
 same way ready then of course vi 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.980
 they must be leavened they must rise in 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.410
 this way the children always burns then the 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.900
 tigella for those who weren't from Emilia to 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.640
 whoever is not used to eating them goes 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.250
 open inside his I make you 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.170
 see how it is filled with a cheese 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.260
 and a sausage so in this case I have 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.269
 of the baked ham and the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.880
 Don't do slices like I've seen it done before 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.370
 two tigelle on top of one another because not 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.070
 it works like this is not sandwich bread but 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.650
 tigella opens inside must be 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.720
 still hot gone insert inside 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.910
 the cheese is cured 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.450
 I put a slice like that 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.340
 melts instantly 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.950
 let's add the ham 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.670
 cooked and raw what you prefer 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.739
 we close and eat 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.040
 here it is then I made three shelves 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.769
 several one with robiola and salami 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.690
 strolghino one with mortadella e 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.299
 here in this case I'm putting some 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.609
 san daniele cured ham cut into 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.110
 inside knife I did not put 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.520
 cheeses that are otherwise we can 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.300
 always add here also the two 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.430
 thin and are very comfortable to do too 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.500
 first because you want to freeze them 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.389
 already cooked and thawed only at the moment 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.190
 of need especially if you have parties 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.150
 if you have people at home it's great 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.150
 bread substitute
