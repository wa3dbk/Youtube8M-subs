00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
everything up lifting it out and then

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.010 
everything up lifting it out and then
I'm<00:02:34.040> just<00:02:34.220> sliding<00:02:34.520> this<00:02:34.790> over<00:02:35.360> maybe<00:02:35.870> a

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
I'm just sliding this over maybe a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:49.230 
I'm just sliding this over maybe a
little<00:02:36.200> bit<00:02:36.440> off<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:36.650> gets<00:02:37.160> close<00:02:37.400> enough

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.490 

I'm<00:02:50.240> going<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.420> draw<00:02:50.570> a<00:02:50.600> three-quarter<00:02:51.320> inch

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
I'm going to draw a three-quarter inch

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.350 
I'm going to draw a three-quarter inch
hole<00:02:51.800> in<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.250> corner<00:02:52.580> of<00:02:52.730> each<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.240> these

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
hole in the corner of each of these

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.380 
hole in the corner of each of these
melamine<00:02:53.900> pieces<00:02:54.730> if<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:55.790> decide<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.270> use

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
melamine pieces if you decide to use

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.449 
melamine pieces if you decide to use
melamine<00:02:56.990> for<00:02:57.290> any<00:02:57.470> kind<00:02:57.740> of<00:02:57.830> project<00:02:58.100> you

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
melamine for any kind of project you

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.860 
melamine for any kind of project you
just<00:02:58.550> need<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.880> be<00:02:59.000> careful<00:02:59.240> that<00:02:59.570> you've<00:02:59.720> got

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
just need to be careful that you've got

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.810 
just need to be careful that you've got
some<00:03:00.140> sort<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.500> backer<00:03:00.950> board<00:03:01.400> underneath

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
some sort of a backer board underneath

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.780 
some sort of a backer board underneath
it<00:03:02.270> to<00:03:02.450> prevent<00:03:02.900> any<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:03.950> white<00:03:04.400> stuff

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
it to prevent any of this white stuff

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.860 
it to prevent any of this white stuff
from<00:03:05.120> chipping<00:03:05.540> out

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.100 

I<00:03:08.959> decided<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.860> cut<00:03:10.099> these<00:03:10.250> legs<00:03:10.610> down<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.330> 32

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
I decided to cut these legs down to 32

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.100 
I decided to cut these legs down to 32
inches<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.890> 36<00:03:13.610> inches<00:03:14.060> just<00:03:14.330> seemed<00:03:14.690> out<00:03:14.959> of

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
inches the 36 inches just seemed out of

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.309 
inches the 36 inches just seemed out of
proportion<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.159> I<00:03:16.700> put<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.060> coat<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.450> paste<00:03:17.989> wax

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
proportion and I put a coat of paste wax

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.289 
proportion and I put a coat of paste wax
on<00:03:18.680> these<00:03:18.890> so<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.340> think<00:03:19.400> they'll<00:03:19.670> slide<00:03:20.000> into

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
on these so I think they'll slide into

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.910 
on these so I think they'll slide into
the<00:03:20.420> holes<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.810> little<00:03:21.019> easier<00:03:21.319> and<00:03:21.560> I'm<00:03:21.769> going

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
the holes a little easier and I'm going

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.720 
the holes a little easier and I'm going
to<00:03:21.980> drop<00:03:22.370> these<00:03:22.940> legs<00:03:23.330> in<00:03:24.040> with<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.370> holes

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
to drop these legs in with the holes

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.530 
to drop these legs in with the holes
facing<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.599> inside<00:03:27.760> I'm<00:03:28.760> attaching<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.269> top

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
facing the inside I'm attaching the top

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.869 
facing the inside I'm attaching the top
and<00:03:29.840> bottom<00:03:29.959> shelves<00:03:30.440> with<00:03:30.829> a<00:03:31.040> screw<00:03:31.549> into

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
and bottom shelves with a screw into

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:39.610 
and bottom shelves with a screw into
each<00:03:32.030> leg<00:03:37.989> now<00:03:38.989> I'm<00:03:39.079> just<00:03:39.200> going<00:03:39.319> to<00:03:39.379> try<00:03:39.590> to

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
each leg now I'm just going to try to

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.270 
each leg now I'm just going to try to
thread<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.610> two<00:03:41.150> middle<00:03:41.540> shelves<00:03:41.989> down<00:03:42.769> they

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
thread the two middle shelves down they

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:58.509 
thread the two middle shelves down they
don't<00:03:43.459> get<00:03:43.670> attacked<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:56.859> I<00:03:57.859> can<00:03:58.010> attach<00:03:58.280> this

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
don't get attacked and I can attach this

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.339 
don't get attacked and I can attach this
top<00:03:58.849> shelf<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.480> same<00:03:59.690> way<00:03:59.900> they<00:04:00.049> hit<00:04:00.260> the

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
top shelf the same way they hit the

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.660 
top shelf the same way they hit the
bottom<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:02.890> I'm<00:04:03.890> just<00:04:04.010> going<00:04:04.159> to<00:04:04.190> iron<00:04:04.519> on

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
bottom and I'm just going to iron on

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.890 
bottom and I'm just going to iron on
some<00:04:04.940> of<00:04:05.000> this<00:04:05.090> melamine<00:04:05.629> edging<00:04:07.629> this<00:04:08.629> edge

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
some of this melamine edging this edge

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.319 
some of this melamine edging this edge
banding<00:04:09.319> will<00:04:09.470> cover<00:04:09.739> up<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:09.920> edges<00:04:10.129> and<00:04:10.609> hide

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
banding will cover up the edges and hide

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.590 
banding will cover up the edges and hide
the<00:04:11.659> screws

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.740 

I<00:04:19.340> pick<00:04:20.340> up<00:04:20.430> some<00:04:20.490> of<00:04:20.670> these<00:04:20.730> plastic<00:04:21.390> tips

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
I pick up some of these plastic tips

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.690 
I pick up some of these plastic tips
that<00:04:22.020> I'll<00:04:22.140> put<00:04:22.320> on<00:04:22.440> both<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.920> bottom<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.490> the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
that I'll put on both the bottom and the

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.910 
that I'll put on both the bottom and the
top<00:04:23.730> I<00:04:26.240> cut<00:04:27.240> up<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.540> quarter<00:04:28.020> inch<00:04:28.170> dowel<00:04:28.470> into<00:04:28.890> a

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
top I cut up a quarter inch dowel into a

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.130 
top I cut up a quarter inch dowel into a
bunch<00:04:29.220> of<00:04:29.370> little<00:04:29.580> shelf<00:04:29.940> pins<00:04:30.240> I<00:04:30.510> just<00:04:30.960> put

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
bunch of little shelf pins I just put

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.260 
bunch of little shelf pins I just put
those<00:04:31.290> in<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.800> holes<00:04:32.070> wherever<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.820> want<00:04:33.150> to

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
those in the holes wherever I want to

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.830 
those in the holes wherever I want to
shove<00:04:33.510> to<00:04:33.720> be<00:04:34.940> well<00:04:35.940> I<00:04:36.000> guess<00:04:36.150> it's<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.360> little

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
shove to be well I guess it's a little

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.600 
shove to be well I guess it's a little
tight<00:04:37.290> I<00:04:37.560> guess<00:04:37.770> if<00:04:37.920> I<00:04:38.010> was<00:04:38.040> going<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.310> do<00:04:38.460> this

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
tight I guess if I was going to do this

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.430 
tight I guess if I was going to do this
again<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.030> would<00:04:39.240> make<00:04:39.480> these<00:04:39.750> holes<00:04:40.080> in<00:04:40.290> these

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
again I would make these holes in these

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.070 
again I would make these holes in these
two<00:04:40.620> shelves<00:04:40.890> a<00:04:41.100> little<00:04:41.430> bit<00:04:41.580> bigger<00:04:41.910> but<00:04:42.570> it's

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
two shelves a little bit bigger but it's

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.840 
two shelves a little bit bigger but it's
working<00:04:43.410> all<00:04:43.560> right<00:04:43.590> one<00:04:44.370> nice<00:04:44.580> thing<00:04:44.610> about

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
working all right one nice thing about

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.060 
working all right one nice thing about
using<00:04:45.150> melamine<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:46.020> that<00:04:46.230> it<00:04:46.320> cleans<00:04:46.680> up

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
using melamine is that it cleans up

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.580 
using melamine is that it cleans up
really<00:04:47.280> nicely<00:04:47.910> with<00:04:48.240> lacquer<00:04:48.780> thinner<00:04:49.200> I

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
really nicely with lacquer thinner I

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.670 
really nicely with lacquer thinner I
have<00:04:50.190> some<00:04:50.810> adhesive<00:04:51.810> that's<00:04:52.020> squeezed<00:04:52.440> out

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
have some adhesive that's squeezed out

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.980 
have some adhesive that's squeezed out
from<00:04:52.770> this<00:04:53.220> edge<00:04:53.490> banding<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.360> it<00:04:54.630> takes<00:04:54.840> it

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
from this edge banding and it takes it

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.160 
from this edge banding and it takes it
right<00:04:55.020> off<00:04:55.520> one<00:04:56.520> way<00:04:56.730> to<00:04:56.790> simplify

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
right off one way to simplify

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
right off one way to simplify
construction<00:04:58.170> rather<00:04:58.380> than<00:04:58.710> making<00:04:59.010> all<00:04:59.160> of

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
construction rather than making all of

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.370 
construction rather than making all of
the<00:04:59.430> holes<00:04:59.760> in<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.270> legs<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:00.840> using<00:05:01.230> the

the holes in the legs and using the

the holes in the legs and using the
Shelf<00:05:01.710> pins<00:05:02.010> is<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.850> consider<00:05:03.420> using<00:05:03.630> one<00:05:03.840> of

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
Shelf pins is to consider using one of
