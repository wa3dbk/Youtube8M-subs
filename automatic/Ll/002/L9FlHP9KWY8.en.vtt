00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.549 
dramatic images and they left an
impression<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.969> me<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:43.020> very<00:00:43.140> difficult

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
impression on me and it's very difficult

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.910 
impression on me and it's very difficult
to<00:00:43.950> pinpoint<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.850> these<00:00:45.570> things<00:00:45.960> come<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
to pinpoint it these things come to you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
to pinpoint it these things come to you
subconsciously<00:00:47.610> if<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.570> do<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> lot<00:00:49.050> of

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
subconsciously if you do a lot of

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.069 
subconsciously if you do a lot of
research<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.860> your<00:00:50.039> early<00:00:50.190> period<00:00:50.879> of

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
research and your early period of

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.860 
research and your early period of
learning<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.890> trade

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.590 

I<00:00:55.989> think<00:00:56.559> he<00:00:57.010> influenced<00:00:57.579> many<00:00:57.820> artists<00:00:58.480> of

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
I think he influenced many artists of

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.920 
I think he influenced many artists of
later<00:00:59.260> periods<00:00:59.890> like<00:01:00.640> Gustave<00:01:01.149> doré<00:01:01.390> eh<00:01:01.420> I

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
later periods like Gustave doré eh I

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.920 
later periods like Gustave doré eh I
always<00:01:02.410> say<00:01:02.829> he's<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.519> for<00:01:04.269> one<00:01:04.449> of<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.690> first

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
always say he's the for one of the first

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.859 
always say he's the for one of the first
art<00:01:05.229> directors<00:01:05.860> of<00:01:06.100> motion<00:01:06.520> pictures<00:01:06.940> because

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
art directors of motion pictures because

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.340 
art directors of motion pictures because
so<00:01:08.770> many<00:01:08.950> of<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.400> early<00:01:09.820> art<00:01:10.030> directors<00:01:10.659> would

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
so many of the early art directors would

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.280 
so many of the early art directors would
use<00:01:11.890> his<00:01:12.130> compositions<00:01:12.970> he<00:01:13.690> had<00:01:13.930> a<00:01:13.960> wonderful

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
use his compositions he had a wonderful

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.950 
use his compositions he had a wonderful
way<00:01:14.710> of<00:01:15.280> making<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:15.880> depth<00:01:16.210> he<00:01:16.600> would<00:01:16.750> have

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
way of making the depth he would have

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.070 
way of making the depth he would have
the<00:01:17.170> foreground<00:01:17.590> very<00:01:18.369> dark<00:01:18.729> and<00:01:19.030> a<00:01:19.270> medium

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
the foreground very dark and a medium

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.440 
the foreground very dark and a medium
ground<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.800> then<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:21.130> very<00:01:21.520> light<00:01:21.790> background

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
ground and then a very light background

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.200 
ground and then a very light background
his<00:01:23.020> engravings<00:01:23.800> were<00:01:24.040> very<00:01:24.310> filmic

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
his engravings were very filmic

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.080 
his engravings were very filmic
all<00:01:26.750> these<00:01:27.049> painters<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:28.369> that<00:01:28.549> period

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
all these painters of of that period

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.530 
all these painters of of that period
were<00:01:29.720> visionaries<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.860> I<00:01:31.369> think<00:01:31.700> his

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
were visionaries and I think his

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.140 
were visionaries and I think his
paintings<00:01:33.170> were<00:01:33.310> highly<00:01:34.310> influenced<00:01:34.940> on

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
paintings were highly influenced on

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.690 
paintings were highly influenced on
early<00:01:36.020> films<00:01:36.409> like<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.940> deluge<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:39.700> various

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
early films like the deluge and various

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.540 
early films like the deluge and various
other<00:01:40.909> films<00:01:41.360> of<00:01:41.540> that<00:01:41.570> period<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:42.409> all<00:01:43.280> these

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
other films of that period so all these

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.730 
other films of that period so all these
artists<00:01:44.119> they<00:01:44.270> influenced<00:01:44.840> other<00:01:45.050> people<00:01:45.530> and

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
artists they influenced other people and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.370 
artists they influenced other people and
it<00:01:45.860> gradually<00:01:46.280> grows<00:01:46.700> it's<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.479> snowball<00:01:47.840> and

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
it gradually grows it's a snowball and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.820 
it gradually grows it's a snowball and
it<00:01:48.740> gets<00:01:48.890> bigger<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.399> bigger<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:49.759> bigger<00:01:50.830> one

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
it gets bigger and bigger and bigger one

in Ray's films especially in Clash of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.669 
in Ray's films especially in Clash of
the<00:02:07.940> Titans<00:02:08.360> when<00:02:09.320> you've<00:02:09.440> got<00:02:09.590> the

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
the Titans when you've got the

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.680

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
influenced by somebody else and I think

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.240 
influenced by somebody else and I think
that's<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:16.220> way<00:02:16.820> progress<00:02:17.330> is<00:02:17.510> made<00:02:18.190> this<00:02:19.190> is

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
that's the way progress is made this is

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.250 
that's the way progress is made this is
probably<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.000> biggest<00:02:20.150> exhibition<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.110> we

probably the biggest exhibition that we

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.199 
probably the biggest exhibition that we
have<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.739> today<00:02:22.250> we<00:02:22.730> are<00:02:22.790> going<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.090> be
