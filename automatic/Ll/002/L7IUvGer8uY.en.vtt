right<00:00:15.000> then<00:00:15.210> today<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.600> thought<00:00:16.049> we'd<00:00:16.230> have

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
right then today I thought we'd have

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.950 
right then today I thought we'd have
another<00:00:16.920> look<00:00:17.160> at<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.850> weapon<00:00:18.450> that's<00:00:18.600> going<00:00:18.869> to

DLC for Battlefield 4 today we're going
to<00:00:23.640> be<00:00:23.730> using<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.270> Bulldog<00:00:24.810> assault<00:00:25.290> rifle

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
to be using the Bulldog assault rifle

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.490 
to be using the Bulldog assault rifle
now<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:27.029> assault<00:00:27.330> rifle<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> little<00:00:28.380> bit

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
now this assault rifle is a little bit

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.929 
now this assault rifle is a little bit
different<00:00:28.950> from<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> ones<00:00:29.430> that<00:00:29.610> are<00:00:29.730> already

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
different from the ones that are already

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.110 
different from the ones that are already
available<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.930> bf4<00:00:31.590> apart<00:00:32.430> from<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.759> scar-l

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
available in bf4 apart from the scar-l

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.840 
available in bf4 apart from the scar-l
and<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.840> major<00:00:34.110> difference<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:35.130> it's

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
and the major difference here is it's

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.150 
and the major difference here is it's
higher<00:00:36.180> rate<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> damage<00:00:37.050> per<00:00:37.530> bullet<00:00:37.560> that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
higher rate of damage per bullet that

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.610 
higher rate of damage per bullet that
this<00:00:38.310> weapon<00:00:38.670> actually<00:00:39.090> deals<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:40.200> Bulldog

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
rifles in battlefield 4 and as I said

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.279 
rifles in battlefield 4 and as I said
that<00:00:53.309> puts<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.850> par<00:00:53.879> with<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.510> scar-l<00:00:55.050> we

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
that puts it on par with the scar-l we

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.470 
that puts it on par with the scar-l we
finally<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:55.980> another<00:00:56.010> weapon<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:57.269> can

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
finally have another weapon that can

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.389 
finally have another weapon that can
compete<00:00:57.839> with<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> scar-l<00:00:58.589> in<00:00:58.980> terms<00:00:59.250> of

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
compete with the scar-l in terms of

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.729 
compete with the scar-l in terms of
damage<00:00:59.699> output<00:01:00.199> looking<00:01:01.199> at<00:01:01.320> some<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.589> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
damage output looking at some of the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.650 
damage output looking at some of the
stats<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.640> available<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
stats that we have available for the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.630 
stats that we have available for the
Bulldog<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.290> putting<00:01:04.530> them<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.890> comparison

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
Bulldog and putting them in comparison

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.090 
Bulldog and putting them in comparison
to<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.090> scar-l<00:01:06.510> within<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> game<00:01:07.530> already

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
to the scar-l within the game already

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.600 
to the scar-l within the game already
the<00:01:08.820> scar-l<00:01:09.150> has<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.870> rate<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.140> fire<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.610> 650

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the scar-l has a rate of fire of 650

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.190 
the scar-l has a rate of fire of 650
rounds<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.970> minute<00:01:12.000> whereas<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.690> Bulldog<00:01:13.080> is

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
rounds a minute whereas the Bulldog is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.740 
rounds a minute whereas the Bulldog is
at<00:01:13.560> 700<00:01:14.430> which<00:01:14.880> gives<00:01:15.120> it<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.300> slight<00:01:15.600> advantage

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
at 700 which gives it a slight advantage

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.660 
at 700 which gives it a slight advantage
in<00:01:16.260> your<00:01:16.650> sort<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.890> close<00:01:17.130> quarters<00:01:17.610> combat

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
in your sort of close quarters combat

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.910 
in your sort of close quarters combat
and<00:01:18.270> when<00:01:18.840> you're<00:01:18.990> aiming<00:01:19.410> a<00:01:19.470> little<00:01:19.680> bit

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
and when you're aiming a little bit

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.350 
and when you're aiming a little bit
further<00:01:20.190> away<00:01:20.550> it's<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> give<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
further away it's going to give you a

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.270 
further away it's going to give you a
little<00:01:21.690> bit<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.930> an<00:01:22.110> advantage<00:01:22.620> I<00:01:22.740> don't<00:01:22.980> think

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
little bit of an advantage I don't think

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.100 
little bit of an advantage I don't think
50<00:01:23.760> rounds<00:01:24.060> per<00:01:24.180> minute<00:01:24.300> is<00:01:24.540> really<00:01:24.570> anything

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
50 rounds per minute is really anything

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.840 
50 rounds per minute is really anything
to<00:01:25.230> write<00:01:25.440> home<00:01:25.470> about<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:25.980> if<00:01:26.640> you're

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
to write home about but if you're

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.310 
to write home about but if you're
getting<00:01:26.970> down<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> nitty<00:01:27.600> gritty<00:01:27.690> it<00:01:28.170> is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
getting down to the nitty gritty it is

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.260 
getting down to the nitty gritty it is
going<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.770> help<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.280> certain<00:01:29.490> situations

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
going to help you in certain situations

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.380 
going to help you in certain situations
if<00:01:30.870> we<00:01:31.140> tie<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.010> 34<00:01:32.850> max<00:01:33.150> damage

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
if we tie that in with the 34 max damage

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.720 
if we tie that in with the 34 max damage
at<00:01:33.630> close<00:01:33.660> range<00:01:34.200> 700<00:01:34.920> rounds<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.220> minute<00:01:35.250> there

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
at close range 700 rounds a minute there

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.240 
at close range 700 rounds a minute there
means<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.480> you<00:01:36.660> can<00:01:36.930> actually<00:01:37.530> rip<00:01:37.830> through

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
means that you can actually rip through

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.610 
means that you can actually rip through
people<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:38.820> close<00:01:39.060> range<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.990> only<00:01:40.200> downside

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
people at close range the only downside

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.010 
people at close range the only downside
is<00:01:40.650> obviously<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.430> only<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.820> 21<00:01:42.240> rounds<00:01:42.870> in

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
is obviously you only have 21 rounds in

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.680 
is obviously you only have 21 rounds in
a<00:01:43.230> magazine<00:01:43.260> and<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.670> reload<00:01:45.120> time<00:01:45.150> at<00:01:45.540> least

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
a magazine and the reload time at least

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.480 
a magazine and the reload time at least
the<00:01:45.780> short<00:01:46.080> readout<00:01:46.320> time<00:01:46.620> is<00:01:46.830> two<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> half

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the short readout time is two and a half

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.880 
the short readout time is two and a half
seconds<00:01:48.120> which<00:01:48.690> is<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:48.930> quite<00:01:49.410> a<00:01:49.440> considerable

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
seconds which is a quite a considerable

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.950 
seconds which is a quite a considerable
amount<00:01:50.370> of<00:01:50.550> time<00:01:50.610> whereas<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.330> scar-l<00:01:51.630> is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
amount of time whereas the scar-l is

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.710 
amount of time whereas the scar-l is
only<00:01:52.140> 1.8<00:01:52.920> seconds<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.060> it's<00:01:54.180> nearly<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.450> full

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
only 1.8 seconds so it's nearly a full

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.450 
only 1.8 seconds so it's nearly a full
second<00:01:55.230> longer<00:01:55.590> for<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:55.860> get<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.160> new

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
second longer for you to get a new

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.790 
second longer for you to get a new
magazine<00:01:56.730> into<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.300> weapon<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.930> carry<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.680> in

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
magazine into the weapon and carry on in

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.890 
magazine into the weapon and carry on in
a<00:01:58.860> gunfight<00:01:59.130> which<00:01:59.940> means<00:02:00.180> even<00:02:00.600> though<00:02:00.840> you

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
a gunfight which means even though you

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.780 
a gunfight which means even though you
can<00:02:01.170> rip<00:02:01.440> through<00:02:01.620> people<00:02:02.040> at<00:02:02.160> close<00:02:02.340> quarters

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
can rip through people at close quarters

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.790 
can rip through people at close quarters
then<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.270> really<00:02:03.720> need<00:02:03.900> to<00:02:04.020> make<00:02:04.170> sure<00:02:04.470> that

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
then you really need to make sure that

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.100 
then you really need to make sure that
you're<00:02:05.250> always<00:02:05.460> going<00:02:05.940> for<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.330> short<00:02:06.600> reload

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
you're always going for the short reload

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.969 
you're always going for the short reload
because<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.280> long<00:02:08.520> reload<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.569> 3.2<00:02:10.259> seconds

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
because the long reload is 3.2 seconds

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.240 
because the long reload is 3.2 seconds
which<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.360> just<00:02:12.360> massively<00:02:12.870> long<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.500> if<00:02:14.099> you

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
which is just massively long and if you

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.740 
which is just massively long and if you
get<00:02:14.459> caught<00:02:14.730> out<00:02:14.940> you're<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:15.330> going<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.629> get

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
get caught out you're just going to get

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.530 
get caught out you're just going to get
killed<00:02:15.989> instantly<00:02:16.349> in<00:02:16.530> close<00:02:16.769> quarters<00:02:17.250> I

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
killed instantly in close quarters I

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.420 
killed instantly in close quarters I
found<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:18.840> really<00:02:19.290> beneficial<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:20.190> a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
found it's really beneficial to have a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.460 
found it's really beneficial to have a
laser<00:02:20.730> sight<00:02:21.030> on<00:02:21.270> there<00:02:21.540> if<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.750> are<00:02:21.960> going<00:02:22.410> to

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
laser sight on there if you are going to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.260 
laser sight on there if you are going to
be<00:02:22.590> using<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:23.010> weapon<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.520> close<00:02:23.730> quarters

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
be using this weapon in close quarters

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.030 
be using this weapon in close quarters
it<00:02:24.720> means<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.140> gives<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.410> just<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.680> little<00:02:25.710> bit

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
it means it gives you just a little bit

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.700 
it means it gives you just a little bit
better<00:02:26.220> hit<00:02:26.460> for

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
better hit for

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.650 
better hit for
our<00:02:26.800> accuracy<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.550> as<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:27.760> said<00:02:27.940> but<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.090> 700

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
our accuracy and as I said but that 700

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.970 
our accuracy and as I said but that 700
rounds<00:02:28.900> per<00:02:29.050> minute<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.410> are<00:02:29.440> going<00:02:29.770> to<00:02:29.830> get

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
rounds per minute you are going to get

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.160 
rounds per minute you are going to get
some<00:02:30.220> kills<00:02:30.520> there<00:02:30.880> but<00:02:31.510> it's<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.780> reload

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
some kills there but it's the reload

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.960 
some kills there but it's the reload
time<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.530> really<00:02:32.950> do<00:02:33.100> need<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.550> make<00:02:33.700> sure

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
time you really do need to make sure

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.370 
time you really do need to make sure
you're<00:02:34.300> paying<00:02:34.540> attention<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:35.050> how<00:02:35.320> many

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
you're paying attention to how many

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.190 
you're paying attention to how many
bullets<00:02:35.950> you've<00:02:36.130> got<00:02:36.340> left<00:02:36.640> in<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.200> weapon

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
bullets you've got left in that weapon

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.830 
bullets you've got left in that weapon
because<00:02:38.650> if<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:38.950> go<00:02:39.190> beyond<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:40.240> 20<00:02:40.690> or<00:02:40.810> the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
because if you go beyond the 20 or the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.390 
because if you go beyond the 20 or the
21<00:02:41.290> bullets<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:41.740> run<00:02:41.890> out<00:02:42.010> completely

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
21 bullets and you run out completely

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.090 
21 bullets and you run out completely
you're<00:02:43.090> looking<00:02:43.360> at<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.570> 3.2<00:02:44.380> second<00:02:44.860> long

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
you're looking at a 3.2 second long

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.340 
you're looking at a 3.2 second long
reload<00:02:45.520> time<00:02:45.760> which<00:02:46.030> just<00:02:46.300> takes<00:02:46.480> forever<00:02:46.750> and

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
reload time which just takes forever and

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.470 
reload time which just takes forever and
in<00:02:47.800> close<00:02:48.040> quarters<00:02:48.520> you're<00:02:48.670> gonna<00:02:48.850> get<00:02:49.120> shot

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
in close quarters you're gonna get shot

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.090 
in close quarters you're gonna get shot
so<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.990> really<00:02:50.350> need<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.590> make<00:02:50.710> sure<00:02:50.950> you're

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
so you really need to make sure you're

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.470 
so you really need to make sure you're
paying<00:02:51.250> attention<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.790> how<00:02:51.880> much<00:02:52.000> ammo<00:02:52.300> you've

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
paying attention to how much ammo you've

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.500 
paying attention to how much ammo you've
got<00:02:52.660> left<00:02:54.000> obviously<00:02:55.000> from<00:02:55.210> what<00:02:55.240> I've<00:02:55.480> just

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
got left obviously from what I've just

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.150 
got left obviously from what I've just
said<00:02:55.840> you<00:02:56.050> must<00:02:56.230> have<00:02:56.320> worked<00:02:56.560> out<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.100> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
said you must have worked out that the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.250 
said you must have worked out that the
Bulldog<00:02:57.610> is<00:02:57.640> basically<00:02:58.210> meant<00:02:58.540> for<00:02:58.810> medium<00:02:59.230> to

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
Bulldog is basically meant for medium to

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.500 
Bulldog is basically meant for medium to
long<00:02:59.590> range<00:02:59.830> combat<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:00.520> it's<00:03:00.970> there<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.210> deal

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
long range combat and it's there to deal

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.630 
long range combat and it's there to deal
a<00:03:01.540> lot<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:01.870> damage<00:03:01.960> and<00:03:02.530> that's<00:03:02.770> it<00:03:03.190> does<00:03:03.460> that

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
a lot of damage and that's it does that

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.120 
a lot of damage and that's it does that
extremely<00:03:04.180> well<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.810> does<00:03:05.230> however<00:03:05.500> have<00:03:05.740> a

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
extremely well it does however have a

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.640 
extremely well it does however have a
little<00:03:06.400> bit<00:03:06.550> of<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.760> recoil<00:03:07.210> problem<00:03:07.720> it's<00:03:08.470> got

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
little bit of a recoil problem it's got

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.250 
little bit of a recoil problem it's got
a<00:03:08.680> point<00:03:09.010> 5<00:03:09.310> 5<00:03:09.700> vertical<00:03:10.450> recoil<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:11.140> then

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
a point 5 5 vertical recoil and then

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.620 
a point 5 5 vertical recoil and then
point<00:03:11.590> three<00:03:11.860> side<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.370> side<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.150> left<00:03:13.360> and

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
point three side to side to the left and

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.840 
point three side to side to the left and
the<00:03:13.810> right<00:03:14.080> in<00:03:14.380> terms<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.070> horizontal<00:03:15.640> recoil

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
the right in terms of horizontal recoil

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.210 
the right in terms of horizontal recoil
so<00:03:16.300> this<00:03:16.750> thing<00:03:16.990> can<00:03:17.260> bounce<00:03:17.530> around<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:18.100> little

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
so this thing can bounce around a little

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.190 
so this thing can bounce around a little
bit<00:03:18.520> but<00:03:19.090> as<00:03:19.210> I<00:03:19.240> say<00:03:19.480> if<00:03:19.630> you've<00:03:19.750> got<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.050> right

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
bit but as I say if you've got the right

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.200 
bit but as I say if you've got the right
attachments<00:03:20.890> on<00:03:21.040> there<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.400> you're<00:03:21.880> going

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
attachments on there and you're going

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.730 
attachments on there and you're going
for<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.420> right<00:03:22.630> targets<00:03:23.140> you're<00:03:23.290> not<00:03:23.440> really

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
for the right targets you're not really

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.370 
for the right targets you're not really
going<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.130> notice<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.850> recoil<00:03:25.300> it's<00:03:26.170> just

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
going to notice the recoil it's just

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.050 
going to notice the recoil it's just
something<00:03:26.770> that<00:03:26.800> if<00:03:26.950> you've<00:03:27.310> used<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:27.700> scar-l

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
something that if you've used the scar-l

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.510 
something that if you've used the scar-l
before<00:03:28.630> you're<00:03:29.110> going<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.590> know<00:03:29.770> how<00:03:29.800> the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
before you're going to know how the

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.370 
before you're going to know how the
Bulldog<00:03:30.970> actually<00:03:31.420> feels<00:03:31.660> it's<00:03:31.900> it's<00:03:32.140> no

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
Bulldog actually feels it's it's no

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.800 
Bulldog actually feels it's it's no
different<00:03:32.890> basically<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.640> mean<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.360> recoil

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
different basically I mean the recoil

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.360 
different basically I mean the recoil
values<00:03:35.170> are<00:03:35.320> virtually<00:03:35.740> the<00:03:35.860> same<00:03:36.100> for<00:03:36.340> both

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
values are virtually the same for both

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.420 
values are virtually the same for both
weapons<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.630> Bulldog<00:03:38.290> is<00:03:38.500> slightly<00:03:39.130> more

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
weapons the Bulldog is slightly more

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.090 
weapons the Bulldog is slightly more
vertical<00:03:40.120> recoil<00:03:40.360> happy<00:03:40.990> but<00:03:41.260> you're<00:03:41.950> really

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
vertical recoil happy but you're really

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.220 
vertical recoil happy but you're really
not<00:03:42.370> going<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.700> notice<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.300> but<00:03:43.450> if<00:03:43.690> you<00:03:44.050> are

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
not going to notice it but if you are

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.980 
not going to notice it but if you are
sort<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.830> user<00:03:45.370> of<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.850> normal<00:03:46.480> assault

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
sort of a user of the normal assault

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.570 
sort of a user of the normal assault
rifles<00:03:47.380> as<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.620> like<00:03:47.800> to<00:03:47.920> call<00:03:47.950> them<00:03:48.190> like<00:03:48.400> the

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
rifles as I like to call them like the

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.330 
rifles as I like to call them like the
m16a4<00:03:49.240> and<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.780> format<00:03:50.170> then<00:03:50.830> you're<00:03:51.040> going

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
m16a4 and the format then you're going

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.460 
m16a4 and the format then you're going
to<00:03:51.520> notice<00:03:51.730> that<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.270> Bulldog<00:03:52.750> is<00:03:53.170> just<00:03:53.410> a

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
to notice that the Bulldog is just a

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.260 
to notice that the Bulldog is just a
little<00:03:53.680> bit<00:03:53.800> harder<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.220> use<00:03:54.640> for<00:03:54.910> you<00:03:55.000> and

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
little bit harder to use for you and

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.460 
little bit harder to use for you and
it's<00:03:55.420> going<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.660> take<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:55.840> little<00:03:56.110> bit<00:03:56.350> of

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
it's going to take a little bit of

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.140 
it's going to take a little bit of
adjustment<00:03:56.890> but<00:03:57.250> if<00:03:57.580> you<00:03:57.670> put<00:03:57.820> in<00:03:57.910> a<00:03:57.970> bit<00:03:58.090> of

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
adjustment but if you put in a bit of

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.850 
adjustment but if you put in a bit of
practice<00:03:58.570> and<00:03:58.810> I'm<00:03:59.050> sure<00:03:59.230> you'll<00:03:59.410> get<00:03:59.620> there

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
practice and I'm sure you'll get there

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.490 
practice and I'm sure you'll get there
part<00:04:00.850> of<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.090> reason<00:04:01.510> that<00:04:01.540> this<00:04:01.750> weapon<00:04:02.230> has

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
part of the reason that this weapon has

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.040 
part of the reason that this weapon has
a<00:04:02.920> very<00:04:03.250> long<00:04:03.460> reload<00:04:03.850> time<00:04:04.090> is<00:04:04.360> because<00:04:04.750> it's

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
a very long reload time is because it's

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.650 
a very long reload time is because it's
a<00:04:05.290> bullpup<00:04:05.710> design<00:04:05.850> as<00:04:06.850> you<00:04:07.030> can<00:04:07.180> see<00:04:07.360> when<00:04:07.540> you

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
a bullpup design as you can see when you

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.230 
a bullpup design as you can see when you
reload<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.410> cartridge<00:04:09.040> goes<00:04:09.250> in<00:04:09.460> further<00:04:10.030> to

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
reload the cartridge goes in further to

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.270 
reload the cartridge goes in further to
the<00:04:10.330> back<00:04:10.510> of<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.810> weapon<00:04:11.200> so<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.950> takes<00:04:12.160> a<00:04:12.250> bit

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
the back of the weapon so it takes a bit

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.280 
the back of the weapon so it takes a bit
longer<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.700> reload<00:04:13.180> but<00:04:13.510> in<00:04:13.660> that<00:04:13.840> sense<00:04:14.140> you

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
longer to reload but in that sense you

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.990 
longer to reload but in that sense you
do<00:04:14.470> have<00:04:14.650> quite<00:04:14.980> good<00:04:15.010> hipfire<00:04:15.640> accuracy

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
do have quite good hipfire accuracy

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.640 
do have quite good hipfire accuracy
which<00:04:16.420> is<00:04:16.570> why<00:04:16.690> I<00:04:16.780> said<00:04:17.020> to<00:04:17.140> stick<00:04:17.350> a<00:04:17.380> laser

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
which is why I said to stick a laser

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.370 
which is why I said to stick a laser
sight<00:04:17.950> on<00:04:18.160> it<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:19.060> can<00:04:19.330> go<00:04:19.600> around<00:04:19.720> and<00:04:20.230> get

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
sight on it you can go around and get

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.110 
sight on it you can go around and get
some<00:04:20.560> really<00:04:20.739> good<00:04:20.950> hipfire<00:04:21.489> kills<00:04:21.880> if<00:04:22.090> you

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
some really good hipfire kills if you

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.460 
some really good hipfire kills if you
are<00:04:22.390> stuck<00:04:22.720> in<00:04:22.930> one<00:04:23.080> of<00:04:23.170> those<00:04:23.260> situations

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
are stuck in one of those situations

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.440 
are stuck in one of those situations
where<00:04:23.980> you<00:04:24.130> literally<00:04:24.550> have<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:25.000> spray<00:04:25.270> the

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
where you literally have to spray the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.690 
where you literally have to spray the
weapon<00:04:25.840> then<00:04:26.380> I<00:04:26.620> don't<00:04:26.950> think<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.310> Bulldog

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
weapon then I don't think the Bulldog

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.060 
weapon then I don't think the Bulldog
will<00:04:27.910> let<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.240> down<00:04:28.450> as<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:28.660> said<00:04:28.930> inside<00:04:29.680> 12

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
will let you down as I said inside 12

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.070 
will let you down as I said inside 12
meters<00:04:30.460> you're<00:04:30.610> looking<00:04:30.850> at<00:04:30.940> 34<00:04:31.480> damage<00:04:31.840> so

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
meters you're looking at 34 damage so

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.380 
meters you're looking at 34 damage so
really<00:04:32.650> two<00:04:32.860> three<00:04:33.190> maybe<00:04:33.400> even<00:04:33.520> four<00:04:33.820> shots

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
really two three maybe even four shots

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.060 
really two three maybe even four shots
at<00:04:34.540> a<00:04:34.600> maximum<00:04:35.169> and<00:04:35.290> you're<00:04:35.710> looking<00:04:35.980> at

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
at a maximum and you're looking at

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.740 
at a maximum and you're looking at
downing<00:04:36.430> opponent<00:04:36.940> as<00:04:37.090> long<00:04:37.300> as<00:04:37.450> you're<00:04:37.570> being

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
downing opponent as long as you're being

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.879 
downing opponent as long as you're being
accurate

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
accurate

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.739 
accurate
the<00:04:39.189> laser<00:04:39.399> sight<00:04:39.579> really<00:04:40.059> does<00:04:40.269> help<00:04:40.509> out

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:40.749 
the laser sight really does help out

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:42.569 
the laser sight really does help out
being<00:04:41.139> a<00:04:41.259> bullpup<00:04:41.649> weapon<00:04:41.799> it's<00:04:42.159> giving<00:04:42.459> you

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:42.579 
being a bullpup weapon it's giving you

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:44.879 
being a bullpup weapon it's giving you
quite<00:04:42.849> good<00:04:43.119> hipfire<00:04:43.539> accuracy<00:04:43.959> there<00:04:44.439> so

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
quite good hipfire accuracy there so

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.439 
quite good hipfire accuracy there so
maybe<00:04:45.069> it's<00:04:45.279> worth<00:04:45.339> utilizing<00:04:46.149> that<00:04:46.269> if

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
maybe it's worth utilizing that if

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:47.969 
maybe it's worth utilizing that if
you're<00:04:46.629> on<00:04:46.779> a<00:04:46.809> map<00:04:47.019> like<00:04:47.199> operation<00:04:47.619> Locker

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
you're on a map like operation Locker

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.189 
you're on a map like operation Locker
for<00:04:48.249> example<00:04:48.789> but<00:04:48.939> and<00:04:49.149> it<00:04:49.479> should<00:04:49.719> work<00:04:49.959> quite

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
for example but and it should work quite

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.719 
for example but and it should work quite
well<00:04:50.349> within<00:04:50.709> the<00:04:50.889> dragon's<00:04:51.249> teeth<00:04:51.429> maps

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
well within the dragon's teeth maps

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.789 
well within the dragon's teeth maps
actually<00:04:52.239> because<00:04:52.869> most<00:04:53.109> of<00:04:53.199> those<00:04:53.349> are<00:04:53.589> going

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:53.799 
actually because most of those are going

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:56.939 
actually because most of those are going
to<00:04:53.949> sort<00:04:54.159> of<00:04:54.219> be<00:04:54.509> urban<00:04:55.509> warfare<00:04:55.779> maps<00:04:56.379> the

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
to sort of be urban warfare maps the

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.019 
to sort of be urban warfare maps the
only<00:04:57.129> one<00:04:57.249> I've<00:04:57.369> seen<00:04:57.639> it<00:04:57.819> I've<00:04:57.999> seen

00:04:58.019 --> 00:04:58.029 
only one I've seen it I've seen

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:00.239 
only one I've seen it I've seen
propaganda<00:04:58.929> which<00:04:59.079> I<00:04:59.289> really<00:04:59.769> like<00:04:59.949> the<00:05:00.069> look

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:00.249 
propaganda which I really like the look

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:02.489 
propaganda which I really like the look
of<00:05:00.369> which<00:05:00.579> is<00:05:00.729> set<00:05:00.999> in<00:05:01.239> Pyongyang<00:05:01.899> in<00:05:02.139> North

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:02.499 
of which is set in Pyongyang in North

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:04.679 
of which is set in Pyongyang in North
Korea<00:05:02.919> it's<00:05:03.399> a<00:05:03.519> little<00:05:03.759> bit<00:05:03.849> more<00:05:04.029> open<00:05:04.419> which

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:04.689 
Korea it's a little bit more open which

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.689 
Korea it's a little bit more open which
will<00:05:04.869> allow<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.619> Bulldog<00:05:06.069> to<00:05:06.249> sort<00:05:06.459> of<00:05:06.519> take

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
will allow the Bulldog to sort of take

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:08.669 
will allow the Bulldog to sort of take
people<00:05:07.029> down<00:05:07.179> at<00:05:07.329> longer<00:05:07.509> ranges<00:05:08.019> but<00:05:08.199> there

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:08.679 
people down at longer ranges but there

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:10.829 
people down at longer ranges but there
are<00:05:08.889> sort<00:05:09.129> of<00:05:09.189> stairways<00:05:09.759> and<00:05:09.789> tighten<00:05:10.779> the

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:10.839 
are sort of stairways and tighten the

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:12.329 
are sort of stairways and tighten the
alleyways<00:05:11.229> that<00:05:11.439> you<00:05:11.499> can<00:05:11.649> see<00:05:11.829> there<00:05:12.009> as<00:05:12.159> well

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:12.339 
alleyways that you can see there as well

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:14.579 
alleyways that you can see there as well
so<00:05:12.369> having<00:05:13.179> the<00:05:13.449> laser<00:05:13.659> sight<00:05:13.959> on<00:05:13.989> there<00:05:14.349> may

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:14.589 
so having the laser sight on there may

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:16.439 
so having the laser sight on there may
be<00:05:14.619> beneficial<00:05:15.219> all<00:05:15.579> the<00:05:15.729> time<00:05:15.909> just<00:05:15.939> to<00:05:16.269> keep

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
be beneficial all the time just to keep

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:17.819 
be beneficial all the time just to keep
that<00:05:16.629> thing<00:05:16.869> on<00:05:17.049> there<00:05:17.229> in<00:05:17.349> case<00:05:17.499> you<00:05:17.679> ever

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:17.829 
that thing on there in case you ever

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:19.289 
that thing on there in case you ever
come<00:05:18.159> into<00:05:18.399> one<00:05:18.489> of<00:05:18.549> those<00:05:18.669> close-quarters

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:19.299 
come into one of those close-quarters

00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:22.709 
come into one of those close-quarters
situations<00:05:20.249> now<00:05:21.249> so<00:05:21.609> far<00:05:21.879> the<00:05:22.089> bulldog<00:05:22.509> has

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
situations now so far the bulldog has

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:24.539 
situations now so far the bulldog has
been<00:05:22.929> quite<00:05:23.199> a<00:05:23.229> good<00:05:23.469> weapon<00:05:23.649> to<00:05:23.949> me<00:05:24.099> the<00:05:24.249> only

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:24.549 
been quite a good weapon to me the only

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:26.549 
been quite a good weapon to me the only
time<00:05:24.759> I<00:05:24.789> found<00:05:25.209> myself<00:05:25.449> being<00:05:25.959> let<00:05:26.259> down<00:05:26.289> by

00:05:26.549 --> 00:05:26.559 
time I found myself being let down by

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.669 
time I found myself being let down by
this<00:05:26.829> thing<00:05:27.219> is<00:05:27.429> when<00:05:28.149> the<00:05:28.389> target<00:05:28.899> was<00:05:29.109> moving

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:29.679 
this thing is when the target was moving

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:31.019 
this thing is when the target was moving
at<00:05:29.919> quite<00:05:30.279> a<00:05:30.309> distance

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:31.029 
at quite a distance

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:33.989 
at quite a distance
basically<00:05:31.839> this<00:05:32.109> thing's<00:05:32.379> only<00:05:32.709> got<00:05:32.999> 450

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:33.999 
basically this thing's only got 450

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.119 
basically this thing's only got 450
meters<00:05:34.299> a<00:05:34.329> second<00:05:34.809> bullet<00:05:34.989> velocity<00:05:35.649> so<00:05:35.919> it's

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
meters a second bullet velocity so it's

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.189 
meters a second bullet velocity so it's
not<00:05:36.429> great<00:05:36.699> for<00:05:36.849> hitting<00:05:37.359> people<00:05:37.389> if<00:05:37.959> they're

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
not great for hitting people if they're

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.559 
not great for hitting people if they're
running<00:05:38.589> at<00:05:38.709> long<00:05:38.919> distances<00:05:39.519> medium<00:05:40.419> and

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:40.569 
running at long distances medium and

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.269 
running at long distances medium and
close<00:05:40.749> range<00:05:41.079> no<00:05:41.409> problem<00:05:41.799> it<00:05:41.889> doesn't<00:05:42.159> really

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:42.279 
close range no problem it doesn't really

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:43.559 
close range no problem it doesn't really
make<00:05:42.489> a<00:05:42.519> difference<00:05:42.639> because<00:05:43.299> they're<00:05:43.419> so

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:43.569 
make a difference because they're so

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:44.850 
make a difference because they're so
close<00:05:43.749> to<00:05:44.019> you<00:05:44.110> that<00:05:44.139> the<00:05:44.289> bullets<00:05:44.559> already

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
close to you that the bullets already

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.109 
close to you that the bullets already
got<00:05:45.039> to<00:05:45.159> them<00:05:45.279> before<00:05:45.309> you've<00:05:45.669> even<00:05:45.729> thought

00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:46.119 
got to them before you've even thought

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:48.959 
got to them before you've even thought
about<00:05:46.239> it<00:05:46.419> but<00:05:47.229> at<00:05:47.379> long-range<00:05:47.619> it<00:05:48.399> does<00:05:48.729> let

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:48.969 
about it but at long-range it does let

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:51.059 
about it but at long-range it does let
you<00:05:49.089> down<00:05:49.269> a<00:05:49.479> little<00:05:49.689> bit<00:05:49.989> once<00:05:50.439> again<00:05:50.739> if<00:05:50.949> you

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
you down a little bit once again if you

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:52.769 
you down a little bit once again if you
can<00:05:51.309> learn<00:05:51.519> to<00:05:51.789> lead<00:05:51.999> your<00:05:52.179> target<00:05:52.389> properly

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:52.779 
can learn to lead your target properly

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:56.189 
can learn to lead your target properly
just<00:05:53.169> like<00:05:53.459> calculating<00:05:54.459> for<00:05:54.729> for<00:05:55.389> recoil<00:05:55.869> or

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
just like calculating for for recoil or

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.239 
just like calculating for for recoil or
anything<00:05:56.619> like<00:05:56.919> that

00:05:57.239 --> 00:05:57.249 
anything like that

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:59.069 
anything like that
then<00:05:57.699> you'll<00:05:57.879> be<00:05:57.909> able<00:05:58.149> to<00:05:58.389> succeed<00:05:58.749> with<00:05:58.959> this

00:05:59.069 --> 00:05:59.079 
then you'll be able to succeed with this

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:00.299 
then you'll be able to succeed with this
weapon<00:05:59.289> it's<00:05:59.589> just<00:05:59.739> something<00:05:59.979> that<00:06:00.009> you<00:06:00.099> need

00:06:00.299 --> 00:06:00.309 
weapon it's just something that you need

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:02.219 
weapon it's just something that you need
to<00:06:00.489> make<00:06:00.639> sure<00:06:00.849> you're<00:06:00.999> aware<00:06:01.329> of<00:06:01.599> if<00:06:01.809> you<00:06:02.019> are

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
to make sure you're aware of if you are

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.659 
to make sure you're aware of if you are
going<00:06:02.259> to<00:06:02.469> fire<00:06:02.709> at<00:06:02.860> people<00:06:03.129> at<00:06:03.219> long<00:06:03.399> range

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
going to fire at people at long range

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.459 
going to fire at people at long range
especially<00:06:04.179> if<00:06:04.629> they<00:06:04.749> put<00:06:04.929> something<00:06:04.959> like<00:06:05.229> an

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469 
especially if they put something like an

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.219 
especially if they put something like an
ace<00:06:05.589> 23<00:06:06.219> which<00:06:06.429> has<00:06:06.610> got<00:06:06.849> massively<00:06:07.839> higher

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
ace 23 which has got massively higher

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.049 
ace 23 which has got massively higher
bullet<00:06:08.649> velocity<00:06:08.769> than<00:06:09.339> what<00:06:09.549> you've<00:06:09.759> got

00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:10.059 
bullet velocity than what you've got

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:12.059 
bullet velocity than what you've got
then<00:06:10.689> really<00:06:11.229> you<00:06:11.259> do<00:06:11.499> just<00:06:11.679> need<00:06:11.799> to<00:06:11.919> pay

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
then really you do just need to pay

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:13.589 
then really you do just need to pay
attention<00:06:12.099> of<00:06:12.669> that<00:06:12.879> you<00:06:13.119> can<00:06:13.269> still<00:06:13.449> succeed

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
attention of that you can still succeed

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.349 
attention of that you can still succeed
but<00:06:14.079> just<00:06:14.559> make<00:06:14.709> sure<00:06:14.739> you're<00:06:15.069> aware<00:06:15.359> so

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:16.359 
but just make sure you're aware so

00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:18.149 
but just make sure you're aware so
overall<00:06:16.809> I'm<00:06:16.989> really<00:06:17.049> impressed<00:06:17.649> with<00:06:17.889> the

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159 
overall I'm really impressed with the

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.009 
overall I'm really impressed with the
Bulldog<00:06:18.309> I<00:06:18.669> really<00:06:18.939> like<00:06:19.149> it<00:06:19.329> as<00:06:19.449> a<00:06:19.479> weapon

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:20.019 
Bulldog I really like it as a weapon

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:22.139 
Bulldog I really like it as a weapon
it's<00:06:20.469> not<00:06:20.739> really<00:06:21.009> something<00:06:21.219> I<00:06:21.519> would<00:06:21.729> use<00:06:21.939> on

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:22.149 
it's not really something I would use on

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:23.909 
it's not really something I would use on
a<00:06:22.179> regular<00:06:22.269> basis<00:06:23.109> I'm<00:06:23.289> one<00:06:23.499> of<00:06:23.589> those<00:06:23.709> guys

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
a regular basis I'm one of those guys

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.279 
a regular basis I'm one of those guys
that<00:06:24.189> prefers<00:06:24.549> to<00:06:24.789> use<00:06:24.819> the<00:06:25.509> assault<00:06:25.839> rifles

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
that prefers to use the assault rifles

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:28.739 
that prefers to use the assault rifles
with<00:06:26.469> really<00:06:26.829> high<00:06:27.039> rates<00:06:27.369> of<00:06:27.549> fire<00:06:27.849> in<00:06:28.359> fact<00:06:28.629> I

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:28.749 
with really high rates of fire in fact I

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:30.389 
with really high rates of fire in fact I
really<00:06:28.989> like<00:06:29.109> just<00:06:29.229> using<00:06:29.559> the<00:06:29.619> carbines<00:06:30.129> the

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:30.399 
really like just using the carbines the
