00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.860
 hello everybody is me you black and 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.900
 I came back here on call of duty 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.610
 ghost after some video I didn't do 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.100
 if this game because why is it today 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.930
 went January on both xbox 360 and up 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.670
 xbox one has released the new dlc called 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.500
 onslaught this dlc 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.600
 in addition to the four multiplayer maps 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.060
 to the extension map of which vi 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.910
 I will speak specifically in other videos 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.770
 maybe I'll do it if I can already today 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.320
 or maybe in the next few days 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.970
 I'm here to tell you about the new weapon 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.010
 which included in the course of the 5 starmi 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.620
 called maverick and year and sniper 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.290
 rifle or maverick assault rifle either 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.640
 assault rifles and sniper rifle 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.410
 call of duty has also been added 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.600
 ghost this weapon really is 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.399
 a double weapon because the same weapon 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.590
 we find under two categories under the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.930
 assault rifle category called 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.170
 maverick is under the rifle category of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.670
 precision called metric a2 very well 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.980
 speaking of the weapon the question that arises 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.480
 spontaneous is because this weapon we find 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.280
 under two different categories 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.080
 the underlying principle that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.549
 the weapon we use is as it possesses 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.619
 on balance, however, there is precision 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.420
 the same however is modified a 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.920
 so naturally in the design so it will come 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.840
 a slightly different shape e 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.460
 naturally as I imagine anyone 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.900
 can understand having goals 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.850
 different we start from the version 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.710
 sniper of this harmos and from maverick 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.020
 and 2 on this basic mounted weapon a 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.340
 modified tracer sight compared to 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.930
 classic viewfinder tracers that 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.439
 we usually applied if shotgun 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.390
 assault 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.650
 however its functionalities remain 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.810
 such and such if not that of 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.759
 allow us a greater zoom 15 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.619
 will color ours orange 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.880
 interface allowing us to identify 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.320
 much more easily in the months 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.360
 especially when they are from 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.950
 long distances and or maybe in maps 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.780
 a little darker and therefore companies the map 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.579
 fog the new but program is given in one 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.439
 very foggy area however a 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.939
 compensate for the advantage offered by 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.290
 this million tracer that I emphasize 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.729
 it does not cost us any points 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.460
 team because it is basic 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.290
 on the weapon is the recoil of this weapon 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.600
 because despite not being a bolt action 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.340
 sniper then a gun like a spring 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.229
 every shot we hope we should three 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.700
 behind the spring it is instead a 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.110
 rifle is that it also allows us to 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.149
 shoot one shot after another a lot 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.979
 really to a recoil really 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.329
 high so I aimed to kill 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.430
 your opponent with the first shot 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.560
 or I advise against resigning 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.230
 however the blasts gust leaving it miram 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.939
 activates therefore not letting go of the lever 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.049
 of the viewfinder 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.609
 let's move on to the second version of 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.620
 this weapon sial maverick ivc 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.359
 of the normal assault this weapon of the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.159
 30 round magazine a weapon with a 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.810
 really high range of fire then 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.510
 despite being excellent from medium and long 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.069
 distances as an excellent assault rifle 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.420
 also from the ropes distances because thanks 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.400
 with a really high vogue layer 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.840
 we can consider it a kind of 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.420
 submachine gun on which the viewfinder 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.790
 metals to the standard viewfinder that already 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.109
 it is applied so it's really great 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.849
 needless to go and spend points for 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.709
 laser sights rather millionaire Dr. 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.689
 maybe I recommend a suppressor of 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.180
 flame that virus that will help you 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.859
 reduce flare 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.540
 finally the maps on which advice 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.700
 use this weapon for how much 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.319
 concerns the normal maverick if shotgun 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.090
 assault and excellent in my opinion su 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.290
 any type of map is not there 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.909
 maps better first but so far 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.560
 worse while in regards to 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.459
 the maverick and 2 that gun 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.010
 precision 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.260
 I recommend it in size maps 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.730
 higher then maybe shake it at 9 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.709
 map that come out point that are out 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.449
 precisely with this dlc but I recommend it 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.250
 more in some of the maps 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:22.139
 standards therefore present in the game fin 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.849
 from the beginning such as the map 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.069
 stonehaven in the castle map 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.780
 so guys I hope the video is there 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.280
