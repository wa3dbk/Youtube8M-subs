00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.950
 you hello to all and all 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.300
 welcome to north to report the 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.260
 little heading of the curtain peace then 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.790
 this week no appetizer 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.380
 but I still wanted to do this 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.269
 small section for you then we will 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.820
 start directly with the report 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.960
 it was fnatic against 4 week of day 1 and 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.070
 I'm trying to postpone it's the team of 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.519
 fnatic while I had it north 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.900
 last week 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.250
 I am the first disappointed you go 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.109
 why while here 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.300
 there was an advance of 5 cases for the 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.380
 fnatic have infested with yellowstar then 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.939
 that look reckless and not even the 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.800
 greece and a brand logo so he 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.210
 has rushed too fast to 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.230
 the situation there was push on the 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.880
 top is the friend of the names would rather 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.110
 prized to be able to have the information 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.399
 on the opposing team and beyond that we 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.320
 go go in the head in the jungle 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.700
 adversary without vision we are 4 then 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.890
 we have five corpses are a team 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.300
 experienced we are the number one team 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.010
 in europe and it's the team that wants 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.210
 represent europe at the level of the world 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.379
 and watch what is taking face 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.270
 redhead 4 a turnaround 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.920
 because it will end in help yes 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.270
 an ace for queries while there 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.039
 had five corpses the fnatic 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.820
 it must not happen we did not take all 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.410
 the elements in account we got 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.090
 precipitated and unfortunately this is the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.410
 star who was the victim proposed a 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.059
 good enough it's not very fat that happens to 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.079
 everyone goes out but a few meters 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.519
 later two minutes later they get 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.379
 find in the same situation seat 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.540
 missed the part of fnatic where they will be 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.000
 totally returned by the roccat on 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.560
 see behind these events the azir that 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.570
 was blocking done beaven with in 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.250
 more to a very nice intervention by 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.250
 name of steve the french coming 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.500
 totally canceled the threat of the azir and 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.210
 behind the rocha that debunks their team 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.340
 fight and that again surprises 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.690
 the fnatic on a failed seat two 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.770
 teamfight missed shot after blow 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.450
 does not look like fnatic 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.920
 I am disappointed and you are postponed 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.930
 attention next week we go on 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.510
 directly with the north to chtouka and 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.160
 ios face i was week two day 2 and the 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.930
 person I have chosen to honor this 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.310
 week it's up to him to lead him alone and 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.420
 not his team because watching 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.110
 with his rum bally takes the initiative 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.250
 crazy 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.300
 teleportation while his opponent 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.430
 does not have deportation since then 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.690
 totally brain behind ultimate who 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.250
 slows down the opponent we can say good 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.630
 we could have done better but 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.620
 look it's not over at 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.970
 data that really takes the 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.980
 transversal which is going to be a big 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.900
 threatens silk the backup elements 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.770
 who will arrive and pushed dexter then 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.690
 that first shake is totally 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.160
 locked up it unlocks the famous they 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.230
 lajan with his beautiful teleportation 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.580
 who is allowed to wed the ajena and one 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.020
 can say well it's nothing that knows 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.670
 that he does not know much except 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.800
 that behind we validate a turret 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.030
 thanks to the atp of 2md since it is him 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.740
 who initiated this action 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.810
 we will validate the first dragon which 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.350
 thanks to the water atp must lead and in 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.990
 exchange look at what hands are doing 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.540
 they do not take anything no turn no 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.530
 jungle no farm nothing special because 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.950
 that must lead takes the initiative of 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.540
 bach 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.630
 he leaves directly this at full rate 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.850
 to defend t1 turret from its rate 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.260
 full and so we have really beats behind 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.700
 joy to who try to push but there 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.200
 will not happen and on the contrary to the data 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.300
 who come again the element 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.350
 key to the sub region he buys for 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.060
 again look for them first 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.290
 skew twice in a row his first 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.610
 relief who takes the sauce like those 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.840
 who will not get out so we have to 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.800
 to lead that does a louvre action that goes 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.280
 continue to watch the damage 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.650
 monstrous 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.730
 the ultimate that separates the two players 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.500
 who has paved Norman of range there is like 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.150
 if talking about player he must rely on 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.010
 dedicated models 2 must lead both 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.490
 that he can do nothing and joao who will 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.480
 to be forced to die under the eyes 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.540
 of his teammates 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.940
 did we take three a tower a drake 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.770
 without giving anything back to must lead 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.140
 to totally carrie his team in 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.700
 this game bravo to him is the honor 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.080
 of the week we find ourselves well before 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.070
