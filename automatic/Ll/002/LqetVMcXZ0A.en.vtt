 Well, it's gorilla pod race too 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.449
 sar ie SLR- 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.369
 First of all, gorilla pods 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.230
 Well, it's 3 songs from the digital camera, but in the old days 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.739
 There is also a lot of money, for example, you can't afford money 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.249
 It is not possible to wrap it on such things 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.179
 It was convenient for the first time, but I expected support effect 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.890
 People can break their legs in the tributary if they can not handle single-lens reflex cameras 

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:32.310
 It is the first time in 4 years zoom lens 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.310
 There is a reason 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.150
 It's such a big difference when you can compare a normal voice 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.390
 Of course my feet 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.250
 Hardness is also different before the war Cat is a great birth Sasusa side 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.690
 It is attached to single-lens reflex camera 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.690
 Schema 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.310
 On the other hand 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.310
 You are winding 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.480
 It's fine is not 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.920
 Even though the single-lens reflex camera is okay, the lens I'm wearing is complete on this 28. 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.620
 It is a top product that can be realized with a very light lens by winning 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.320
 After all 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.530
 Zoom lens 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.880
 I would like to wear it 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.250
 High and familiar type 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.240
 The world's largest magnification is 10x, but 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.139
 No. 2 of the Venus continuous distillation method that can not be done 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.020
 with this 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.020
 How is it 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.690
 At once 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.720
 NPCs were opened 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 Oizumi Yoko 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.399
 Amateur 7777 in the ordinary 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.460
 I felt a little mean and narrowed the interval 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.610
 Date Masamune 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.860
 Hit 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.749
 You've usually gone 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:03.749
 thephone no good 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.310
 The bell was loud 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.190
 Hattori told 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.190
 Of course 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:13.680
 7 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.939
 liked it 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.509
 Revised by 3 times normal and this can be recommended 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:20.629
 really 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:21.959
 Even zoom lens
