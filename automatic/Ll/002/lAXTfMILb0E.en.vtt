 install nothing simply for the 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:28.230
 files that I left in the description 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.380
 once they click on the link, they will 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.230
 send to an advertising page 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:38.460
 They wait 6 seconds for him to jump 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.510

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.530
 giga is a little bit weary and is 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.830
 because it has all the directions but the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.110

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:26.659
 Once the download as we go 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.240
 to the arrow of our browser 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.469
 We give you a right click and look for the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.469
 destination of the discharge 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:40.000
 once here then unzip this 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.000
 cip 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.240
 I already have it decompressed and I'm going 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.470
 to show 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.810
 we go to the icon that we give right click 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.670
 Let's send 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.110
 desktop this is going to send an access 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.440
 direct to the desk so that 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.390
 have better ease when starting the 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.190
 game then we go to room so that 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.190
 we check that all the groups are 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.740
 and this is the file for 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.690
 keyboard configuration we go back 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:21.450
 we close down we minimize everything 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.050
 we see on the desktop the icon of the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.870
 we give them double click but there is something 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.050
 very important and it is that all these are 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.480
 the rooms but so that it works well 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.560
 let's file update run list 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.560
 and then choose 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.380
 we give this file a choice 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.640
 will not send to open a little window 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.790
 we give the run accept 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.040
 and it's all right it's ready to 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.819
 play by double clicking we can choose 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.609
 any game 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.670
 to configure the controls we are going to 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.770
 option 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.050
 controls settings and here goes to 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.100
 go out where we can configure our 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.800
 control if we have a control that is not 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.900
 just the keyboard because here it's going to come out in 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.939
 where 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.230
 all this is the configuration of 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.900
 control 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.130
