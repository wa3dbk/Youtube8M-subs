the animated the third season the first

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.530 
the animated the third season the first
episode<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.260> think<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.350> called<00:01:07.470> trans<00:01:07.770> warped

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
episode I think it's called trans warped

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.060 
episode I think it's called trans warped
he's<00:01:09.540> also<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.900> character<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.770> there<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
he's also a character in there in the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.310 
he's also a character in there in the
beginning<00:01:11.600> gets<00:01:12.600> beat<00:01:12.810> up<00:01:12.900> pretty<00:01:13.080> badly

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
beginning gets beat up pretty badly

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.170 
beginning gets beat up pretty badly
though<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:13.950> definitely<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> character<00:01:14.970> that's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
though but definitely a character that's

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.020 
though but definitely a character that's
another<00:01:15.479> reason<00:01:15.689> why<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.670> picked<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.759> guy<00:01:18.000> up

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
another reason why I picked this guy up

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.050 
another reason why I picked this guy up
and<00:01:19.040> always<00:01:20.040> kind<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.430> wanted<00:01:20.610> him<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.000> I

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
and always kind of wanted him but I

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.789 
and always kind of wanted him but I
didn't<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.420> Amato<00:01:21.810> version<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.560> when<00:01:22.770> I

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
didn't like the Amato version but when I

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.060 
didn't like the Amato version but when I
saw<00:01:23.009> pictures<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.430> hot<00:01:23.759> nothing<00:01:24.860> look<00:01:25.860> pretty

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
saw pictures of hot nothing look pretty

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.100 
saw pictures of hot nothing look pretty
good<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:27.170> yeah<00:01:28.170> man<00:01:28.380> let's<00:01:28.770> take<00:01:28.920> them<00:01:29.070> out

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
good so yeah man let's take them out

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.260 
good so yeah man let's take them out
here<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.320> are<00:01:31.470> both<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.340> their<00:01:32.520> alternate

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
here they are both in their alternate

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.100 
here they are both in their alternate
mode<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:36.200> Minicon<00:01:37.200> jolt<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.850> blades<00:01:39.119> do<00:01:39.360> spin

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
mode and Minicon jolt the blades do spin

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.010 
mode and Minicon jolt the blades do spin
pretty<00:01:40.350> good<00:01:40.939> and<00:01:43.070> he's<00:01:44.070> got<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:45.020> Minicon

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
pretty good and he's got that Minicon

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.069 
pretty good and he's got that Minicon
port<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.560> guess<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> bottom<00:01:47.460> here<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
port I guess at the bottom here and

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.350 
port I guess at the bottom here and
suppose<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:50.640> peg<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.970> at<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> back

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
suppose to you can peg it at the back

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.899 
suppose to you can peg it at the back
but<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:52.619> not<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.070> be<00:01:53.130> much<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.790> time

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
but it's not going to be much it's time

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.370 
but it's not going to be much it's time
we<00:01:54.030> practical<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.689> don't<00:01:54.840> know<00:01:54.899> why<00:01:55.049> then

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
we practical I don't know why then

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.950 
we practical I don't know why then
designer<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.950> way<00:01:56.299> but<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.450> instructions

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
designer this way but the instructions

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.280 
designer this way but the instructions
tell<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:59.060> tell<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.240> put<00:02:00.450> them<00:02:00.540> like<00:02:00.930> so

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
tell you do tell you to put them like so

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.569 
tell you do tell you to put them like so
and<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:02.219> now<00:02:02.850> you've<00:02:03.119> got<00:02:03.360> them<00:02:04.280> on<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> back

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
and then now you've got them on the back

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.520 
and then now you've got them on the back
attached<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.299> him<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.750> these<00:02:06.960> attached<00:02:07.350> is

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
attached to him so on these attached is

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.700 
attached to him so on these attached is
fairly<00:02:07.740> long

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
fairly long

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.490 
fairly long
you<00:02:09.550> know<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.330> hotshot<00:02:10.960> does<00:02:11.140> well<00:02:11.320> pretty

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
you know and hotshot does well pretty

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.060 
you know and hotshot does well pretty
good<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:13.440> no<00:02:14.440> problem<00:02:14.800> there<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:16.860> let's<00:02:17.860> just

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
good so no problem there and let's just

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.200 
good so no problem there and let's just
transform<00:02:18.700> em<00:02:19.060> well<00:02:19.510> quick<00:02:19.660> very<00:02:20.320> simple<00:02:21.210> take

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
transform em well quick very simple take

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.010 
transform em well quick very simple take
the<00:02:22.390> feet<00:02:22.570> down<00:02:24.030> put<00:02:25.030> this<00:02:25.150> back<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.690> that's

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
the feet down put this back and that's

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.370 
the feet down put this back and that's
it<00:02:26.320> bring<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.740> arms<00:02:26.770> out<00:02:27.070> very<00:02:27.910> similar<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.380> is

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
it bring the arms out very similar to is

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.600 
it bring the arms out very similar to is
a<00:02:30.240> model<00:02:31.240> version<00:02:31.860> but<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.010> transformation

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
a model version but the transformation

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.050 
a model version but the transformation
is<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.700> little<00:02:33.910> different<00:02:34.240> and<00:02:34.590> sin<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:36.820> does<00:02:37.000> a

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
is a little different and sin so does a

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.950 
is a little different and sin so does a
stand<00:02:37.330> but<00:02:37.600> that's<00:02:37.990> jolt<00:02:38.380> Minicon<00:02:39.010> jolt<00:02:39.310> and

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
stand but that's jolt Minicon jolt and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.000 
stand but that's jolt Minicon jolt and
then<00:02:41.100> let's<00:02:42.100> transform<00:02:42.550> hotshot<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.830> what

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
then let's transform hotshot and what

articulation in the arms you have front
and<00:05:33.280> movement<00:05:33.820> back<00:05:34.240> a<00:05:34.270> little<00:05:34.570> bit<00:05:34.720> but<00:05:34.840> it's

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
and movement back a little bit but it's

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.430 
and movement back a little bit but it's
tendered<00:05:35.820> moves<00:05:36.820> out<00:05:37.000> just<00:05:37.240> a<00:05:37.330> bit<00:05:37.539> you've<00:05:38.289> got

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440

album<00:05:38.830> movement<00:05:39.250> and<00:05:39.729> that's<00:05:40.060> about<00:05:40.180> it<00:05:40.300> but

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
album movement and that's about it but

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.140 
album movement and that's about it but
you've<00:05:41.199> got<00:05:41.349> more<00:05:41.550> leg<00:05:42.550> movement<00:05:42.909> you<00:05:43.000> got

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
you've got more leg movement you got

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.330 
you've got more leg movement you got
knees<00:05:43.389> movement<00:05:44.020> in<00:05:44.139> and<00:05:44.260> out<00:05:44.380> you<00:05:45.070> can<00:05:45.220> also

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
knees movement in and out you can also

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.920 
knees movement in and out you can also
move<00:05:45.550> outwards<00:05:45.940> like<00:05:46.030> so<00:05:46.300> if<00:05:46.449> you<00:05:46.539> move<00:05:46.690> back

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
move outwards like so if you move back

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.990 
move outwards like so if you move back
and<00:05:47.680> then<00:05:48.659> so<00:05:49.659> and<00:05:49.870> also<00:05:50.020> we<00:05:50.289> can<00:05:50.320> twist<00:05:50.650> them

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
and then so and also we can twist them

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.439 
and then so and also we can twist them
look<00:05:52.000> like<00:05:52.120> that<00:05:52.330> so<00:05:52.840> a<00:05:53.110> little<00:05:54.070> bit<00:05:54.280> of

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:54.449 
look like that so a little bit of

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:56.700 
look like that so a little bit of
hindrance<00:05:55.449> in<00:05:55.570> the<00:05:55.659> articulation<00:05:56.320> compared

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
hindrance in the articulation compared

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.129 
hindrance in the articulation compared
to<00:05:56.830> the<00:05:56.919> other<00:05:57.120> leg<00:05:58.120> universe<00:05:58.510> figures<00:05:58.870> and

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
to the other leg universe figures and

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.279 
to the other leg universe figures and
you<00:05:59.349> can<00:05:59.470> also<00:05:59.620> put<00:05:59.919> the<00:06:00.130> Minicon<00:06:00.550> on<00:06:01.539> top<00:06:02.020> of

you can also put the Minicon on top of

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:06.469 
you can also put the Minicon on top of
all<00:06:02.889> you<00:06:03.070> see<00:06:03.280> transforming<00:06:04.150> back<00:06:04.830> quick

little different version than the air

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.730

mata<00:06:36.900> and<00:06:37.900> the<00:06:37.990> transformation<00:06:38.230> is<00:06:38.710> just

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
mata and the transformation is just
