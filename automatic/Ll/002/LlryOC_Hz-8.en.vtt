00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.009
 Y 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.009
 or not 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.789
 We are in Madrid at the offices of 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.710
 mountain to try one of the first 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.630
 prototypes of oculus ruiz that we have in 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.360
 Spain and that that colorist 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.369
 you will ask then are these glasses that 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.289
 they offer us something very similar to the 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.300
 virtual reality an immersion system 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.300
 what are we going to try right now 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.250
 under this viewer aspect of 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.050
 infrared what is hidden is a 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.670
 Stereoscopic vision device 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.640
 It is much lighter than it seems 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.930
 barely 300 grams in the hand and has 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.860
 It looks very comfortable, I'm going to 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.860
 try for the first time 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.470
 they have advised me to hold on to the 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.660
 table in case the printing is too much 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.880
 great and the truth is that it is difficult to 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.390
 write the level of investment that 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.479
 we have 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.610
 an image that surrounds me in 360 degrees 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.650
 completely three-dimensional and what I 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.690
 I'm looking like it's on top of a 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.979
 trolley is what you see in the 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.979
 screen in front of me 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.240
 the truth is that he is giving me laughter 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.400
 because the printing 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.560
 spectacular the best that I can tell you 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.310
 is that it's like feeling inside this 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.619
 roller coaster 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.799
 of course you realize that 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.180
 is a video game are 3d graphics at 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.880
 better there are small saw teeth 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.280
 little pixilation but the important thing is 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.960
 the immersion of one within this 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.140
 3d environment and if I try to keep myself 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.590
 still not to get far and paste a 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.880
 cable pull is because you will not have 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.590
 that you are inside my eyes 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.170
 to realize what is happening 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.590
 the drawn distance is not the most 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.530
 impressive but if the look at 360 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.500
 degrees and see that the machine a pc with 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.810
 a medium technology graphics card 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.549
 is able to put on screen because that 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.240
 all the elements without that in any 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.210
 moment 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.620
 we found no emptiness that 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.330
 applications can have this for the 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.520
 games then in a shooter at first 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.860
 person would be something really 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.850
 spectacular the only thing I do not get is 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.920
 see myself but everything else 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.550
 it seems that we have made a reality 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.550
 of alternatives 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.850
 you will ask what team we are 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.220
 using to reproduce our 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.900
 experience with oculus rif is about 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.290
 a mount inÃ©s martos with a processor 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.290
 core i7 and 8 gb ram memory ddr3 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.660
 virtual reality returns to the field of 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.270
 video games thanks to the glasses 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.400
 oculus red what we try is a 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.770
 very light prototype of just 400 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.670
 grams that connects to a computer to 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.710
 dvi and hdmi through the USB ports 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.020
 interior lenses show an image 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:32.140
 with a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.480
 640 x 800 for each eye this kit has been 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.710
 developed in an artisanal way and 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.450
 will put on sale with light 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.910
 modifications throughout the year 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.610
 next to know more about glasses 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.520
 oculus rif we speak with one of the bosses 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.950
 of product of the mountain the oculus alone 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.890
 it only gives you experience 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.100
 visual but with some kits that already 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.500
 are developing you may be able to receive 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.730
 that feedback throughout your body can you 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.590
 feel the bullets with a vest or 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.050
 you can throw yourself to the ground and roll for a 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.770
 At the moment, only the 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.510
 development kit 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.790
 what exactly does that serve to 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.920
 developers that give free rein 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.860
 to your imagination and can and can 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.230
 pose an infinity of projects 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.970
 we do not know what they are and is 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.290
 developing we do not know if 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.730
 together with oculus or with a 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.890
 equal technology 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.650
 for the playstation 4 a system a 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.420
 similar system is still unknown 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.090
 price and the release date of the 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.130
 Oculus rif glasses in Spain 'by the 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.960
 At the moment we can anticipate that the 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.230
 impression of playing with them deserves the 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.230
 pain
