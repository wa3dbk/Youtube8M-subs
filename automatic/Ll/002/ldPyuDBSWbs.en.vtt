00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
a lot of reaction time something that's

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.190 
a lot of reaction time something that's
great<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.910> get<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.510> get<00:02:23.660> dirty<00:02:23.900> with<00:02:24.019> the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
great to get in and get dirty with the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.080 
great to get in and get dirty with the
character<00:02:24.530> right<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.370> one<00:02:25.519> combo<00:02:25.940> of

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
character right this is the one combo of

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.720 
character right this is the one combo of
like<00:02:26.239> actually<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:27.019> even<00:02:27.650> consider<00:02:28.280> using<00:02:28.489> with

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
like actually I even consider using with

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.920 
like actually I even consider using with
them<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.000> only<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> quarter<00:02:29.510> combo<00:02:29.810> is

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
them and it's only a quarter combo is

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.360 
them and it's only a quarter combo is
that<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.290> doesn't<00:02:30.620> work<00:02:30.709> outside<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.280> they'll

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
that it doesn't work outside and they'll

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.309 
that it doesn't work outside and they'll
open<00:02:31.670> his<00:02:32.030> moves<00:02:32.269> are<00:02:32.360> always<00:02:32.630> too<00:02:32.780> short<00:02:32.810> are

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
open his moves are always too short are

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.870 
open his moves are always too short are
always<00:02:33.650> too<00:02:33.950> slow<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.280> come<00:02:34.519> out<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:34.790> actually

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
always too slow to come out and actually

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.400 
always too slow to come out and actually
connect<00:02:35.330> those<00:02:35.450> combos<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.989> really<00:02:36.230> don't<00:02:36.349> see

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
connect those combos I really don't see

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.520 
connect those combos I really don't see
you<00:02:36.650> can<00:02:36.800> try<00:02:37.010> as<00:02:37.190> combos<00:02:37.610> inside<00:02:38.450> of<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.049> game

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
you can try as combos inside of the game

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.470 
you can try as combos inside of the game
of<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.769> tutorials<00:02:40.250> but<00:02:40.489> those<00:02:41.000> are<00:02:41.209> really

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
of the tutorials but those are really

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.570 
of the tutorials but those are really
difficult<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.230> time<00:02:42.410> consuming<00:02:42.580> like

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
difficult and time consuming like

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.039 
difficult and time consuming like
tutorials<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.569> don't<00:02:44.750> get<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.900> lot<00:02:44.989> of

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
tutorials and you don't get a lot of

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.630 
tutorials and you don't get a lot of
payoff<00:02:45.410> form<00:02:45.709> so<00:02:45.890> I'm<00:02:45.980> not<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.340> don't<00:02:46.549> really

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
payoff form so I'm not I don't really

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.920 
payoff form so I'm not I don't really
see<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:46.880> benefit<00:02:47.299> of<00:02:47.360> trying<00:02:47.569> to<00:02:47.660> do<00:02:47.750> those

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
see the benefit of trying to do those

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.960 
see the benefit of trying to do those
except<00:02:48.739> maybe<00:02:48.860> if<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.340> can<00:02:49.519> find<00:02:49.640> out<00:02:49.850> the

except maybe if you can find out the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.940 
except maybe if you can find out the
commons<00:02:50.330> I'm<00:02:50.420> sure<00:02:50.630> these<00:02:51.170> combos<00:02:51.590> are

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
commons I'm sure these combos are

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.890 
commons I'm sure these combos are
heavily<00:02:52.819> involved<00:02:53.090> in<00:02:53.299> these<00:02:53.420> costume

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
heavily involved in these costume

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.740 
heavily involved in these costume
changes<00:02:54.200> because<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.560> can<00:02:55.390> cancel<00:02:56.390> out<00:02:56.540> of

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
changes because you can cancel out of

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.740 
changes because you can cancel out of
the<00:02:56.840> transformation<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.769> can<00:02:57.950> transform

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
the transformation you can transform

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.030 
the transformation you can transform
that's<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.989> normal<00:03:00.290> tech<00:03:00.530> but<00:03:00.739> you<00:03:00.830> can<00:03:00.920> also

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
that's the normal tech but you can also

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.550 
that's the normal tech but you can also

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
transform and change that attack that

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.930 
transform and change that attack that
pops<00:03:03.799> out<00:03:03.980> from<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.250> i'm<00:03:04.340> sure<00:03:04.549> that's<00:03:04.790> what
