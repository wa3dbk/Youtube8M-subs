00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
that are more electronic in creating

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.840 
that are more electronic in creating
what<00:01:57.729> is<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:58.180> very<00:01:58.780> unique<00:01:59.110> sound<00:02:00.180> no<00:02:01.180> that's

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
I love being in the room and hearing

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.220 
I love being in the room and hearing
something<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.030> didn't<00:02:24.390> expect<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.750> happen<00:02:24.960> but

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
something I didn't expect to happen but

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.480 
something I didn't expect to happen but
it's<00:02:25.380> actually<00:02:25.680> better<00:02:25.890> than<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.190> thought<00:02:26.430> it

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
it's actually better than I thought it

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.400 
it's actually better than I thought it
would<00:02:26.730> be<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.510> that's<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.870> value<00:02:28.380> of

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
would be and that's the value of

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.490 
would be and that's the value of
bringing<00:02:29.040> all<00:02:29.430> these<00:02:29.610> different<00:02:30.000> parties<00:02:30.500> to

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
bringing all these different parties to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.949 
bringing all these different parties to
our

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.199 

the<00:02:40.349> game<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.980> set<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.280> two<00:02:41.730> different<00:02:42.000> time

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
the game is set in two different time

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.630 
the game is set in two different time
periods<00:02:42.239> ones<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.079> future<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:44.280> ones<00:02:44.459> in

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
periods ones in the future and ones in

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.910 
periods ones in the future and ones in
the<00:02:44.730> 80s<00:02:45.150> back<00:02:45.719> sort<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.079> in<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.230> Cold<00:02:46.500> War

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
the 80s back sort of in a Cold War

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.470 
the 80s back sort of in a Cold War
so<00:02:47.099> we<00:02:47.250> want<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.459> have<00:02:47.609> two<00:02:47.849> different<00:02:47.969> musical

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
so we want to have two different musical

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.649 
so we want to have two different musical
directions<00:02:48.810> for<00:02:49.230> each<00:02:49.590> time<00:02:50.549> period<00:02:50.659> we

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
directions for each time period we

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.420 
directions for each time period we
wanted<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.140> future<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.829> feel<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.069> little

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
wanted the the future to feel a little

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.500 
wanted the the future to feel a little
bit<00:02:53.640> more<00:02:53.700> slicker<00:02:54.359> and<00:02:55.760> have<00:02:56.760> maybe<00:02:57.090> more

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
bit more slicker and have maybe more

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.289 
bit more slicker and have maybe more
electronics<00:02:58.230> whereas<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.889> 80s<00:02:59.310> felt<00:02:59.609> feels<00:03:00.180> a

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
electronics whereas the 80s felt feels a

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:09.030 
electronics whereas the 80s felt feels a
little<00:03:00.389> bit<00:03:00.540> more<00:03:00.599> Kestrel

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040
