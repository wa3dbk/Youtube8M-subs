 Welcome to Dekkskifte's guide on how to find the right tire online. 

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:27.800
 On the left side there is a box with different filters that will help you find the right tire. 

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:38.567
 For example, you only want to see winter tires for a regular passenger car 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:47.400
 you need to select the 'passenger car winter tires' from the list of types. 

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:54.817
 The next thing to choose is size. 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:06.600
 If you are unsure how to find out what size you need, there is a guide that you find under the menu item 'Guides'. 

00:01:08.174 --> 00:01:24.800
 Start by choosing the width of your tire. If your size is '195 / 65R 15', 195 is your width. 

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:38.867
 Then select the tire height. That is the second number in the sequence, ie 65. 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:51.400
 Finally, the size of your rim is selected in inches (the last number). 

00:01:56.267 --> 00:02:04.570
 If you check 'Advanced Search' you can set the speed index and load index. 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.250
 See the explanation for these under the menu item 'Guides'. 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:26.150
 If you want to look at tires within a certain price level, you can specify it with the 'price slider'. 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:37.950
 By dragging on the two squares, you specify a price level that you want to search within. 

00:02:44.067 --> 00:03:03.200
 If you already have a tire in mind, you can just enter its name in the 'Free text' field. 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.750
 We have collected a lot of the industry's tire test and have embedded them in our system. 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:21.450
 This makes it easier for you to find the best tires, and therefore we always sort by default for reviews. 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:46.130
 You can also sort by name, price and popularity by clicking on one of them in the sort bar. Click again for reverse sorting. 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.100
 In this hypothetical example, we have chosen the tire 'Continental ContiWinterContact TS 830' 

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:10.630
 which is the best reported winter tire in winter 2011/2012. We therefore click on 'Read more'. 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:25.300
 Now we come to the selected tire's product page. More information about the tire can be found here. 

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:32.830
 All information provided on the 'Find the Tire' page is saved to this page. 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:41.650
 If you have specified winter tires, 195 / 65R 15 with a speed index 'T: max. 190 km / h, it will automatically enter these. 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:52.200
 If you enter the site somewhere else from a 'Find deck', you have to choose the type, size etc. 

00:04:54.067 --> 00:05:06.570
 You can also easily choose new settings, such as a new size. 

00:05:07.967 --> 00:05:12.970
 When you are satisfied with the settings, click on the 'BUY' button on the right. 

00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:31.920
 If you were to undo and would rather look at another tire, all your selected settings in the search feature are saved 

00:05:32.367 --> 00:05:39.620
 so when you press back, you do not have to re-enter it all. 

00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:50.130
 If you want to start all over again, you can always press the 'Reset filters' button. 

00:05:53.333 --> 00:06:06.000
 It was all for this time. We hope you got something out of the guide. If you have more questions, please feel free to write to kontakt@daekskifte.dk
