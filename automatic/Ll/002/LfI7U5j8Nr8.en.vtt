00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hi everyone, I'm going to do the 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.370
 tutorial of a very romantic touch and 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.469
 delicate for all ages one 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.599
 a little younger you can use 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.059
 At parties you start dividing santana. 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.330
 Side heat shield that went 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.550
 lateral divide this side or middle 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.160
 caught in that part of the top and you go 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.500
 start caching ando it's the bottom 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.260
 but can later on top 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.750
 the caches do not have to be perfect 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.239
 I prefer slightly larger ones 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.380
 which greater circumference than 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.760
 little ones 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.030
 Are you watching my dinner party? 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.670
 closed is a good thing as well without 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.510
 Well, anyway, you do not need to be right. 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.170
 right 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.309
 So everybody's good in this case without 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.170
 grab me 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.750
 so here it is only when the wind analyzes 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.390
 10 to 15 seconds standby hair and 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.739
 loosens the box can 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.059
 little bit a little bit but it has not 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.620
 much trouble 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.410
 now I'm finding the rest 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.489
 this part of my hair I started 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.950
 from top to bottom and again 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.500
 very right or wrong in that part until 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.320
 because as hair will get stuck in a 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.979
 you need to be afraid how you're going to stay 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.979
 this end 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.920
 now that I've got it all caught 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.560
 at the top of my head until more or 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.890
 less the position of my ear I go 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.990
 dividing this front part of the hair is 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.320
 you for her in the rest of that hair 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.329
 On both sides 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.970
 now soon after after this 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.860
 Division I'm going to get this hair back 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.180
 to my head I'm going to comb it 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.479
 position you normally 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.479
 grows is to analyze any wire 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.729
 whatever you have and I'll learn with two 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.950
 clips in this way to create a 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.350
 greater volume in the hairstyle 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.899
 now I will do is create another division 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.899
 the hair on the back of my 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.320
 ear I make a straight line almost 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.030
 half at the bottom of my head 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.160
 this hair again separates them 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.759
 these divisions need not be exact 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.950
 exact as i'm doing 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.680
 more or less in this area to 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.480
 the purpose that we will use the 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.220
 remaining hair that is not 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.430
 I did not have any division 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.980
 You'll do 11 1 twisted your hair 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.260
 and forming a whole with coke that 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.230
 place the curl has to appear then 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.470
 a very well malformed touch anyway 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.170
 knows with one of the parties in the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.049
 the bottom that you've separated will you 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.150
 send her back from the bun and 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.150
 hair tip you will learn with 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.670
 grapinho hiding it inside the 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.159
 where we had made a copy when 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.840
 You put a clip on 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.519
 to add coke and wick hair that 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.620
 You learned from the program. 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.970
 vertically and after pushing and 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.849
 horizontally 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.280
 again I hit the wick to not 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.480
 stay with a dog and attach with a 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.849
 remember to place it if it 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.230
 It will look like or bohemian well 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.450
 collapsed right 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.949
 in this front part you divide in two 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.530
 and very gently passes the party to 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:21.410
 part closest to your face 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.750
 from the farthest part and goes a twisting 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.669
 so the wicks and especially this 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.859
 first in crowd and consequently 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:30.379
 the rest you have to make a 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.269
 way too light so you can not 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.030
 a lot of hair because the grace of that 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.760
 this movement of the bunch is then combed 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.340
 so I do not think you can attest to it 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.889
 will put again rolling around 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.889
 of the coke trap inside the coke 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.819
 this is the natural result 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.190
 Now I'm doing the same thing in 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.549
 other side remembering that it is optional 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.400
 leave this strand above the ear not to 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.780
 nina dobrev left it I found it beautiful there 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.370
 You're seeing that I'm learning from 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.560
 clamp above the bun and now I go 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.979
 do with the rest of the average around 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.720
 this coke understand under the coke 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:18.019
 with grampinho as you are seeing there 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.400
 fashion you wore them 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.250
 wick 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.780
 are appearing is more or less so 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.120
 like I said you can leave 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.630
 the front or not you leave 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.389
 ideal is you and you do not have the undertone 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.699
 formal creek how do nina dobrev use is 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.340
 in the hairstyles in the toronto film fest goal 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.229
 straightened hairstyle as you want peace 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.780
 sprint hair to last all party and 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.330
 You do not have to undo everything in the 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.830
 bathroom is who wants to send me this 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.539
 look to ask anything can 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.680
 Sign in to facebook here below 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.870
 number if it is 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.460
 This is the end result. 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.650
 You liked it so much because 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.949
 I watched this video kisses and even 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.949
 next
