00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
talk about the first measure and how

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.130 
talk about the first measure and how
you're<00:00:41.490> going<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.700> go<00:00:41.820> about<00:00:42.060> executing<00:00:42.900> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
you're going to go about executing the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.400 
you're going to go about executing the
accent<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.790> legato<00:00:45.210> notes<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:46.290> what

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
accent and the the legato notes and what

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.069 
accent and the the legato notes and what
I<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.920> use<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.130> right<00:00:47.610> hand<00:00:47.940> motion<00:00:48.450> down

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
I do is I use a right hand motion down

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.410 
I do is I use a right hand motion down
on<00:00:49.470> the<00:00:49.649> first<00:00:49.860> note<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.520> left<00:00:50.820> hand<00:00:51.030> motion

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
on the first note and a left hand motion

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.330 
on the first note and a left hand motion
up<00:00:51.630> on<00:00:51.810> the<00:00:52.200> second<00:00:52.560> note<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.950> that

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
up on the second note and that

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.760 
up on the second note and that
differentiates<00:00:53.940> between<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.290> accident

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
differentiates between the on accident

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.860 
differentiates between the on accident
notes<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> accident<00:00:56.670> notes<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.690> that's

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
notes and the accident notes so that's

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.910 
notes and the accident notes so that's
the<00:00:58.020> first<00:00:58.230> thing<00:00:58.380> and<00:00:58.649> I'll<00:00:58.710> demonstrate

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the first thing and I'll demonstrate

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:16.520 
the first thing and I'll demonstrate
that<00:00:59.520> now<00:01:13.610> I'm<00:01:14.610> exaggerating<00:01:14.990> that<00:01:15.990> motion

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
that now I'm exaggerating that motion

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.250 
that now I'm exaggerating that motion
right<00:01:17.100> hand<00:01:17.370> down<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> first<00:01:18.150> note<00:01:18.950> and

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
right hand down for the first note and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.050 
right hand down for the first note and
then<00:01:22.260> left<00:01:22.619> hand<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> accident<00:01:23.850> note

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.830 

and<00:01:29.060> in<00:01:29.210> measure<00:01:29.479> 1<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.619> last<00:01:30.979> beat<00:01:31.939> beat

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
and in measure 1 the last beat beat

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.279 
and in measure 1 the last beat beat
three<00:01:33.259> and<00:01:33.469> four<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.159> end<00:01:34.399> of<00:01:34.759> two<00:01:35.289> would

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
three and four and the end of two would

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:46.380 
three and four and the end of two would
go<00:01:36.560> right<00:01:37.549> hand<00:01:37.850> down<00:01:43.210> also<00:01:44.210> measure<00:01:44.990> 14<00:01:45.619> I

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
go right hand down also measure 14 I

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.990 
go right hand down also measure 14 I
would<00:01:47.390> use<00:01:47.689> that<00:01:47.720> same<00:01:48.259> right<00:01:48.710> hand<00:01:48.950> down<00:01:49.189> left

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
would use that same right hand down left

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.600 
would use that same right hand down left
hand<00:01:50.390> up<00:01:50.630> for<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.470> on<00:01:51.679> exit<00:01:52.069> notes<00:01:52.310> and
