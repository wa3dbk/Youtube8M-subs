00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
chain a bunch of attacks together if

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.390 
chain a bunch of attacks together if
they<00:02:14.110> decide<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.500> know<00:02:14.590> what<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.739> want<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.040> do<00:02:15.370> a

they decide you know what I want to do a

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.110 
they decide you know what I want to do a
a<00:02:15.790> really<00:02:16.269> high<00:02:16.420> damage<00:02:16.750> finale<00:02:17.970> one<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
a really high damage finale one of the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.229 
a really high damage finale one of the
ways<00:02:19.209> we<00:02:19.390> do<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:20.850> let's<00:02:21.850> go<00:02:21.940> ahead<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.180> go

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
ways we do is is let's go ahead and go

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.960 
ways we do is is let's go ahead and go
back<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.480> pistol<00:02:22.750> pistol<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.170> show<00:02:23.290> unload

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.660 

unload<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.150> particularly<00:02:28.720> powerful<00:02:29.049> attack

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
unload is a particularly powerful attack

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.250 
unload is a particularly powerful attack
that<00:02:30.670> because<00:02:31.209> she's<00:02:31.660> pulling<00:02:31.930> off<00:02:32.049> of<00:02:32.080> her

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
that because she's pulling off of her

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.570 
that because she's pulling off of her
initiative<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.769> there's<00:02:32.890> no<00:02:33.010> cooldown<00:02:33.280> she

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
initiative and there's no cooldown she

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.840 
initiative and there's no cooldown she
can<00:02:33.700> do<00:02:33.819> to<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:34.209> unloads<00:02:34.569> back<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.959> back<00:02:35.140> and

can do to of unloads back to back and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.840 
can do to of unloads back to back and
really<00:02:36.850> take<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:37.390> take<00:02:38.319> a<00:02:38.350> mob<00:02:38.560> down<00:02:38.769> quickly<00:02:39.040> of

really take a take a mob down quickly of

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.630 
really take a take a mob down quickly of
course<00:02:40.230> that's<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.410> strategic<00:02:42.190> choice<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.610> a

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
course that's a strategic choice that a

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.910 
course that's a strategic choice that a
thief<00:02:42.850> does<00:02:43.060> because<00:02:43.390> in<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.870> depleting<00:02:44.799> all

of their initiative they're going

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.490 
of their initiative they're going
they're<00:02:46.420> going<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.720> be<00:02:46.810> vulnerable<00:02:47.019> for<00:02:47.319> a

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
they're going to be vulnerable for a

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.300 
they're going to be vulnerable for a
period<00:02:47.680> of<00:02:47.830> time<00:02:49.590> we<00:02:50.590> could<00:02:50.709> go<00:02:50.830> ahead<00:02:50.920> and

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
period of time we could go ahead and

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.979 
period of time we could go ahead and
show<00:02:51.910> stealth<00:02:54.450> obviously<00:02:55.450> one<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.810> key

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
show stealth obviously one of the key

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.780 
show stealth obviously one of the key
things<00:02:56.019> behind<00:02:56.769> a<00:02:56.920> thief<00:02:57.100> would<00:02:57.310> be<00:02:57.430> their

things behind a thief would be their

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.520 
things behind a thief would be their
ability<00:02:58.180> stealth<00:02:58.420> unlike<00:02:59.109> other<00:02:59.230> games

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
ability stealth unlike other games

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
so we want it to be something that

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.710 
so we want it to be something that
players<00:03:06.100> you<00:03:06.250> strategically<00:03:06.489> as<00:03:07.090> opposed<00:03:07.600> to

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
period of time so you'll see that

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.020 
period of time so you'll see that
between<00:04:34.180> shadowstep<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:36.400> know<00:04:36.520> having<00:04:36.970> to

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
backstab ability that is very much

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.140 
backstab ability that is very much
dependent<00:04:41.380> on<00:04:41.770> what<00:04:42.010> position<00:04:42.430> she's<00:04:42.639> in<00:04:42.669> when

she attacks a mob the thief has to be

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.700 
she attacks a mob the thief has to be
even<00:04:46.270> more<00:04:46.479> mindful<00:04:46.930> than<00:04:47.050> other<00:04:47.199> professions

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
even more mindful than other professions

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.439 
even more mindful than other professions
as<00:04:47.830> to<00:04:48.280> where<00:04:48.729> they<00:04:48.849> are<00:04:49.000> in<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.180> battlefield

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
opposed to studying the UI all the time

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.140 
opposed to studying the UI all the time
while<00:04:59.680> they<00:04:59.740> are<00:04:59.800> in<00:04:59.860> combat<00:05:02.099> yeah<00:05:03.150> we're

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
while they are in combat yeah we're

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.960 
while they are in combat yeah we're
trying<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:04.419> find<00:05:04.630> some<00:05:05.349> some<00:05:06.220> giant<00:05:06.669> tree-like

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
trying to find some some giant tree-like

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.529 
trying to find some some giant tree-like
oh<00:05:07.389> that<00:05:07.780> looks<00:05:07.960> like<00:05:08.110> yeah<00:05:08.440> there<00:05:08.680> we<00:05:08.800> go<00:05:09.539> folk

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
oh that looks like yeah there we go folk

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:19.900 
oh that looks like yeah there we go folk
arts<00:05:10.870> are<00:05:10.990> particularly<00:05:12.150> fierce<00:05:13.150> opponents

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.970 

yep<00:05:20.910> so<00:05:21.720> again<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.140> allows<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:22.590> thief<00:05:22.740> to<00:05:22.860> get

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
in close really really quickly if you're

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.690 
in close really really quickly if you're
particularly<00:05:25.440> skilled<00:05:25.740> you<00:05:26.220> have<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:26.370> way<00:05:26.550> of

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
particularly skilled you have a way of

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.250 
particularly skilled you have a way of
like<00:05:26.880> hitting<00:05:27.480> getting<00:05:27.690> in<00:05:27.750> a<00:05:27.810> couple<00:05:28.020> attacks

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260

like hitting getting in a couple attacks
and<00:05:28.410> then<00:05:28.530> jumping<00:05:28.890> out<00:05:29.340> very<00:05:29.880> quickly<00:05:52.610> there

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
and then jumping out very quickly there

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.810 
and then jumping out very quickly there
you<00:05:53.760> go<00:05:54.050> so<00:05:55.050> what<00:05:55.620> Sarah<00:05:55.830> did<00:05:55.890> just<00:05:56.220> there<00:05:56.460> is

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
you go so what Sarah did just there is

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.580 
you go so what Sarah did just there is
she<00:05:57.390> went<00:05:57.570> ahead<00:05:57.660> and<00:05:57.870> switched<00:05:58.200> weapons

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
there's a there's a one key way to swap

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.810
