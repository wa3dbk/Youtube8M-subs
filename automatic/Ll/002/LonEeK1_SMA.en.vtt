the<00:00:51.910> interface<00:00:52.269> there<00:00:52.539> I<00:00:52.570> noticed<00:00:53.140> that

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
the interface there I noticed that

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.599 
the interface there I noticed that
you're<00:00:53.350> moving<00:00:53.649> the<00:00:53.710> camera<00:00:53.920> around<00:00:54.039> yeah

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
you're moving the camera around yeah

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.579 
you're moving the camera around yeah
this<00:00:54.760> is<00:00:54.910> this<00:00:55.090> is<00:00:55.239> actually<00:00:55.510> one<00:00:55.750> of<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:56.019> one

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
this is this is actually one of the one

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.229 
this is this is actually one of the one
of<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.769> several<00:00:57.160> ways<00:00:57.280> you<00:00:57.339> can<00:00:57.519> control<00:00:57.969> you

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
of the several ways you can control you

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.279 
of the several ways you can control you
can<00:00:58.390> control<00:00:58.629> it<00:00:58.780> from<00:00:58.870> one<00:00:59.050> of<00:00:59.140> our

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
can control it from one of our

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.709 
can control it from one of our
controllers<00:00:59.920> or<00:01:00.129> motor<00:01:00.309> control<00:01:00.760> from<00:01:01.059> from<00:01:01.629> a

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
controllers or motor control from from a

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.569 
controllers or motor control from from a
Crestron<00:01:02.170> directly<00:01:02.710> from<00:01:02.890> Aurora<00:01:03.160> switcher

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
Crestron directly from Aurora switcher

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:04.759 
Crestron directly from Aurora switcher
whatever<00:01:03.910> you<00:01:03.999> need<00:01:04.120> to<00:01:04.239> do

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
whatever you need to do

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.050 
whatever you need to do
but<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.039> always<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> web<00:01:05.640> interfaces

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
but we always have a web interfaces

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.649 
but we always have a web interfaces
built<00:01:06.450> into<00:01:06.719> the<00:01:06.840> camera<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.979> basically<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
built into the camera and basically the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.749 
built into the camera and basically the
web<00:01:09.780> server<00:01:10.229> serves<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.859> interface<00:01:11.280> so

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
web server serves up this interface so

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:12.919 
web server serves up this interface so
if<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.939> want<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.149> manage<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> cameras

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:12.929 
if you want to manage the cameras

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:14.719 
if you want to manage the cameras
remotely<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.829> somebody<00:01:14.219> says<00:01:14.399> that<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.640> know
