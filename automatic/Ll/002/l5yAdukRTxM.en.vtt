next thing you have is a PFD which

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:06.579 
next thing you have is a PFD which
stands<00:00:05.060> for<00:00:05.149> a<00:00:05.270> personal<00:00:05.689> flotation<00:00:05.810> device

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:06.589 
stands for a personal flotation device

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.770 
stands for a personal flotation device
now<00:00:07.339> there<00:00:07.520> are<00:00:07.580> a<00:00:07.609> whole<00:00:07.850> variety<00:00:08.420> of

now there are a whole variety of

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.330 
now there are a whole variety of
different<00:00:08.870> PFDs<00:00:09.590> out<00:00:09.830> there<00:00:10.070> you<00:00:10.160> need<00:00:10.280> to

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
different PFDs out there you need to

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.470 
different PFDs out there you need to
make<00:00:10.520> sure<00:00:10.670> you<00:00:10.760> have<00:00:10.880> a<00:00:10.910> Coast<00:00:11.210> Guard

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
approved PFD if you're rafting you tend

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.170 
approved PFD if you're rafting you tend
to<00:00:14.540> be<00:00:14.690> on<00:00:14.809> bigger<00:00:15.139> water<00:00:15.410> than<00:00:15.530> you<00:00:15.710> would<00:00:15.860> be

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
to be on bigger water than you would be

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.240 
to be on bigger water than you would be
at<00:00:17.180> as<00:00:17.840> an<00:00:17.990> entry<00:00:18.230> level<00:00:18.410> kayaker<00:00:18.919> for

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
at as an entry level kayaker for

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.159 
at as an entry level kayaker for
instance<00:00:19.520> or<00:00:19.640> a<00:00:19.669> canoeist<00:00:20.210> so<00:00:20.360> you<00:00:20.419> want<00:00:20.630> a<00:00:20.689> PFD

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:21.169 
instance or a canoeist so you want a PFD

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.889 
instance or a canoeist so you want a PFD
that's<00:00:21.500> going<00:00:21.649> to<00:00:21.710> float<00:00:22.070> you<00:00:22.250> well<00:00:22.689> this<00:00:23.689> has

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:23.899 
that's going to float you well this has

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.690 
that's going to float you well this has
four<00:00:24.259> buckles<00:00:24.739> need<00:00:24.980> to<00:00:25.070> make<00:00:25.189> sure<00:00:25.369> all<00:00:25.579> of

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
four buckles need to make sure all of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.030 
four buckles need to make sure all of
them<00:00:25.820> work<00:00:26.090> they're<00:00:26.989> adjustable<00:00:27.500> on<00:00:27.680> the<00:00:27.800> side

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
them work they're adjustable on the side

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.130 
them work they're adjustable on the side
so<00:00:28.579> you<00:00:28.610> can<00:00:28.790> fit<00:00:29.180> it<00:00:29.270> so<00:00:29.390> it's<00:00:29.540> nice<00:00:29.689> and<00:00:29.899> tight

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
so you can fit it so it's nice and tight

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.229 
so you can fit it so it's nice and tight
on<00:00:30.410> you<00:00:30.710> make<00:00:31.220> sure<00:00:31.430> the<00:00:31.579> pillow<00:00:31.820> is<00:00:32.029> on<00:00:32.149> the

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
on you make sure the pillow is on the

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.360 
on you make sure the pillow is on the
outside<00:00:32.660> this<00:00:32.989> floats<00:00:33.350> you<00:00:33.590> right<00:00:33.829> side<00:00:34.130> up

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
outside this floats you right side up

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.580 
outside this floats you right side up
conscious<00:00:35.090> or<00:00:35.210> unconscious<00:00:35.600> that's<00:00:36.440> what

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
conscious or unconscious that's what

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.100 
conscious or unconscious that's what
you're<00:00:36.710> looking<00:00:36.950> for<00:00:37.190> when<00:00:37.370> you're<00:00:37.460> out<00:00:37.670> there

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
you're looking for when you're out there

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.600 
you're looking for when you're out there
fit<00:00:39.110> is<00:00:39.260> an<00:00:39.410> important<00:00:39.920> consideration<00:00:40.960> and<00:00:42.610> so

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
fit is an important consideration and so

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.360 
fit is an important consideration and so
we<00:00:43.820> have<00:00:44.590> PFDs<00:00:45.590> out<00:00:45.770> there<00:00:45.950> now<00:00:46.100> that<00:00:46.160> are

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
we have PFDs out there now that are

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.640 
we have PFDs out there now that are
designed<00:00:47.050> specifically<00:00:48.050> for<00:00:48.170> different<00:00:48.530> body

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
designed specifically for different body

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.440 
designed specifically for different body
types<00:00:49.100> -<00:00:49.460> this<00:00:50.000> is<00:00:50.240> designed<00:00:51.230> for<00:00:51.650> a<00:00:51.710> woman<00:00:52.450> and

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
types - this is designed for a woman and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.810 
types - this is designed for a woman and
has<00:00:54.290> a<00:00:54.320> slightly<00:00:54.770> different<00:00:54.920> cut<00:00:55.400> gives<00:00:55.670> you

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
has a slightly different cut gives you

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.280 
has a slightly different cut gives you
more<00:00:56.000> maneuverability<00:00:56.630> while<00:00:57.020> you're<00:00:57.170> out

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
more maneuverability while you're out

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.390 
more maneuverability while you're out
there<00:00:57.320> sitting<00:00:57.710> you're<00:00:57.829> able<00:00:58.040> to<00:00:58.130> paddle

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
there sitting you're able to paddle

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.210 
there sitting you're able to paddle
while<00:00:59.239> wearing<00:00:59.630> the<00:00:59.900> PFD<00:01:00.200> you<00:01:00.770> notice<00:01:01.100> that

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
while wearing the PFD you notice that

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.069 
while wearing the PFD you notice that
this<00:01:01.370> is<00:01:01.520> sort<00:01:01.640> of<00:01:01.730> a<00:01:01.820> bulky<00:01:02.300> more<00:01:02.899> of<00:01:03.020> a

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
restricting and then you have the PFD

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.300 
restricting and then you have the PFD
such<00:01:11.330> as<00:01:11.479> this<00:01:11.690> that<00:01:12.380> gives<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:12.830> lots<00:01:13.159> of
