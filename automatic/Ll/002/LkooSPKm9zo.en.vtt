00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:12.210
 enjoying the art 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:16.910
 the face is about enjoying or reading a 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.910
 work of art is to make sense of it. 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.680
 we have the red color of a work 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.570
 figurative form in the same way as the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.029
 People see the color of a traffic sign 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.990
 a traffic light that flashes in the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.480
 street in front of the colors of the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.010
 our reading is linked to a 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:42.510
 only possibility of interpretation 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.879
 red stop yellow wait green follow 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.010
 the interpretation is unique 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.190
 at that time we deal with codes 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.820
 which are closed signs signs 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.100
 because the man has assigned a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.140
 single meaning to better organize 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.570
 life 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.969
 now before the body element in the work 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.309
 of art opens up the possibility of 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.060
 multiplicity of readings 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.060
 interpretations 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.659
 at this moment you find connoisseur 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.880
 of work of art makes a reading 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.920
 structured in open codes different 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.990
 of a traffic light whose 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.350
 qualification or interpretation of such 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.570
 codes become infinite in this way 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.060
 varying from person to person 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.640
 are these codes of the work of art that 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.310
 will influence the face of each 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.350
 when you watch a movie 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.540
 I heard a song is impossible. 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.610
 interpret them unrelated to their 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.710
 life history and the moment in which 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.930
 you live the aesthetic experience of 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.049
 music movie enjoyment 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.600
 the work of art is seen in accordance with 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.750
 your personal and cultural references 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.450
 to appreciate a work of art together with 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.220
 other people will surely each give 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.610
 a different meaning 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.649
 because as we have already said, we appreciate 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.149
 a work of art considering all the 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.550
 our life experience 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:14.880
 our feelings our individuality 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:19.460
 so we can say that taste is relative 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.460
 will depend on the eye of the beholder
