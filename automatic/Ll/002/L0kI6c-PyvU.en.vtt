00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.670 
games you have again valve can do it or
maybe<00:02:36.400> because<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.390> steam<00:02:37.930> just<00:02:38.110> steam

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
maybe because of the steam just steam

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.199 
maybe because of the steam just steam
how<00:02:39.100> steam<00:02:39.370> works<00:02:39.610> maybe<00:02:39.820> then<00:02:40.090> other

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
how steam works maybe then other

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.240 
how steam works maybe then other
companies<00:02:40.660> could<00:02:40.810> start<00:02:41.019> doing<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.440> like<00:02:41.650> 2k

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
companies could start doing it like 2k

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.860 
companies could start doing it like 2k
and<00:02:42.489> so<00:02:42.730> forth<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.120> on<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.450> think<00:02:43.540> that's<00:02:43.750> a

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
and so forth so on so I think that's a

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.090 
and so forth so on so I think that's a
pretty<00:02:43.989> cool<00:02:44.200> idea<00:02:44.290> but<00:02:44.620> then<00:02:44.950> you've<00:02:45.070> also

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
pretty cool idea but then you've also

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.920 
pretty cool idea but then you've also
got<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.430> be<00:02:45.610> careful<00:02:45.790> with<00:02:46.060> say<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.480> won<00:02:46.690> 500

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
got to be careful with say you won 500

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.050 
got to be careful with say you won 500
so<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.769> don't<00:02:48.100> know<00:02:48.160> how<00:02:48.280> many<00:02:48.489> sales<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:48.880> would

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
so I don't know how many sales you would

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.259 
so I don't know how many sales you would
get<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.450> don't<00:02:49.750> know<00:02:49.930> um<00:02:50.739> so<00:02:51.519> it<00:02:51.880> has<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.150> be<00:02:52.239> a

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
get I don't know um so it has to be a

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.430 
get I don't know um so it has to be a
substantial<00:02:52.569> amount<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:53.080> time<00:02:53.230> it's<00:02:53.410> like

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
substantial amount of time it's like

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.470 
substantial amount of time it's like
I've<00:02:53.800> we<00:02:54.040> get<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.310> million<00:02:54.489> sales<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.330> mass
