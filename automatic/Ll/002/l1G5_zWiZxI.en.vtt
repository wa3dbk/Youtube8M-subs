jump in and give it a test fit it turned
out<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:32.940> tighter<00:00:33.149> than<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.450> expected<00:00:33.540> I

out to be tighter than I expected I

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.750 
out to be tighter than I expected I
won't<00:00:34.469> be<00:00:34.620> able<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.860> stretch<00:00:35.070> out<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.219> here<00:00:35.550> I

won't be able to stretch out in here I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.030 
won't be able to stretch out in here I
also<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.930> modify<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.320> seed<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.770> made<00:00:37.920> to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
also have to modify the seed it made to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.160 
also have to modify the seed it made to
give<00:00:38.160> me<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.309> little<00:00:38.460> more<00:00:38.579> Headroom<00:00:39.030> I've<00:00:39.989> been

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
give me a little more Headroom I've been

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.630 
give me a little more Headroom I've been
staring<00:00:40.440> at<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.920> while<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.280> said<00:00:41.550> it

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
staring at it for a while and said it

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.610 
staring at it for a while and said it
was<00:00:41.730> time<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.940> play<00:00:42.180> my<00:00:42.390> new<00:00:42.420> router<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.590> I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
was time to play my new router so I

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.799 
was time to play my new router so I
started<00:00:43.980> working<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> turret<00:00:44.610> ring<00:00:44.820> first

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
started working on the turret ring first

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.779 
started working on the turret ring first
step<00:00:46.050> was<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.289> modify<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> roller<00:00:47.010> chain<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.520> I

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
step was to modify a roller chain and I

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.610 
step was to modify a roller chain and I
quote<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.750> way<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.079> which<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.379> was<00:00:49.410> not

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
quote in a way in which it was not

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.100 
quote in a way in which it was not
designed<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.129> used<00:00:50.690> cutting<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.750> outside

ride on the guide in the turret base
here<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.460> was<00:00:59.640> testing<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.030> curve<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> chain

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
here I was testing the curve the chain

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.209 
here I was testing the curve the chain
after<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.050> cut<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.440> secured<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.739> turret<00:01:02.070> base

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
after I cut and secured the turret base
