this is the rci one s part of the new
line<00:00:26.680> of<00:00:26.710> quad<00:00:27.070> copters<00:00:27.550> from<00:00:28.090> RC<00:00:28.480> lager<00:00:28.720> the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
line of quad copters from RC lager the

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.440 
line of quad copters from RC lager the
thing<00:00:29.800> looks<00:00:29.830> cool<00:00:30.250> I<00:00:30.430> think<00:00:30.610> anyone<00:00:31.090> can<00:00:31.210> fly

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
thing looks cool I think anyone can fly

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.290 
thing looks cool I think anyone can fly
it<00:00:31.510> oh<00:00:31.779> yeah<00:00:32.380> definitely<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:33.640> perfect

it oh yeah definitely this perfect

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.880 
it oh yeah definitely this perfect
rotorcraft<00:00:34.690> for<00:00:35.110> both<00:00:35.290> beginners<00:00:35.470> and

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
rotorcraft for both beginners and

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:43.010 
rotorcraft for both beginners and
experts

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.600 

no<00:00:44.020> what<00:00:44.170> kind<00:00:44.320> of<00:00:44.440> assembly<00:00:44.950> is<00:00:45.040> required<00:00:45.070> for

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
no what kind of assembly is required for

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.240 
no what kind of assembly is required for
this<00:00:45.960> actually<00:00:46.960> it<00:00:47.320> already<00:00:47.530> came<00:00:47.620> completely

extra propellers and a crash pad extra

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:13.140 
extra propellers and a crash pad extra
motors<00:00:59.860> and<00:01:00.129> landing<00:01:00.850> gear

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:25.110 

Oh

alright<00:01:26.120> so<00:01:26.240> tell<00:01:26.420> me<00:01:26.480> about<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.930> three

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
alright so tell me about the three

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.950 
alright so tell me about the three
different<00:01:27.770> modes<00:01:27.950> well<00:01:28.940> first<00:01:29.450> there's<00:01:29.900> the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
different modes well first there's the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.920 
different modes well first there's the
gainer<00:01:30.260> mode<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:31.460> beginner<00:01:31.730> mode<00:01:31.940> limits<00:01:32.600> the

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
gainer mode the beginner mode limits the

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.020 
gainer mode the beginner mode limits the
height<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.440> angle<00:01:33.650> in<00:01:34.160> which<00:01:34.220> you<00:01:34.700> can<00:01:34.850> fly

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
height and angle in which you can fly

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.650 
height and angle in which you can fly
the<00:01:35.090> quadcopter<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.950> sport<00:01:37.310> mode<00:01:37.660> maintains

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
the quadcopter the sport mode maintains

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.510 
the quadcopter the sport mode maintains
the<00:01:38.900> throttle<00:01:39.320> all<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.500> way<00:01:39.620> through<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.490> that

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
the throttle all the way through so that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.580 
the throttle all the way through so that
it<00:01:40.820> automatically<00:01:41.360> keeps<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.960> copter<00:01:42.320> in<00:01:42.500> the

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
it automatically keeps the copter in the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.490 
it automatically keeps the copter in the
air<00:01:42.740> as<00:01:42.980> you<00:01:43.010> do<00:01:43.250> flips<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:44.780> expert<00:01:45.290> mode

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
air as you do flips the expert mode

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.890 
air as you do flips the expert mode
allows<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.160> control<00:01:46.340> everything<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:47.870> that

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
allows you to control everything so that

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.260 
allows you to control everything so that
when<00:01:48.200> you<00:01:48.380> become<00:01:48.710> experienced<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:49.790> can<00:01:49.940> take

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
when you become experienced you can take

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.840 
when you become experienced you can take
these<00:01:50.480> couplers<00:01:50.900> to<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.260> limit<00:01:51.560> if<00:01:52.490> I<00:01:52.640> want

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
these couplers to the limit if I want

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.790 
these couplers to the limit if I want
one<00:01:52.940> of<00:01:52.970> these<00:01:53.120> for<00:01:53.330> myself<00:01:53.510> thank<00:01:54.500> you<00:01:54.740> know
