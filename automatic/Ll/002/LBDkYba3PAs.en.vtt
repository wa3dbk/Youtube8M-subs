00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.709
 ah 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:27.739
 the sound of the sole of his shoe touching the 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.149
 the cement sidewalk and strained by vacuum 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.419
 Jorge, apparently walking short 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.809
 timed 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.970
 he was getting closer and closer to me 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.250
 that I looked anxiously without knowing who it was 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.140
 that man wearing jeans and 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.210
 a leather jacket that looked like 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.870
 to know 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.820
 I can smell it from afar and it 's whore 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.350
 of the matchless 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.750
 that man stopped for some 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.339
 two meters away from me if 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.839
 He bent so that their values stay 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.729
 at the time of my 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.939
 he introduced himself with a yellow smile 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.369
 of cynicism and red of his blood 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.680
 gums are anchored with the same 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.159
 has a full face 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.289
 incredible 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.100
 I want to never take this taste of pain 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:19.020
 agrees said with warm tone 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.359
 I can see the movement of your tongue 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.369
 to sanchez 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.319
 I kept eye that my story fixed 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.289
 in his bizarre expression 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:31.459
 He seemed hungry too. 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.459
 Edward, I heard what this face is. 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.459
 duddy 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.530
 At that moment I discovered my hand or not. 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:45.360
 case, as I had said the way I 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:49.140
 called that man seemed to know me 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.969
 some time he spoke with confidence 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.379
 who would say that on the day against this 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.299
 situation 

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:55.259
 as it is in the face of an old woman in the middle of the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.009
 Street 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.020
 Who would know what you're talking about? 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.969
 was the chance to know who it was from 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.899
 I came because it had been very isolated 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.060
 with something so painful dude he was 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.370
 again even is not 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.129
 doubts only increased and obviously 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.459
 I did not know if I could trust that man. 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.530
 who had a killer look was obvious 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.620
 that he was part of my past 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.930
 just did not know if it was the good part or 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.019
 in the part where I began to question myself 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.720
 your past had a part but nobody 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.760
 suffer like i was suffering atom 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.200
 perhaps the smartest choice was 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.480
 leave it as it was 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.600
 it would be ironic to struggle to find out 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.400
 one last 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.210
 then give anything to 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.800
 forget it we go during a man said 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.040
 while taking off his leather jacket 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.170
 dark he threw to me was going to 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.850
 marry your rotten flesh scent 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.040
 I hit that bad day of smell 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.010
 mothball reminds me of old folks I 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.840
 I hate old people it was funny to see 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.420
 because he did not look so young 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.400
 so his face looked about 40 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.930
 years but his wrinkled hands did not 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.760
 cheated he had more than that 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.830
 I could see a smirk on the corner 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.660
 mouth while removing the jacket from the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.830
 old lady that I had just 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.350
 to decorate 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.210
 I grabbed his jacket quickly and 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.270
 wear 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.080
 we he called as he turned to 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.720
 back 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.460
 confident that he would not have 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.610
 option then I did 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.220
 we walked slowly along the sidewalk he 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.320
 He did not look back for a moment. 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.780
 we only get back together when we 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.510
 approaching a link with black was a 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.340
 new car its body really shone 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.280
 reflecting only the lamp posts 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.500
 they were not even that strong 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.390
 he's beautiful is not it that the practice 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.370
 It does not bother me at all to repeat 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.530
 how many times do you need 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.240
 a man is proud as he passed 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.090
 hand on the hood of the car 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.000
 he calls himself black mamba is a lincoln 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.610
 continental year 61 and interior all of 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.790
 original color is beautiful just to hear but it is 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.200
 better to see he opened the hitchhiker's door and 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.040
 gestured with my hand so that I 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.690
 I had already followed the car 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.890
 had just been retired 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:21.100
 could smell the new plastic 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.410
 android already forgotten your friend is expensive 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.030
 every trip you change the seat 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.570
 you who did not leave pieces and a 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:32.320
 center where we are going 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.540
 she is one of the games and there is that man 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.310
 Strange replied in counted with the 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.500
 car 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.110
 the Christmas spirit really was 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.660
 hovering over city city ​​which 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.620
 still did not know how memories in 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.530
 my mind was 10 where we are 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.390
 I asked how this is where we are 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:58.300
 the car and celebrate Christmas I mean 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:00.550
 What place is this city? 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.670
 What country is this 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.810
 the man looked suspiciously 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.650
 took a deep breath and continued 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.870
 conformed 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.070
 I understand you want to understand what's going on. 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.810
 happening and what should be 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.430
 completely confused 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.280
 then you will have your questions answered in 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.170
 soon it will be annoying but it's a 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.230
 very boring job but I said no 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.130
 Do not worry, you took one of 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.350
 steering wheel 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.530
 and held me for boost 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.750
 held and shook hands to make a 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.020
 called gold 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.910
 We met some good years finally. 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.940
 something was beginning to be 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.550
 He used to call himself my friend, I did not remember. 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.860
 of a face even if it was the only source 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:46.900
 information I had would have to 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:51.960
 to grab her because I'm so 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.960
 What is happening to me during the day? 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.720
 I did not remember that word but already 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.780
 supposed to be something good 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.030
 he continued but you're not just another 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.759
 I'll zombie then if you're one of the 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:11.100
 best in the best humiliated poses 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:14.340
 wandering my darkness by murdering 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.539
 eating way crawling up blood 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:21.930
 being hunted like an animal really 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:24.660
 it was an honor because I'm so I know 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.460
 I'm alive imagine being killed in the 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.020
 body hurts fed 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.090
 I feel that my house is limp 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.840
 fall at any time because you do not 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:36.900
 It is so because not only expanded so 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:40.860
 you much less than you are you 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:44.340
 also not me but you also do not eat 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.530
 human flesh does not have the same color 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.830
 need you I eat because it is 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:52.430
 Good you know it tastes delicious and 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:57.539
 The more I eat, but I'll stay here. 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:07:00.300
 It's like a circle parked down from the 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:01.410
 car and already outside and called for the 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:06.470
 window 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.470
 It's time, let's eat.
