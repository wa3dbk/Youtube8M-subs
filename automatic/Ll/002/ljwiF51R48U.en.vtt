00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:07.940
 Oh, change is reverse change 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.720
 The brake pedal is 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.340
 On the left side 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.610
 Well 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.480
 This side is out, isn't it? 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.340
 It is nice to shift patterns together 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.670
 With one leg 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.250
 Neutral 2-speed is the third speed 4-speed 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.050
 There are 4 speed missions 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:35.370
 The rest is the explanation of the cab 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:40.440
 This is a s &amp; s sly nice cab 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:44.220
 I'm chalk I'm super empty this is a state where fishing is pulled 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.400
 You can draw chalk when you're from him, but in summer 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.940
 By pessimistic bought or or minus from Ow's tomorrow Marshall 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:56.100
 Well this is 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:01.560
 It is idling 8 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.650
 From the operation 1/2 rotation is performed or so little up 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.710
 It is easy to take the engine 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.030
 so 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.250
 This is 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.659
 8 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.920
 Mixed screw 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.940
 Anma 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.010
 I do not need to touch 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.080
 You can adjust the idling here 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.730
 I can go home 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.040
 This is acceleration pump shinko 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.510
 Ets 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.850
 This is the acceleration pump 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.830
 It is a school of adjustment 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.490
 This of this negative 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.790
 When it is tightened, it is squeezed after death and opened 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.810
 When PC pump hears more 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.540
 This mixture is also 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.820
 It gets thinner as I tighten up 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.830
 When the Unit 5 is gradually opened 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.330
 8 work areas will be 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:58.270
 It is this filter but I 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.250
 That day is rainy 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.960
 When not on it 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.940
 What time is it ? I'll cover it and get wet and I'm sucking it and it's engine no matter 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.390
 Please be careful because it will be 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.390
 later 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:19.180
 I got a point and a capacitor that I was allowed to exchange that inside of this cover here. 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.989
 I have entered 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.989
 later 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.280
 Anticipation 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.430
 Fender's clearance here is quite open 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.930
 That's it . 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.790
 To Well real soon in we did not have so spear 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.989
 that 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:48.989
 I think that it would look better if you changed it properly 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.989
 The rest is this number and this is also that 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:56.900
 I ca n't get the Japanese number, so the size is a bit 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.530
 I think it would be better to make it a bigger one 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.530
 later 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.700
 This is 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.620
 This is brand new in the regulator 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:12.860
 This is a generator This is also a brand new 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.569
 This is also replaced with oil fielder. 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.010
 so 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.010
 Put gear oil from here 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.580
 The engine oil is like a dry sump 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.580
 Here I be 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.140
 And 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.880
 I wonder if he is Joel 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.880
 Overwintering single 50 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.810
 Gear oil has gear oil for sport star and it is good to have it bought 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.390
 Do you think 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.340
 Art is that 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.520
 I have not met so much 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:57.280
 It is roughly is such mon guy of this hand 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.660
 I wonder if there can say open 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:07.380
 Leave Well around a little I'd brake a little drag feeling of brake rear 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.380
 I hope that it will be a little Well good in this please look at how to 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.590
 When 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.940
 There so early 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.350
 After a while frame number is 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.430
 a building 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.310
 here 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:25.040
 At the neck 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:30.280
 There is a country that is an engine here, but this vehicle has a rigid meaning that the job right is stamped 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.210
 It is a certified vehicle in the frame, so that the authority of that proof of saying says 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.000
 that 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.550
 Here it is pasted here under the sheet 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.660
 this 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:46.780
 Please take care of it if you peel it off when you do something 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:51.790
 Overwhelmed 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:57.130
 I How do I Do not such a place would also after question if available 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.790
 You should ask me, but basically it is an old car and there are a lot of vibrations 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.750
 that 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.160
 By'm lucky hard tail of the hard tail l Hall 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.270
 So that 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:10.390
 Imperial Palace inch tools 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:15.040
 To think I Anomaa really that beans to have 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:19.210
 It would be nice if you tighten all over again 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:22.639
 By you or flew well at Toka highway while driving 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.680
 Please take care of that that 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:30.030
 What about the rest? 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.440
 After oil change once every 83 months 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.580
 Once a year Gyor 3 months 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.810
 8 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:42.270
 Gear oils It is best when the change in the frequency of about once every six months Well 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:48.330
 8 filters are also once a year 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:53.330
 After that the brakes are really that front and rear compared with the current domestic model or something 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.330
 It does not work at all, so please be careful 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.580
 Is there something like 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.090
 Well after that 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:07.680
 So while folding 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:09.930
 Exploring Well the top dead center when you think you kick a good and familiar in going 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.040
 Lost kick 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.840
 I'm going to give it a go 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:21.560
 As a knack 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.560
 8 color kick accelerator back 5 times 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:29.289
 And the key to the on and kids misunderstanding from after full throttle 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:34.169
 Axel still got 3 diffractions 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:38.599
 It 's really serious to come from the state with the accelerator released 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.599
 Then it takes a bit It is good to repeat 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.280
 When 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.339
 How about 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.520
 It is about that 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.190
 About that 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:03.510
 Hey, I think 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.510
 There is no, but there was something with the 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:11.779
 For the time being, it is such a cousin
