choose<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.470> but<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.460> can<00:00:20.670> have<00:00:21.240> anything

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
choose this but you can have anything

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.250 
choose this but you can have anything
there<00:00:23.180> one<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.390> things<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
there one of the things that you have to

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.220 
there one of the things that you have to
do<00:00:25.439> whatever<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.460> choose<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.849> base<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.449> like

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
do whatever you choose the base is like

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.799 
do whatever you choose the base is like
rough<00:00:28.560> with<00:00:29.010> with<00:00:29.820> paper<00:00:32.420> because<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> paper

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
rough with with paper because the paper

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.340 
rough with with paper because the paper
is<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.350> stick<00:00:35.090> into<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.480> clay<00:00:36.750> then<00:00:37.200> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
is going to stick into the clay then it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.240 
is going to stick into the clay then it
will<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.649> more<00:00:37.890> easy<00:00:38.420> to<00:00:39.420> remove<00:00:39.899> whatever<00:00:40.680> you

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
will be more easy to remove whatever you

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.410 
will be more easy to remove whatever you
put<00:00:41.489> there<00:00:41.760> as<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.480> support<00:00:43.879> normally<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
put there as a support normally all the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.700 
put there as a support normally all the
Clay's<00:00:46.700> figurines<00:00:47.700> then<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.809> require<00:00:49.230> like

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
Clay's figurines then they require like

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.040 
Clay's figurines then they require like
a<00:00:49.739> structure<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.120> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:51.930> over

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
a structure this is going to be over

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
a structure this is going to be over
structure<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.760> put<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.210> away

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
structure but we have to put this away

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.979 
structure but we have to put this away
after<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.280> make<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.670> model<00:00:57.030> that's<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.750> little

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
after we make the model that's a little

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.950 
after we make the model that's a little
bit<00:00:58.140> challenge<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.489> one<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> things<00:01:00.660> that

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
bit challenge but one of the things that

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.160 
bit challenge but one of the things that
we<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.770> why<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.989> right<00:01:03.989> now

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
we are going to you why not right now

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.660 
we are going to you why not right now
sorry<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:06.260> trap<00:01:07.640> these<00:01:08.990> slabs<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:11.070> that

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
sorry is to trap these slabs to that

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.260 
sorry is to trap these slabs to that
base<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.600> order<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.080> make<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.560> body<00:01:13.939> maybe<00:01:14.939> we

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
base in order to make the body maybe we

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.420 
base in order to make the body maybe we
are<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.960> start<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.979> because

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
are going to start like this because

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.160 
are going to start like this because
body<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.900> at<00:01:19.710> least<00:01:19.790> that<00:01:20.790> long

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
body is going to be at least that long

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:37.660 
body is going to be at least that long
then<00:01:22.170> let's<00:01:22.680> see

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.940 

now<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.270> see<00:01:39.510> that<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.870> have<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.290> melt<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
now you can see that we have to melt the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.400 
now you can see that we have to melt the
two<00:01:41.100> pieces<00:01:41.340> together<00:01:41.640> okay<00:01:42.300> that's<00:01:43.290> very

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
two pieces together okay that's very

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.590 
two pieces together okay that's very
important<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:46.170> later<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:48.140> solid<00:01:49.140> a

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
important to have later a solid a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:02:04.850 
important to have later a solid a
structure<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.810> figuring<00:01:52.280> okay<00:02:03.440> then<00:02:04.440> we<00:02:04.680> know

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
structure and figuring okay then we know

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.930 
structure and figuring okay then we know
that<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:06.710> now<00:02:07.710> we<00:02:07.770> have<00:02:07.950> like<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.910> base<00:02:10.940> of

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
that here now we have like the base of

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:21.589 
that here now we have like the base of
the<00:02:12.330> body<00:02:12.510> already<00:02:12.930> here

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.649 

and<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.319> can<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.790> goes<00:02:24.060> like<00:02:24.329> this

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
and you can this it goes like this

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.559 
and you can this it goes like this
of<00:02:25.049> course<00:02:25.379> we<00:02:25.920> have<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.310> add<00:02:26.489> more<00:02:26.569> more

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
of course we have to add more more

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.670 
of course we have to add more more
material<00:02:28.079> here<00:02:28.109> and<00:02:28.980> try<00:02:29.639> to<00:02:29.670> go<00:02:30.409> little<00:02:31.409> bit

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
material here and try to go little bit

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.280 
material here and try to go little bit
down<00:02:31.950> maybe<00:02:32.370> when<00:02:33.329> I'm<00:02:33.510> going<00:02:33.749> to<00:02:33.810> go<00:02:34.019> that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
down maybe when I'm going to go that

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.809 
down maybe when I'm going to go that
down<00:02:34.650> because<00:02:36.709> our<00:02:37.709> structure<00:02:39.920> means<00:02:40.920> this

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
down because our structure means this

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.300 
down because our structure means this
tire<00:02:42.239> form<00:02:42.629> that<00:02:42.989> we<00:02:43.170> use<00:02:43.639> it's<00:02:44.639> quite<00:02:44.909> big<00:02:46.310> we

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
tire form that we use it's quite big we

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:58.429 
tire form that we use it's quite big we
don't<00:02:47.489> want<00:02:47.669> that<00:02:54.169> been<00:02:55.340> shown<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:58.230> know

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
don't want that been shown you know

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:03.939 
don't want that been shown you know
because<00:02:59.719> okay<00:03:00.719> that's<00:03:01.549> that's<00:03:02.549> okay

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:03.949 
because okay that's that's okay

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:15.170 
because okay that's that's okay
now<00:03:04.949> we<00:03:05.010> have<00:03:05.459> more<00:03:05.669> or<00:03:05.760> less<00:03:13.909> the<00:03:14.909> body

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
now we have more or less the body

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.139 
now we have more or less the body
structure<00:03:15.629> here
