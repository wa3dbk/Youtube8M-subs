00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
in that I don't even understand really

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.710 
in that I don't even understand really
why<00:01:33.510> this<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.320> long<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.830> it<00:01:35.130> kind<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.720> kind

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
why this is so long but it kind of kind

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.510 
why this is so long but it kind of kind
of<00:01:36.870> hangs<00:01:37.110> I'm<00:01:37.560> not<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.010> sure<00:01:38.130> what<00:01:38.490> that

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
of hangs I'm not really sure what that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.150 
of hangs I'm not really sure what that
design<00:01:39.060> idea<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.660> I<00:01:40.050> guess<00:01:42.230> no<00:01:43.230> no<00:01:43.710> clue<00:01:43.920> really

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
design idea is I guess no no clue really

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.700 
design idea is I guess no no clue really
you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.670> good<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.750> comment<00:01:46.080> tell<00:01:46.440> me<00:01:46.560> why

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
you can good if you comment tell me why

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.770 
you can good if you comment tell me why
they<00:01:47.340> would<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.270> length<00:01:48.510> it's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
they would have it at this length it's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.480 
they would have it at this length it's
not<00:01:48.900> really<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:49.410> long<00:01:49.620> that<00:01:49.830> you<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.130> leave<00:01:50.370> it

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
not really so long that you can leave it

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.650 
not really so long that you can leave it
in<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.670> car<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:50.940> this<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:51.390> gonna<00:01:51.600> be

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
in the car and this is not gonna be

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.570 
in the car and this is not gonna be
bothersome<00:01:52.170> or<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.010> can<00:01:53.160> leave<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.370> in<00:01:53.550> the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
bothersome or you can leave this in the

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.070 
bothersome or you can leave this in the
purse<00:01:53.820> they're<00:01:54.150> both<00:01:54.300> going<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.600> come<00:01:54.720> out<00:01:54.840> and

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
purse they're both going to come out and

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.410 
purse they're both going to come out and
it<00:01:55.260> kind<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.650> gets<00:01:56.250> caught<00:01:56.550> up<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.820> things<00:01:56.880> so

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
it kind of gets caught up on things so

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.970 
it kind of gets caught up on things so
that<00:01:57.990> would<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.290> negative<00:01:58.440> for<00:01:58.890> me

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
that would be a negative for me

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.550 
that would be a negative for me
relatively<00:01:59.910> heavy<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:00.480> I'm<00:02:00.990> small<00:02:01.320> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
pretty portable and in order to take it
