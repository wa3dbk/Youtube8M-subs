00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
and you can see the dice so you can

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.000 
and you can see the dice so you can
throw<00:03:26.570> a<00:03:26.630> whole<00:03:26.810> handful<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:27.410> guys<00:03:27.530> in<00:03:27.860> these

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.449 
this is a very simple thing to transport
too<00:03:35.630> because<00:03:36.050> it<00:03:36.230> comes<00:03:36.440> apart<00:03:36.769> and<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.340> all

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
too because it comes apart and it all

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.790 
too because it comes apart and it all
fits<00:03:37.760> in<00:03:37.880> an<00:03:37.970> envelope<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.630> whole<00:03:38.810> thing<00:03:39.080> is

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
fits in an envelope the whole thing is

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.590 
fits in an envelope the whole thing is
nice<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:40.820> when<00:03:40.940> you<00:03:41.000> put<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.209> together<00:03:41.330> it

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
nice and when you put it together it

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.930 
nice and when you put it together it
snaps<00:03:41.870> together<00:03:42.050> very<00:03:42.380> sturdily<00:03:42.860> and<00:03:43.160> is<00:03:43.730> easy

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
snaps together very sturdily and is easy

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.759 
snaps together very sturdily and is easy
to<00:03:44.090> move<00:03:44.269> around<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:44.840> I'm<00:03:45.230> not<00:03:45.500> worried<00:03:45.739> about

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
to move around and I'm not worried about

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.759 
to move around and I'm not worried about
the<00:03:46.010> thing<00:03:46.190> falling<00:03:46.550> apart<00:03:46.820> and<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:48.080> if<00:03:48.530> you
