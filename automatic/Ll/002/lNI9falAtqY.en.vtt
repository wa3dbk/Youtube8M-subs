 It happened yesterday morning 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.460
 Before that everything was fine 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.180
 I was walking down the street 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.640
 When suddenly he disappeared 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.980
 I really do not understand why 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.160
 We got along well with him and me 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.000
 He left without warning, without saying anything 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.960
 Hello, hello sir computer 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.500
 Tell me, tell me where my heart went 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.560
 I checked, it's not an error

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.700
 But he was really gone 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.000
 I must come to my rescue 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.440

 Hello, hello sir computer 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.200
 Do not look especially 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.920
 I found my heart 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.140
 It's a boy with a charming smile 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.940
