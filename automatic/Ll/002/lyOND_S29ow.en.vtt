00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.480 
nice features the next one I'm going to
go<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:21.080> muggy<00:02:21.260> as<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:22.130> can<00:02:22.250> see<00:02:22.430> i<00:02:22.460> have

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
go to is the muggy as you can see i have

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.530 
go to is the muggy as you can see i have
a<00:02:22.640> muggy<00:02:22.880> here<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:24.800> has<00:02:25.100> lots<00:02:25.940> of<00:02:26.030> upgrades<00:02:26.210> on

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
a muggy here it has lots of upgrades on

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.000 
a muggy here it has lots of upgrades on
it<00:02:26.630> but<00:02:26.780> i<00:02:26.810> was<00:02:26.960> it<00:02:27.140> this<00:02:27.290> isn't<00:02:27.410> this<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:27.860> a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
they call a hybrid monster truck why

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.470 
they call a hybrid monster truck why
because<00:02:31.550> well<00:02:31.880> it's<00:02:32.090> not<00:02:32.620> what<00:02:33.620> makes<00:02:33.860> it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
because well it's not what makes it

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
truggy is the center differential it's

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.650 
truggy is the center differential it's

is messed up you got the sign of
differential<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.810> don't<00:02:41.960> see<00:02:42.110> any<00:02:42.260> big<00:02:42.470> huge

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740

transmission<00:02:43.370> in<00:02:43.520> there<00:02:43.670> all<00:02:43.910> you<00:02:44.030> see<00:02:44.270> is<00:02:44.360> the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
transmission in there all you see is the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.510 
transmission in there all you see is the
cost<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.840> all<00:02:44.930> going<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.380> spur<00:02:46.160> gear<00:02:46.190> that

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
cost of all going to the spur gear that

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.910 
cost of all going to the spur gear that
is<00:02:46.610> a<00:02:46.640> differential<00:02:47.180> in<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.630> that's<00:02:48.440> why<00:02:48.650> they

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
is a differential in it that's why they

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.650 
is a differential in it that's why they
consider<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.310> truggy<00:02:50.560> now<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.790> body<00:02:53.030> on<00:02:53.240> looks

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
consider a truggy now the body on looks

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.860 
consider a truggy now the body on looks
like<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.810> struggling<00:02:58.450> okay<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.570> looks<00:02:59.600> like<00:02:59.750> a
