00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.249 
I really like the this erlan 2001 line
because<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> attention<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> detail<00:01:16.080> on

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
because of the attention to detail on

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.010 
because of the attention to detail on
the<00:01:16.350> accuracy<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.820> especially<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.689> Sailor

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the accuracy and especially the Sailor

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.170 
the accuracy and especially the Sailor
Moon<00:01:19.170> doll<00:01:19.380> because<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.740> think<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> all<00:01:20.939> of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
Moon doll because I think out of all of

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.440 
Moon doll because I think out of all of
them<00:01:22.040> all<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.100> characters<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.970> release<00:01:24.270> I

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
them all the characters that release I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.929 
them all the characters that release I
think<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> most<00:01:25.229> accurate<00:01:25.939> with

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
think this is the most accurate with

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.039 
think this is the most accurate with
color<00:01:27.210> wise<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.049> detail<00:01:28.380> wise<00:01:28.790> so<00:01:30.049> appearance

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
color wise and detail wise so appearance

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.620 
color wise and detail wise so appearance
wise<00:01:31.290> we'll<00:01:31.860> start<00:01:32.100> with<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> face<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.850> think

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
wise we'll start with the face I think

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.590 
wise we'll start with the face I think
the<00:01:33.780> face<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.290> her<00:01:34.670> out<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> other<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.329> all

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the face on her out of the other one all

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.929 
the face on her out of the other one all
the<00:01:36.869> others<00:01:37.110> again<00:01:37.710> looks<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.100> best<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.700> I

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the others again looks the best and I

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.010 
the others again looks the best and I
think<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.180> looks<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.479> most<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
think it looks the most like the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.429 
think it looks the most like the
character<00:01:41.150> her<00:01:42.150> eyes<00:01:42.360> they're<00:01:42.899> good<00:01:43.079> color<00:01:43.320> I

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
character her eyes they're good color I

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.530 
character her eyes they're good color I
really<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.100> way<00:01:44.189> they<00:01:44.369> look<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:45.360> her

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
really like the way they look that her

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.060 
really like the way they look that her
eyes<00:01:45.720> should<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.110> little<00:01:46.380> bit<00:01:46.500> darker<00:01:46.860> blue

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
eyes should be a little bit darker blue

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.710 
eyes should be a little bit darker blue
but<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:47.790> not<00:01:47.909> really<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.210> big<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.540> deal

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
but that's not really that big a deal

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.810 
but that's not really that big a deal
they<00:01:49.049> even<00:01:49.229> got<00:01:49.470> her<00:01:49.649> moon<00:01:49.890> earrings<00:01:50.340> which<00:01:50.640> is

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
they even got her moon earrings which is

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.090 
they even got her moon earrings which is
a<00:01:50.850> really<00:01:51.119> nice<00:01:51.299> touch<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.930> when<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> got<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:52.950> I

was<00:01:53.220> kind<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.430> afraid<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:54.270> they<00:01:54.420> wouldn't

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
