00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:08.720
 Hmm 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:14.500
 Tokyo- Osaka and Kagoshima may be seen within this thin band 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.500
 In difficult Japan, it is rare to be able to observe with such alternation 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.820
 Approximately 70% is observed 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.170
 It is the first time in 932 if it is not a Middle East eclipse 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.100
 then 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.100
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.170
 Kata in food and drink 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.980
 There is no decrease either 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.860
 What the hell is different with the manager 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.860
 ー ー ー ー Do you know the answer is the number of seams 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:46.270
 Good to me annular eclipse seen for the first time in 25 years 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.620
 Early morning on May 21st, Monday 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:54.870
 Annular solar eclipse to be 25 years in Japan will be observed 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.870
 But what exactly is a ring eclipse 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:05.990
 Here is a dvd that answers such questions 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:08.990
 1/400 miracle 21st century total eclipse gold ring eclipse 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.610
 It has been observed around the world in this century 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.890
 Total solar eclipse ring ring eclipse 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.200
 Rarely seen 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.610
 dai place 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.610
 I can enjoy bird 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:33.380
 So annular solar eclipse and the total eclipse is the hula issue has been noted out that what the hell is the difference 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.670
 Let's start with a young eclipse 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:41.330
 The solar eclipse is aligned with the Sun Moon Earth 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.730
 We say phenomenon that correspondence is concealed by the moon 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:51.180
 It is the point where the moon is at this time 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:52.290
 If the position of the moon is close to hourly salary, the moon looks large from the ground, so the sun is completely hidden by the moon 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.540
 It will end 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:01.300
 This is a total solar eclipse 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:04.380
 If the opposite position is far from the earth , the moon seen from the ground will be smaller 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.899
 The sun looks out of the moon 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.899
 This is the ring eclipse 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:22.760
 The light and heat of the sun are so strong that you will eat email if you look directly 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:22.760
 It is absolute to see with sunglasses Let's observe safely using exclusive eclipse glass 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:35.370
 The next ring eclipse can be observed in Hokkaido on June 1, 2030 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.370
 It seems to be about 300 years later to be seen in various places of Japan like this time
