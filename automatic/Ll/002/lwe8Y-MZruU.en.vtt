 I already have powder and concealer 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.440

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.160
 brush you can alternatively but also 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.840
 just use a white kajal 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.029
 so that we begin now to us the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.240
 Make white paint at one 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.910

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.410
 We then blur these passages 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.190
 the concealer brush is suitable 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.190
 especially good for that 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.820
 for the color in the face we take 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.430
 now a dull bronze and a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.410
 skunk brush with which you can 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.180

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.940
 I'll take the hula panzer now 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.129

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.420
 darker as your skin tone but it works 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.890

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.700
 Contour your face once 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.270

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.500
 cheeks and neck also not wrong 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.210
 she looked at the transitions well blinded 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.369
 so now you are a black one 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.080
 kajal and preferably already a sharpener 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:44.330
 with it because you have it on more often 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:48.259
 tip and then you catch one on you 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.259
 to paint tigernase 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:05.960
 her upper lip is also surrounded by her and 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:10.840
 she just paints black then want 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.840
 we have a connection from nose to mouth 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:21.530
 so and then the nÃ¤schen becomes black 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:25.750
 painted a freshly pointed kohl 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.750

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.670

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.349
 then we sit up from the eyebrow 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:24.060
 a hard contour at the tip of the nose 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:26.750

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.500
 make or in a round shape 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.080

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.690
