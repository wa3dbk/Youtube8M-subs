about this scissor so I got one and I
want<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> show<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.320> guys<00:00:31.590> or<00:00:32.009> tell<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.340> guys

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
want to show you guys or tell you guys

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.680 
want to show you guys or tell you guys
what<00:00:32.610> it's<00:00:32.730> really<00:00:32.880> all<00:00:32.969> about<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.450> what<00:00:33.570> it

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
what it's really all about and what it

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.510 
what it's really all about and what it
feels<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.500> your<00:00:34.559> hand<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.130> all<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.370> that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
feels like in your hand and all of that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.790 
feels like in your hand and all of that
so<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.300> makes<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.570> easier<00:00:36.899> if<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.770> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
so that it makes it easier if this is a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.470 
so that it makes it easier if this is a
scissor<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.250> you're<00:00:38.340> looking<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.700> pick<00:00:39.329> up

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
scissor that you're looking to pick up

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.410 
scissor that you're looking to pick up
so<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.649> acro<00:00:40.920> type<00:00:41.160> k<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> big<00:00:41.700> difference<00:00:42.180> i

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
so the acro type k the big difference i

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.690 
so the acro type k the big difference i
see<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.110> scissor<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.340> look<00:00:44.520> at

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
see in this scissor is if you look at

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.470 
see in this scissor is if you look at
like<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.910> acro<00:00:45.629> type<00:00:46.079> z2<00:00:46.940> you<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.300> that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
like the acro type z2 you can see that

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.420 
like the acro type z2 you can see that
that<00:00:48.660> all<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.140> handles<00:00:49.770> that's<00:00:50.039> really<00:00:50.309> what

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that all that handles that's really what

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.549 
that all that handles that's really what
makes<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.000> acro<00:00:51.480> scissor<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
makes this the acro scissor is that the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.130 
makes this the acro scissor is that the
handles<00:00:53.010> are<00:00:53.129> all<00:00:53.219> very<00:00:53.460> similar<00:00:53.870> so<00:00:54.870> if

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
handles are all very similar so if

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.529 
handles are all very similar so if
you're<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> fan<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> acro<00:00:56.579> already<00:00:56.879> then

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
you're a fan of the acro already then

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.209 
you're a fan of the acro already then
then<00:00:57.930> you're<00:00:58.020> good<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.230> go<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.530> what<00:00:58.770> what

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
then you're good to go but what what

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.650 
then you're good to go but what what
really<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.670> you've<00:00:59.789> never<00:00:59.940> used<00:01:00.239> an<00:01:00.359> acro

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
really if you've never used an acro

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.750 
really if you've never used an acro
scissor<00:01:00.930> what<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.620> does<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
scissor what it does is it that the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.429 
scissor what it does is it that the
thumb<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.300> placed<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.780> little<00:01:03.930> bit<00:01:04.140> further

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
thumb is placed a little bit further

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.370 
thumb is placed a little bit further
away<00:01:04.909> and<00:01:05.909> what<00:01:06.210> i<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.450> about<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.020> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
away and what i like about this is it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.380 
away and what i like about this is it
actually<00:01:07.409> helps<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.340> not<00:01:08.520> crimping<00:01:09.240> your

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
actually helps with not crimping your

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.690 
actually helps with not crimping your
hand<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.900> much<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.799> lot<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.220> people

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
hand so much because a lot of people

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.130 
hand so much because a lot of people
that<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:11.909> carpal<00:01:12.180> tunnel<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.630> happens<00:01:12.930> right

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that get carpal tunnel it happens right

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.109 
that get carpal tunnel it happens right
in<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:14.159> from<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.400> pinching

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
in here and it's from that pinching

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.240 
in here and it's from that pinching
motion<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:16.170> your<00:01:16.350> hand<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.770> happens<00:01:17.100> all

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250

motion with your hand that happens all
the<00:01:17.280> time<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.759> that's<00:01:18.180> why<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> lot<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.630> people

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the time so that's why a lot of people

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.020 
the time so that's why a lot of people
love<00:01:19.170> using<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.710> let's<00:01:20.340> say<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> swivel

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
love using like let's say a swivel

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.670 
love using like let's say a swivel
scissor<00:01:21.240> because<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.990> puts<00:01:22.200> your<00:01:22.320> finger

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
scissor because it puts your finger

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.380 
scissor because it puts your finger
further<00:01:23.070> away<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.850> don't<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.330> much

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
further away so you don't get so much

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.960 
further away so you don't get so much
pinching<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.080> there<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.159> personally<00:01:26.820> I

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
pinching in there but I personally I

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.390 
pinching in there but I personally I
like<00:01:27.509> using<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.869> swivel<00:01:28.200> sometimes<00:01:28.619> some

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
like using a swivel sometimes some

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.340 
like using a swivel sometimes some
people<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.970> Brian<00:01:30.180> loves<00:01:30.570> swivel<00:01:31.020> scissors

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
people like Brian loves swivel scissors

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.920 
people like Brian loves swivel scissors
can't<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.040> him<00:01:32.159> away<00:01:32.220> from<00:01:32.340> him<00:01:32.670> i<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.450> like

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
can't get him away from him i I like

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.520 
can't get him away from him i I like
them<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.229> certain<00:01:34.500> things<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.939> acro

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
them for certain things but the acro

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.679 
them for certain things but the acro
getting<00:01:37.530> back<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.549> has<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.329> finger

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
getting back to that it has the finger

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.940 
getting back to that it has the finger
holes<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> little<00:01:40.259> bit<00:01:40.470> further<00:01:40.710> away<00:01:40.829> so

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
holes are a little bit further away so

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.770 
holes are a little bit further away so
there's<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:41.579> much<00:01:41.820> pinching<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.450> there<00:01:42.600> so

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
there's not as much pinching in there so

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.899 
there's not as much pinching in there so
I<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.409> about<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.549> got<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> nice

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
I like that about it it's got a nice

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.569 
I like that about it it's got a nice
point<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.689> blade<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.649> some<00:01:47.100> people<00:01:47.369> don't

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
point to the blade so some people don't

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.520 
point to the blade so some people don't
like<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.759> super<00:01:48.149> round<00:01:48.420> blade<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.229> got<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> nice

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
like a super round blade it's got a nice

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.319 
like a super round blade it's got a nice
point<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.100> great<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.430> precision<00:01:51.060> cutting

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
point it's great for precision cutting

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.300 
point it's great for precision cutting
that's<00:01:51.509> really<00:01:51.810> what<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.079> scissors<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.770> made

know when I was in beauty school

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.600 
know when I was in beauty school
everybody<00:02:01.350> was<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:02.100> got<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
think even on eBay once I ordered a

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.699 
think even on eBay once I ordered a
10-inch<00:02:08.879> scissor<00:02:09.149> that's<00:02:09.479> I've<00:02:09.690> control<00:02:10.470> it's

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
10-inch scissor that's I've control it's

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.500 
10-inch scissor that's I've control it's
crazy<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:12.300> five<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.900> half<00:02:12.930> just

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
crazy so five and a half just

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.270 
crazy so five and a half just
you<00:02:13.659> have<00:02:13.870> control<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.409> it<00:02:14.769> you<00:02:14.920> can<00:02:15.069> really

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
you have control of it you can really

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.830 
you have control of it you can really
work<00:02:15.459> in<00:02:15.730> there<00:02:15.939> anytime<00:02:16.689> you're<00:02:16.810> cutting

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
work in there anytime you're cutting

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.289 
work in there anytime you're cutting
precision<00:02:17.319> lines<00:02:17.950> now<00:02:18.489> if<00:02:18.970> you're<00:02:19.060> trying<00:02:19.269> to

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
precision lines now if you're trying to

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.330 
precision lines now if you're trying to
cut<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.510> precision<00:02:19.989> line<00:02:20.379> you're<00:02:21.099> not<00:02:21.250> gonna

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
cut a precision line you're not gonna

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.039 
cut a precision line you're not gonna
use<00:02:21.549> a<00:02:21.579> longer<00:02:21.909> scissor<00:02:22.299> because<00:02:22.689> the<00:02:22.840> hair

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
use a longer scissor because the hair

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.750 
use a longer scissor because the hair
has<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.349> travel<00:02:23.739> so<00:02:24.040> much<00:02:24.159> further<00:02:24.459> when<00:02:24.640> that

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
has to travel so much further when that

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.000 
has to travel so much further when that
scissor<00:02:25.030> comes<00:02:25.329> down<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.689> cut<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.799> blade

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
scissor comes down to cut and the blade

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.039 
scissor comes down to cut and the blade
comes<00:02:27.250> down<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.519> cut<00:02:27.700> but<00:02:28.120> it's<00:02:28.360> more<00:02:28.629> bound<00:02:28.870> to

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
comes down to cut but it's more bound to

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.930 
comes down to cut but it's more bound to
push<00:02:29.379> the<00:02:29.680> hair<00:02:29.890> if<00:02:30.190> you're<00:02:30.430> trying<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.760> cut

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
push the hair if you're trying to cut

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.550 
push the hair if you're trying to cut
with<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.120> longer<00:02:31.420> scissor<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.170> work<00:02:32.379> with

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
with a longer scissor so work with

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.710 
with a longer scissor so work with
something<00:02:32.950> smaller<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.730> you're<00:02:34.360> gonna<00:02:34.450> have

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
something smaller and you're gonna have

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.479 
something smaller and you're gonna have
you<00:02:35.019> know<00:02:35.110> an<00:02:35.200> easier<00:02:35.409> time<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.769> way<00:02:35.920> also

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
you know an easier time that way also

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.100 
you know an easier time that way also
you're<00:02:37.120> gonna<00:02:37.239> have<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.450> lot<00:02:37.690> easier<00:02:37.720> time

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
you're gonna have a lot easier time

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.440 
you're gonna have a lot easier time
cutting<00:02:38.620> precise<00:02:39.129> if<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:40.000> have<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.150> smaller

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
cutting precise if you have a smaller

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.729 
cutting precise if you have a smaller
blade<00:02:40.690> because<00:02:41.109> you're<00:02:41.230> gonna<00:02:41.349> be<00:02:41.530> able<00:02:41.650> to

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
blade because you're gonna be able to

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.640 
blade because you're gonna be able to
fit<00:02:41.980> into<00:02:42.250> those<00:02:42.790> spots<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.900> head<00:02:44.109> where

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
fit into those spots on the head where

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.890 
fit into those spots on the head where
the<00:02:44.769> shoulders<00:02:45.099> get<00:02:45.310> in<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.459> way<00:02:45.629> your<00:02:46.629> gets

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
the shoulders get in the way your gets

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.380 
the shoulders get in the way your gets
in<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.049> way<00:02:47.140> whatever<00:02:47.549> so<00:02:48.549> just<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.359> know

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
in the way whatever so just you know

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.580 
in the way whatever so just you know
check<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.170> out<00:02:50.260> as<00:02:50.379> well

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
I love the acro type k it's got a flat

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.110 
I love the acro type k it's got a flat
screw<00:02:52.889> easy<00:02:53.889> to<00:02:54.190> tighten<00:02:54.400> easy<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.879> work<00:02:55.060> with

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
screw easy to tighten easy to work with

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.509 
screw easy to tighten easy to work with
I<00:02:55.599> think<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.650> can<00:02:56.799> even<00:02:56.889> order<00:02:57.159> it<00:02:57.310> with<00:02:57.400> the

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
I think you can even order it with the

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.110 
I think you can even order it with the
removable<00:02:57.879> tang<00:02:58.209> is<00:02:58.239> what<00:02:58.629> Mizutani<00:02:59.200> says<00:02:59.739> so

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
removable tang is what Mizutani says so

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.119 
removable tang is what Mizutani says so
um<00:03:01.120> but<00:03:01.359> I<00:03:01.510> sometimes<00:03:02.139> I'm<00:03:02.409> the<00:03:02.769> removable

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
um but I sometimes I'm the removable

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.039 
um but I sometimes I'm the removable
tang<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.489> kind<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.730> annoying<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:04.629> I<00:03:04.659> like<00:03:05.019> that

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
tang is kind of annoying so I like that

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.690 
tang is kind of annoying so I like that
it's<00:03:05.319> a<00:03:05.409> saw<00:03:05.650> there<00:03:05.889> why<00:03:06.040> would<00:03:06.069> you<00:03:06.310> ever<00:03:06.489> need

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
it's a saw there why would you ever need

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.129 
it's a saw there why would you ever need
to<00:03:06.760> remove<00:03:06.909> it<00:03:07.150> anyways<00:03:07.569> does<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:07.989> make<00:03:08.109> sense

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
to remove it anyways does it make sense

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.069 
to remove it anyways does it make sense
so<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:09.790> know<00:03:09.909> this<00:03:10.090> scissor<00:03:10.540> fits<00:03:10.870> really

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
so you know this scissor fits really

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.199 
so you know this scissor fits really
well<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.739> Tang<00:03:11.980> doesn't<00:03:12.280> scoop<00:03:12.489> too<00:03:12.700> much<00:03:12.909> so

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
well the Tang doesn't scoop too much so
