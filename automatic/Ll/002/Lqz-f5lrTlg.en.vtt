 watching this combination lock 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.510
 but it is clear that there are all these three zeros 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.970
 there probably and here as if this 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.260
 the clasp fastens so no one is there 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.090
 while you go nobody there 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.549
