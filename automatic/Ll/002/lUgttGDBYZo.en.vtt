00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
sometimes difficult to dodge so that was

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.820

to wake up feeling more refreshed and

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.759 
to wake up feeling more refreshed and
it's<00:04:17.600> going<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.810> be<00:04:17.870> easier<00:04:18.229> for<00:04:18.260> you<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:18.530> get

it's going to be easier for you to get

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.590 
it's going to be easier for you to get

up and you'll find yourself waking up
without<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:21.049> need<00:04:21.169> for<00:04:21.229> an<00:04:21.590> alarm<00:04:22.160> clock<00:04:22.490> I

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
without the need for an alarm clock I

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.680 
without the need for an alarm clock I
think<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.740> kind<00:04:25.580> of<00:04:25.669> the<00:04:25.880> sleep<00:04:26.180> cycle<00:04:26.360> we

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
think the kind of the sleep cycle we

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.050 
think the kind of the sleep cycle we
have<00:04:26.900> in<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.200> US<00:04:27.560> where<00:04:27.919> you<00:04:28.430> wake<00:04:28.580> up<00:04:28.729> early

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
have in the US where you wake up early

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.909 
have in the US where you wake up early
on<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.360> weekdays<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.169> then<00:04:30.289> you<00:04:30.380> sleep<00:04:30.650> in<00:04:30.770> on

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
on the weekdays and then you sleep in on

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.409 
on the weekdays and then you sleep in on
the<00:04:30.950> weekends<00:04:31.430> it's<00:04:31.669> actually<00:04:32.060> one<00:04:32.270> of<00:04:32.300> the

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
the weekends it's actually one of the

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.420 
the weekends it's actually one of the
causes<00:04:32.630> for<00:04:32.900> why<00:04:33.260> so<00:04:33.530> many<00:04:33.680> people<00:04:33.770> have<00:04:34.160> such

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
causes for why so many people have such

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.800 
causes for why so many people have such
a<00:04:34.460> difficult<00:04:34.970> time<00:04:35.150> getting<00:04:35.180> up<00:04:35.539> in<00:04:35.720> the

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
a difficult time getting up in the

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.870 
a difficult time getting up in the
mornings<00:04:36.200> if<00:04:36.919> you<00:04:37.100> just<00:04:37.280> woke<00:04:37.430> up<00:04:37.610> at<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.820> same

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
time every day you did that for 21 days
