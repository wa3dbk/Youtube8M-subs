00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
Galaxy Tab 10.1 note let's take a look

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.099 
Galaxy Tab 10.1 note let's take a look
at<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> features<00:01:00.090> first<00:01:00.600> thing<00:01:00.719> I'll<00:01:01.020> mention

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
at the features first thing I'll mention

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.209 
at the features first thing I'll mention
about<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> case<00:01:01.710> which<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.980> little

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
about the case which is little

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.160 
about the case which is little
disappointing<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.690> came<00:01:03.840> through

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
disappointing is that as it came through

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.920 
disappointing is that as it came through
the<00:01:04.290> mail<00:01:05.119> you<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> would<00:01:06.630> say<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the mail you know I would say that the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.840 
the mail you know I would say that the
packages<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.770> packaging<00:01:08.220> isn't<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
packages the packaging isn't the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.460 
packages the packaging isn't the
greatest<00:01:08.939> you'll<00:01:09.659> notice<00:01:09.930> right<00:01:09.960> here<00:01:10.080> that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
greatest you'll notice right here that

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.080 
greatest you'll notice right here that
it<00:01:10.590> has<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.920> kind<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.189> indentation<00:01:11.520> I'll

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it has this kind of indentation I'll

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.320 
it has this kind of indentation I'll
probably<00:01:12.330> send<00:01:12.540> an<00:01:12.659> email<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.290> actual

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
probably send an email to the actual

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.719 
probably send an email to the actual
manufacturer<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.780> I've<00:01:16.470> had<00:01:17.009> other<00:01:17.130> cases<00:01:17.460> as

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
manufacturer but I've had other cases as

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.370 
manufacturer but I've had other cases as
you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.970> see<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.479> probably<00:01:18.689> get<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> dimple

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
you can see they probably get a dimple

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.080 
you can see they probably get a dimple
as<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.189> press<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.820> see<00:01:20.970> these

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
as you press on it you can see these

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.390 
as you press on it you can see these
dimples<00:01:21.299> pop<00:01:21.600> up<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.930> then<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.590> pops<00:01:22.920> back<00:01:23.070> out

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
dimples pop up and then it pops back out

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.280 
dimples pop up and then it pops back out
so<00:01:23.670> they<00:01:23.759> don't<00:01:23.939> show<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.150> anymore<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:25.140> this

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
so they don't show up anymore but this

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.870 
so they don't show up anymore but this
crease<00:01:25.590> I've<00:01:25.799> had<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> couple<00:01:26.280> days<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
crease I've had it for a couple days and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.240 
crease I've had it for a couple days and
the<00:01:26.970> crease<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.180> doesn't<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.810> away<00:01:28.250> outside

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the crease just doesn't go away outside

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.670 
the crease just doesn't go away outside
of<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.329> pretty<00:01:30.720> standard<00:01:31.079> very<00:01:31.290> slim

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
of that it's a pretty standard very slim

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.569 
of that it's a pretty standard very slim
case<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.310> has<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.390> microfiber<00:01:33.990> interior<00:01:34.579> with

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
case it has the microfiber interior with

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.280 
case it has the microfiber interior with
the<00:01:35.729> groove<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> channels<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.020> you

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
the groove or the channels so that you

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.780 
the groove or the channels so that you
can<00:01:37.470> actually<00:01:37.650> rest<00:01:38.159> your<00:01:38.369> tablet<00:01:38.700> in

different<00:01:39.030> degrees<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.570> really<00:01:40.320> there's<00:01:40.590> not

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
different degrees and really there's not

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.789 
different degrees and really there's not
a<00:01:40.950> lot<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.570> padding<00:01:42.570> with<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> case<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:43.680> an

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
a lot of padding with the case it's an

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.429 
a lot of padding with the case it's an
ultra-thin<00:01:44.210> case<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.899> let's<00:01:46.110> see<00:01:46.259> how<00:01:46.290> you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
ultra-thin case so let's see how you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.399 
ultra-thin case so let's see how you
would<00:01:46.710> insert<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.159> case<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.700> how<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
would insert the case and how do the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.859 
would insert the case and how do the
ports<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.220> pen<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.700> line<00:01:51.509> when<00:01:51.750> it's

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
ports and the pen a line when it's

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.980 
ports and the pen a line when it's
inside<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:53.000> you'll<00:01:54.000> exert<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.479> here's<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
inside so you'll exert the here's the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.959 
inside so you'll exert the here's the
this<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.500> camera<00:01:55.829> cut<00:01:56.009> out<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.670> what<00:01:56.820> we'll

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
this is the camera cut out so what we'll

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.340 
this is the camera cut out so what we'll
do<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.149> we'll<00:01:57.299> insert<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.719> tab<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.200> way

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
do is we'll insert the tab this way

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.639 
do is we'll insert the tab this way
towards<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.310> cutout<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.960> will<00:02:01.170> slide<00:02:01.469> in

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
towards the cutout and it will slide in

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.580 
towards the cutout and it will slide in
tight<00:02:02.000> okay<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.210> then<00:02:03.750> what<00:02:04.110> we'll<00:02:04.259> do<00:02:04.409> is

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
tight okay and then what we'll do is

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.830 
tight okay and then what we'll do is
we'll<00:02:04.740> snap<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.250> sides<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.820> your<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.360> snap

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
we'll snap the sides in your just snap

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.120 
we'll snap the sides in your just snap
and<00:02:07.110> then<00:02:07.619> here's<00:02:07.799> another<00:02:07.979> side<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.879> what

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
and then here's another side and what

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.790 
and then here's another side and what
and<00:02:09.400> closed<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.670> case<00:02:10.000> now<00:02:10.960> let's<00:02:11.530> look<00:02:11.680> at

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
and closed the case now let's look at

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.650 
and closed the case now let's look at
the<00:02:11.890> cutouts<00:02:12.190> if<00:02:12.970> we<00:02:13.120> look<00:02:13.210> at<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.390> cut<00:02:13.540> outs

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
the cutouts if we look at the cut outs

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.600 
the cutouts if we look at the cut outs
here<00:02:13.960> you'll<00:02:14.110> notice<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.410> things<00:02:15.280> are<00:02:15.460> cut

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
here you'll notice that things are cut

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.160 
here you'll notice that things are cut
out<00:02:15.640> rather<00:02:15.940> nicely<00:02:16.060> you're<00:02:16.750> not<00:02:16.960> really

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
out rather nicely you're not really

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.630 
out rather nicely you're not really
obstructing<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.860> camera<00:02:18.280> you're<00:02:18.490> not

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
obstructing the camera you're not

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.450 
obstructing the camera you're not
obstructing<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.240> actual<00:02:19.690> flash<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.770> that's

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
obstructing the actual flash so that's

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.700 
obstructing the actual flash so that's
nice<00:02:21.700> on<00:02:22.630> this<00:02:22.810> side<00:02:23.020> you'll<00:02:23.170> notice<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.470> you

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
nice on this side you'll notice that you

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.410 
nice on this side you'll notice that you
have<00:02:23.740> access<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.520> your<00:02:24.550> power<00:02:24.820> button<00:02:25.090> and

covered by the actual grip here that

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.090 
covered by the actual grip here that
closes<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.510> case<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:32.320> does<00:02:32.620> not<00:02:32.650> have<00:02:33.070> a

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
closes the case this does not have a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.340 
closes the case this does not have a
magnetic<00:02:33.460> cover<00:02:33.790> at<00:02:34.000> all<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.720> do<00:02:34.900> have<00:02:35.050> access

microphone your headphone jack and if we
go<00:02:40.810> around<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.050> sides<00:02:41.350> you'll<00:02:42.040> notice<00:02:42.340> that

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
go around the sides you'll notice that

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.430 
go around the sides you'll notice that
it<00:02:42.880> does<00:02:43.120> provide<00:02:43.420> adequate<00:02:43.870> protection<00:02:43.900> on

areas i found and you know maybe this is

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.690 
areas i found and you know maybe this is
a<00:03:05.440> design<00:03:05.740> flaw<00:03:06.070> or<00:03:06.250> something<00:03:06.490> that<00:03:06.610> you

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
a design flaw or something that you

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.730 
a design flaw or something that you
think<00:03:06.940> about<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.300> well<00:03:07.840> they<00:03:08.050> did<00:03:08.260> design<00:03:08.560> it

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
think about is well they did design it

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.650 
think about is well they did design it
so<00:03:08.770> that<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.070> can<00:03:09.190> take<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.490> s<00:03:09.610> turn<00:03:09.880> out<00:03:10.120> so

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
so that you can take the s turn out so

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.510 
so that you can take the s turn out so
you<00:03:10.750> can<00:03:10.870> take<00:03:11.050> that<00:03:11.080> spin<00:03:11.470> out<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.830> they<00:03:12.280> move

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
you can take that spin out and they move

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.950 
you can take that spin out and they move
what<00:03:12.850> will<00:03:12.970> normally<00:03:13.300> be<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.570> corner

there's like a corner edge here there's

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.300 
there's like a corner edge here there's
no<00:03:22.180> support<00:03:22.450> protecting<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.320> corner<00:03:23.710> so<00:03:24.160> what

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
no support protecting the corner so what

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.740 
no support protecting the corner so what
I<00:03:24.340> would<00:03:24.430> have<00:03:24.580> done<00:03:24.670> in<00:03:25.030> designing<00:03:25.300> this<00:03:25.510> case

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
I would have done in designing this case

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.510 
I would have done in designing this case
is<00:03:25.900> taken<00:03:26.230> this<00:03:26.470> protector<00:03:27.010> right<00:03:27.220> here<00:03:27.400> this

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
is taken this protector right here this

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.760 
is taken this protector right here this
bumper<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.120> put<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.690> right<00:03:28.930> here<00:03:28.990> on<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.500> side

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
bumper and put it right here on the side

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.430 
bumper and put it right here on the side
so<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.610> you'd<00:03:31.090> have<00:03:31.180> adequate<00:03:31.990> protection

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
so that you'd have adequate protection

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.540 
so that you'd have adequate protection
here<00:03:32.740> and<00:03:33.000> here<00:03:34.290> missing<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.380> here<00:03:35.710> I'm<00:03:36.430> just

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
here and here missing it here I'm just

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.860 
here and here missing it here I'm just
concerned<00:03:36.850> that<00:03:36.970> if<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.240> were<00:03:37.420> if<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.690> case

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
concerned that if you were if the case

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.990 
concerned that if you were if the case
ripped<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.170> bit<00:03:38.380> banged<00:03:38.980> up<00:03:39.220> on<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.760> side

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
ripped a bit banged up on the side

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.180 
ripped a bit banged up on the side
there's<00:03:40.720> no<00:03:40.870> protection<00:03:41.380> so<00:03:41.740> that's<00:03:41.920> kind<00:03:42.130> of

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
there's no protection so that's kind of

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.140 
there's no protection so that's kind of
a<00:03:42.280> design<00:03:42.640> i<00:03:42.970> would<00:03:43.240> say<00:03:43.390> a<00:03:43.420> design<00:03:43.870> deficiency

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
a design i would say a design deficiency

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.520 
a design i would say a design deficiency
you<00:03:46.150> have<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.510> this<00:03:46.959> is<00:03:47.080> one<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.350> cases

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
you have it this is one of the cases

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.960 
you have it this is one of the cases
that<00:03:47.680> while<00:03:47.980> close<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.490> can<00:03:48.640> still<00:03:48.820> charge

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
that while close you can still charge

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.430 
that while close you can still charge
your<00:03:49.180> tab<00:03:49.360> which<00:03:49.600> is<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.780> good<00:03:49.990> thing<00:03:50.050> you<00:03:50.350> can

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
your tab which is a good thing you can

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.780 
your tab which is a good thing you can
see<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.650> charging<00:03:51.040> port<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.310> available<00:03:51.640> there

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
see the charging port is available there

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.060 
see the charging port is available there
and<00:03:52.000> then<00:03:52.870> what<00:03:53.050> you<00:03:53.080> have<00:03:53.320> on<00:03:53.470> this<00:03:53.620> side<00:03:53.800> is

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
and then what you have on this side is

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.920 
and then what you have on this side is
the<00:03:54.370> traditional<00:03:54.790> bumpers<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.420> you<00:03:55.480> have<00:03:55.690> your

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
the traditional bumpers so you have your

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.440 
the traditional bumpers so you have your
corner<00:03:56.500> bumper<00:03:56.650> here<00:03:57.100> over<00:03:58.090> here<00:03:58.209> another

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
corner bumper here over here another

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.240 
corner bumper here over here another
bumper<00:03:58.900> a<00:03:58.930> corner<00:03:59.440> and<00:03:59.620> then<00:03:59.770> you<00:03:59.860> have<00:04:00.010> one<00:04:00.220> on

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
bumper a corner and then you have one on

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.250 
bumper a corner and then you have one on
this<00:04:00.430> side<00:04:00.610> so<00:04:00.670> this<00:04:01.180> side<00:04:01.420> is<00:04:01.690> adequately

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
this side so this side is adequately

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.990 
this side so this side is adequately
protected<00:04:02.709> you<00:04:02.830> notice<00:04:03.100> you<00:04:03.580> really<00:04:03.850> don't

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
protected you notice you really don't

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.490 
protected you notice you really don't
have<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.180> worry<00:04:04.360> about<00:04:04.450> anything<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:05.260> comes

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
have to worry about anything it comes

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.650 
have to worry about anything it comes
down<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.830> this<00:04:05.950> side<00:04:06.190> or<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:07.120> only<00:04:07.270> have<00:04:07.450> two

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
down to this side or you only have two

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.390 
down to this side or you only have two
here<00:04:07.990> and<00:04:08.110> I<00:04:08.170> probably<00:04:08.470> would<00:04:09.070> have<00:04:09.160> put

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
here and I probably would have put

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.550 
here and I probably would have put
another<00:04:09.610> one<00:04:09.820> right<00:04:09.880> here<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.570> still<00:04:11.260> giving

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
another one right here and still giving

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.220 
another one right here and still giving
you<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.770> ability<00:04:11.860> to<00:04:12.160> take<00:04:12.430> out<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.760> pen

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
you the ability to take out the pen

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.510 
you the ability to take out the pen
another<00:04:14.230> thing<00:04:14.440> that<00:04:14.560> i<00:04:14.620> mentioned<00:04:15.040> that<00:04:15.160> not

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
another thing that i mentioned that not

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.420 
another thing that i mentioned that not
too<00:04:15.700> thrilled<00:04:15.940> about<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.330> case<00:04:16.540> is<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:17.430> when

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
too thrilled about the case is that when

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.349 
too thrilled about the case is that when
you<00:04:18.520> snap<00:04:18.729> it<00:04:18.760> on<00:04:19.109> its<00:04:20.109> kind<00:04:20.500> of

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
you snap it on its kind of

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.510 
you snap it on its kind of
is<00:04:21.509> as<00:04:21.900> easy<00:04:22.199> to<00:04:22.349> snap<00:04:22.620> on<00:04:22.860> there's<00:04:23.219> there's

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
is as easy to snap on there's there's

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.610 
is as easy to snap on there's there's
kind<00:04:23.729> of<00:04:23.819> a<00:04:23.879> little<00:04:24.090> trick<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.659> it<00:04:24.780> doesn't

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
kind of a little trick to it doesn't

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.679 
kind of a little trick to it doesn't
close<00:04:25.830> easily<00:04:26.430> but<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.150> also<00:04:27.270> means<00:04:27.539> that<00:04:27.569> it

00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:27.689 
close easily but it also means that it

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:29.480 
close easily but it also means that it
won't<00:04:27.840> open<00:04:27.930> easily<00:04:28.319> but<00:04:28.830> you'll<00:04:28.979> notice<00:04:29.129> as

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
won't open easily but you'll notice as

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.520 
won't open easily but you'll notice as
I'm<00:04:29.669> trying<00:04:29.909> to<00:04:30.000> close<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.449> whereas<00:04:31.139> I<00:04:31.259> put<00:04:31.439> the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
I'm trying to close it whereas I put the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.399 
I'm trying to close it whereas I put the
cover<00:04:31.740> on<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:31.919> you<00:04:32.400> have<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:33.050> kind<00:04:34.050> of<00:04:34.080> push<00:04:34.259> it

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:34.409 
cover on it you have to kind of push it

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:35.420 
cover on it you have to kind of push it
in<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:34.590> then<00:04:34.680> you<00:04:34.800> still<00:04:34.979> have<00:04:35.069> to<00:04:35.129> pushing<00:04:35.310> a

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
in and then you still have to pushing a

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.529 
in and then you still have to pushing a
little<00:04:35.520> bit<00:04:35.699> further<00:04:35.969> so<00:04:36.210> that<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.449> will

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
little bit further so that it will

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.300 
little bit further so that it will
really<00:04:36.780> close<00:04:37.199> if<00:04:37.229> not<00:04:37.439> it<00:04:37.770> stays<00:04:37.979> raised

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
really close if not it stays raised

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.459 
really close if not it stays raised
you'll<00:04:39.090> also<00:04:39.270> notice<00:04:39.539> that<00:04:39.689> as<00:04:39.990> it's<00:04:40.199> closed

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:40.469 
you'll also notice that as it's closed

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.700 
you'll also notice that as it's closed
because<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:41.699> thing<00:04:41.939> is<00:04:41.969> over<00:04:42.539> tight<00:04:42.930> it<00:04:43.319> kind

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
because this thing is over tight it kind

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.529 
because this thing is over tight it kind
of<00:04:43.800> pushes<00:04:44.069> in<00:04:44.340> on<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.550> sides<00:04:44.819> kind<00:04:45.300> of<00:04:45.389> lift

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
of pushes in on the sides kind of lift

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.080 
of pushes in on the sides kind of lift
up<00:04:45.750> so<00:04:46.349> I<00:04:46.409> like<00:04:46.560> some<00:04:46.710> of<00:04:46.830> my<00:04:46.860> other<00:04:47.099> cases<00:04:47.430> with

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
up so I like some of my other cases with

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.790 
up so I like some of my other cases with
this<00:04:48.270> stays<00:04:48.449> flush<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.259> you<00:04:49.349> don't<00:04:49.500> see<00:04:49.770> that

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
this stays flush and you don't see that

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.980 
this stays flush and you don't see that
kind<00:04:50.069> of<00:04:50.520> butterfly<00:04:50.939> effect<00:04:51.389> with<00:04:51.629> you<00:04:51.900> know

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
kind of butterfly effect with you know

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:04.379 
know while I pointed out some defects in

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.219 
know while I pointed out some defects in
the<00:05:04.439> case<00:05:04.650> for<00:05:05.460> four<00:05:05.969> sub<00:05:06.539> twenty<00:05:06.870> dollars

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
the case for four sub twenty dollars

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.290 
the case for four sub twenty dollars
it's<00:05:08.129> not<00:05:08.310> bad<00:05:08.639> and<00:05:08.879> I<00:05:08.939> guess<00:05:09.120> you<00:05:09.240> could

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
it's not bad and I guess you could

it's not bad and I guess you could
probably<00:05:09.569> deserve<00:05:10.050> it<00:05:10.199> as<00:05:10.529> far<00:05:11.159> as<00:05:11.189> using<00:05:11.460> it

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
probably deserve it as far as using it

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.360 
probably deserve it as far as using it
from<00:05:11.849> 44<00:05:12.810> viewing<00:05:13.080> angles<00:05:13.469> you<00:05:13.800> know<00:05:13.919> as<00:05:14.159> you

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
from 44 viewing angles you know as you

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.769 
from 44 viewing angles you know as you
remove<00:05:14.580> the<00:05:14.729> edges<00:05:15.029> as<00:05:15.120> you<00:05:15.210> to<00:05:15.360> additionally

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:15.779 
remove the edges as you to additionally

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:17.570 
remove the edges as you to additionally
do<00:05:15.960> you<00:05:16.439> can<00:05:16.620> rest<00:05:16.889> it<00:05:17.039> in<00:05:17.159> any<00:05:17.340> of<00:05:17.490> these

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
do you can rest it in any of these

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.209 
do you can rest it in any of these
angles<00:05:18.029> the<00:05:18.479> grooves<00:05:18.750> are<00:05:19.020> deep<00:05:19.349> enough<00:05:19.469> where

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
angles the grooves are deep enough where

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.129 
angles the grooves are deep enough where
you<00:05:20.789> know<00:05:20.909> it<00:05:21.210> will<00:05:21.360> not<00:05:21.569> fall<00:05:21.810> out<00:05:21.960> of<00:05:21.990> the

you know it will not fall out of the

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.110 
you know it will not fall out of the
space<00:05:22.439> easily<00:05:22.860> so<00:05:22.919> you<00:05:23.039> can<00:05:23.159> see<00:05:23.310> as<00:05:23.520> I<00:05:23.759> move<00:05:23.789> it

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
space easily so you can see as I move it

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.879 
space easily so you can see as I move it
it<00:05:24.419> kind<00:05:24.659> of<00:05:24.719> stays<00:05:25.020> we're<00:05:25.349> supposed<00:05:25.650> to<00:05:25.710> be

it kind of stays we're supposed to be
and<00:05:26.159> then<00:05:26.639> it<00:05:26.759> has<00:05:26.909> that<00:05:27.089> third<00:05:27.330> and<00:05:27.629> arch

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
and then it has that third and arch

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.680 
and then it has that third and arch
which<00:05:28.680> is<00:05:28.979> where<00:05:29.190> this<00:05:29.729> last<00:05:30.029> piece<00:05:30.270> of<00:05:30.330> carry
