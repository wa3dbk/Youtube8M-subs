this<00:01:07.740> shoe<00:01:08.100> more<00:01:08.310> formula<00:01:08.729> has<00:01:08.909> been<00:01:08.969> around

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
this shoe more formula has been around

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.270 
this shoe more formula has been around
for<00:01:09.539> a<00:01:09.570> while<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.079> they've<00:01:10.259> redone<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
for a while but they've redone it so

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.819 
for a while but they've redone it so
this<00:01:11.729> revamped<00:01:12.299> edition<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.170> actually<00:01:13.619> quite

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
this revamped edition is actually quite

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.370 
this revamped edition is actually quite
better<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.729> my<00:01:14.880> opinion<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.539> I<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.020> think

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
better at in my opinion and I do think

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.840 
better at in my opinion and I do think
that<00:01:16.560> because<00:01:17.070> they<00:01:17.159> are<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.520> creamy

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
that because they are so creamy

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.090 
that because they are so creamy
especially<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> pearls<00:01:19.289> and<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> metallics

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that they glide on just as well as the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
how you would apply a gel liner so I

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.279 
how you would apply a gel liner so I
highly<00:01:41.909> recommend<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.479> brush<00:01:42.749> actually

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
with these shimura drawing pencils they

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.419 
with these shimura drawing pencils they
tend<00:01:45.569> to<00:01:45.689> work<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:46.139> well<00:01:46.229> together<00:01:46.590> so

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
tend to work really well together so

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.719 
tend to work really well together so
this<00:01:47.789> I<00:01:47.999> is<00:01:48.030> as<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> silver<00:01:49.859> smokey

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
this I is as you can see a silver smokey

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.999 
this I is as you can see a silver smokey
eye<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.689> really<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.139> silver<00:01:52.619> because<00:01:52.920> I

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
eye and I really like silver because I

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.340 
eye and I really like silver because I
don't<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:53.759> quite<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.270> stark<00:01:54.749> as<00:01:54.840> white

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
don't think it's quite as stark as white

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.109 
don't think it's quite as stark as white
white<00:01:56.039> can<00:01:56.340> actually<00:01:56.700> make<00:01:56.850> your<00:01:56.969> eyes<00:01:57.090> look

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
white can actually make your eyes look

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.660 
white can actually make your eyes look
smaller<00:01:57.539> so<00:01:58.289> silver<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.859> a<00:01:58.889> great<00:01:59.189> way<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.399> add

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
smaller so silver is a great way to add

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.669 
smaller so silver is a great way to add
a<00:01:59.700> little<00:01:59.969> funky<00:02:00.569> metallic<00:02:01.079> edge<00:02:01.289> to<00:02:01.590> your

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
a little funky metallic edge to your

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.520 
a little funky metallic edge to your
look<00:02:01.920> without<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.520> super<00:02:03.420> super<00:02:03.749> dark<00:02:04.020> so

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
look without going super super dark so

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.050 
look without going super super dark so
