exercise<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.470> pool<00:02:16.650> because<00:02:16.950> we're

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
exercise in the pool because we're

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.240

that<00:02:20.970> kind<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.300> thing<00:02:21.569> here<00:02:21.780> for<00:02:21.959> therapy<00:02:22.110> I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
that kind of thing here for therapy I

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.540 
that kind of thing here for therapy I
think<00:02:22.349> we're<00:02:22.560> gonna<00:02:22.680> pull<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:22.950> clip<00:02:23.340> up

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
think we're gonna pull that clip up

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.650 
think we're gonna pull that clip up
because<00:02:23.760> we<00:02:23.880> have<00:02:24.000> such<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.209> good<00:02:24.330> time<00:02:24.480> but

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
because we have such a good time but

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.420 
because we have such a good time but
again<00:02:24.720> it's<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.050> same<00:02:25.080> sort<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.560> concept<00:02:25.770> for

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
again it's the same sort of concept for

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.080
