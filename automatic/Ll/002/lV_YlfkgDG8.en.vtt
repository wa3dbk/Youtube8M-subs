drink from a cup it will transfer so
it's<00:04:26.229> not<00:04:26.380> exactly<00:04:26.620> budge<00:04:27.310> proof<00:04:27.660> so<00:04:28.660> really

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
it's not exactly budge proof so really

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.559 
it's not exactly budge proof so really
in<00:04:29.350> essence<00:04:29.800> it's<00:04:29.979> like<00:04:30.190> any<00:04:30.430> other<00:04:30.759> creamy

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:31.569 
in essence it's like any other creamy

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.189 
in essence it's like any other creamy
lipstick<00:04:32.080> in<00:04:32.259> terms<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.830> long<00:04:33.280> wear<00:04:33.580> and

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
lipstick in terms of the long wear and

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.960 
lipstick in terms of the long wear and
the<00:04:35.199> finish<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:36.720> do<00:04:37.720> notice<00:04:38.139> that<00:04:38.289> this<00:04:38.530> goes<00:04:38.710> on

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
the finish I do notice that this goes on

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.309 
the finish I do notice that this goes on
extremely<00:04:39.970> smooth<00:04:40.479> like<00:04:41.319> I<00:04:41.620> could<00:04:42.190> do<00:04:42.310> this

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
extremely smooth like I could do this

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:44.879 
extremely smooth like I could do this
all<00:04:44.319> day

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
all day

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.749

only time that I noticed that there was

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.399 
only time that I noticed that there was
a<00:05:37.500> little<00:05:38.500> bit<00:05:39.370> of<00:05:39.580> taking<00:05:40.150> up<00:05:40.330> is<00:05:41.020> on<00:05:41.259> the

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
a little bit of taking up is on the

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.830 
a little bit of taking up is on the
inner<00:05:41.590> portion<00:05:41.949> of<00:05:42.340> my<00:05:42.550> lip<00:05:42.880> which<00:05:43.360> i<00:05:43.509> think<00:05:43.570> is

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
pretty standard when it comes to most

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.330 
pretty standard when it comes to most

some other emollient creamier lipsticks
but<00:05:59.409> I<00:05:59.469> would<00:05:59.830> advise<00:06:00.759> wearing<00:06:01.270> a<00:06:01.750> lip<00:06:02.199> liner

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
can definitely get away with just

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.330 
can definitely get away with just
applying<00:06:10.630> this<00:06:10.960> and<00:06:11.199> not<00:06:11.650> having<00:06:11.889> to<00:06:11.979> worry

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
applying this and not having to worry

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.740 
applying this and not having to worry
about<00:06:12.430> that<00:06:13.199> but<00:06:14.199> with<00:06:14.380> the<00:06:14.500> darker<00:06:15.130> lipsticks

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
about that but with the darker lipsticks

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.110 
about that but with the darker lipsticks
and<00:06:16.750> if<00:06:17.440> you<00:06:17.650> really<00:06:17.860> want<00:06:18.159> that<00:06:18.250> precise<00:06:18.789> line

and if you really want that precise line

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.800 
and if you really want that precise line
you<00:06:19.570> should<00:06:19.870> definitely<00:06:20.469> use<00:06:20.500> a<00:06:21.099> lip<00:06:21.430> liner<00:06:21.810> to

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
you should definitely use a lip liner to

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.529 
you should definitely use a lip liner to
kind<00:06:23.110> of<00:06:23.199> create<00:06:23.710> and<00:06:24.159> shape<00:06:24.639> out<00:06:24.909> and<00:06:25.240> give

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.719 
so overall I think this product is great
it<00:06:31.509> is<00:06:31.690> quite<00:06:32.020> pricey<00:06:32.260> for<00:06:32.740> a<00:06:32.770> lipstick<00:06:33.400> being

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
it is quite pricey for a lipstick being

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:35.430 
it is quite pricey for a lipstick being
that<00:06:33.940> it<00:06:34.060> is<00:06:34.260> $24

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
that it is $24

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.080 
that it is $24
however<00:06:36.010> if<00:06:36.279> you
