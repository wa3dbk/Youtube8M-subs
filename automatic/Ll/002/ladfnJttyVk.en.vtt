chest lifted okay so you start a small
shimmy<00:00:52.190> here<00:01:03.220> and<00:01:04.220> then<00:01:04.370> you<00:01:05.050> become<00:01:06.050> small<00:01:07.840> so

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
shimmy here and then you become small so

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.760 
shimmy here and then you become small so
it's<00:01:09.439> smaller<00:01:10.009> and<00:01:10.450> smaller<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:11.930> then<00:01:12.649> you

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
it's smaller and smaller and then you

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
it's smaller and smaller and then you
have<00:01:12.920> a<00:01:12.950> shimmy<00:01:13.250> very<00:01:14.119> basics<00:01:14.659> motion<00:01:15.140> either
