00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.520

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.490
 this video is created a little ones 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.040
 advice on how to face the next 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.230
 jailbreak in ios 6 that is imminent what 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.660
 true is that the boys of iva bears 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.020
 have created a website that is this one 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.520
 here is evasion puntocom evasion with the 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.469
 last or with a zero as you are seeing 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.030
 here on this website you are going to see all 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.680
 the information in relation to gender 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.079
 that supposedly will be launched on 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.780
 next Sunday but notice that as 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.460
 you see here is already at 68 percent 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.350
 advanced note that looks like a bar 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.489
 It was pretty cool where we see that 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.230
 it is quite advanced 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.879
 eliel brno being in beta them 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.530
 doing different tests but it seems 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.300
 that they already have it done and these people do 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.069
 that are legit so I do not have any 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.690
 doubt that soon the same 

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:00.760
 week possibly Sunday as 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.559
 announced we will have available the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.819
 jailbreak and remember this web page 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.620
 because the truth is that all the 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:07.840
 information you will see first 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.580
 hand on this web page these guys are 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.470
 those who are going to jailbreak these 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.570
 guys are going to squeeze to explain first 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.490

 os xo from linux as you see 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.320

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.300
 to be super fast we will be able to 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.610
 do in 5 minutes we're just going to 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.180
 need a computer with windows mac or 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.340
 linux 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.200
 we are going to need a team to me is 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.070
 obviously it will work with all 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.080
 Support teams from 6.0 to 6.1 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.210
 of agreement and also the only thing that we are going to 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.030
 need is a usb cable to connect 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.190
 our team ios to the computer nothing more 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.630
 it's going to be super simple, okay 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.610
 so in this video I want to give you a 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.410
 series of tips so good for you 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.820
 prepare before the imminent jailbreak 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.740
 because if right now you already have the 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.899
 jailbreak surely you want to keep 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.789
 your favorite tweets do not and for that 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.709
 I'm going to recommend two pretty tweets 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.600
 interesting that may serve you 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.769
 let's go to live perfect because 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.510
 We are looking at the ipad screen 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.070
 let's go to my jailbreak folder 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.780
 since I have all my little things 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.520
 jailbreak the first application 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.130
 or tui that I'm going to recommend from cydia 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.480
 it's called app info is an application that 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.650
 what is essential because it gives us 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.420
 information of all applications 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.730
 that we have installed in our team 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.650
 ios also gives us information of all 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.510
 the clicks and repositories that we have 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.130
 installed on our computer ios and this 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.870
 is the most important and the most important 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.100
 of everything for the subject of the applications 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.840
 you know that no problem is made 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.310
 is a backup on iTunes on 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.080
 icloud is already you do not have to 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.390
 worry about nothing else but for the 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.590
 subject of movie tweets so yes that 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.810
 we're going to have to do a backup 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.600
 because itunes supports us and icloud 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.489
 opponent does not support for this 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.110
 this type of applications not in this 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.180
 case we have to go to the tab to 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.769
 the little tab the package and from here 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.180
 notice that we have all the 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.769
 repositories that we have installed 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.019
 In addition , all packages appear here 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.940
 that we have installed the already clicks 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.800
 or essential packages that already in themselves 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.120
 cidh is already giving us in this case I 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.130
 I would recommend giving him the little button 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.290
 export this top right and 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.880
 from here we give detailed list or 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.709
 simple lists as you want to me 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.030
 I like the detailed list more and 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.040
 Note that from here, well, let's go 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.750
 to see all the repositories on one side 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.670
 that we have a simple position and 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.390
 cubes that come by default 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.040
 ajax repo in zanelli replenishes me here 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.260
 you are seeing the urls of 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.819
 all these repositories agree and what 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.410
 most important of all here we will see 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.849
 a detailed description of all the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.430
 tweets that we have installed he has 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.900
 activator up info what is this 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.540
 application the technicians I'm teaching 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.860
 no more we have up list appsync ap ap 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.510
 well we have all these clicks of 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.580
 agreement apt vacation talk about it 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.230
 we have I have for him installed I have 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.880
 all these that you simply send 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.650
 by mail and you're going to have all the 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.880
 information in your email 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.800
 in detail and then simply 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.900
 you could install all the tweets by hand 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.340
 that you consider appropriate or 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.500
 all those repositories so that you do not 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.880
 miss none in this case we're going to 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.380
 eliminate the draft this is what I 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.430
 I recommend because just because it is 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.260
 true that now I will explain how 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.260
 make a backup of all the clicks that 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.090
 you have on your iphone ipod and ipad with 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.470
 jailbreak what happens is that many 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.239
 clicks surely of those that you have 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.760
 installed are not yet compatible with the 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.010
 a-6 therefore if ye jailbreaking 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.960
 the new jailbreak with ios 6 surely 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.240
 some tweet that will only work in 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.590
 ios 5 is not compatible and therefore 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.300
 can give problems 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.250
 then I would recommend that now 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.900
 do not make a backup and 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.069
 install the clicks manually in 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.020
 Any case I will explain how 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.940
 make a backup but not if 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.199
 you are interested in this topic not good 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.819
 see here we have the tab 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.680
 screen word with all the details of 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:46.509
 the basic applications that we have in 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.340
 The springboard for example cilia with 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.379
 all these applications and so on 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.150
 also if you are interested we have a 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.259
 ipod eyelash where we will see all 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.659
 the music that we have installed in 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.800
 Our team ios we want to export 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.599
 the somehow not here we have all 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.659
 the songs and from here so good 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:03.490
 we can reproduce the ones if we want to quote 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:04.629
 a little more this is the application of 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.400
 true that this application is very useful 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.110
 because above all to save those 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.520
 tweets that we do not want to lose and about 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.199
 all repositories that this is very 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.150
 important where we download 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.860
 our favorite tweets not good that 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.430
 more the next tweet that I love you 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.740
 recommend is not more than apt back up is 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.360
 a pretty simple tweet of agreement os 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.830
 I'm going to show you how it works but 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.900
 simply here he explains it to you 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.569
 it simply serves to make a backup 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.300
 of all the tweets and repositories that 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.219
 have installed on your computer ios 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.259
 with the jailbreak simply what 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:37.900
 you have to do is from birds 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:40.120
 This backup application have 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.070
 the little backup button just this 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.780
 It has already made a backup 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.210
 a file that is lost around here by 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.830
 the memory of the team I is not already 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.900
 you only have to do this when 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.310
 you have this you have to go to itunes and 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.570
 make a backup we are going to 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.789
 go so you can see a little more 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.289
 clear good perfect because I'm already in 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.270
 iTunes and the truth is that they have 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.949
 the little eyelash of the ipad2 me right now 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.690
 I'm connected by wifi and agree 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:04.180
 but I recommend that you connect by 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.860
 usb cable because it will go much more 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.330
 fast backup what 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.979
 we have to do here is right now 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.720
 we will have to give this little button of 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.490
 here to make a backup 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.530
 I'm not going to give to not waste time 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.880
 but what you have to do is cut 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.070
 the little bit of making a copy of 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.560
 security and then what you have to 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.780
 to do is obviously restore from the 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.520
 same and tunisia good in your 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.250
 ios team to update it to 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.110
 imminent there is a 6.1 agree if 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.550
 you want to update it of course not me 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.470
 I do not recommend updating 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.599
 I always recommend to restore from 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.669
 itunes because this is the same as in the 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:38.380
 computer format and install the 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.720
 operating system from scratch according 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.190
 is the most reliable because for me for me 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.050
 taste works a little bit more 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.770
 fluid if we do this good as a 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.539
 time 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.129
 restoring our equipment I am what 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.810
 we're going to have to do obviously is 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:52.569
 do the jailbreak with the tool 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.129
 that the invaders will give us 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:56.020
 and I will explain that when you leave the the 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:57.220
 next jailbreak not in this case when 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.110
 let's have the jailbreak done what 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.060
 we have to do is install this 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.490
 application here that is called apt 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.289
 backup from cydia we only have to 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.270
 do this once we have this done 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:09.460
 we recover the backup that 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.020
 we have saved on iTunes and 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.210
 when the copy of 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.729
 security we just put them to see 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.590
 we get into apt backup and from here 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:19.539
 we give the little button to restore the 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.310
 agreement and it is already going to recover the 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:22.599
 backup and all the tweets that 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.880
 we have installed and 

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:27.190
 repositories we are going to have us from 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.840
 back in our new jailbreak as 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.430
 I already tell you this we recommend it because 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.960
 many tweets that you have 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.580
 installed will surely not be 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.169
 compatible with ios 6 still have them 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.639
 what to adapt of agreements I recommend 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:38.800
 do it manually but agree 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:40.000
 good if you want to try it , nothing happens 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.620
 you try it and it is already there is no 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.240
 problem of agreement and well this has been 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.500
 all these are my tips for the 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.150
 next jailbreak I hope you have 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.710
 liked the video and we'll see if 

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.710
 you want in a next chao 

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.960
 yes
