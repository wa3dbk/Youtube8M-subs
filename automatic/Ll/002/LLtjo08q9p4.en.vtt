00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
think lose himself and then hopefully

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.530 
think lose himself and then hopefully
one<00:02:08.989> day<00:02:09.019> find<00:02:09.709> that<00:02:09.860> soul<00:02:10.129> that<00:02:10.429> we<00:02:10.729> all<00:02:10.879> you

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
one day find that soul that we all you

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.210 
one day find that soul that we all you
know<00:02:11.569> love<00:02:12.049> that<00:02:12.380> we've<00:02:12.500> loved<00:02:12.709> for<00:02:12.890> two<00:02:12.980> years
