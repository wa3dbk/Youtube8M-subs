00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.220 

you

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.110 

the<00:00:10.099> last<00:00:10.309> song<00:00:10.490> will<00:00:10.639> be<00:00:10.669> talking<00:00:11.059> about

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
the last song will be talking about

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.459 
the last song will be talking about
today<00:00:11.209> is<00:00:11.719> entitled<00:00:12.289> hajimemasu<00:00:13.009> tape<00:00:13.459> and

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
today is entitled hajimemasu tape and

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.769 
today is entitled hajimemasu tape and
basically<00:00:15.469> the<00:00:15.679> idea<00:00:15.709> was<00:00:16.369> for<00:00:17.270> us<00:00:17.480> in<00:00:17.689> the

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
basically the idea was for us in the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.279 
basically the idea was for us in the
verse<00:00:18.050> to<00:00:18.380> be<00:00:18.500> creative<00:00:19.070> in<00:00:19.279> the<00:00:19.520> studio<00:00:19.910> and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
verse to be creative in the studio and

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.890 
verse to be creative in the studio and
take<00:00:21.289> away<00:00:21.560> from<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:22.039> live<00:00:22.489> show<00:00:22.820> a<00:00:23.150> little

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
take away from the live show a little

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.570 
take away from the live show a little
bit<00:00:24.169> with<00:00:24.710> an<00:00:24.980> arranged<00:00:25.550> apart<00:00:25.939> in<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:26.539> verse

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
bit with an arranged apart in the verse

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.710 
bit with an arranged apart in the verse
specifically<00:00:28.580> in<00:00:28.759> the<00:00:28.910> rhythms<00:00:29.300> there<00:00:29.509> was<00:00:29.630> an

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
specifically in the rhythms there was an

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.419 
specifically in the rhythms there was an
accompaniment<00:00:30.230> rhythm<00:00:30.650> and<00:00:30.769> rhythm<00:00:31.220> had

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
accompaniment rhythm and rhythm had

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.700 
accompaniment rhythm and rhythm had
rhythmic<00:00:31.880> pattern<00:00:32.239> that<00:00:32.360> I<00:00:32.419> wrote<00:00:32.689> in<00:00:32.930> the

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
rhythmic pattern that I wrote in the

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.470 
rhythmic pattern that I wrote in the
studio<00:00:34.129> I<00:00:34.190> thought<00:00:34.580> it<00:00:34.730> would<00:00:34.850> be<00:00:34.940> good<00:00:35.150> for

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
studio I thought it would be good for

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.130 
studio I thought it would be good for
the<00:00:36.140> verse<00:00:36.379> and<00:00:37.030> we<00:00:38.030> added<00:00:38.210> strings<00:00:38.690> to<00:00:39.019> it

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
the verse and we added strings to it

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.760 
the verse and we added strings to it
later<00:00:39.379> of<00:00:39.589> course<00:00:39.620> as<00:00:40.040> well<00:00:40.190> doing<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.270> same

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
later of course as well doing the same

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.139 
later of course as well doing the same
accents<00:00:42.770> so<00:00:43.430> there<00:00:43.610> were<00:00:43.670> rhythmic<00:00:44.000> figures

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
accents so there were rhythmic figures

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.760 
accents so there were rhythmic figures
for<00:00:44.570> the<00:00:44.660> band<00:00:44.870> more<00:00:45.140> or<00:00:45.260> less<00:00:45.379> to<00:00:45.559> play

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
for the band more or less to play

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.380 
for the band more or less to play
underneath<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.370> verse<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:46.879> make<00:00:47.030> it<00:00:47.149> creative

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
underneath the verse to make it creative

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.229 
underneath the verse to make it creative
because<00:00:47.719> we're<00:00:47.960> playing<00:00:48.199> basically<00:00:49.239> this

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
because we're playing basically this

00:00:50.239 --> 00:01:06.930 
because we're playing basically this
basically<00:01:02.500> that<00:01:03.500> was<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:04.009> original<00:01:05.619> hits<00:01:06.619> in

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
basically that was the original hits in

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.700 
basically that was the original hits in
pattern<00:01:07.940> that<00:01:08.060> we<00:01:08.179> were<00:01:08.300> doing<00:01:08.600> in<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:08.869> part

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
pattern that we were doing in that part

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.380 
pattern that we were doing in that part
so<00:01:10.009> it's<00:01:10.130> very<00:01:10.280> slow<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:10.970> sort<00:01:11.240> of<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:14.270> know

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
so it's very slow and sort of you know

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.440 
so it's very slow and sort of you know
big<00:01:14.690> in<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.289> half<00:01:16.099> time<00:01:16.130> field<00:01:16.880> the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
big in the in the half time field the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.850 
big in the in the half time field the
only<00:01:17.660> thing<00:01:17.840> was<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.050> I<00:01:18.319> wanted<00:01:18.470> to<00:01:18.679> add<00:01:18.830> a

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
only thing was that I wanted to add a

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.540 
only thing was that I wanted to add a
little<00:01:19.160> more<00:01:20.380> nuanced<00:01:21.380> underneath<00:01:22.220> with<00:01:22.520> the

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
little more nuanced underneath with the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.550 
little more nuanced underneath with the
rhythmic<00:01:23.060> arrangement<00:01:23.599> so<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:23.810> created<00:01:24.380> a

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
rhythmic arrangement so I created a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:02:13.699 
rhythmic arrangement so I created a
little<00:01:24.679> cadence<00:01:25.130> if<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:26.179> will<00:01:26.360> one<00:01:27.200> two

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.119 

the<00:02:14.709> idea<00:02:15.069> there<00:02:15.129> was<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:16.030> create<00:02:16.959> these<00:02:17.379> short

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
the idea there was to create these short

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:42.059 
the idea there was to create these short
notes<00:02:18.430> kind<00:02:18.879> of<00:02:18.910> like<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.680> was<00:02:41.859> the

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
notes kind of like and that was the

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.610 
notes kind of like and that was the
pattern<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:42.879> i<00:02:42.940> wrote<00:02:43.239> to<00:02:43.599> go<00:02:44.260> along<00:02:44.590> with

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
pattern that i wrote to go along with

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.580 
pattern that i wrote to go along with
the<00:02:45.090> rest<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.480> song<00:02:46.690> i<00:02:47.019> thought<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.500> would

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
the rest of the song i thought it would

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.129 
the rest of the song i thought it would
be<00:02:47.709> fitting<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.280> for<00:02:49.209> us<00:02:49.299> all<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.510> play<00:02:49.900> those

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
be fitting and for us all to play those

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.900 
be fitting and for us all to play those
rhythmic<00:02:50.530> figures<00:02:50.739> so<00:02:51.160> i<00:02:51.190> interpreted<00:02:51.819> as

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
rhythmic figures so i interpreted as

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.270 
rhythmic figures so i interpreted as
best<00:02:52.120> I<00:02:52.269> could<00:02:52.329> on<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.660> drum<00:02:52.959> kit<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.470> in<00:02:54.190> the

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
best I could on the drum kit and in the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.520 
best I could on the drum kit and in the
bass<00:02:54.459> guitar<00:02:55.060> would<00:02:55.299> hit<00:02:55.720> those<00:02:55.930> as<00:02:56.109> well<00:02:56.290> and

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
bass guitar would hit those as well and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.220 
bass guitar would hit those as well and
we<00:02:56.560> would<00:02:56.739> play<00:02:56.859> a<00:02:56.889> very<00:02:57.569> uniformed<00:02:58.569> in<00:02:58.810> the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
we would play a very uniformed in the

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.590 
we would play a very uniformed in the
studio
