head back so now you have all this range

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.920 
head back so now you have all this range
I'm<00:01:12.960> exaggerating<00:01:13.820> here<00:01:14.820> now<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.720> all

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.380 
so that's how you make the right hand
longer<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.189> let's<00:01:20.400> say<00:01:20.549> I'm<00:01:20.790> back<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.270> I'm

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
boom okay instead of this and then try

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.550 
boom okay instead of this and then try
to<00:01:26.670> reach<00:01:26.939> then<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.600> try<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> reach<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.140> here<00:01:28.350> my

the right hand will reach okay pull also

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.580 
the right hand will reach okay pull also
pull<00:01:42.119> back<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> your<00:01:42.479> left<00:01:42.600> shoulder<00:01:42.689> pulling

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
pull back to your left shoulder pulling

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.810 
pull back to your left shoulder pulling
back<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:44.040> look<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.549> helps<00:01:44.729> you

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
back you know look so it helps you

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.210 
back you know look so it helps you
rotate<00:01:45.240> more<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:46.290> get<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.680> right<00:01:46.860> hand<00:01:47.040> out

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
rotate more and get that right hand out

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.910 
rotate more and get that right hand out
longer<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.149> that's<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> technique<00:01:48.720> part<00:01:48.920> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
longer so that's the technique part the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.840 
longer so that's the technique part the
strategy<00:01:50.460> part<00:01:51.799> best<00:01:52.799> time<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.189> land<00:01:53.399> your

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
strategy part best time to land your

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.760 
strategy part best time to land your
right<00:01:54.090> hand<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.630> when<00:01:55.229> your<00:01:55.350> opponent<00:01:55.740> is

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
right hand is when your opponent is

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.100 
right hand is when your opponent is
coming<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.219> okay<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.450> if<00:01:57.659> your<00:01:57.780> points

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
coming in okay so if your points

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.630 
coming in okay so if your points
throwing<00:01:58.320> punches<00:01:58.500> he's<00:01:58.770> coming<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.189> that's<00:01:59.549> a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
throwing punches he's coming in that's a

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.670 
throwing punches he's coming in that's a
great<00:01:59.850> time<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.210> throw<00:02:00.420> your<00:02:00.540> right<00:02:00.689> hand<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
great time to throw your right hand the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.429 
great time to throw your right hand the
case<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.070> trade<00:02:02.310> shops<00:02:02.610> within

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
case of trade shops within

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.050 
case of trade shops within
he's<00:02:03.619> coming<00:02:03.890> in<00:02:03.979> with<00:02:04.009> a<00:02:04.100> jab<00:02:04.399> though<00:02:04.789> right

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
he's coming in with a jab though right

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.550 
he's coming in with a jab though right
hand<00:02:05.270> he's<00:02:05.390> coming<00:02:05.659> with<00:02:05.749> dry<00:02:05.869> hands<00:02:06.109> only<00:02:06.409> the

hand he's coming with dry hands only the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.880 
hand he's coming with dry hands only the
right<00:02:06.679> hand<00:02:07.060> if<00:02:08.060> he's<00:02:08.330> running<00:02:08.509> away<00:02:08.890> anytime

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
right hand if he's running away anytime

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.229 
right hand if he's running away anytime
that<00:02:10.250> someone's<00:02:10.519> running<00:02:10.640> away<00:02:10.940> from<00:02:11.000> you

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
that someone's running away from you

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.580 
that someone's running away from you
it's<00:02:11.450> probably<00:02:11.629> gonna<00:02:11.900> be<00:02:11.959> pretty<00:02:12.019> hard<00:02:12.410> to

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
it's probably gonna be pretty hard to

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.720 
it's probably gonna be pretty hard to
hit<00:02:12.709> him<00:02:12.830> with<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.069> right<00:02:13.220> hand<00:02:13.250> because

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
hit him with the right hand because

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.130 
hit him with the right hand because
there's<00:02:13.940> they're<00:02:14.390> running<00:02:14.690> away<00:02:14.780> there's

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
there's they're running away there's

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.839 
there's they're running away there's
moving<00:02:15.440> away<00:02:15.620> like<00:02:15.799> this<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.580> if<00:02:16.700> they're

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
moving away like this and if they're

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.490 
moving away like this and if they're
leaning<00:02:17.090> back<00:02:17.390> like<00:02:17.629> this<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.019> you<00:02:18.200> saw<00:02:18.379> her

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
leaning back like this and you saw her

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.660 
leaning back like this and you saw her
right<00:02:18.530> hand<00:02:18.739> they<00:02:18.920> lean<00:02:19.099> back<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.310> little<00:02:19.459> more

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
right hand they lean back a little more

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.640 
right hand they lean back a little more
and<00:02:19.910> then<00:02:20.030> they<00:02:20.720> come<00:02:20.989> back<00:02:21.019> with<00:02:21.319> their<00:02:21.470> right

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
and then they come back with their right

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.210 
and then they come back with their right
hand<00:02:21.940> okay<00:02:22.940> so<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.390> have<00:02:23.599> to<00:02:23.750> know<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.220> if

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
hand okay so you have to know that if

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.280 
hand okay so you have to know that if
you<00:02:25.700> want<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.030> chase<00:02:26.269> again<00:02:26.660> with<00:02:26.959> your<00:02:27.080> right

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
you want to chase again with your right

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.320 
you want to chase again with your right
hand<00:02:27.470> then<00:02:28.129> you<00:02:28.310> probably<00:02:28.580> have<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.970> square<00:02:29.269> it

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
hand then you probably have to square it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.240 
hand then you probably have to square it
up<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.599> little<00:02:29.780> bit<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.170> come<00:02:30.410> into<00:02:30.709> like<00:02:30.890> you

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
up a little bit and come into like you

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.650 
up a little bit and come into like you
know<00:02:31.340> more<00:02:31.519> of<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.700> squared<00:02:32.000> up<00:02:32.150> position<00:02:32.540> and

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
know more of a squared up position and

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.839 
know more of a squared up position and
then<00:02:32.750> chase<00:02:32.989> them<00:02:33.170> down<00:02:33.200> walk<00:02:34.160> into<00:02:34.519> him<00:02:34.670> like

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
then chase them down walk into him like

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.449 
then chase them down walk into him like
that<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.319> if<00:02:36.319> he's<00:02:36.470> sideways<00:02:36.709> like<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:37.220> a

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
that and if he's sideways like this a

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.490 
that and if he's sideways like this a
good<00:02:38.120> idea<00:02:38.480> would<00:02:38.629> be<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.810> take<00:02:39.049> your<00:02:39.110> right

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
good idea would be to take your right

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.949 
good idea would be to take your right
foot<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:40.549> cut<00:02:40.879> it<00:02:41.000> around<00:02:41.269> his<00:02:41.480> front<00:02:41.780> foot

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
foot and cut it around his front foot

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.080 
foot and cut it around his front foot
and<00:02:42.530> then<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.799> way<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.220> can<00:02:43.730> punch<00:02:43.940> them

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
and then that way you can punch them

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.229 
and then that way you can punch them
over<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:44.420> back<00:02:44.599> side<00:02:44.870> but<00:02:45.489> if<00:02:46.489> you<00:02:46.519> chase<00:02:46.910> into

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
over the back side but if you chase into

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.869 
over the back side but if you chase into
him<00:02:47.739> directly<00:02:48.739> here<00:02:49.069> you're<00:02:49.340> basically<00:02:49.730> gonna

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
him directly here you're basically gonna

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.850 
him directly here you're basically gonna
run<00:02:50.120> right<00:02:50.360> into<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:50.780> right<00:02:50.989> hand<00:02:51.230> okay<00:02:51.799> so

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
run right into this right hand okay so

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.190 
run right into this right hand okay so
you<00:02:52.040> need<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.280> run<00:02:52.430> up<00:02:52.579> behind<00:02:52.849> him<00:02:53.200> but

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
you need to run up behind him but

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.619 
you need to run up behind him but
anyways<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:55.220> part<00:02:55.609> technique<00:02:55.970> part

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
anyways this part technique part

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.420 
anyways this part technique part
strategy<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.680> have<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.950> know<00:02:58.069> how<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.190> make

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
strategy you have to know how to make

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.400 
strategy you have to know how to make
the<00:02:58.549> right-hand<00:02:58.970> longer<00:02:59.359> and<00:02:59.629> at<00:03:00.109> the<00:03:00.230> same

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
the right-hand longer and at the same

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.780 
the right-hand longer and at the same
time<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.829> have<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.069> know<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.310> right<00:03:01.430> time<00:03:01.609> to

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
time you have to know the right time to

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.009 
time you have to know the right time to
throw<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.060> right<00:03:02.209> hand<00:03:02.239> which<00:03:02.569> is<00:03:02.690> basically

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
throw the right hand which is basically

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.449 
throw the right hand which is basically
when<00:03:03.290> he's<00:03:03.440> coming<00:03:03.739> for<00:03:03.920> or<00:03:04.190> when<00:03:04.340> he's

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
when he's coming for or when he's

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.089 
when he's coming for or when he's
throwing<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.849> punch<00:03:05.290> okay<00:03:06.290> or<00:03:06.470> when<00:03:06.650> he<00:03:06.769> squared

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
throwing a punch okay or when he squared

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.500 
throwing a punch okay or when he squared
up<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.310> he<00:03:07.430> squared<00:03:07.700> up<00:03:07.760> at<00:03:07.910> this<00:03:08.030> perfect

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
up and he squared up at this perfect

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.970 
up and he squared up at this perfect
time<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.870> throw<00:03:09.049> just<00:03:09.380> throw<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.680> doesn't

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
time to throw just throw it doesn't
