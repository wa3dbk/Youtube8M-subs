00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.490
 we will do everything possible to 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.510
 to be 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.760
 of not being able to do it safely so the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.350
 next game but we're 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.630
 working for 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.860
 so that's it 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.310
 obviously yes 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.170
 these questions one does not wait for me 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.930
 it touched me to sit down these two parties 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.570
 previous and good in the personal is 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.440
 hurt for not being able to play but they are 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.149
 circumstances that 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.480
 what happens in football the question of 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.850
 health but the important thing is that I go 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.210
 improving well of a good evolution and 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.089
 we do not have much left so I can 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.100
 so he can be and be able to support 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.000
 my colleagues from from inside where 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.540
 as determined by the technician we receive 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.540
 truly a strong blow 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.150
 but in life in life you should never 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.060
 lower the arms 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.040
 in this circumstance in sports in 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.050
 football the team will fight until 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.110
 the last consequences are left 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.680
 seven matches are many points we know 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.970
 that the teams that are 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.020
 ahead of us it is very difficult that 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.210
 win all seven games then 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.190
 we have to adjust and as I said 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.520
 this is just a blow 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.980
 we have talked with each other in 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.060
 some the day after the day 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.590
 party that unfortunately in the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.990
 dressing there was not a good mood but 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.120
 we try to talk there on the day of 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.390
 today that this is work is 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.860
 will the sacrifice is to try to 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.590
 Well the first thing you do not have to do 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.000
 one of self frauds and a way to 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.950
 It favors itself is to believe that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.840
 things are already and they are not then 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.399
 I was referring to the fact that life is like that 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.539
 then always in life one goes to 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.780
 have blows but you have to get up 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:11.140
 quickly we will try to lose 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.940
 with cougars to keep bailing the good and 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.890
 wait the result is not difficult now 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.410
 because obviously to win already 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.930
 we depended on us today is 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.989
 different but but good the team 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.930
 he has to continue to take off 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.489
 this discomfort quickly and win the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.560
 good weekend and see if you can 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.200
 combine a result that we put another 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.510
 time in the fight and well the team has 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.269
 to become strong we have a large group 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.970
 in the human in what we are 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.040
 working on the commitment and that this 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.980
 can not under any circumstances 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.110
 to drop the blows on the contrary 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.100
 they have us we do not have to do more 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.430
 strong 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.280
 of course not until this does not 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.840
 it ends until it ends 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.800
 the team has to keep fighting 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.600
 struggling 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.300
 As I told you, we received a blow from 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.580
 strong but we still have the match 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.870
 with black lions in front we know of 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.190
 that they add different but also 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.140
 by not winning, the good is greatly reduced by 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.210
 team has to go we have to 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.560
 do our work properly and 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.910
 after good we will see to see if they 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.660
 can leave something in the way that 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.660
 it will be welcome
