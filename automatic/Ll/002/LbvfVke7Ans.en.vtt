00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
in this video I'm going to make a

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.549 
in this video I'm going to make a
tutorial<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.910> metal<00:00:09.240> nails<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.200> just

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
tutorial of the metal nails this is just

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.339 
tutorial of the metal nails this is just
it's<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.370> same<00:00:11.550> thing<00:00:11.759> as<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.059> nails<00:00:12.349> it's

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
it's the same thing as the nails it's

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.410 
it's the same thing as the nails it's
just<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.710> little<00:00:13.830> bit<00:00:14.040> different<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:15.389> looks

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
just a little bit different it looks

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.200 
just a little bit different it looks
different<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:16.139> solved<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.680> same<00:00:16.859> way<00:00:17.210> so

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
different it solved the same way so

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.560 
different it solved the same way so
first<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.380> start<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.890> hold<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:21.180> it

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
first to start it to hold it with it

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.920 
first to start it to hold it with it
would<00:00:21.660> be<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.260> screw<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.930> parts

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
would be like the screw like the parts

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.810 
would be like the screw like the parts
that<00:00:25.140> would<00:00:25.260> go<00:00:25.470> into<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.980> wall<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.460> here

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
that would go into the wall with it here

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.730 
that would go into the wall with it here
and<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> parts<00:00:27.330> safe<00:00:27.510> amaura<00:00:27.900> 2<00:00:28.080> will<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.380> here

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
and the parts safe amaura 2 will be here

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.479 
and the parts safe amaura 2 will be here
so<00:00:30.109> you<00:00:31.109> want<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.380> take<00:00:31.590> your<00:00:31.830> one<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.369> your

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
so you want to take your one in your

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.690 
so you want to take your one in your
right<00:00:32.640> hand<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.180> swing<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:35.550> way

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
right hand and swing it all the way

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.490 
right hand and swing it all the way
around<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:37.040> that<00:00:38.210> this<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.809> top<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.440> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
around so that this is on top and you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.619 
around so that this is on top and you
have<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.710> heart-shaped<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.430> moment<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.210> if

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
have this heart-shaped a moment and if

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.510 
have this heart-shaped a moment and if
you<00:00:42.870> just<00:00:43.110> go<00:00:43.379> straight<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:43.920> you'll

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
you just go straight like that you'll

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.490 
you just go straight like that you'll
have<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.730> heart<00:00:45.059> shape<00:00:45.329> but<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.140> will<00:00:46.320> be<00:00:46.410> on

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
have the heart shape but this will be on

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500 
have the heart shape but this will be on
bottom<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.309> won't<00:00:47.460> work<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.969> you

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
bottom and then it won't work so you

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.470 
bottom and then it won't work so you
want<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.870> take<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.440> all<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.620> way<00:00:49.770> around<00:00:50.480> then

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
want to take it all the way around then

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.889 
want to take it all the way around then
um<00:00:52.170> bring<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.510> bring<00:00:54.510> your<00:00:54.690> hand<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:57.210> out

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
um bring it bring your hand up and out

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.470 
um bring it bring your hand up and out
like<00:00:59.570> bring<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:01.250> like<00:01:02.250> slide<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.940> toward<00:01:03.210> you

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
like bring it like slide it toward you

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.899 
like bring it like slide it toward you
while<00:01:04.640> twisting<00:01:05.640> your<00:01:05.880> hand<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.600> so

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
while twisting your hand like this so

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.840 
while twisting your hand like this so
and<00:01:08.990> then<00:01:09.990> you'll<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.830> stage<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.610> you

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
and then you'll be in this stage and you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.780 
and then you'll be in this stage and you
can<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.380> pull<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.409> apart<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.490> then<00:01:14.610> it's

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
can just pull it apart and then it's

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.880 
can just pull it apart and then it's
solved<00:01:15.119> putting<00:01:15.840> back<00:01:16.020> together<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.470> reverse

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
solved putting back together to reverse

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.190 
solved putting back together to reverse
just<00:01:17.250> slide<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:19.830> go<00:01:20.250> down

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
just slide it like this and then go down

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.649 
just slide it like this and then go down
there<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.250> undo<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.490> first<00:01:24.119> step<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.479> once

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
there just undo that first step so once

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.819 
there just undo that first step so once
again<00:01:25.040> it's<00:01:26.040> around<00:01:28.579> twist<00:01:29.579> up<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.600> out<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
again it's around twist up and out and

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.640 
again it's around twist up and out and
then<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.220> split<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.960> it's<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.020> pretty<00:01:34.290> easy

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
then just split it it's a pretty easy

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.800 
then just split it it's a pretty easy
puzzle<00:01:35.280> I've<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.759> actually<00:01:36.299> solved<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.720> by

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
puzzle I've just actually solved it by

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
puzzle I've just actually solved it by
accident<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.619> was<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.250> playing<00:01:38.460> with<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.729> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
accident I was just playing with it and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.359 
accident I was just playing with it and
then<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.119> dropped<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.409> was<00:01:40.530> going<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.829> I

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
then I dropped it like I was going in I

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.580 
then I dropped it like I was going in I
dropped<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.479> solves<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.140> then<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> just

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
dropped it and it solves and then I just

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.200 
dropped it and it solves and then I just
did<00:01:43.770> their<00:01:43.920> person<00:01:44.369> what<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> did<00:01:44.729> back

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
did their person what I did back

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.050 
did their person what I did back
together<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.890> do<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.310> one<00:01:47.579> other<00:01:47.610> metal

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
together I do have one other metal

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.690 
together I do have one other metal
puzzle<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.540> figure<00:01:48.930> 8<00:01:49.140> room<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> didn't

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
puzzle the figure 8 room but I didn't

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.649 
puzzle the figure 8 room but I didn't
really<00:01:51.180> figure<00:01:51.450> out<00:01:51.659> how<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.930> solve<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:53.659> it's

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
really figure out how to solve it it's

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.649 
really figure out how to solve it it's
kind<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:56.219> looks<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.969> same<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
kind of like it looks the same like you

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.740 
kind of like it looks the same like you
could<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:58.049> go<00:01:58.290> around<00:01:58.439> or<00:01:59.009> whatever<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.420> I'm

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
could just go around or whatever so I'm

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.539 
could just go around or whatever so I'm
still<00:02:01.079> working<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.560> but<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.040> will<00:02:02.310> make<00:02:02.520> a

still working on that but I will make a

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.600 
still working on that but I will make a
tutorial<00:02:03.170> when<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.500> know<00:02:04.770> how<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.950> solve<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.369> and

tutorial when I know how to solve it and

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.719 
tutorial when I know how to solve it and
when<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.060> time<00:02:06.090> so
