00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.690
 maninha battle the irÃ£ and this is the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.900
 complement of this video here cuspindo 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.359
 fire is and in part that we use torch 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.369
 I know that most people with 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.289
 torch in the pocket is common here in the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.150
 Brazil or anywhere in the world 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.449
 people walking with a torch here in the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.780
 pocket but anyway I'll show 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.070
 to continue, you only have to take a piece 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.809
 of bamboo 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.239
 so bamboo and in these parts here 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.059
 You will need sawing. You can not cut. 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.430
 It has to be the one with the machete 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.219
 one thing goes shattered business 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.590
 whole is going to end here like 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.100
 I did it here and leave it alone, and if it's okay 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.489
 on here 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.579
 then you'll make lots of fillets 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.219
 so the on-line cut- and-pour is 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.989
 A good part of the cuts are there. 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.280
 to cut up a two cm 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:12.930
 15 before the bamboo node not to 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.110
 damage the name and then wire you 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.320
 it's a good tie 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.479
 No more strings that you made to when 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.290
 you put the business to push not 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.500
 usual name outdated tear go 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.540
 see if a cork is picked up and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.780
 rich she even 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.570
 there's more to open so it is then 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.640
 just get the rebound on something and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.200
 put there to propose fuel as 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.900
 Are you going to stay after you stay like this? 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.330
 tie everything tightly and 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.190
 putting fuel is as I had to 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.450
 talk I put a little piece of 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.390
 Antenna is there and then I wrapped 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.160
 a little piece of year suit I put there 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.270
 inside then just put the album all 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:07.200
 look a little light and stay 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.670
 ready this way was if you do not forget 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.259
 to sign up for her channel 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.259
 How are you?
