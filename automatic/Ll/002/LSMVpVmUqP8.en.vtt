00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.130
 tweeted gentlemen on this second who violate rights speak here meteorology 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.440
 we must first know that the methodology is divided into two parts. 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.719
 methodology applied. 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.590
 the hurricane methodology study of technology directed to the field of 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.029
 search for example the trophy metering calculate trust that he wishes 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.150
 the methodology applied in the study of the methodology and directed by 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.820
 clubs of our beloved human activity for example as a maritime methodology 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.590
 agricultural industry and our beloved aeronautical methodology now let's 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.940
 to talk about our important metrology with marques 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.400
 this specific field of aeronautical meteorology is divided into five parts 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.150
 observation disclosure collection analysis done exposure 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.990
 so let's start by talking about the first record the observation 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.660
 The observation according to their decision is the verification of the instrumental 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.470
 food represent the weather conditions mounted a moment 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.940
 delicate given local 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.020
 thus being carried out by the track are metrological surface kayak ns 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.009
 or the passive attitude weather station 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.859
 should be through the radio society and we also have the 

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:17.180
 oncological treatment and in sergipe 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.320
 so let's go to the next step after observation we have to give 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.760
 disclosure 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.080
 dissemination and transmission of the observed data so that other sites as well 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.470
 that I became aware of the prevailing conditions of the higher volume of 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.909
 customers on the finals all over the internet 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.429
 now let's follow let's talk about the collection this as the name says is the 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.109
 the reception of the states a given region for the broader knowledge 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.100
 weather conditions 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.439
 after collection the next step is the analysis analyzes the study and 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.440
 interpretation of the observations that were reviewed without the support was the 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.880
 nautical course in the form of weather forecasts 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.189
 and last but not least is the provision 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.359
 Vice President Exposure of the observed observed data so everyone 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.359
 you will be able to access it either through the telephone and internet 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.790
 Now, ladies and gentlemen, let's hear a story here that our 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.790
 I was counting on when we went to sleep. 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.139
 was once in the year 1944 a land called e chicago 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.289
 in that land that year there was a meeting that gave rise to the organization 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:29.049
 from international civil aviation to another 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.829
 federal police 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.010
 The decree establishes that the member countries of the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.630
 meteorological service with the purpose of guaranteeing users the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.390
 information necessary for the safety of air operations as regards 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.939
 respect to atmospheric conditions 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.629
 to provide on-stage predictions in a standard format 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:49.399
 form 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.789
 an area prevention system was created with two global centers 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:57.409
 with the tax then I saw another and did not want several national 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.329
 aeronautical meteorology 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.170
 Aeronautical methodology in Brazil is structured in the form of a 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:07.150
 network of meteorological services in a network of meteorological stations and 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.849
 these activities are the responsibility of the 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.029
 aeronautics the day before the head of the space control department 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:13.789
 air 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:15.399
 with skirt 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:20.709
 then you are the second best brand here now after watching and 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.420
 saviola you might be thinking 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.319
 but this time she said she said but she did not say anything after all it's obvious that people 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.630
 will not use this information during our day-to-day in aviation - 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.200
 our pockets this video blocked to 12 900 something that affects our 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.650
 goal in reality 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.519
 then you access information to 11 clubs or not in our day-to-day 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.700
 version this is irrelevant 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.270
 The big question is that ANATEL demands that it be part of our 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.230
 then even if you do not like any of this information from your 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.200
 day-to-day in aviation is required to be done said any approved 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.360
 I see it as a box of surprises and this can be a decisive theme for some 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.419
 questions 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:03.919
 It's a cool thing that I saw not only the video lesson because some people after 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.299
 being heard said some results in the video comments 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.959
 so we continue to draw inspiration from the accounts everybody just wins 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.699
 So I know you do not have any of the other comments. 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.180
 performance or later we will choose the best price the positive balance 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.549
 means at the top of the comments 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.349
 So, gentlemen, I'm fine. Good luck. Do not forget to have more agility.
