00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.730 
they look like doughnuts bagels are just
very<00:01:49.890> hard<00:01:50.100> doughnuts<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.729> think<00:01:51.660> yeah<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.380> to

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
very hard doughnuts I think yeah and to

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.950 
very hard doughnuts I think yeah and to
make<00:01:52.920> these<00:01:53.070> bagels<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.820> have<00:01:53.970> wheat

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
make these bagels you have to have wheat

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.040 
make these bagels you have to have wheat
in<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.380> shape<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.650> this<00:01:55.830> like<00:01:56.190> a<00:01:56.930> diamond<00:01:57.930> I

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
in a shape like this like a diamond I

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.590 
in a shape like this like a diamond I
think<00:01:58.259> yeah<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.820> also<00:02:00.000> toast<00:02:00.390> these

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
smart but I do suggest the comic reader

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.729 
smart but I do suggest the comic reader

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
that I don't know but yeah that's an

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.570 
that I don't know but yeah that's an
idea<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:46.260> let's<00:02:46.680> look<00:02:46.830> at<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.130> more<00:02:47.280> complex

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
idea and let's look at the more complex

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.490 
idea and let's look at the more complex
stuff<00:02:47.670> where<00:02:48.120> we<00:02:48.630> are<00:02:48.720> gonna<00:02:48.780> make<00:02:48.989> waffles

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
stuff where we are gonna make waffles

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.350 
stuff where we are gonna make waffles
and<00:02:49.920> pancakes<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:50.760> before<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.180> make<00:02:51.299> your

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360

and pancakes but before you make your
waffle<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:51.900> pancakes<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.830> gotta<00:02:53.010> have<00:02:53.160> your

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
waffle and pancakes you gotta have your

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.280 
waffle and pancakes you gotta have your
basic<00:02:53.730> mix<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.330> make<00:02:54.480> these<00:02:54.690> basic<00:02:54.959> mix

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
basic mix and to make these basic mix

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.620 
basic mix and to make these basic mix
you<00:02:55.830> have<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.100> have<00:02:56.220> 3<00:02:56.489> beat<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.880> top<00:02:57.090> 2

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
you have to have 3 beat on the top 2

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.690 
you have to have 3 beat on the top 2
eggs<00:02:57.840> on<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.110> side<00:02:58.290> 1<00:02:58.890> milk<00:02:59.190> bucket<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.640> the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
eggs on the side 1 milk bucket in the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.610 
eggs on the side 1 milk bucket in the
middle<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.120> three<00:03:00.450> bowls<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:00.959> bottom<00:03:01.260> and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
middle and three bowls in the bottom and

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.740 
middle and three bowls in the bottom and
you'll<00:03:01.799> get<00:03:01.950> three<00:03:02.310> basic<00:03:02.730> mix<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.600> this

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
you'll get three basic mix and if this

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.380 
you'll get three basic mix and if this
basic<00:03:04.080> mix<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.380> go<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:05.250> making<00:03:05.459> your<00:03:05.790> waffle

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
basic mix you go to making your waffle

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.500 
basic mix you go to making your waffle
and<00:03:06.660> pancake<00:03:07.320> mix<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:08.459> make<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.790> I'm

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
and pancake mix and to make it I'm

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.449 
and pancake mix and to make it I'm
pretty<00:03:10.110> sure<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.440> pancake<00:03:10.799> uses<00:03:11.100> more<00:03:11.250> milk

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
pretty sure that pancake uses more milk

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.699 
pretty sure that pancake uses more milk
so<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:11.940> have<00:03:12.150> feed<00:03:12.450> buckets<00:03:13.110> on<00:03:13.230> top

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
so you have feed buckets on top

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.500 
so you have feed buckets on top
sugar<00:03:14.190> all<00:03:14.340> around<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.820> your<00:03:15.000> basic<00:03:15.330> mix

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.490 
cinnamon
and<00:03:16.159> your<00:03:16.430> waffles<00:03:16.939> eat<00:03:17.180> less<00:03:17.510> no<00:03:17.750> I'm<00:03:18.319> not

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
and your waffles eat less no I'm not

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.140 
and your waffles eat less no I'm not
quite<00:03:18.680> sure<00:03:18.709> how<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:18.890> make<00:03:19.069> waffles<00:03:19.219> but<00:03:19.640> he

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
quite sure how to make waffles but he

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.300 
quite sure how to make waffles but he
has<00:03:20.359> less<00:03:20.870> milk<00:03:21.079> so<00:03:21.260> why<00:03:21.439> not<00:03:21.650> bucket<00:03:21.980> right<00:03:22.189> on

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
has less milk so why not bucket right on

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.030 
has less milk so why not bucket right on
the<00:03:22.370> top<00:03:22.549> sugar<00:03:23.239> all<00:03:23.390> round<00:03:23.629> and<00:03:23.810> basic<00:03:24.439> mix<00:03:24.859> in

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
the top sugar all round and basic mix in
