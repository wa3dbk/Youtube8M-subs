00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.690
 so here we start with the feint 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.309
 shooting the news to this one so she 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.200
 overrated the case where the queen is 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.050
 especially for his little kÃ©kÃ© in match 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.550
 you press the l2 key and then 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.120
 you make a feint of fire that's 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.510
 the key for playstation 3 2-2 passion 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.789

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.480
 in red and after the little blue cross 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.680
 except that you do not press the key 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.909
 she was not giving the cia just that of two 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.909

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.250
 upward on the right 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.000

 So that's why I'm doing 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.530
 oath 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.350
 this fatal also exists for a 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.090
 feint of center so it's square x 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.550

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:24.030
 too close on madoff an entrance sign 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.570
 left side it must depend on the bad 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.690

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.270
 this is it is he is right handed 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.560
 left side so left side for them 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.400

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.370
