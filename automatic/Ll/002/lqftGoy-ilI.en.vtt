00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.330
 on May 23, exactly at 23:44, it was time for champions league winner 2001 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.330
 FC Bayern Munich 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.960
 the decision was made on penalties 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.779
 in favor of Bavaria 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.409
 World class spaces 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.280
 held three penalties 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.119
 even more 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.399
 scheduled losers in the hour of this week's triumph 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.390
 The customers now do not lose the Bayern 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.240
 this championship final 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.850
 because they did not like Valencia hoping to win 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.400
 but in every hundredth of a second of this match convinced of their victory 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.030
 were 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.470
 came in addition to because 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.790
 the symbol for it 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.610
 they win 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.570
 we want a good 20 minutes the more active team and there also the better ones 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.740
 Team is still the better goal opportunities 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.030
 That's why I think we deserved to win 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.480
 the greater will to win was decisive 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.740
 the early lead Valencia from the missed penalty of should 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.740
 this Bavaria and all do not harm 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.760
 Bayern 2001 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.130
 certainly not for the faint of heart 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.000
 Stefan Effenberg's equalizer 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.480
 Picture Hoffmann Hitzfeld wanted 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.480
 could not look 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.390
 Failure a word that one at Bayern Munich otherwise conversation in the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.980
 Could delete vocabulary 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.190
 There was simply no room for failure on this memorable evening in Milan 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.140
 as the currently best team in the world against the heroes in the Bavarian 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.720
 State capital back 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.720
 arrived at the top of the zenith 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.740
 Now it is important to confirm the success 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.890
 She has already done that at the peak of performance 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.420
 again such an incredible goal 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.420
 So exactly the right thing for Bayern Munich 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.669
 around
