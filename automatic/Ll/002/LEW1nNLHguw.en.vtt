 say dark orbit can open an account 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.480
 create the closed server 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.920
 So you know quite normal that one 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.750
 can create an account and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.390
 one is assigned to any server 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.399
 There you can between then but it 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.380
 it's easier to go easy on everyone 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.149
 fall home scroll down more 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.700

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.050
 For example, you fake this page 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.120

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.920
 For example, just enter adonis 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.490
 then you will see it down here will be the same 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.220
 sweated again for comparison 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.960
