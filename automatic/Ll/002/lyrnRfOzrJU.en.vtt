price goes who knows but it's going to

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.240 
price goes who knows but it's going to
go<00:02:54.870> higher<00:02:55.079> John<00:02:55.769> I'm<00:02:55.889> going<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.069> try<00:02:56.219> and

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
go higher John I'm going to try and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.159 
go higher John I'm going to try and
recover<00:02:56.579> from<00:02:56.819> that<00:02:57.000> visual<00:02:57.389> of<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.629> pimple

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
recover from that visual of the pimple

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.659 
recover from that visual of the pimple
but<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.439> mentioned<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.829> few<00:02:58.980> currencies<00:02:59.489> and

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
but you mentioned a few currencies and

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.000 
but you mentioned a few currencies and
this<00:03:00.419> leads<00:03:00.540> me<00:03:00.659> to<00:03:00.810> my<00:03:00.840> next<00:03:00.930> question<00:03:01.199> about

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
this leads me to my next question about

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.339 
this leads me to my next question about
depreciation<00:03:02.489> of<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.150> US<00:03:03.569> dollar<00:03:03.840> we're

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
depreciation of the US dollar we're

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.140 
depreciation of the US dollar we're
seeing<00:03:04.650> other<00:03:04.859> currencies<00:03:05.489> we<00:03:05.639> deflated

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
seeing other currencies we deflated

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.869 
seeing other currencies we deflated
around<00:03:06.419> the<00:03:06.569> world<00:03:06.810> 8<00:03:07.409> John<00:03:08.189> are<00:03:08.219> we<00:03:08.609> in<00:03:08.760> a

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
around the world 8 John are we in a

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.000 
around the world 8 John are we in a
currency<00:03:09.389> war<00:03:09.419> and<00:03:09.900> B<00:03:10.139> what<00:03:10.379> do<00:03:10.439> you<00:03:10.530> make<00:03:10.709> of

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
currency war and B what do you make of

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.210 
currency war and B what do you make of
the<00:03:11.370> run-up<00:03:11.669> in<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.359> US<00:03:12.629> dollar<00:03:12.900> well<00:03:13.829> it's

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
the run-up in the US dollar well it's

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.830 
the run-up in the US dollar well it's
been<00:03:14.400> pretty<00:03:14.609> surprising<00:03:15.120> how<00:03:15.389> strong<00:03:15.689> the

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
been pretty surprising how strong the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.499 
been pretty surprising how strong the
dollars<00:03:16.199> win<00:03:16.409> but<00:03:16.590> again<00:03:16.889> is<00:03:17.159> that<00:03:17.189> as<00:03:17.909> people

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:18.509 
dollars win but again is that as people

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:19.999 
dollars win but again is that as people
like<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.930> say<00:03:19.109> it's<00:03:19.259> the<00:03:19.349> best<00:03:19.379> course<00:03:19.829> that

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:20.009 
like to say it's the best course that

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:21.469 
like to say it's the best course that
will<00:03:20.099> glue<00:03:20.250> factory<00:03:20.459> there's<00:03:20.879> no<00:03:20.970> question

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:21.479 
will glue factory there's no question

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.349 
will glue factory there's no question
that<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:22.829> dollar<00:03:23.099> has<00:03:23.250> got<00:03:23.549> problems<00:03:24.030> but<00:03:24.269> it

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
that the dollar has got problems but it

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.030 
that the dollar has got problems but it
probably<00:03:24.569> has<00:03:24.750> less<00:03:24.959> problems<00:03:25.439> than<00:03:25.590> anybody

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
probably has less problems than anybody

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.999 
probably has less problems than anybody
else<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.509> it<00:03:27.509> actually<00:03:27.750> has<00:03:28.139> the<00:03:28.169> more

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:29.009 
else and it actually has the more

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.009 
else and it actually has the more
problems<00:03:29.310> than<00:03:29.579> gold<00:03:29.849> so<00:03:30.569> you<00:03:30.629> know<00:03:30.870> we

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
problems than gold so you know we

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.159 
problems than gold so you know we
brought<00:03:31.939> gold<00:03:32.939> really<00:03:33.269> has<00:03:33.509> the<00:03:33.659> potential<00:03:33.989> to

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
brought gold really has the potential to

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.710 
brought gold really has the potential to
run<00:03:34.409> higher<00:03:34.650> now<00:03:35.009> is<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.759> all<00:03:35.909> the<00:03:36.030> stalls<00:03:36.329> at

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
run higher now is it all the stalls at

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.770 
run higher now is it all the stalls at
this<00:03:36.900> 95<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.769> Dixie's<00:03:38.099> at<00:03:38.250> 95<00:03:38.729> missiles<00:03:39.599> are

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
this 95 the Dixie's at 95 missiles are

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.960 
this 95 the Dixie's at 95 missiles are
on<00:03:39.900> this<00:03:40.019> level<00:03:40.259> it's<00:03:41.040> up<00:03:41.310> significantly

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
on this level it's up significantly

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.520 
on this level it's up significantly
about<00:03:42.209> twenty<00:03:42.540> percent<00:03:42.870> from<00:03:43.139> where<00:03:43.379> it<00:03:43.500> was

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
about twenty percent from where it was

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.390 
about twenty percent from where it was
worth<00:03:44.069> bottom<00:03:44.549> or<00:03:44.699> lowers<00:03:45.599> last<00:03:45.900> year<00:03:46.229> and<00:03:46.530> and

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
worth bottom or lowers last year and and

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.199 
worth bottom or lowers last year and and
I<00:03:47.579> think<00:03:47.609> at<00:03:47.879> some<00:03:48.060> point<00:03:49.189> US<00:03:50.209> manufacturers

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
I think at some point US manufacturers

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.879 
I think at some point US manufacturers
that<00:03:51.359> with<00:03:51.780> foreign<00:03:52.199> businesses<00:03:52.709> you're

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
that with foreign businesses you're

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.289 
that with foreign businesses you're
going<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.099> start<00:03:53.280> complaining<00:03:53.609> at<00:03:53.939> the<00:03:54.060> strong

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
going to start complaining at the strong
