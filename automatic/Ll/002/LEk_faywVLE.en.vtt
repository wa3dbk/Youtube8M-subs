00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.719

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.809
 paula cobas for paparazzi more without now 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.779
 I want to interview hers because it's 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.509
 a brave paparazzi how are you very 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.310
 well thanks for brave brave 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.680
 because this brave brave because you 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.680
 You put in everything and ask her some questions 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.939
 where you least expect it or not if you know 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.650
 I really love my job that 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.810
 I have the opportunity to meet 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.940
 wonderful people people a 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.230
 little bit too heavy would also be not once 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.960
 said alexis valdés got it out no longer 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.870
 fire but alex valdez said on telemundo 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.270
 in puerto rico that simply does not 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.210
 they reached agreements and you know or I do 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.329
 I started to know something there and I did not 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.920
 goals in trouble no no no javier no 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.350
 is also to practice or not 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.270
 it seems to me they were not misunderstood 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.100
 the words of javi everyone knows 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.110
 that alexis valenciano this mega tv 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.690
 because they did not reach a mutual agreement 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.710
 but it was not because then they pulled out not what 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.320
 they voted simply that's part 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.130
 the company policy seems to me that 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.810
 has been arrogant alexis valdés to say 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.710
 that he is the star or the focus and 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.659
 interpret that he is the star at 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.490
 focus and what remains are the insects what 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.500
 it seems to you about that comment he made 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.720
 alex valdez good not heard this 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.330
 comment but always seen the 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.009

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.160
 my cameraman always tells me 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.830

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.380

 is has a boyfriend is married 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:05.300
 complicated status is complicated 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:09.080
 explain why because it 's complicated 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:12.130
 worse than me because sometimes things 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.350
 They do not go as you wanted and so 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.590
 I was married for a long time I'm in 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.450

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.450
