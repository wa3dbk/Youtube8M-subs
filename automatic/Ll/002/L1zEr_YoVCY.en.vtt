00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
my problem with it is twofold what is

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.719 
my problem with it is twofold what is
that<00:04:43.690> it's<00:04:43.870> not<00:04:44.020> true<00:04:44.080> that<00:04:44.860> they<00:04:45.400> planned

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
that it's not true that they planned

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
this all along that's completely there's

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.250 
this all along that's completely there's
no<00:04:48.370> other<00:04:48.400> nice<00:04:48.940> way<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.210> say<00:04:49.449> it<00:04:49.479> i<00:04:49.660> mean<00:04:49.870> if

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
no other nice way to say it i mean if

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.950 
no other nice way to say it i mean if
that's<00:04:50.560> completely<00:04:51.010> made<00:04:51.310> up<00:04:51.660> this<00:04:52.660> notion

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
that's completely made up this notion

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.500 
that's completely made up this notion
that<00:04:53.350> we<00:04:54.130> made<00:04:54.400> metro<00:04:54.880> so<00:04:55.120> we<00:04:55.240> could<00:04:55.360> later

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
that we made metro so we could later

just<00:05:16.900> I<00:05:17.110> found<00:05:17.470> that<00:05:17.590> whole<00:05:17.770> thing<00:05:17.919> to<00:05:18.039> be<00:05:18.160> very

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
just I found that whole thing to be very

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.820 
just I found that whole thing to be very
disingenuous<00:05:20.760> and<00:05:21.760> I<00:05:22.419> i<00:05:22.450> I<00:05:22.870> just<00:05:23.080> I<00:05:23.500> don't<00:05:23.710> know

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
disingenuous and I i I just I don't know

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.469 
disingenuous and I i I just I don't know
I<00:05:24.010> that<00:05:24.460> really<00:05:24.639> the<00:05:24.850> whole<00:05:25.000> thing<00:05:25.180> rubbed<00:05:25.360> me

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
I that really the whole thing rubbed me

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:26.939 
I that really the whole thing rubbed me
the<00:05:25.510> wrong<00:05:25.630> way<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:26.380> notion<00:05:26.710> that<00:05:26.740> they

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
the wrong way the notion that they

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.400 
the wrong way the notion that they
planned<00:05:27.220> this<00:05:27.370> all<00:05:27.580> along<00:05:27.610> the<00:05:28.539> whole<00:05:29.169> premise

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
planned this all along the whole premise

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.830 
planned this all along the whole premise
yeah<00:05:29.919> yeah<00:05:30.340> it<00:05:30.520> would<00:05:30.789> be<00:05:30.910> a<00:05:30.940> very<00:05:31.180> elaborate

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
yeah yeah it would be a very elaborate

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.810 
yeah yeah it would be a very elaborate
plan<00:05:32.200> if<00:05:32.530> that<00:05:32.710> had<00:05:32.889> been<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:33.070> plan<00:05:33.400> is<00:05:33.520> crazy

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
plan if that had been the plan is crazy

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.060 
plan if that had been the plan is crazy
that's<00:05:34.539> like<00:05:34.690> it<00:05:34.810> it's<00:05:35.260> like<00:05:35.380> a<00:05:35.440> close<00:05:35.800> so

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
that's like it it's like a close so

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.029

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
instantaneous from what we hear it do it

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.219 
instantaneous from what we hear it do it
I<00:06:23.979> think<00:06:24.370> there's<00:06:24.550> still<00:06:24.729> some<00:06:25.120> testing<00:06:26.080> to<00:06:26.110> be

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
I think there's still some testing to be

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.190 
I think there's still some testing to be
done<00:06:26.320> but<00:06:26.620> otherwise<00:06:27.930> originally<00:06:28.930> I<00:06:28.960> had

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:29.200 
done but otherwise originally I had

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.080 
done but otherwise originally I had
heard<00:06:29.500> they<00:06:29.680> were<00:06:29.740> targeting<00:06:30.340> to<00:06:30.550> push<00:06:30.820> this
