00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.950
 bach al lax but it's hello to all of you guys 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.570
 here your specter today I present to you 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.160
 the eighteenth guide to arms of 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.630
 battlefield 4 where we will discover the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.929
 features of 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.670
 American origin m4 m4 is the seventh 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.859
 unlockable carbine for all classes 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.660
 requesting 59 thousand points with 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.160
 those years on your left 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.660
 you can see as always the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.640
 general characteristics 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.920
 the damage is in the media one speaks of 25 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.480
 up close and 15.4 points from a distance 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.430
 respectively four and seven strokes 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.469
 to kill the fire rat is 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.989
 slightly higher than the average will be 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.460
 equal to 800 accounts per minute but keep a 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.430
 mind that this weapon only shoots at 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.320
 gust and single shot the charger 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.750
 it's average will probably 30 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.750
 recharge times are very fast yes 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.000
 talk about 1.85 seconds with a shot in 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.210
 barrel and 2.4 to the charger completely 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.559
 exhausted the sprint speed is 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.500
 very high to be a carbine yes 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.920
 speaks of 580 meters per second while 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.270
 drops to 320 when silenced for 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.920
 as far as accuracy is concerned 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.540
 we find nothing particular except a 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.600
 increase by stroke the upper elements 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.460
 to the average or zero point 104 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.140
 n 4 like all the other carbine sisters 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.840
 a good one but for a style of play in 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.060
 movement but suffers over long distances a 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.549
 due to a dispersion an oval chamber 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.930
 from a standstill it is too high 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.820
 however the excellent dispersions me 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.350
 distinctive in moving aiming mode 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.140
 make it particularly suitable for 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.549
 clashes on short and medium distances 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.439
 however this weapon turns out more 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.990
 long-range efficient thanks to the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.150
 burst mode I'll explain right away 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.070
 because this statement why 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.180
 this year being a burst should 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.610
 be better over long distances 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.439
 compared to the automatic fire sisters 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.509
 before this, however, we move on to 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.280
 recoil as you can see from the numbers 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.549
 super pressure and wrinkle is nothing 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.740
 special me is not high nor nor low it 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.210
 vertical deviation equal to 0.34 ma 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.049
 as we well know this is an importance 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.119
 relative 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.490
 the horizontal one is a lot of tents 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.130
 much to the right pulling 0 10 to the left and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.310
 0 40 to the right for precisely the recovery 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.140
 the multiplier 2.5 is equal to 18 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.509
 however it should be kept in mind that the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.610
 multiplier of the first shot comes 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.650
 moved to the last shot of the burst 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.380
 in weapons precisely from burst 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.150
 three shots or when you shoot one 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.860
 when you press the trigger the first two 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.590
 strokes will have a normal recoil while 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.670
 the third will have the recoil is amplified 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.950
 of point 5 we pass now to the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.110
 The final verdict concerns this year the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.550
 m4 is a weapon that rewards precision 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.769
 patience and dedication with delle 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.120
 exceptional statistics as a nation of 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.709
 speed to fly at recharge times 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.470
 herat recoil of fire make it 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.970
 extremely lethal however the mode 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.799
 burst requires experience to be 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.239
 best used because the techniques 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.150
 used with non automatic weapons 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.530
 can be used like this but in a 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.540
 nutshell good speed and 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.049
 controllability but requires experience e 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.360
 discipline I will propose again but how 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.650
 necessary and aimed at improving the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.660
 precision features of 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.190
 this year first of all as well-known cables 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.599
 advice and an all in one later is that the 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.430
 minino metallica even though I am 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.069
 found well with it is not really 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.980
 beautiful but accessory I recommend 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.570
 no doubt the laser pointer 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.010
 as a cane I recommend the heavy barrel 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.690
 which makes duet well with nature more 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.060
 on the cetraro he took the moons 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.620
 distance of this weapon finally like 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.010
 that ergonomic grip that one 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.989
 just squat because the angled one gives us 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.609
 an advantage that essentially does not exist 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.230
 serves since the multiplier of the first 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.090
 blow as mentioned above comes 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.530
 moved to the last shot 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.209
 having said that guys I hope the video is 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.920
 was not only interesting but also 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.870
 useful is mica I hope to see you at 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.730
 my next guide so what else to say 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.790
 here was your step and spectre 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.790
 I close
