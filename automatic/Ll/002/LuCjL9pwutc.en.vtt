00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
separately once we got down to know

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.260 
separately once we got down to know
exactly<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.830> needed<00:01:44.039> then<00:01:44.940> you<00:01:45.060> just

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
exactly what we needed then you just

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.660
