00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.600 
birthing of zone weight to a dealer and
that<00:02:33.420> dealer<00:02:33.690> didn't<00:02:33.990> believe<00:02:34.230> me<00:02:34.410> -<00:02:34.610> and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
that dealer didn't believe me - and

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.750 
that dealer didn't believe me - and
therefore<00:02:36.000> I've<00:02:36.180> made<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.600> movie<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.410> show

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
therefore I've made it movie to show

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.450 
therefore I've made it movie to show
that<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:39.210> car<00:02:39.480> really<00:02:40.020> does<00:02:40.170> not<00:02:40.470> have<00:02:40.680> any

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
that this car really does not have any

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.570 
that this car really does not have any
oil<00:02:41.850> level<00:02:42.890> viewable<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.700> cold<00:02:45.030> motor<00:02:45.240> so

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
oil level viewable is a cold motor so

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.460 
oil level viewable is a cold motor so
physically<00:02:47.580> this<00:02:47.630> this<00:02:48.630> dealer<00:02:48.870> not<00:02:49.110> long<00:02:49.440> ago

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
physically this this dealer not long ago

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.960 
physically this this dealer not long ago
to<00:02:52.470> check<00:02:53.180> my<00:02:54.180> car<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.190> seems<00:02:56.490> there<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.730> no

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
to check my car and it seems there is no

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.960 
to check my car and it seems there is no
no<00:02:57.330> car<00:02:57.600> anymore<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:58.530> because<00:02:59.460> they<00:02:59.610> will<00:02:59.760> then

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
no car anymore in because they will then

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.250 
no car anymore in because they will then
grab<00:03:00.150> reason<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:01.890> now<00:03:02.190> we<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.550> about<00:03:03.260> driven

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
grab reason so now we have about driven

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.470 
grab reason so now we have about driven
about<00:03:04.350> 65<00:03:05.280> kilometres<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:06.030> 70<00:03:06.450> kilometers

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
about 65 kilometres to 70 kilometers

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.910 
about 65 kilometres to 70 kilometers
with<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.110> car<00:03:07.430> wait<00:03:08.430> about<00:03:08.640> five<00:03:09.570> hours<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.350> as

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
with a car wait about five hours and as

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.590 
with a car wait about five hours and as
you<00:03:11.100> can<00:03:11.310> see<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:12.740> temperature<00:03:13.740> of<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.250> oil

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
you can see the temperature of the oil

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.280 
you can see the temperature of the oil
as<00:03:15.800> well<00:03:16.800> as<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.190> temperature<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.090> water

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.900 

there's<00:03:22.290> nothing<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.860> indicate<00:03:23.010> only<00:03:23.310> level

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
there's nothing to indicate only level

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.220 
there's nothing to indicate only level
meters<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:25.290> now<00:03:25.440> we<00:03:25.500> take<00:03:25.800> a<00:03:26.930> look<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:28.080> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
meters so now we take a look on the

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.860 
meters so now we take a look on the
motor<00:03:28.530> hood<00:03:28.800> to<00:03:29.220> see<00:03:29.330> what's<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.510> level<00:03:30.750> of

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
motor hood to see what's the level of

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.960 
motor hood to see what's the level of
the<00:03:30.989> oil<00:03:31.020> currently<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.890> will<00:03:32.459> check<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.700> right

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the oil currently I will check it right

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.850 
the oil currently I will check it right
now

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:50.360 

there's<00:03:38.100> now<00:03:39.230> nothing<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:48.780> see

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
there's now nothing and you see

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.839 
there's now nothing and you see
it's<00:03:50.879> no

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.349 

so<00:03:54.739> that's<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.890> big<00:03:56.040> question<00:03:56.749> how<00:03:57.749> can<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.170> be

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
so that's the big question how can it be

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:07.150 
so that's the big question how can it be
nothing<00:04:00.359> when<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.109> know<00:04:01.230> your<00:04:01.409> vehicle

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.470 

perhaps<00:04:07.820> focusing<00:04:08.630> on<00:04:08.780> those<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.110> answer
