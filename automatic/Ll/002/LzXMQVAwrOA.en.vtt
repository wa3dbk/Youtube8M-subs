00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.480
Hello and welcome back to unit 5 of this European
Schoolnet Academy Games Based Learning course,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.750
and of course module 5 is all about Designing
Games.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.759
This is a little unit on some advanced games
design tools.

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.920
We have already looked at some simple games
design tools with a bit of an introduction,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.809
and we have looked at some games design tools
that could be used for certainly younger children

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.390
but always for the young at heart.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.261
What we are going to have a look at in this
module here are some tools that perhaps are

00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:46.489
a little bit more advanced so perhaps the
young people need to maybe be a little bit

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:47.489
older.

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.510
First we are going to have a quick look at
something which is called RPG Game Maker.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.499
If you are familiar with software for the
Nintendo DS, then even though this is a PC-based

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:05.159
game the actual types of game that you are
able to produce with RPG Game Maker look like

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.240
the types of game that you would normally
play on the Nintendo DS.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.479
They are map-based which means that you explore
different aspects of the game, and most importantly

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.620
they are incredibly narrative driven.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.840
You can develop your own stories, you can
develop your own fight scenes, you can develop

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.141
your own different pathways, so depending
on which direction you want to take the game

00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:31.140
in and the choices that the game play makes
would depend on the actual outcome of the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.140
game.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.990
Now we are going to have a look at something
called the UDK, the Unreal Development Kit.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.480
Even though you might not have heard of the
Unreal Development Kit before, you probably

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.170
heard of some of the games that it has been
used to create.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.720
All the Batman games for example or Infinity
Blade, they used and created using the UDK.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.700
What people do not realise about the UDK though
is that it is a free game engine, which can

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.840
be used by schools.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.570
It has got a licencing agreement with it,
so you can use the Kit for free.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.730
However, if you go on to sell your game, then
you need to pay quite a bit of royalties back

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.520
to the UDK team.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.350
What this means for us in schools is that
actually we can use industry standard games

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.390
design software for free in our schools.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.600
That is a pretty empowering thing and something
which UDK know and they are very keen to support.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.430
The thing about UDK is that it is a step up
from any other game engines that we have looked

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.430
at already.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.970
And as a result of that, it is also pretty
complicated to use, although there is a lot

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.880
of really good tutorials that are available
that you can either work through with your

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.350
students or they can indeed work through by
themselves.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.830
You have only got to look at some of the features
of what can be created in UDK to realise it

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.750
is a pretty amazing piece of software.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.650
Just look how beautiful this screenshot looks
here because of the adjusted lighting.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.240
Again, just like good game engines, it also
got a really advanced physics engine, and

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.650
as you would expect, the physics engine for
the UDK contains quite a lot of complex mathematics.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.900
It is not just physics and what the game can
do, it is also around different effects that

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.800
can happen as well in the game depending on
which way your character is looking or indeed

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.350
depending on what time of day it is within
the game as well.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.450
As well as effects and as well as physics
engine, you can also carry out a number of

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.130
visual scriptings to ensure that certain things
happen when you want them to happen because

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.720
of a delay.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.790
In this example here, this is looking at the
visual scripting for sandstorm which is going

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.340
to happen during the game.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.910
Again, visual scripting tools can be used
to introduce older children into what is actually

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.530
required when we talk about game play and
also to introduce some elements of storytelling.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.401
The other nice thing about the UDK is similar
to Project Spark and Kodu which is that we

00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:47.400
can introduce different levels.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.730
This ensures that the game remains progressive
but also of course you can get different students

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.860
to work on a different level of the game.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.480
So we can also introduce that element of collaboration.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.530
That was a couple of quite advanced games
design units that you can actually use with

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.260
your children in your classroom.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.940
Again, the Royal Society of Edinburgh has
produced 2 other things which you might find

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.580
of interest, although they are not specifically
related to games design, again they have got

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.600
games design which permeates through them.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.959
One is called I Love My Smartphone, which
encourages young people to develop smartphone

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.740
apps, and the other one is a unit on information
and web databases.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.780
Remember that there are very sophisticated
databases behind all games design units.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.500
There we go, we have reached the end of module
5 and I hope you have enjoyed it.
