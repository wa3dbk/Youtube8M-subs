00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.320
 eat a dish at home too 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.280
 as from the restaurant well this is the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.870
 our case 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.750
 the ingredients for today's recipe 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.310
 are four sheets of fresh pasta for 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.880
 lasagna a spring onion two boiled potatoes 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.460
 400 g of Charterhouse a Kaiser Pear 100 g 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.489

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.750
 I have a potato mash here when 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.460
 use a yes tools if not 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.940
 warm potatoes you don't even need anymore 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.719
 peel the potato with a minimum of strength 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.200
 track go down and you will get yours 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.200
 mashed potatoes 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.309
 the only care the temperature of the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.590
 potatoes if they cool they become 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.289
 really hard to crush will not have 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.600
 so we work the other ingredients 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.489
 egg pasta made in a classic way 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.159
 I brought the ingredients for 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.040
 let you see it every 200 g of flour 2 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.590
 eggs therefore the proportion is identical one 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 pinch of salt and the dough is made like 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.960
 always 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.909
 let it rest wrapped by the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.610
 film if you do n't want to put yourself in 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.830
 knead with egg flour you can 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.720
 buy egg pasta sheets 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.030
 already fresh the same ones used for 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.869
 the lasagna we finish pulling the dough 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:33.570
 very thin and then brush and oil 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.820
 brush all the handful surface 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.400
 of parmesan cheese 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.070
 let the pastry prevent 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.890
 features covered a very light 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.409
 let's call the breading now the first thing 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.509
 that we will do will be to cut the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.159
 then cut onion is not there 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.409
 need to do it too thin will be 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.509
 just cut it into small pieces and 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.880
 then we put it in a pan with a wire 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.439
 of oil well I immediately put the potatoes 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.469
 you just have to let him do one 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.670
 are light roasting in the pan are 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.500
 balmy 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.200
 indeed they are really cult rather than lukewarm 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.090
 I add the hero cheese cut into 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.910
 pieces and started slowly a 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.430
 he must not become a pimp with care 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.890
 however the ingredients are homogeneous 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.060
 must be tied this is of the 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.000
 pillow 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.000
 I cut it and match it and put it 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 the brush to brown brush 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.670
 of oil the mold inside and then one 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.269
 then good sprinkling of Parmesan 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.140
 I take the pasta I put it inside the 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:46.060
 our mold stop a good dose of 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:49.060
 filling I close the first sides and then I give it 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.440
 our bundles form a bundle 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.690
 put them in the oven for 7 8 minutes 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.610
 little robot these are tomatoes 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.590
 of pachino not liz boiling not them 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.489
 cook remove peel and nothing is 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.489
 so wonderful 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.290
 and give a touch of color to ours 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.480
 false floor plan to squeeze spirit 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.220
 let all the liquid flow down 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.870
 this is one for a kaiser pear for the 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.269
 cooking I always recommend it because 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.900
 a work that keeps the pulp the pulp 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.420
 and a lot and soda and on what but not you not 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.310
 it flakes even if cooked this is needed 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.310
 to make small beads 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.409
 I put it in the pulp and it continues 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.049
 to do so of the small pearls we give 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.940
 to pearls a seared in such a way 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.829
 that can be inserted together with 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.560
