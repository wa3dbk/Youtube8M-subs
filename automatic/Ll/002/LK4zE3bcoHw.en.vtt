track<00:02:58.560> just<00:02:58.800> doesn't<00:02:59.280> connect<00:03:04.730> think<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.820> might

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
track just doesn't connect think I might

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.190 
track just doesn't connect think I might
throw<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.650> little<00:03:08.040> one<00:03:08.190> right<00:03:08.750> here<00:03:09.750> well

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
throw that little one right here well

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.820 
throw that little one right here well
maybe<00:03:10.560> just<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.860> little<00:03:11.130> bit<00:03:11.400> good<00:03:11.700> big<00:03:12.830> but
