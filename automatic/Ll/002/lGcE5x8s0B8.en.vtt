00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.290
 [Music] 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.850
 I lit the grille and fixed the badminton net. 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.460
 Are those clouds in sight? 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.090
 Do not check your phone 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.680
 I know you! 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:20.960
 [Music] 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.030
 Our noses can capture up to a trillion different smells, and a large number of these odors are closely related 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:32.830
 With our memories and feelings, like your grandmother's house, your first dog, or ... the smell of rain. 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.080
 Winds of storms carry an orchestra of independent odors 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.780
 But the distinctive smell of the earth before the storm can be traced back to three chemical sources. 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.890
 Before the thunderstorm, you probably smell the ozone 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.690
 It is interesting that they acquired this name from the Greek word meaning "jade" 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.600
 The electrical charge from the lightning stored in the drawn cloud at the top, divides the oxygen gas into separate atoms 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.680
 Some of these atoms can be re-formed into ozone. 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.600
 Lower air currents push this ozone in front of the expected storm, and down to the level of your nose. 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.700
 As the rain begins, a new smell emerges from the mud 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.980
 It is the pungent fragrance we are pleased to call the Beatricor. 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.240
 The Beatricor obtained half of its name from the etheric conclusion that passed through the veins of the Greek gods, and the other half received the stones of the earth 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.860
 This name almost includes both the science and the strong feeling I feel when I smell that smell. 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.150
 When the rotten organic matter blows through the air, it lands on the mud 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.680
 The rocks combine with the minerals, the mixture blends into a mixture 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.960
 Magic of particles. 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.200
 Then the falling rain drops send those airborne chemicals to your blurred nose. 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.940
 When there is no rain, those chemicals remain in the mud 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.500
 Where plants are alerted to stop growing their roots or to prevent their seeds from sprouting when there is no water to drink. 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.560
 The Beatric Hope plants that wait wait ... to grow and thrive. 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.350
 The bacteria in the mud contribute to the betricor by releasing a chemical called gyosmin 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.740
 It is the same compound that gives the beet its dusty taste. 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.620
 There are other purposes of the Beatricor as well as bestowal of feelings. 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.520
 It is believed to attract beauty to desert oases where you drink and transport mud bacteria through sand. 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.300
 It also seems that the elongated petricor to rivers and lakes also alerts fish to the time of reproduction. 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.760
 There is nothing that sends a romantic spark like rainstorms I think. 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.820
 So next time you smell a summer storm, take a minute of your time to think about what you want that rock out there to tell you. 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.760
 Stay curious 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.340
 And "Ashkm" next time. 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.870
 Why the loans are very scary? The monsters hungry for blood are caught inside the waves to eat 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.940
 Our human flesh. If we can get rid of these comrades, our holidays will be more 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.130
 And nothing will worry us as we ski and dance in the ocean. 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.900
 But that does not happen in fact. 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.410
 "Crimson, Eleven, Delight, Petricor" (password to open in Doctor Who episode) 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.990
 just awesome!
