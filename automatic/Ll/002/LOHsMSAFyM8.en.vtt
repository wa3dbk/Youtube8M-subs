00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:09.780
 and we're going to have dinner at a buffet 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.780
 but if they go to lunch 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.400
 this is what you call lunch less 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.020
 could you have made me a fried egg 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.939
 you are lazy 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.939
 I do not know where we are going 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:33.360
 I remember it is true today we have 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.250
 that place where this place listens to you 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.449
 If you do not know what we are talking not 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.489
 make you see that if you know 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:43.190
 today we will have dinner in a free buffet, not you 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.190
 you agree that we discussed it with a 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.620
 and he has not said jester has said buffet 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.540
 free you always understand everything upside down 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.160
 look if I'm not a free buffet is a 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.110
 restaurant where you can eat so much 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.730
 as you want of all good 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.730
 as much as they want 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.970
 and I also die of desire and 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.350
 there we have to eat as much as 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.530
 we can today there will be no food and 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.530
 snack 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.940
 we do not go to the restaurant of a hotel 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.590
 luxury costs more than 7000 yen per head 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.600
 adults and 4000 children 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.830
 we have to go very hungry to 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.830
 seize the occasion 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:39.070
 let's go there to see how we're feeling 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.050
 we have a lot but if you have 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.390
 tapped a hole better two 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.550
 holes - Zinkia the willing to 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.910
 pants that look great but 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.590
 I do not like them because they fall out and sir 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.830
 but how do you want them to not fall off if 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.080
 you wear the loose straps 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.210
 very well I have also put the 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.560
 skirts with rubber waist we can eat 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.610
 as much as we want we will not have 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.610
 no problem 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.940
 Let's see 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.190
 because of breast runs as expected not yet 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.760
 first we must have a table that they will want 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.310
 that it serves them to drink since of 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.880
 moment we will not take the day thanks to the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.010
 good deal agreement because you have not 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.690
 let me measure one fresh and two here 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.580
 you can eat everything you want but from 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.819
 the drink they do not say anything look at the letter of 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.230
 prices 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:37.189
 33 800 you see the most expensive are the 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.189
 prices of a luxury hotel 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.310
 something become section manager 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.569
 I have seen for important things 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.569
 It seems to me that it is already time to 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.250
 fill the banana not yet woman in a 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.260
 Free buffet can not do 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.180
 things in a hurry before you have to 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.239
 be very clear when you can attack and 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.090
 that you want to take exactly you have 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.769
 think that always worth more 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.400
 there is something that ends quickly you know 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.319
 what is the change of different life I 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.790
 it seems that they still have not taken it out but 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.719
 I'm sure that when they do what 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.519
 will put on that table we do not have to 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:20.209
 lose sight of her that table of agreement 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:24.360
 very well the war cry to gobble and 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:29.540
 by the way what is that of the plane 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.540
 They are shark eggs, shark eggs 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.220
 I think you 're imagining something strange 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.080
 you do not think you should explain it a little 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.730
 better what is caviar 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:49.019
 you do not need a man when it's time 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.019
 you'll already see smoked salmon as a vegetable 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.250
 misa in not being able to fill the plate of that 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.549
 way you do not realize why that 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.549
 technique 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.450
 ah 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.160
 good 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.160
 Thank you 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.160
 These are restaurant of a hotel of 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.160
 luxury we should eat 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.729
 I'm going to skin 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:58.909
 these are shark eggs 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.139
 They look like frog eggs or bayern has 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:03.129
 finished the caviar 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.129
 I think I wanted to try 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.839
 we can accept 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:14.300
 you have arrived not please 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:19.789
 accept it we eat it with been 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:24.039
 daily , thank you very much but 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.039
 think that caviar those frog eggs 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.559
 substitutes 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.569
 secular but you get real raisins we have 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.960
 we eat everything we can and repeat 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:43.550
 and has thought about repeating itself but it is not so 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.550
 easy if we do not want to look bad 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.720
 if we repeat too much they look at us and 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.370
 He is also a stingy because instead of 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.650
 prepare 5 or 6 plates at once 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.370
 prepare one by one to the shadows I go 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:58.100
 to look more very well I too and of 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.750
 you will see many thanks 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.880
 hey my mother says you 're a stingy 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.290
 because they prepare the dishes they have one to 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.290
 see always for 56 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.900
 I'm not about to burst on me I do not 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.180
 it's well filled we have amortized 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.440
 Of course I have eaten so much that I think 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.440
 I will not be hungry anymore 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.270
 the next morning 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:35.270
 one moment please, how important I am 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.040
 And we need very little yesterday. 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.620
 to cooper and they 're starving 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.940
 It seems incredible that we endure so little 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.940
 time without eating half 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.400
 I stop
