00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
right so now we're at a point where we

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.230 
right so now we're at a point where we
have<00:06:12.120> minus<00:06:12.620> 651<00:06:13.620> population<00:06:14.430> it's<00:06:15.000> because

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
have minus 651 population it's because

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
population isn't it time you but if you

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.470 
population isn't it time you but if you
look<00:06:19.380> here<00:06:19.650> you<00:06:19.980> can<00:06:20.040> see<00:06:20.220> that<00:06:20.700> our<00:06:21.270> numbers

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
look here you can see that our numbers

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.350 
look here you can see that our numbers
have<00:06:21.660> gone<00:06:21.990> up<00:06:22.050> a<00:06:22.290> lot<00:06:22.320> so<00:06:23.280> now<00:06:23.520> let's<00:06:24.120> say<00:06:24.300> you
