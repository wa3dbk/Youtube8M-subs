00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
your power charger what do you do this

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.269 
your power charger what do you do this
is<00:00:30.240> something<00:00:30.449> from<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.750> pc<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.560> like

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
is something from a pc and this is like

any<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.559> charging<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.460> or<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.760> keeping

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
any is that charging it or just keeping

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.880 
any is that charging it or just keeping
it<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:03.780> an<00:01:03.899> additional<00:01:04.559> battery

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
it going it's like an additional battery

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.010 
it going it's like an additional battery
so<00:01:05.460> once<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.000> depleted<00:01:06.450> it'll<00:01:06.659> go<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
so once this is depleted it'll go to the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.530 
so once this is depleted it'll go to the
the<00:01:07.409> battery<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.040> y<00:01:08.250> co<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.970> if<00:01:09.210> you've

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.179 
the battery on this y co but if you've
using<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.439> probably<00:01:10.530> depleted<00:01:11.100> this

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
using this you probably depleted this

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.039 
using this you probably depleted this
one<00:01:11.369> already<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.240> get<00:01:12.299> anywhere<00:01:12.659> on

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
