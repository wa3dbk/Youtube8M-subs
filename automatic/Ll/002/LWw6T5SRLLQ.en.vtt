00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 and the barbell really has that 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.290
 all the time contact us 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:14.429
 thigh 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:16.170
 We begin as I row what 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.270
 that means how does it work? 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.830
 once the short variant and once the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.810
 latte variant for the country committee so 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.810
 we need a short dumbbell and one 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.000
 oblique bank first important again 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.439
 to fix our shoulders so the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.780
 left and right shoulder are on 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.340
 a height actually only move 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.190
 our arm to the rear 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.190
 the goal is the elbow on the body 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.350
 along to pull back up as well 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.879
 not like here with the shoulder down 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.100
 to go to blame is always fixed 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.879
 is the left and right shoulder on 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.950
 a height 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.570
 because next to the side not the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.010
 elbow out but the elbow 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.559
 really lead to the back 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.690
 so we can effectively our country 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.940
 what the biggest mistake is the training 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.829
 Most people just do the dumbbells 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.829
 to the side and not to the rear 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.800
 so and the whole we can also with the 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.710
 make a dumbbell 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.490
 We take our land in easily 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.980
 The knees then bend forward to us 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.280
 ass of the outstretched eighth and the 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.560
 press straight is therefore moves from the march 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.650
 over press up to the head one straight 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.080
 line and involve the barbell 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.090
 our thighs along as you 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.670
 has been there for a long time 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.620
 contact to our thighs completely 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.560
 At the bottom of the knee, we begin to them 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.880
 completely high in the hips and here too 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.680
 Focus on us again 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.200
 Pull elbows to the rear and not 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.760
 to the side 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.520
 so we can be effective again 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.290
 our left and right at the same time 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.820
 Exercise and exercise 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.270
 Of course, our back stricker 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.980
