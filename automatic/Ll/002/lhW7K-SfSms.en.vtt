00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
here is stone getting a lot of

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.500 
here is stone getting a lot of
reflection<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.750> little<00:02:35.049> bit<00:02:35.290> Brea<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:37.360> is

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
reflection so a little bit Brea this is
