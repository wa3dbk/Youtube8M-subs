00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.740

 actually exhibited in museums 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.910
 So once more comes to 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:04.290
 politics together and then the rad 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.460
 and then lead a kind of design 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.340

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.540
 proper museums is exhibited 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.840
 both benders days on the occasion of info to 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.710
 roleplaying with looks through the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.640
 landscape 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.700
 new characters and 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.170
 minister 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.880
 and are always before decision 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.390
 posed 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.390
 generation 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.660
 I do not jump 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.700
 that can be very simple things 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.250
 which way do you want next to left or 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.320
 right 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.820
 here, for example, meets five men 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.740
 somewhere on the side of the road and for you 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.690
 decide to take the middle with those 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.130
 we drink to go 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.510
 the question if that is the decision of the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.870
 Senate any things that bring you 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.850
 no matter what decisions 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.550
 the storyline evolves every time 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.850
 completely different look beautiful 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.850
 wheel design 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.930
 The fights do not play a big role 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.159
 the customer 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.159
 very good 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.190
 literature 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.190
 more 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.069
 this is the first baby of the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.069
 tutorials confidences turn based 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.300
 we are blue the fine one 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.320
 Leipzig 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.300
 to confirm 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.960
 There are obviously different classes 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.960
 very classic 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.980
 nice attacks 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.380
 painful 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.519
 vision presents 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.020
 precisely because you are up to your decision 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.440
 not only fighting but now 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.620
 always during the 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.150
 when it comes to gameplay in principle all yours 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.150
 characters die 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.439
 telling us that is basically good 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:39.440
 imagine such a best of game of 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:42.430
 thrones 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.430
 vikings 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:47.209
 and the fight for the xcom
