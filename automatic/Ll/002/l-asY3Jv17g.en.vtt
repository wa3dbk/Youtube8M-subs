 how much time and how is the life of the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.040
 penguins is distributed throughout 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.980
 coasts and South American islands both in the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.259
 peaceful ocean like in the atlantic in 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.450
 the Argentine maritime coast the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.270
 reproduction colonies are found 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.039
 located between Tierra del Fuego and the 42 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.890
 degrees of visual south latitude and maciver

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.250
 Antarctic and sub- Antarctic distribution 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.590
 this species occupies temperate areas east 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.530
 penguin presents throughout the year two 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.440
 well defined periods one reproductive 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.870
 where it only goes to the sea and feed and 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.809
 Pelagic life cycle where no 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.510
 they leave the sea in no time this 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.520
 last period begins in the fall in 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.800
 where you make a migration to the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.600
 north spending the winter in the sea 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.719
 off the coast of Brazil towards 1977 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.910
 in the case of adults this period 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.040
 pelagic finishes towards the end of August 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.250
 or early September when 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.230
 return to the colonies 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.510
 the juvenile individuals instead 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.910
 arrive in the colony during the month of 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.610
 November reproduction occurs in 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.760
 large colonies being the largest of

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.080
 monogamous and present a high fidelity

 to the nest they take turns to incubate 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.410
 eggs and feed the boersma chicks

 lethal in press in October the females 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.080
 They put two eggs hatch in November 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.570
 the chicks become independent towards ends 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.820

 north in the colony of punta tombo has 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.380
 registered an interannual variation in 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.630
 reproductive success the number of 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.960
 chicks independent by couple varies 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.300

 food availability is one of the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.370
 main factors that affect the

 reproductive success of seabirds 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.360

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.620
 been associated with lack of food 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.850
 resulting from a decrease in

 the couples arrive before the colony 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.890
 occupy nests early as the 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.530
 adults have more weight the eggs are 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.840
 longer and heavier the chicks are 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.210
 they feed more frequently and earn

 Despite these annual fluctuations,

 colonies located in the north of the

 patagonia seem to increase their number 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.859
 from the first half of the 20th century 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.810
 lethal boersma in press this is due to 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.819
 the high fluctuation in success

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:03.480
 drastically the three main 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.790
 causes of mortality associated with 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.519
 disturbances produced by man are
