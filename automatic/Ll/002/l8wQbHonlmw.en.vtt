00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.730 
it and that basically means the same as
copy<00:01:44.220> except<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.000> deletes<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.570> takes<00:01:46.560> it

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
copy except it deletes it takes it

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.420 
copy except it deletes it takes it
actually<00:01:47.399> takes<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.820> from<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.180> folder<00:01:48.479> so

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
actually takes it from that folder so

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.200 
actually takes it from that folder so
I'm<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.610> cut<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:52.610> let's<00:01:53.610> see<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.090> I
