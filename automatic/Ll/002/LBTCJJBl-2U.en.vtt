00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.690
 well this is a tutorial a guide 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.279
 or whatever you want to call about how it is 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.960
 that water and pokÃ©mon suicidal gold and silver 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.789
 Well, let's start, I'll leave you the 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.320
 links in the description 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:26.770
 all they have to do is enter 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.910
 url that leaves the description 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.759
 to see a second meeting 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.030
 you can see that you have me very slow 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.030
 He passed 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.310
 then the link will take this page 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.310
 [Music] 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.180
 as I told him and let them take 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.440
 this page 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.440
 the plane 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.649
 they only wait 25 seconds 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.450
 the typical five seconds that you 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.850
 despair 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.850
 the advertising bet 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.100
 you know buried advertising 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.229
 [Music] 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.229
 make you publicity and take you 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.100
 the ingredient 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.960
 in this case pokemon silver soulsilver 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.960
 by the way is in Spanish and everything 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.840
 good since they give you a click 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.320
 because you have been clicked 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.720
 a few a bit of time for that 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.710
 it starts to download as it says 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.540
 starting only weighs 40 megabytes point 5 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.750
 in this case prison or because it 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.750
 I have 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.350
 and I will leave you with this choice 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.640
 this completes on 7 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.640
 and they have to extract it 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.250
 I will leave you etc 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.230
 that she is to open the game 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.560
 is going to prove to you that as you have more than 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.409
 10 moment 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.940
 Abreu 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.510
 desk 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.510
 here it is 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.560
 and start 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.000
 come on 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.000
 so you see if it works 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.130
 Well for those who do not have at the moment 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:35.940
 I leave you the lic is also this 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.300
 the same they click on the link and the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.300
 carry 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.970
 will take them 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.130
 and will take them to the same page 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.700
 advertising wait 5 seconds 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.700
 required 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.970
 one 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.629
 and you can give that three publicity 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.440
 I want to take this page 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.720
 from this page because you follow this 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.000
 is the main one in this you can load the 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.430
 version that has windows example if 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.400
 have more download this if they have 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.489
 32 bit windows download that in my 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.799
 case unload of 64 there appear several 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.970
 options the truth I do not know what it means 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.970
 is to remove and pedal 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.190
 I do not know clearly do not take them here 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.280
 is that seconds are present 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.550
 As you can see , this file does not weigh 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.550
 much 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:48.310
 it only weighs a mega inning and a half 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:51.599
 Well then let's wait for it to download 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.599
 while we can do 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.849
 download quickly please 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.030
 well, ten seconds left 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.650
 by the way 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.880
 this is the fourth attempt to record 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.980
 this video 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.510
 they have interrupted me I forgot some 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.510
 things or things like that 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.510
 good either in folder 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.260
 I can do this already 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.260
 is this 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.570
 here I had it 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.220
 okay 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.140
 good 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.220
 it's the same, it seems to me that if he's 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:38.180
 not good folder 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.990
 can be extracted at 10 times with 0.9 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.650
 points 9 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.580
 winslet and 64 so the folder is created 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.580
 and they will not have a 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:53.000
 all full of files since they have 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:57.530
 open just open the application and that 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.520
 they can be opened and opened better than in 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.520
 this case completely 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.099
 and that 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.410
 that easy, I know if this is 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.819
 now by the way 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.789
 ander or let's play and the law as 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:25.610
 you want me to tell you the truth I do not know 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:27.589
 that's what I mean audio I do not 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.910
 I have half and makes perfect record 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:31.730
 friends 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:35.000
 look up to the maximum to see how it 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.360
 listen I guess it will sound different and 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.360
 if you go up 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.530
 if you do not listen, I repeat it, 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:47.129
 flat is not heard or heard 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.060
 but very little 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:52.630
 so you believe me 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.940
 well that's all thanks for watching 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.760
 liked it in like to share it with friends 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.900
 or whatever you want 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.590
 The truth is that it does not have much 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.310
 importance 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.850
 good until then I say goodbye file 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.850
