00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.420 
league if the league's no longer around
I<00:01:31.229> mean<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.560> that's<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.950> difficult<00:01:32.340> position

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
I mean that that's a difficult position

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.429 
I mean that that's a difficult position
you<00:01:32.880> know<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.030> know<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.390> u.s.<00:01:33.570> ones<00:01:33.990> national

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
we believe firmly that we need to

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.600 
we believe firmly that we need to
maintain<00:02:32.550> in<00:02:33.120> order<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.510> continue<00:02:33.660> providing

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
maintain in order to continue providing

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.450 
maintain in order to continue providing
the<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:36.030> best<00:02:36.270> talent<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.800> best<00:02:37.980> women's

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
the the best talent the best women's

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.380 
the the best talent the best women's
soccer<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.960> world<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.680> think<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.390> US

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
soccer in the world and I think that US

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.570 
soccer in the world and I think that US
soccer<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:43.440> willing<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.860> work<00:02:44.040> with<00:02:44.100> us<00:02:44.250> and

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
soccer is willing to work with us and

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.580 
soccer is willing to work with us and
doing<00:02:44.850> so<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.330> think<00:02:45.780> one<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.110> important

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
doing so I think one of the important

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.340 
doing so I think one of the important
things<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:46.890> note<00:02:47.280> is<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.580> we<00:02:48.510> are<00:02:48.540> five<00:02:48.990> teams

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
things to note is that we are five teams

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.520 
things to note is that we are five teams
this<00:02:49.590> year<00:02:50.060> we<00:02:51.060> were<00:02:51.270> six<00:02:51.690> last<00:02:51.990> year<00:02:52.320> we've

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
this year we were six last year we've

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.110 
this year we were six last year we've
operated<00:02:52.830> under<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.460> waiver<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.940> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
operated under a waiver of the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.690 
operated under a waiver of the
eight-team<00:02:55.040> minimum<00:02:56.040> standard<00:02:56.520> for

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
eight-team minimum standard for

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.150 
eight-team minimum standard for
professional<00:02:57.210> leagues<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.660> past<00:02:58.160> the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
professional leagues in the past the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.880 
professional leagues in the past the
reason<00:02:59.610> we<00:02:59.760> are<00:02:59.880> at<00:03:00.060> five<00:03:00.300> teams<00:03:00.660> this<00:03:00.959> year<00:03:01.320> is

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
reason we are at five teams this year is

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.770 
reason we are at five teams this year is
not<00:03:02.160> because<00:03:02.580> we<00:03:02.790> lost<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.300> team<00:03:03.480> due<00:03:03.690> to

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
not because we lost a team due to

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.350 
not because we lost a team due to
financial<00:03:04.200> concerns<00:03:04.770> or<00:03:05.160> had<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.700> team<00:03:06.000> fold

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
financial concerns or had a team fold

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.930 
financial concerns or had a team fold
but<00:03:06.630> we<00:03:06.810> our<00:03:07.650> Board<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.340> Governors<00:03:08.459> made<00:03:08.910> a

but we our Board of Governors made a

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.990 
but we our Board of Governors made a
very<00:03:09.300> conscious<00:03:09.959> business<00:03:10.500> decision<00:03:11.370> to

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
very conscious business decision to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.360 
very conscious business decision to
terminate<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.900> team<00:03:13.320> because<00:03:13.709> of<00:03:14.100> an<00:03:14.190> owner

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
terminate a team because of an owner

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.150 
terminate a team because of an owner
that<00:03:14.489> they<00:03:14.790> felt<00:03:15.120> was<00:03:15.450> not<00:03:15.810> operating<00:03:16.770> in<00:03:17.070> the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
that they felt was not operating in the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.530 
that they felt was not operating in the
best<00:03:17.190> interest<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.030> league<00:03:18.239> in<00:03:18.420> the

best interest of the league in the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.640 
best interest of the league in the
players<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:21.660> really<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.050> a<00:03:22.170> decision

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
players and so it really is a decision

know you can't say in every sport we're

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.700 
know you can't say in every sport we're
only<00:05:27.729> one<00:05:28.030> of<00:05:28.150> two<00:05:28.180> professional<00:05:29.169> leagues<00:05:29.440> for

only one of two professional leagues for
women<00:05:30.070> in<00:05:30.250> this<00:05:30.729> country<00:05:30.970> and<00:05:31.690> if<00:05:32.289> you<00:05:32.380> take

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
women in this country and if you take

women in this country and if you take
that<00:05:32.800> away<00:05:32.919> I<00:05:33.039> think<00:05:33.460> that's<00:05:33.699> a<00:05:33.970> tremendous

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
that away I think that's a tremendous

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.750 
that away I think that's a tremendous
disservice<00:05:35.139> to<00:05:35.500> all<00:05:35.949> the<00:05:36.190> young<00:05:36.370> women<00:05:36.400> that

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
disservice to all the young women that

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
professionally in this sport so I think

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.790 
professionally in this sport so I think
you<00:05:41.830> know<00:05:41.979> the<00:05:42.789> players<00:05:43.120> need<00:05:44.080> to<00:05:44.229> support<00:05:44.590> it

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
you know limitless possibilities I know

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.570 
you know limitless possibilities I know
that<00:06:31.720> you<00:06:32.440> know<00:06:32.560> soccers<00:06:32.949> have<00:06:33.130> a<00:06:33.160> tough<00:06:33.460> road

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
that you know soccers have a tough road

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.290 
that you know soccers have a tough road
in<00:06:33.970> this<00:06:34.240> country<00:06:34.780> I<00:06:35.530> think<00:06:35.979> mls<00:06:36.520> is<00:06:36.789> just<00:06:37.030> even

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
in this country I think mls is just even

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.050 
in this country I think mls is just even
hitting<00:06:37.509> their<00:06:37.720> stride<00:06:37.750> rite<00:06:38.380> now<00:06:38.560> after<00:06:39.160> you

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
hitting their stride rite now after you

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.180 
hitting their stride rite now after you
know<00:06:40.150> 18<00:06:40.509> years<00:06:40.870> and<00:06:41.199> I<00:06:41.680> think<00:06:41.770> what<00:06:42.100> people

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
know 18 years and I think what people

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.430 
know 18 years and I think what people
need<00:06:42.490> to<00:06:42.520> remember<00:06:42.729> is<00:06:43.090> that<00:06:43.270> we<00:06:43.870> are<00:06:43.900> in<00:06:44.350> our

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
infancy we're only three years old we're

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.050
