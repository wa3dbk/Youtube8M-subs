00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.929
 see culinary propaganda 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.340
 outside the window the summer is in full swing 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.590
 to hang around in the kitchen for a long time even 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.449
 I don't want to think but on the other hand 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.730
 There is no passing on the noses 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.980
 desires and so accustomed to boiling water 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.630
 fill and generally cook unlearned in 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.279
 this time especially want something 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.410
 easy and fast 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.350
 when shirak goal comes immediately 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.100
 wonderful color from a book as old as 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.520
 about this mammoth 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.230
 Elena Ivanovna new sheep in general to heat 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.950
 mind provance 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.690
 He is called very tasty white fish in 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.810
 white wine 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:54.180
 let's go workplace and so 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.760
 read out take three pounds of fish 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.650
 preferred sterlet i by the way style 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.110
 really once prepared it turns out 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.880
 there is really great taste 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.810
 so they grabbed the sterlet then you have to cook 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.640
 by this way and thus keep 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.280
 pike perch in sturgeon 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.530
 feature is good village studies and other 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.600
 fish with few bones of sturgeon and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.820
 did not cook but cooked perch 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.540
 not one and not two and not three magnificent 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.550
 result but zander in our area no yes 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.320
 and stretched out the years the locals are most likely just 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.050
 from which is some kind of Russian curse 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.090
 but there is a narva for peace need spain 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.960
 love very much because there are few bones and 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.630
 fish is big and it is inexpensive that 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.040
 important for thrifty Spaniards 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.009
 I tried the hake cooked so 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.619
 in a way that I can say very very 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.160
 adequately sea overseas or 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.140
 hake 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.790
 fits well with the recipe 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.479
 intended for the Russian river 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.520
 the scales have already removed now cut off fins 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.360
 so your task is to find perch 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.740
 sturgeon or sturgeon or peace pock I already 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.140

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.330
 known under the guise of hake most often 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.120
 of course 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.120
 kind of unsightly they are large but if 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.580
 a hundred times het does nâ€™t bother right 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.780
 and try and now I need to cut here 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.780
 such portions 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:47.370
 still need dry white wine and lemon 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.580
 and a small piece of butter 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.480
 Now 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.120
 I put the fish in the pan need 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.450
 choose such that blood was not very 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.450

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.730
 it is necessary so much to the fish to the middle 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.500

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.900
 kilograms of fish 50 grams is quite 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.540
 1 lemon is enough 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.370
 no seeds 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.330

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.599
 something light so neutral 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:40.390
 would not have come better rice or spinach 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.769
 stewed in olive oil with 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.380
 a little lemon juice 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.630

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:52.950
 another and attach your options will 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.950

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.000
 of taste 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.130
 as soon as he began to settle the pan here 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.570
 add lemon and turn off the heat 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.370
 the pan is enough for him to end a 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.870
 cell otherwise it will prepare a little bit 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.150
 not that 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.130
 some lemon juice is sour like 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.130
 It seems to me very well underlines 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.670
 his taste well and judging immediately add all 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.670

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.260
 delicate fish flesh delicate taste of spinach with 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.980
 lemon notes 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.410
 innocent and against them crispy 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.190
 garlic-flavored croutons seems to me 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.190
