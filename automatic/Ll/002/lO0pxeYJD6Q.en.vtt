00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
it on the handlebars there's two ways

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.230 
it on the handlebars there's two ways
you<00:02:51.330> can<00:02:51.740> melt<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.460> can<00:02:53.670> mount<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:53.970> for<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
you can melt it you can mount it for the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.410 
you can melt it you can mount it for the
roadway<00:02:54.600> which<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.410> put<00:02:55.620> two<00:02:55.830> zip<00:02:56.820> ties<00:02:57.060> and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
roadway which is put two zip ties and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.880 
roadway which is put two zip ties and
the<00:02:57.720> second<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.200> fourth<00:02:58.380> falls<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.860> both

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
the second and fourth falls on both

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.080 
the second and fourth falls on both
sides<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.550> mount<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.390> embers<00:03:00.870> that

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
sides and mount it to the embers that

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.280 
sides and mount it to the embers that
allows<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.270> to<00:03:03.300> adjust<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.750> angle<00:03:03.840> when

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
allows you to adjust the angle when

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.130 
allows you to adjust the angle when
you're<00:03:04.410> sitting<00:03:04.620> up<00:03:04.710> in<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.920> saddle<00:03:06.140> if

you're sitting up in the saddle if

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.320 
you're sitting up in the saddle if
you're<00:03:07.290> on<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.500> trail<00:03:07.800> I<00:03:08.100> suggest<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:09.150> you

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
move to the first and third holes on

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.120 
move to the first and third holes on
each<00:03:12.030> side<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.630> then<00:03:13.050> use<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.410> two<00:03:13.590> holes<00:03:13.860> on

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
each side and then use the two holes on

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.080 
each side and then use the two holes on
the<00:03:14.190> bottom<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:15.120> secure<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.630> across<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.740> stem

that way it won't move around on the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.440 
that way it won't move around on the
trail<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.160> frankly<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.030> won't<00:03:21.210> be<00:03:21.300> looking

at it much on the trail you're going to
be<00:03:22.950> stopped<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.460> access<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.380> let's<00:03:25.380> just<00:03:25.470> go

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
be stopped to access it so let's just go

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.740 
be stopped to access it so let's just go
ahead<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.280> mount<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.090> first<00:03:27.300> way<00:03:27.480> which

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
ahead and mount it the first way which

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.300 
ahead and mount it the first way which
will<00:03:27.870> be<00:03:28.020> the<00:03:28.110> roadway

container great thing about this it's
cheap<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:20.540> your<00:04:20.690> GPS<00:04:21.019> doesn't<00:04:21.500> take<00:04:21.620> a

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
cheap and your GPS doesn't take a

that the GPS is will reset whether the

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.130 
that the GPS is will reset whether the
electronics<00:04:31.700> are<00:04:31.820> resetting<00:04:32.270> in<00:04:32.360> it<00:04:32.480> or<00:04:32.840> the

affect this so that's how I'm out to my
GPS<00:04:44.060> to<00:04:44.690> my<00:04:45.020> mountain<00:04:45.320> bike<00:04:45.350> for<00:04:45.890> a<00:04:46.280> dollar<00:04:47.060> or
