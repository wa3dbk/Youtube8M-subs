00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.800
 well guess what I'm sick bergeois 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.660
 so I probably will not do 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.180
 many videos this week forgive me 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.040
 a lot but really this is not the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.960
 case 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:44.600
 I come to say that this news because 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.850
 I'm a fan of my hd channel this 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.030
 sent a link on an optical strut 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.830
 optician saying that microsoft was going like 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.030
 that eliminate your forgetfulness of oneself what 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.340
 now we can not continue 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.430
 up in videos of Gilgamesh 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.710
 ge commented on and now very well if 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.260
 we go to the xbox page that is where 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.110
 says the content or how to use the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.550
 use of materials like hello other 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.680
 game that has to do with microsoft 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.350
 let's see very well that there is a section 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.240
 very important that you have to read if 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.490
 we read what it says here this comes from the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.899
 direct page is a live yourselves 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.340
 you can check the link is in the 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.490
 inscription this vision in general 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.610
 no description 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.299
 now to introduce what they say from 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.189
 and by the way and by the way these rules 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.549
 nothing more 'cool' to the publicity of the 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.549
 eggs by microsoft studios where 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.890
 microsoft be have the copyright or 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.840
 so to speak are the owners of 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.729
 copyright us we can give 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.450
 the permits for the use of eggs 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.429
 other publishers or other games that 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.490
 Microsoft does not have, as it were, the 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.560
 copyright or intellectual property sorry 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.100
 but you should contact the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.880
 creators in the game producers and 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.770
 here is a list of games that 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.569
 they allow you to use them 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.659
 with the permission of microsoft in which 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.759
 you have to use one like say one 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.950
 template or a written permission and puts it 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.739
 in the description of your video as 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.720
 you see and it is included in the 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.239
 lists that means we have the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.190
 permission to use the game but with several 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.290
 conditions is to say that we can 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.690
 publish the youtube or vimeo with the 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.910
 following conditions clearly that 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.180
 says that we can show our 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.670
 as hello for example on pages like 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.460
 youtube or vimeo with the condition that 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.370
 they can not have adverse and men that are 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.260
 as advertising products or things for 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.690
 the style unless this product 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.580
 be this advertising that is is for 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.140
 youtube or pay youtube but 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.960
 we can no longer make money 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.210
 legally making videos with hello 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.000
 example from now on because 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.160
 we would be breaking the rules of 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.500
 content of the use of microsoft studios 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.660
 although clearly here also says that 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.970
 it does not matter if you have a partner program 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.380
 with some company would also be 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.840
 breaking the rules of microsoft 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.940
 studios because they are paying you for 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.250
 make money from a branded product 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.320
 those studies for example hello though 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.810
 It surprises me since it 's roster me 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.500
 and machinima that make life does for the 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.750
 style 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.480
 using content in gilo so to speak 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.130
 now very well this the like that so 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.870
 say the will not testament not 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.000
 it's like the letter that he exposes in the 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.160
 description to make it clear that you are 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.080
 using a content that they gave you 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.480
 permission to use it as an example it 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.819
 they have to put the no 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.560
 in the game they have put everything 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.879
 is on the screen it is also on the 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.280
 description so that you have a 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.170
 example what they have to put for 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.030
 of course this is just for having this 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.190
 a concern I always have them 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.099
 my videos in the four and the machinima 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.629
 of rich thread or I think I do not think not 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.580
 I have but still I have some 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.200
 videos not all nothing else to have 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.739
 provocations to avoid problems 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.970
 with the copyright now I 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.890
 It seems very strange that we have to do 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.420
 this from now on really I 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.349
 I did this just for the machinima or 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.030
 for when monetized videos but now 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.950
 I think you have to do it always if you do not 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.870
 we are going to have problems although I am not 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.450
 hundred present safe but I'm sure 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.160
 that we can still upload halo videos of 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.350
 now onward although nothing else there is 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.940
 that like more restrict to the thing and 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.440
 we can not earn money or anything 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.210
 like that 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.520
 and good if you are against 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.199
 these new microsoft rules there is a 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.479
 web page that is also the description 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.600
 of the video for us to sign 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.880
 as one with one as one says 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.250
 complaint to microsoft and so we can gather 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.139
 as many subjects as we can for 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.539
 be able to change the mind of microsoft 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.629
 we did in several companies like the act 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:48.120
 like this in soup like other things that 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.830
 we really did not like them and good guys 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.240
