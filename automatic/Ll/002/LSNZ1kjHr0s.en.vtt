00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.659
 when it came up fast compared to the 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.059
 price when he understood and arrived in 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:07.000
 all right bass drum 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.970

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.770
 channel channel 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.450
 let's go to the specifications of the computer 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.580
 So I'll explain to you how it is that 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.340

 They are seeing what can and fuck one 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.159
 very cheap human price should be must 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.720
 To be trepp is to save money, not enough 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.490
 I followed correctly, I think it 's the best 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.010
 market price is clearly 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.230

 waiting for the deal a long time ago 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.240
 so it was something of dialogue and such and such 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.520

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.600

 connect directly to a stabilizer 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.220
 because it will check the source to 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.100

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.530
 in these little boxes here right then 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.049
 he came the computer up here 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.540
 here he came and slept all over 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.700
 closed with packaging I feel 100% 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.950
 problem, so it came to the 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.510
 tone and roll over without having here 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.459

 so it came all closed to not have 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.920
 problem is perfect that we need 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.900
 the houses are too fucking all the cougars 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.130
 everything right the processor only has 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.709
 but that's not what I wanted to talk about 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.780
 with you I bought a fan cooler from my 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.030
 amd processor until who knows is 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.220
 first goal the trash there I was with 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.200
 afraid he can get hot and can 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.209
 a lot of noise on the recordings and I bought 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.829
 a fan cooler is from here and then I go 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.810
 show you guys inside the computer 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.700
 And then, how much do you need to have the account with 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.040
 processor comes a colleague from them 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.840
 sent the processor package with 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.820
 a little piece of cake left, then everything 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.560
 What did you buy them? 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.180
 for you and in the future I wanted to use 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.700
 This is something of a problem here. 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.130
 I have everything I bought in 1861 right. 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.290

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.230

 with the drives everything is right and the 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.489
 Best of all I think more

 there and warm that came the dear would be a 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.169
 reflection your processor requires 1,300 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.550
 and ugly source manuals are all 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.750
 product that we buy has a note 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.490

 magic is not I did not record opening 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.910
 because I think the business has 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.500
 unnecessary is something that no one 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.310
 wants to see knows what to explain a lot 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.440
