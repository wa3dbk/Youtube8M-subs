00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.510
 hello and welcome to our one.com 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.460
 webeditor test one.com is a typical one 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.440
 hosting company where you get his website 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.250
 including domain and e-mail extremely cheap 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.650
 can relate 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.480
 for beginners there is the web editor of 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.119
 it allows a website without any 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.560
 programming skills to create ears 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.570
 Although dotcom does not offer free 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.849
 tariff but the price structure is very 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.349
 simply designed all tariffs are 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.289
 identical but you have to decide 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.689
 how much memory space you need 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.700
 entry level offers 15 gb which really 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.930
 is very generous and for the 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.399
 most of them probably perfect 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.530
 should be sufficient 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.989
 Who needs more can up to 2 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.579
 increase terabytes 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.440
 in the control panel will be numerous 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.690
 options for the administration of a site 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.460
 displayed here can the e mail account 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.449
 Create or wordpress with only one 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.190
 click install 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.230
 For this test report, we'll take a look 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.559
 but click on the homepage build box 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.109
 web editor usually wants one 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.690
 first see a design template here 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.309
 We can choose any template 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.120
 according to our own ideas 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.250
 to adjust 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.079
 but we had to conclude that it was at 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.869
 a later design change the layer 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:13.450
 can shoot and you can do everything manually 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.070
 It has to be reworked that the 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.840
 templates responses are and we ourselves 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.579
 That's why the mobile view is right there 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.350
 for mobile phones 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.360
 Let's start at our side 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.159
 To do this, we click on one 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.170
 element on us in the left column 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.850
 the properties are displayed 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.619
 Here we can see the font size and 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.119
 set other properties 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.189
 you can drag and drop the 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.840
 elements should move something 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.280
 go wrong we click beforehand 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.560
 Of course we can also new ones 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.890
 components the texts pictures and videos 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.890
 Add 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.369
 that's how it works 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.360
 a picture gallery with few clicks in 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.360
 integrate our site 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.850
 under the menu item we place the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.580
 on 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.590
 navigation we can do it any 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.780
 move a desired location 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.800
 we see up here in the navigation 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.650
 then what that looks like 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.720
 Here we add new pages 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.610
 the budget is one side of the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.739
 copy which we can then customize 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.720
 But what we would miss is one 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.890
 easy way the side with a 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.959
 password 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.730
 we find more pages on settings 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.530
 here if we click on the gear 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.720
 important search engine relevant 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.160
 Information like the page title and 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.940
 the pages description we can here 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.860
 enter 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.150
 besides, it is possible the side of 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.150
 to hide search engines 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.730
 when we drive 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.159
 Let's examine the page in the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.090
 if everything fits, we click 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.909
 publish 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.799
 voila the website is now online 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.780
 We last but not least us of the support 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.799
 To get started you can ask the parents 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.629
 have clarified 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.310
 you can not go on here 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.200
 you can give the homepage guide more 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.750
 remove information or write an e 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.060
 mail to the one team live support 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.980
 exclusively offered by chat the 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.819
 webeditor of one.com can be quite 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.920
 let see 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.870
 the appealing designs can be 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.579
 even without programming skills 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.470
 and overall you get a lot 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.579
 for his money 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.379
 it is also practical that one on one 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.510
 another system wordpress in hindsight 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.519
 should be able to change the web editor 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.829
 one day are no longer enough 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.169
 the website would have to be complete 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.980
 be recreated 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.209
 we have painfully missed one 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.159
 website password protection 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.569
 perhaps you noticed that 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.639
 We do not know anything about an online shop or 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.650
 Although you may have mentioned blog 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.480
 one.com but both operate both 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.129
 must be set up separately and has 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.950
 because not the same look &amp; feel the clock 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.840
 website general one.com right 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.609
 passable option for smaller website 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.530
 projects where especially the price 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.269
 a central role plays in it 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.669
 functionally, competition has more to offer 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.650
 provide more details about the web editor 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:52.540
 and other providers can be found on 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.579
 website twitter.com 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.889
 we hope you have this video 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.760
 fallen and with questions and suggestions 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:01.650
 Just leave us one 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.650
