above the crease because it looked like
she<00:03:59.949> had<00:03:59.979> hers<00:04:00.489> blended<00:04:01.060> into<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.510> crease<00:04:01.840> so

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
she had hers blended into the crease so

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.589 
she had hers blended into the crease so
i<00:04:02.109> went<00:04:02.440> ahead<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.769> place<00:04:03.699> that<00:04:03.729> on<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.449> then

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
i went ahead and place that on and then

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.050 
i went ahead and place that on and then
I<00:04:04.750> grabbed<00:04:05.049> mice<00:04:05.379> the<00:04:06.129> same<00:04:06.370> blending<00:04:06.819> brush

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
I grabbed mice the same blending brush

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.809 
I grabbed mice the same blending brush
and<00:04:07.590> this<00:04:08.590> is<00:04:08.680> my<00:04:08.829> Sigma<00:04:09.190> blending<00:04:09.639> brush<00:04:09.790> and

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
and this is my Sigma blending brush and

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.149 
and this is my Sigma blending brush and
I<00:04:10.060> just<00:04:10.209> blend<00:04:10.930> that<00:04:11.019> into<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.620> crease<00:04:11.889> with

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
I just blend that into the crease with

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.360 
I just blend that into the crease with
the<00:04:12.340> soft<00:04:12.609> brown<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.379> then<00:04:14.379> once<00:04:14.739> that's

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
the soft brown and then once that's

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.089 
the soft brown and then once that's
blended<00:04:15.909> then<00:04:16.570> I'm<00:04:16.780> gonna<00:04:16.959> go<00:04:17.289> back<00:04:17.500> into<00:04:17.769> the

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
blended then I'm gonna go back into the

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:21.060 
blended then I'm gonna go back into the
tamannah<00:04:18.579> pellet<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:19.840> believe<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.709> is

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
tamannah pellet and I believe it is

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.760 
tamannah pellet and I believe it is
let's<00:04:21.609> see<00:04:21.729> if<00:04:21.849> I<00:04:22.000> have<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.270> clip<00:04:22.719> in<00:04:22.870> there<00:04:23.169> I<00:04:23.440> do

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
let's see if I have a clip in there I do

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.540 
let's see if I have a clip in there I do
not<00:04:24.310> but<00:04:24.669> it's<00:04:24.909> just<00:04:25.270> the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
not but it's just the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.180 
not but it's just the
sangria<00:04:25.940> color<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.569> go<00:04:26.780> ahead<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.199> put<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:27.889> up

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
sangria color I go ahead and put that up

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.460 
sangria color I go ahead and put that up
and<00:04:28.430> then<00:04:28.550> blend<00:04:28.849> everything<00:04:29.060> out<00:04:29.509> again<00:04:29.960> then

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
anything because it doesn't even look

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.960 
anything because it doesn't even look

am moving into my falsies which I apply
off<00:04:57.590> camera<00:04:57.860> but<00:04:58.129> they're<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.520> red<00:04:58.879> cherry

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
off camera but they're the red cherry

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.180 
off camera but they're the red cherry
523<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.199> then<00:05:00.919> i'm<00:05:01.039> using<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:02.469> mac<00:05:03.469> handwritten

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
523 and then i'm using a mac handwritten

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.010 
523 and then i'm using a mac handwritten
and<00:05:04.699> a<00:05:04.759> little<00:05:05.030> bit<00:05:05.120> of<00:05:05.180> chocolate<00:05:05.509> from<00:05:05.870> the

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
and a little bit of chocolate from the

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.830 
and a little bit of chocolate from the
tamannah<00:05:06.349> pellet<00:05:06.770> mixed<00:05:07.520> together<00:05:07.669> and<00:05:08.270> i'm

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
tamannah pellet mixed together and i'm

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.529 
tamannah pellet mixed together and i'm
going<00:05:09.199> to<00:05:09.289> smoke<00:05:10.219> that<00:05:10.280> underneath<00:05:10.879> the<00:05:11.419> lower

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
going to smoke that underneath the lower

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.240 
going to smoke that underneath the lower
lash<00:05:11.810> line<00:05:12.080> she<00:05:12.349> had<00:05:12.500> a<00:05:12.530> really<00:05:12.889> deep

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
lash line she had a really deep

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.249 
lash line she had a really deep
chocolate<00:05:13.550> brown<00:05:13.789> under<00:05:14.330> there<00:05:14.509> so<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.050> thought

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
chocolate brown under there so I thought

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.110 
chocolate brown under there so I thought
these<00:05:15.440> two<00:05:15.650> colors<00:05:15.889> were<00:05:16.219> like<00:05:16.460> perfect<00:05:16.879> and

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
these two colors were like perfect and

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.600 
these two colors were like perfect and
then<00:05:17.389> they<00:05:18.169> kind<00:05:18.440> of<00:05:18.530> did<00:05:18.800> like<00:05:18.830> wing<00:05:19.340> it<00:05:19.490> out

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
then they kind of did like wing it out

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.619 
then they kind of did like wing it out
into<00:05:19.909> her<00:05:20.690> outer<00:05:21.560> V<00:05:22.039> on<00:05:22.280> her<00:05:22.639> lid<00:05:22.940> so<00:05:23.300> that's

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:23.629 
into her outer V on her lid so that's

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:26.750 
into her outer V on her lid so that's
what<00:05:23.810> I<00:05:23.840> went<00:05:24.139> ahead<00:05:24.229> and<00:05:24.530> did

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:36.019 

you

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:36.029 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:38.339 

once<00:05:37.029> that's<00:05:37.209> all<00:05:37.360> said<00:05:37.629> and<00:05:37.779> done<00:05:37.869> I'm<00:05:38.169> using

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
once that's all said and done I'm using

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.429 
once that's all said and done I'm using
my<00:05:38.499> L'Oreal<00:05:38.949> extra<00:05:39.639> intense<00:05:40.059> a<00:05:40.360> liner<00:05:40.749> to<00:05:41.079> use

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:41.439 
my L'Oreal extra intense a liner to use

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:45.149 
my L'Oreal extra intense a liner to use
on<00:05:41.709> my<00:05:41.860> lower<00:05:42.039> waterline<00:05:43.889> moving<00:05:44.889> on<00:05:45.009> to

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
on my lower waterline moving on to

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.159 
on my lower waterline moving on to
contour<00:05:45.579> i'm<00:05:45.729> using<00:05:46.059> fawn<00:05:46.299> from<00:05:46.569> Anastasia

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
contour i'm using fawn from Anastasia

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.999 
contour i'm using fawn from Anastasia
Beverly<00:05:47.199> Hills<00:05:47.919> she<00:05:48.309> had<00:05:48.489> a<00:05:48.519> very<00:05:48.939> cool<00:05:49.389> tone

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
Beverly Hills she had a very cool tone

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.649 
Beverly Hills she had a very cool tone
contour<00:05:51.009> so<00:05:51.309> that's<00:05:51.849> why<00:05:52.059> I<00:05:52.089> had<00:05:52.389> went<00:05:52.569> ahead

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
contour so that's why I had went ahead

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:55.739 
contour so that's why I had went ahead
and<00:05:52.899> replicated<00:05:53.969> it<00:05:54.969> was<00:05:55.149> really<00:05:55.449> light<00:05:55.719> but

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:55.749 
and replicated it was really light but

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:57.539 
and replicated it was really light but
you<00:05:56.079> can<00:05:56.229> see<00:05:56.409> that<00:05:56.439> she<00:05:56.860> had<00:05:57.039> a<00:05:57.069> cool<00:05:57.339> tone

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:57.549 
you can see that she had a cool tone

00:05:57.549 --> 00:06:00.689 
you can see that she had a cool tone
contour<00:05:58.149> so<00:05:58.479> I'm<00:05:58.659> just<00:05:58.839> contouring<00:05:59.369> around<00:06:00.369> my

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
contour so I'm just contouring around my

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.239 
contour so I'm just contouring around my
