00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
concealer on my face at all and I've

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
only filled in my brows so I have no

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.160 
only filled in my brows so I have no
makeup<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.730> I'm<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.989> apply

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
makeup on and I'm just going to apply

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.400 
makeup on and I'm just going to apply
this<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.420> careful<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.079> and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
this so just just a careful then and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.240 
this so just just a careful then and
it's<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.739> really<00:00:56.070> liquidy<00:00:56.870> formula<00:00:57.920> if<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:58.980> can

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
it's a really liquidy formula if you can

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.290 
it's a really liquidy formula if you can
see<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.730> literally<00:01:00.300> drops<00:01:00.710> out<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.949> that

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
see it literally drops out like that

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.350 
see it literally drops out like that
it's<00:01:03.300> best<00:01:03.690> well<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.350> shake<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.850> before

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
it's best well to shake this before

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.510 
it's best well to shake this before
using<00:01:06.630> that's<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.560> star<00:01:07.799> person<00:01:08.310> told

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
using that's what the star person told

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.330 
using that's what the star person told
me<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.350> don't<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.710> get<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> liquid

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
me so that you don't just get the liquid

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.870 
me so that you don't just get the liquid
texture<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.740> about<00:01:14.100> three<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.670> four

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
texture so just about three to four

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.240 
texture so just about three to four
drops<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:16.259> I'm<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.920> drop<00:01:17.070> this

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
drops and I'm just going to drop this

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.560 
drops and I'm just going to drop this
all<00:01:17.460> over<00:01:17.580> my<00:01:17.729> face

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
it feels really moisturizing just

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.030 
it feels really moisturizing just
applying<00:03:32.270> it<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:32.630> feeling<00:03:32.960> it<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.530> I'm<00:03:34.010> just

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
applying it and feeling it and I'm just

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:52.750 
applying it and feeling it and I'm just
going<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.430> buff<00:03:34.670> all<00:03:34.850> this<00:03:35.000> in<00:03:35.180> again

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
so I'm done with the second layer of

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.920 
so I'm done with the second layer of
foundation<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.060> I'm<00:03:57.060> actually<00:03:57.480> really

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
foundation and I'm actually really

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.559 
foundation and I'm actually really
loving<00:03:58.920> how<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.550> feels<00:03:59.849> on<00:04:00.090> my<00:04:00.120> skin<00:04:00.209> right

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
loving how this feels on my skin right

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.550 
loving how this feels on my skin right

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
now it feels really lightweight it feels

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.830 
now it feels really lightweight it feels
as<00:04:04.739> if<00:04:04.920> I<00:04:05.069> haven't<00:04:05.250> put<00:04:05.520> on<00:04:05.670> any<00:04:06.030> foundation<00:04:06.720> at

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
as if I haven't put on any foundation at

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.839 
as if I haven't put on any foundation at
all<00:04:06.989> it<00:04:07.349> feels<00:04:07.739> as<00:04:07.920> though<00:04:07.950> I've<00:04:08.280> just<00:04:08.519> put<00:04:08.730> on

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
all it feels as though I've just put on

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.790 
all it feels as though I've just put on
some<00:04:09.120> tinted<00:04:09.360> moisturizer<00:04:10.050> if<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.500> get<00:04:10.650> what

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
some tinted moisturizer if you get what

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.809 
some tinted moisturizer if you get what
I<00:04:10.830> mean

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
I mean

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.890 
I mean
it<00:04:12.480> feels<00:04:13.410> really<00:04:14.130> smooth<00:04:14.640> but<00:04:15.390> it<00:04:15.510> doesn't

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
it feels really smooth but it doesn't

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.780 
it feels really smooth but it doesn't
have<00:04:16.109> that<00:04:16.139> how<00:04:16.980> do<00:04:17.040> we<00:04:17.280> finish<00:04:17.900> like<00:04:18.900> what<00:04:19.200> the

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
have that how do we finish like what the

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.450 
have that how do we finish like what the
Lancome<00:04:20.790> met<00:04:21.180> miracle<00:04:21.720> as<00:04:22.019> well<00:04:22.350> as<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.830> Laura

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
Lancome met miracle as well as the Laura

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.520 
Lancome met miracle as well as the Laura
Mercier<00:04:24.030> tinted<00:04:24.330> moisturizer<00:04:24.930> does<00:04:25.200> for<00:04:25.440> you

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
Mercier tinted moisturizer does for you

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.379 
Mercier tinted moisturizer does for you
those<00:04:26.130> actually<00:04:26.820> do<00:04:27.030> give<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:28.880> nice<00:04:29.880> powdery

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
those actually do give a nice powdery

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.560 
those actually do give a nice powdery
finish<00:04:30.889> that<00:04:31.889> looks<00:04:32.070> pretty<00:04:32.280> matte<00:04:32.580> but<00:04:33.270> this

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
finish that looks pretty matte but this

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.530 
finish that looks pretty matte but this
one<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:34.590> looks<00:04:34.919> pretty<00:04:35.280> matte<00:04:35.550> still<00:04:36.060> but<00:04:36.389> it

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
one it looks pretty matte still but it

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.659 
one it looks pretty matte still but it
doesn't<00:04:36.930> give<00:04:37.169> that<00:04:37.200> powdery<00:04:38.100> finish<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:38.639> I

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
doesn't give that powdery finish so I

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.480 
doesn't give that powdery finish so I
probably<00:04:39.260> would<00:04:40.260> have<00:04:40.290> to<00:04:40.830> set<00:04:41.100> this<00:04:41.280> with

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
probably would have to set this with

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.190 
probably would have to set this with
powder<00:04:41.820> if<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.240> don't<00:04:42.419> want<00:04:42.600> it<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.810> be<00:04:42.960> running

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
powder if I don't want it to be running

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.320 
powder if I don't want it to be running
all<00:04:43.440> over<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.680> place<00:04:43.910> I<00:04:45.470> don't<00:04:46.470> think<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:47.010> need

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
all over the place I don't think I need

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.909 
all over the place I don't think I need
concealer<00:04:48.330> anymore<00:04:48.870> after<00:04:49.350> this<00:04:49.530> because<00:04:49.740> I

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
concealer anymore after this because I

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.920 
concealer anymore after this because I
actually<00:04:50.250> like<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.880> coverage<00:04:51.240> after

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
actually like the coverage after

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.870 
actually like the coverage after
applying<00:04:52.260> two<00:04:52.500> layers<00:04:52.800> of<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.280> it<00:04:53.370> really

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
applying two layers of it and it really

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.000 
applying two layers of it and it really
doesn't<00:04:54.270> feel<00:04:54.540> like<00:04:55.110> it's<00:04:55.320> two<00:04:55.530> layers<00:04:55.740> it

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
doesn't feel like it's two layers it

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.670 
doesn't feel like it's two layers it
feels<00:04:56.310> like<00:04:56.550> I've<00:04:56.760> really<00:04:57.360> just<00:04:57.479> applied<00:04:58.169> like

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
feels like I've really just applied like

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.800 
feels like I've really just applied like
a<00:04:58.740> layer<00:04:59.010> of<00:04:59.160> moisturizer<00:04:59.700> and<00:04:59.940> it<00:05:00.270> has<00:05:00.539> dried

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
a layer of moisturizer and it has dried

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.460 
a layer of moisturizer and it has dried
out<00:05:00.870> already

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
out already

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.850 
out already
it<00:05:01.680> feels<00:05:02.280> very<00:05:02.550> smooth<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:03.510> nice<00:05:03.750> it<00:05:04.500> doesn't

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
it feels very smooth and nice it doesn't

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.250 
it feels very smooth and nice it doesn't
feel<00:05:05.010> sticky<00:05:05.460> at<00:05:05.520> all<00:05:05.640> and<00:05:06.000> I<00:05:06.390> actually<00:05:06.780> like

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
feel sticky at all and I actually like

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.469 
feel sticky at all and I actually like
the<00:05:07.289> liquid<00:05:07.830> consistency<00:05:08.160> of<00:05:08.610> this<00:05:08.880> because

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
the liquid consistency of this because

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.110 
the liquid consistency of this because
it<00:05:10.169> took<00:05:10.380> me<00:05:10.440> a<00:05:10.590> lot<00:05:10.830> faster<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.610> blend<00:05:11.850> it<00:05:11.970> in

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
it took me a lot faster to blend it in

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.380 
it took me a lot faster to blend it in
as<00:05:12.390> compared<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:13.050> my<00:05:13.680> other<00:05:14.390> thicker

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
as compared to my other thicker

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.409 
as compared to my other thicker
foundations<00:05:16.110> so<00:05:16.890> I'm<00:05:17.610> actually<00:05:17.880> pretty<00:05:18.210> happy

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
foundations so I'm actually pretty happy
