running several inches there's a notch

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.130 
running several inches there's a notch
in<00:01:38.400> there<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.909> cut<00:01:39.180> out<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:39.960> can

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
in there you can cut out so you can

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.060 
in there you can cut out so you can
still<00:01:40.380> mount<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.829> servo<00:01:41.100> wench<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:43.079> front

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
still mount a servo wench to the front

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.630 
still mount a servo wench to the front
of<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> truck<00:01:45.500> I'm<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.979> don't<00:01:47.159> run<00:01:47.310> several

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
of the truck I'm I don't run several

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.389 
of the truck I'm I don't run several
inches<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.479> my<00:01:48.659> receiver<00:01:49.560> zip

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
inches so I just have my receiver zip

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.580 
inches so I just have my receiver zip
tied<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.180> don't<00:01:51.540> I'm<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.290> really

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
tied up here I don't I'm not really

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.960 
tied up here I don't I'm not really
worried<00:01:52.979> about<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.159> getting<00:01:53.369> wet<00:01:53.610> because<00:01:53.820> I

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
worried about it getting wet because I

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.700 
worried about it getting wet because I
don't<00:01:54.149> really<00:01:54.299> run<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> water<00:01:55.439> so

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
don't really run it in the water so

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.429 
don't really run it in the water so
that's<00:01:55.799> why<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> don't<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.750> receiver<00:01:57.750> box<00:01:58.049> I

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
that's why I don't have a receiver box I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.429 
that's why I don't have a receiver box I
