00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.550
 welcome to another 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.740
 I would like to have a short tutorial today 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.230
 you the advanced crafting table blog 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.210
 imagine 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.430
 This is the advance crafting table 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.070
 block and is powered by laser 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.070
 And these lasers need power from the picture 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.029
 forces to demonstrations 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.490
 but I have this already here 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.120
 so it could be built up, for example 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.480
 look the engines give the laser 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.870
 Stream and the laser go the rock band 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.440
 the automatic crafting table, so to speak 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.030
 energy i could be here on one side 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.940
 See how much energy crafting 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.760
 recipe is always needed here as well 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:56.950
 a lot is in there and how much right now 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:59.739
 so to speak, here comes her recipe 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.300
 in and down here grabbed the 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.789
 resources for your recipe 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.130
 In this case, the engines are already 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.800
 that is, when the bottom is activated 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.160
 indoors matching resources he will 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.479
 automatically start these and 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.300
 there you can because right with pipe 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.140
 connect and then wherever 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.509
 in leighton in this case in the box 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.110
 what you want to do with it you stop 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.289
 leave 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.599
 you can these laser course to 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.520
 hang walls and you can behind it 

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:34.020
 then put the pension 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:38.170
 so you can do whatever you want 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.240
 and the more lasers there are the more 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.970
 Of course, you get energy like you do 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.530
 here, for example, looks yes and so can 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.640
 you automatic powers 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.620
 let and with it stands 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.470
 they have nothing in the way except 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.030
 This annoying rain everything clear until 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.030
 goodbye
