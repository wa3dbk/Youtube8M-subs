and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox and

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.430 
and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox and
now<00:00:34.440> selling<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.430> wanna<00:00:35.579> sell<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.940> well<00:00:36.440> I

don't<00:01:10.830> understand<00:01:11.369> there's<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.670> lot<00:01:11.820> attitude

what's so great about discovery it's a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.810 
what's so great about discovery it's a

world

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.210 
world
well<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> question<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.680> how<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.070> know

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
well the question is how can you know

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.910 
well the question is how can you know
anything<00:01:32.729> about<00:01:32.820> an<00:01:33.090> extinct<00:01:33.570> ecosystem<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
anything about an extinct ecosystem and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.319 
anything about an extinct ecosystem and
therefore<00:01:35.250> how<00:01:35.369> could<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.579> ever<00:01:35.700> assume<00:01:36.150> that

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
therefore how could you ever assume that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.780 
therefore how could you ever assume that
you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.600> control<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.250> plants

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
you can control it you have plants

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.910 
you can control it you have plants

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
annasmith the building her poisonous you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.800 
annasmith the building her poisonous you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
picked them because they look good but

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.999 
picked them because they look good but
these<00:01:42.960> are<00:01:43.049> aggressive<00:01:43.470> living<00:01:43.770> things<00:01:43.979> that
