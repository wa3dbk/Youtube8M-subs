00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.350
 Good day today I will do a video review 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.889
 ceramic gas burner and another 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.389
 called infrared heater 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.070
 the reason for its acquisition was 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.520
 no electricity for 5 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.500
 days 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.130
 since the only way to heat 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.930
 our house is more electricity 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.290
 in detail the work of the heating pad you will learn from 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.290
 my video 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:44.390
 was he volume of 12 liters refueled i 8 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:46.400
 liters of gas and now write down by 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:53.890
 time on time learning time 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:56.660
 to calculate the gas flow 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:02.210
 according to this burner hot water bottle 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:07.040
 it turns out the Turkish inscription on it and how 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.930
 type nameplate gas edge will find 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:15.229
 immediately complete with gear with 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.399
 the key too which is not necessary to tighten 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.399
 run to look for the key and 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.910
 sealing gum goes on much 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:30.259
 connection use for 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.030
 connect mind balloon connect 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.229
 acquire mind was he immediately 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.909
 connect correctly 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:41.390
 midi parties did not go and all fine 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:45.970
 ready to use here 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:50.900
 box packaging is very burrows boards 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:54.729
 there is an expense on the box here 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:02:01.630
 hard to see turns out to be a half power 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:04.549
 kilowatt 110 grams per hour consumption 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.929
 let's see 110 game for an hour it's pretty 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:15.200
 still interesting and expense heating 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.700
 we have a room somewhere 12 or 16 o'clock 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.120
 the temperature rises by 4 degrees 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.530
 heat pretty comfortable in emergency 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.239
 cases like we have 4 days no 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:32.989
 electricity heated by a beggar therefore 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:34.400
 we bask given a warmer, I do not 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.549
 I know how to celebrate the burner for sure 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.500
 work on the principle I have almost 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.260
 arranges solely on the sides somehow 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.260
 that's weird 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.590
 everywhere hot area 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.599
 ceramics anikin yes I forgot to say that this 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.430
 ceramic goes burner area by 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.900
 on the sides there is a little bit of something 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.540
 gas with places it seems like well there is no 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.790
 Well, like you do not that here it is not 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.140
 this gas burns completely 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:12.659
 I will try to check the other moment 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.379
 burners understand how to be on themselves 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.200
 important note 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.930
 use of the burner should be 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.500
 the rooms are ventilated in our case 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.760
 Here is the window to be 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.909
 sufficient combustion air supply 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.900
 gas 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:34.470
 well, respectively, to carbon monoxide 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.470
 after the collapse of the combustion gas 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.470
 weathered 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:51.709
 the usual match turns out 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:54.870
 we light a match immediately open the floor and 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.680
 present this immediately appears 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:03.780
 blue flame on camera may not be 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.670
 you can see that moment later when pottery 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.880
 slowly being played out on becomes 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.769
 red is created on red and 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.230
 pretty warm very powerful 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.209
 warms up to hold on such 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.269
 distance as now i keep i no longer 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.030
 Iâ€™ll get this distance 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.220
 I can normally well so as not to burn yourself 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.950
 feel no comfortable 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.380
 here's the temperature 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:35.250
 gas burner in case of emergency 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:42.260
 can warm you in the winter when outside 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:45.150
 minus 11 degrees and in the room at the time 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.180
 even when there was no you burner was 14 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:53.570
 degrees of heat in this room and in another 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.570
 thanks for ordering room 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.180
 light so we did not appear somewhere 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.670
 lost our light has gained a balloon 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.560
 small for 12 liters as a rule he has 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:24.910
 8 liters of gasoline aitl 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:35.310
 and for the room we have somewhere 12 or 16 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:35.310
 squares accurately measured posting
