00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.510
 there are very good and tufah wanted 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.119
 commenting and I bring you again a bird 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.000
 in this case how do you like to 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.550
 sack with the mp 7 with silencer and fire 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.220
 fast playing headquarters a 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.320
 game that was taking me some weapon 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.899
 of gold and how I have more than bad 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.220
 l res are so heavy as people 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.439
 this one was pretty camper and there and 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.970
 I said well let's touch the eggs 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.680
 he also touches eggs even comfortable 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.350
 so this one that came out is not 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.399
 also that with the mp 5 is 4 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.050
 general in dome and because of impiety 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.269
 Ivy mp7 so you can see it's a 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.719
 armed, that is, it removes me from a specialist in 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.890
 nothing is a very short gameplay either 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.660
 that is a new faith be excessively 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.120
 rapid that is in general not 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.829
 can catch answered from that and good 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.629
 I want to leave aside the barracks 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.829
 general and that's because we have to double it 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.929
 take me out with the clouds regarding the 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.579
 general and just brick so 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.650
 good I'll leave to make a small 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.500
 explanation of the backups of why 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.300
 this mode is better to remove the moa 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.250
 etcetera man depends is he is a good 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.420
 way to move it out more than by the 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.370
 not good time but I do not want to start 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.070
 now to go into details 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.900
 and let's limit ourselves a little to talk 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.130
 about him about the gameplay is not a 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.460
 implied as I told you I was 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.500
 playing with a small group 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.229
 I was taking out a golden weapon and what 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.270
 said that what he did before was not 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.369
 pretty campillos and well I'm going to 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.100
 practice a little bit with the mp 7 this 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.450
 it was common practice is because I have 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.159
 thought about doing and trying to make a 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.350
 triple mor the other day there was a video of 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.300
 an American who plays fish was a 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.430
 triple more also confirmed with the mp 7 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.280
 that is a savage because you are going to 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.280
 confirm to a a triple mob is a 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.430
 last fruit is very difficult to 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.380
 to do because there is very little time 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.360
 even a double is going to confirm it's already 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.119
 very rare to see then a triple imagine 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.070
 the guy is called nbr france I think it 's a 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.810
 American who also comments a lot 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.159
 well the game plays have new with 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.869
 all the weapons of the game I believe the day is 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.640
 one last as a game to see him to me 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.209
 When I see him as a soldier, I love him 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.010
 because if you think I'm good then 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.989
 he is three times better than me so that 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.340
 you make an idea I do not want either 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.950
 will promote or anything because he has a 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.209
 bunch of suvs and all that but let's go 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.239
 I wanted to take an example, for example 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.110
 to try to take out a triple world and 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.400
 I will try to get us in fourth in general 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.140
 because as it is generally easier 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.550
 and since it is for example the domain 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.989
 I will not try to make it more confirmed 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.130
 because not stick me I get rooms that 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.750
 they have to be pretty bad for 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.700
 there is not one more triple and my companions 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.610
 do not pick up veneers then it's not plan either 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.319
 of that then this was a job of 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.230
 practice I do not even think it 's in the 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.670
 that the raf class 99 and wore the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.489
 throwing knife and you see he threw it by 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.980
 I already say is and the rooster sings as he hears 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.720
 that more ive and as I said the other time 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.910
 it is an implied that is a yes is an ampli 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.530
 short or is a cut item for the 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.959
 theme that the fourth general 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.730
 lasts a lot and the beginning and in that saying 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.900
 I died good is not that I died a lot 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.489
 but I was a little disgusted 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.980
 play with bad weapons against these people 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.780
 and well, I thought it was a little 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.300
 of practice with the mp 7 here you see it is 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.950
 a weapon that is perfect I said it yesterday 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.990
 I also carry it with rapid fire or 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.490
 that kills twice as soon as you get 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.690
 speciesists in the scope so what 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.680
 we removed you have already had the sample 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.180
 quite fast for the issue of chasms not 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.620
 a normal woman and is on time 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.690
 not too fast too fast 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:31.780
 quick but hey pretty good has been 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.340
 I feel and beak seconds 200 seconds by 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.230
 there softened and as I said the other time 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.570
 I'm going to leave the gameplay until I'm 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.670
 Kill that I do not think much will happen here 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.920
 I ask you the answer again and it is 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.330
 when here we see the risk of carrying 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.280
 fast fire not with weapons not carrying 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.630
 dual that the bullets were removed very 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.520
 fast here you agree 9 with 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.370
 silencer I do not know why not not 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.870
 he killed here a piece of the gauze that is 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.850
 philippa and if I stay what it cost 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.820
 diary that my mother has passed that the 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.410
 gaza would move this and good here 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.380
 trying to hit me with the guy is wheat 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.540
 it's gone from your face and without waiting 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.070
 that you like and there I think you like 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.960
 this type of fashion evidently the 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.120
 same play with this with being more than 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.860
 with a heavy like licks 60 with thermal 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.850
 or the laughs so it's more fun like that 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.350
 how good the people of today 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.700
 I hope you liked that it implies 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.420
 do not vote I like favorites and 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.420
 subscribe so far
