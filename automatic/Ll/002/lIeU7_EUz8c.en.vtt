00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
way I don't know this for sure it looks

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.289 
way I don't know this for sure it looks
as<00:01:07.590> though<00:01:07.619> they've<00:01:08.100> decreased<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.270> amount

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
of damage that weapons do so it takes

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.260

more hits to get stuff done but one of

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.570 
more hits to get stuff done but one of
the<00:01:15.509> things<00:01:15.810> about<00:01:15.960> Bad<00:01:16.229> Company<00:01:16.470> 2<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.310> a

that<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.580> netcode<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.390> hit<00:01:24.570> detection<00:01:24.869> was

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
that the netcode and hit detection was

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.719 
that the netcode and hit detection was

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
absolutely awful part of the reason that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.210 
absolutely awful part of the reason that
you<00:01:30.240> couldn't<00:01:30.659> kill<00:01:31.380> someone<00:01:31.829> very<00:01:32.009> quickly

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
you couldn't kill someone very quickly

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.920

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
and Bad Company 2 is because half your

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.140 
and Bad Company 2 is because half your
bullets<00:01:34.290> hit<00:01:34.590> them<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.430> nothing<00:01:35.759> happened

bullets hit them but nothing happened

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.640 
bullets hit them but nothing happened
because<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.450> hitbox<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.930> actually<00:01:37.229> trailed

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
because the hitbox is actually trailed

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.120 
because the hitbox is actually trailed
then<00:01:38.430> characters<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:40.110> I've<00:01:40.590> seen<00:01:40.890> in

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
then characters and if I've seen in

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.370 
then characters and if I've seen in
battlefield<00:01:41.549> 4<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:42.299> they've<00:01:42.509> decreased<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
battlefield 4 that they've decreased the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.960 
battlefield 4 that they've decreased the
damage<00:01:43.710> model<00:01:44.040> which<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.340> which<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.700> good<00:01:44.939> I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
damage model which I which is good I

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.550 
damage model which I which is good I
think<00:01:45.119> there<00:01:45.450> should<00:01:45.720> be<00:01:45.750> more<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.259> an<00:01:46.350> ability

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
think there should be more of an ability

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.230 
think there should be more of an ability
to<00:01:46.799> escape<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.460> I'm<00:01:48.180> seeing<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.610> not<00:01:50.610> much

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
to escape and I'm seeing a not much

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.039 
to escape and I'm seeing a not much
improved<00:01:51.810> netcode<00:01:52.409> from<00:01:52.799> battlefield<00:01:53.310> 3<00:01:53.369> I'm

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
improved netcode from battlefield 3 I'm

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.420 
improved netcode from battlefield 3 I'm
seeing<00:01:55.049> also<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.920> characters<00:01:56.310> are

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
seeing also that the characters are

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.940 
seeing also that the characters are
twitchy<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.750> little<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.259> little<00:01:58.409> off-kilter

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
twitchy and a little a little off-kilter

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.920 
twitchy and a little a little off-kilter
but<00:01:59.280> that's<00:01:59.399> okay<00:01:59.820> that's<00:02:00.240> okay<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.689> still

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
but that's okay that's okay it still

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.959 
but that's okay that's okay it still
it's<00:02:01.110> probably<00:02:01.290> an<00:02:01.740> alpha<00:02:02.100> early<00:02:02.430> beta<00:02:02.610> build

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
it's probably an alpha early beta build

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.639 
it's probably an alpha early beta build
and<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:04.020> what<00:02:04.200> they've<00:02:04.320> done<00:02:04.500> with

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
and I like what they've done with

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.499 
and I like what they've done with
evolution<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> ship<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:06.030> paracel

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
evolution I like the ship on paracel

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.010

talked about this a lot and I hope that

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.350 
talked about this a lot and I hope that

he advises his opinions below but it's

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.590 
he advises his opinions below but it's
all<00:02:17.570> about<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:18.170> execution<00:02:18.670> if<00:02:19.670> all<00:02:20.150> we<00:02:20.360> get

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
they have said they were going to do it

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.400 
they have said they were going to do it
because<00:02:30.440> evolution<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.310> me<00:02:31.520> means<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.910> level

like<00:02:48.890> LEvolution<00:02:49.340> for<00:02:49.850> me<00:02:50.030> should<00:02:50.320> encompass

like LEvolution for me should encompass

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.260 
like LEvolution for me should encompass
the<00:02:51.470> entire<00:02:51.860> map<00:02:52.190> in<00:02:52.370> some<00:02:52.610> ways<00:02:52.820> suddenly

in a different and more fundamental way

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.770 
in a different and more fundamental way
than<00:02:59.360> they<00:02:59.510> have<00:02:59.720> in<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.990> past<00:03:01.060> my<00:03:02.060> issue<00:03:02.270> is<00:03:02.450> I

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
don't see it happening because dice

so many situations that it's it would be

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
silly not to use it and if dice has done

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.850 
silly not to use it and if dice has done
their<00:03:47.330> job<00:03:47.660> there<00:03:47.959> should<00:03:48.170> be<00:03:48.260> enough<00:03:48.560> variety

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
their job there should be enough variety

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.270

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
and enough effective variety that we're

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.370 
and enough effective variety that we're
not<00:03:52.430> so<00:03:52.730> worried<00:03:53.030> about<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:53.270> the<00:03:53.900> back<00:03:54.140> tile

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
not so worried about that the back tile

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.600 
not so worried about that the back tile
evolution<00:03:54.950> I<00:03:55.810> think<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:57.560> dice<00:03:58.040> is<00:03:58.280> going<00:03:58.520> to

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
evolution I think that dice is going to

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.480 
evolution I think that dice is going to
come<00:03:58.790> as<00:03:58.970> close<00:03:59.209> as<00:03:59.570> possible<00:03:59.630> to<00:04:00.590> offering

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
come as close as possible to offering

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.810 
come as close as possible to offering
the<00:04:01.760> LEvolution<00:04:02.270> they've<00:04:02.870> espoused<00:04:03.320> and<00:04:03.820> I

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
the LEvolution they've espoused and I

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.420 
the LEvolution they've espoused and I
think<00:04:05.300> that<00:04:06.200> we<00:04:06.709> haven't<00:04:07.040> seen<00:04:07.220> everything

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
think that we haven't seen everything

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.220 
think that we haven't seen everything
they<00:04:07.670> have<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:07.880> show<00:04:08.030> us<00:04:08.209> yet<00:04:08.450> but<00:04:09.050> what<00:04:09.200> I

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
they have to show us yet but what I

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.920 
they have to show us yet but what I
think<00:04:09.620> is<00:04:09.800> most<00:04:10.190> important<00:04:10.970> for<00:04:11.180> us<00:04:11.480> in<00:04:11.900> the

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
think is most important for us in the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.530 
think is most important for us in the
coming<00:04:12.380> months<00:04:12.730> that<00:04:13.730> when<00:04:13.910> they'll<00:04:14.150> filled

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
coming months that when they'll filled

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.770 
coming months that when they'll filled
for<00:04:14.870> releases<00:04:15.620> we<00:04:16.489> will<00:04:16.669> be<00:04:16.790> in<00:04:17.000> for<00:04:17.390> a<00:04:17.419> shock

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
for releases we will be in for a shock

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.930 
for releases we will be in for a shock
I<00:04:18.870> hope<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.769> that<00:04:19.920> shock<00:04:20.370> is<00:04:20.670> that<00:04:20.700> the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
I hope that that shock is that the

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.379 
I hope that that shock is that the
Bethel<00:04:21.600> evolution<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:23.250> changes<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.150> the

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
Bethel evolution and the changes and the

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.710 
Bethel evolution and the changes and the
improvements<00:04:24.990> we've<00:04:25.139> seen<00:04:25.440> are<00:04:26.190> so<00:04:26.940> much<00:04:27.450> more

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
improvements we've seen are so much more

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.440 
improvements we've seen are so much more
in<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.620> final<00:04:28.950> product<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.610> we're<00:04:30.210> just

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
in the final product that we're just

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.230 
in the final product that we're just
blown<00:04:31.200> away
