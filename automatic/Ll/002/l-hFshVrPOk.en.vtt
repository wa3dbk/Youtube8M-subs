00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.240
 All humans have the instincts only 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.970
 to help each other when there is one 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.610
 Hiker in the mountains leads astray 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.240
 to do a search 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.260
 when an earthquake destroys a city 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.789
 send people from all over the world 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.469
 alternative delivery 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.430
 this instinct is found in everyone 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.240
 Culture 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.240
 without exception 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.850
 Registered early today at 4:30 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.770
 our satellites storm in the 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.820
 near the three stations on the 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.820
 market is and became more and more intense 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:00.359
 and we had to stop the missions 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:04.190
 but during the evacuation can 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.190
 astronaut mark matney around the world 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.800
 I attach an official logbook to mine 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:22.259
 name is markwort and I'm still alive 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.509
 obviously i could be the nasa 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.420
 still contact my flight 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.950
 but it would take four years anyway 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.990
 until another manned mission 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.140
 reached and this station is only for 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.030
 31 days in the face of this 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.920
 prospects remains only an option 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.520
 I have to deal with science from the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.520
 pull shit 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.040
 ok we calculate it by I have one 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.079
 Finding food for four years on 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.050
 Build here on a planet on the 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.340
 nothing grows 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.600
 but if i can not make it the nasa 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.020
 It does not matter to contact 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.020
 more 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.130
 Lawyers for information we have 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.270
 a video message to the whole crew 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.270
 get game 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.020
 markwort is still alive and I answer 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.940
 Do not ask yet we have him 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.950
 left behind 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.569
 Let's get our man the NASA has that 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.580
 that's what we're talking about here 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.930
 talking is pure moth 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.270
 and if we do not have the supplies 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.800
 we can destroy it 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.920
 we die the gravitation wizard 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.920
 we 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.240
 that is the universe it does not cooperate 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.240
 I guarantee you at any point 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.200
 everything just goes wrong 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.250
 and then they say that's it 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.150
 this is my end 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.659
 is it possible that he still lives the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.659
 marsianer
