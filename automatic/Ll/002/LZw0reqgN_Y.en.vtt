and very naturally straight the rollers
come<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.149> stand<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:54.989> actually<00:00:55.410> get<00:00:55.800> 12

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
come on a stand and you actually get 12

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.130 
come on a stand and you actually get 12
of<00:00:56.309> them<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.940> swap<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.539> out<00:00:57.750> as<00:00:57.989> you

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
of them so you can swap one out as you

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.930 
of them so you can swap one out as you
put<00:00:58.350> one<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.739> if<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.980> need<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> use<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> bunch<00:00:59.730> I

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
put one in if you need to use a bunch I

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.029 
put one in if you need to use a bunch I
can<00:01:00.600> get<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> full<00:01:01.020> head<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.230> curls<00:01:01.620> with<00:01:01.829> only

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
can get a full head of curls with only

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.399 
can get a full head of curls with only
six<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.699> very<00:01:02.940> rarely<00:01:03.090> need<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.899> tap<00:01:04.229> into

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
six so I very rarely need to tap into

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.370 
six so I very rarely need to tap into
the<00:01:04.949> other<00:01:05.100> six<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.150> they<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.360> heat<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.900> very

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the other six but they do heat up very

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.590 
the other six but they do heat up very
quickly<00:01:07.680> within<00:01:08.189> two<00:01:08.580> minutes<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.240> it

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
quickly within two minutes or so so it

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.170 
quickly within two minutes or so so it
is<00:01:09.630> feasible<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.530> could<00:01:10.770> put<00:01:11.400> all<00:01:11.610> 12<00:01:11.820> in

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
is feasible that you could put all 12 in

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.810 
is feasible that you could put all 12 in
in<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:13.110> sitting<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.740> not<00:01:13.860> use<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.460> lot<00:01:14.520> of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
in one sitting and not use up a lot of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.510 
in one sitting and not use up a lot of
time<00:01:15.060> they<00:01:15.659> also<00:01:15.840> come<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.560> twelve<00:01:17.159> Clips

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
like I normally do in the morning I just

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.010 
like I normally do in the morning I just
separate<00:01:42.960> I'm<00:01:43.649> gonna<00:01:43.829> take<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.430> folder<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
separate I'm gonna take one folder and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.160 
separate I'm gonna take one folder and
I'm<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.770> start<00:01:47.189> at<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> top<00:01:47.869> wrap<00:01:48.869> my

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
I'm going to start at the top wrap my

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.050 
I'm going to start at the top wrap my
hair<00:01:49.909> around<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.270> roller<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.100> then<00:01:53.100> roll<00:01:53.790> it

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
hair around the roller and then roll it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.249 
hair around the roller and then roll it
downward<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.390> looks<00:01:57.630> just<00:01:58.049> like

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
downward like this so it looks just like

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:58.910 
downward like this so it looks just like
this

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
this

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.789 
this
the<00:01:59.670> rollers<00:01:59.969> are<00:02:00.210> hot<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:00.990> think<00:02:01.320> become

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
the rollers are hot but I think become

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.969 
the rollers are hot but I think become
used<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.340> working<00:02:02.939> with<00:02:02.969> them<00:02:03.360> quickly<00:02:04.229> you

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
used to working with them quickly you

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
every single time I'm going to do this

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.670 
every single time I'm going to do this
in<00:02:19.790> real<00:02:20.000> time<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.599> show<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.840> how<00:02:20.930> quick<00:02:21.470> this

in real time to show you how quick this

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.860 
in real time to show you how quick this
is<00:02:21.739> normally<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.430> would<00:02:22.640> do<00:02:22.819> some<00:02:23.060> stopping<00:02:23.450> and

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
is normally I would do some stopping and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.229 
is normally I would do some stopping and
starting<00:02:24.189> keep<00:02:25.189> this<00:02:25.310> video<00:02:25.519> moving<00:02:26.030> along

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
starting keep this video moving along

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.449 
starting keep this video moving along
quickly<00:02:26.510> but<00:02:26.900> because<00:02:27.590> this<00:02:27.739> is<00:02:27.799> such<00:02:28.099> a<00:02:28.129> fast

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
quickly but because this is such a fast

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.449 
quickly but because this is such a fast
process<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.840> look<00:02:29.959> it<00:02:30.079> to<00:02:30.230> see<00:02:30.500> how<00:02:31.250> it's

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
process you look it to see how it's

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.490 
process you look it to see how it's
super<00:02:31.879> simple<00:02:32.379> this<00:02:33.379> is<00:02:35.140> all<00:02:36.140> right<00:02:36.230> I'm<00:02:36.349> going

super simple this is all right I'm going

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.819 
super simple this is all right I'm going
to<00:02:36.560> take<00:02:36.739> this<00:02:36.980> top<00:02:37.569> back<00:02:38.569> section<00:02:39.349> it's<00:02:39.500> about

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
to take this top back section it's about

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.960 
to take this top back section it's about
an<00:02:40.430> inch<00:02:41.420> thick<00:02:41.829> or<00:02:42.829> so<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.579> I'll<00:02:43.730> take

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
an inch thick or so and I'll take

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.930 
an inch thick or so and I'll take
another<00:02:44.000> curler<00:02:44.780> this<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.769> my<00:02:45.950> fourth<00:02:46.370> curler

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
another curler this is my fourth curler

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.539 
another curler this is my fourth curler
it<00:02:47.090> reached<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.870> top<00:02:48.109> and<00:02:48.560> I'm<00:02:49.340> going<00:02:49.459> to

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
it reached to the top and I'm going to

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.619 
it reached to the top and I'm going to
wind<00:02:49.909> it<00:02:50.239> down<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.079> base<00:02:51.349> of<00:02:51.379> my<00:02:51.799> head

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
wind it down to the base of my head

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.720 
wind it down to the base of my head
quickly<00:02:53.680> making<00:02:54.680> sure<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.099> ends<00:02:55.310> are<00:02:55.519> tucked

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
quickly making sure the ends are tucked

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.160 
quickly making sure the ends are tucked
in<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.389> caught<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.139> they<00:02:57.260> can<00:02:57.439> be<00:02:57.560> curled<00:02:59.170> and

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
in and caught so they can be curled and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.629 
in and caught so they can be curled and
then<00:03:00.500> I'm<00:03:00.620> going<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:00.799> take<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.340> middle

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
then I'm going to take the middle

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.500 
then I'm going to take the middle
section<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.420> my<00:03:02.540> hair<00:03:02.569> here<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.730> I'm<00:03:05.030> going<00:03:05.329> to

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
section of my hair here and I'm going to

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.960 
section of my hair here and I'm going to
take<00:03:05.810> my<00:03:06.170> second-to-last<00:03:06.739> color<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.700> fifth
