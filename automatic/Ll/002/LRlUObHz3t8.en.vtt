00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello one more time how are you all 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.060
 kids here is by and commenting is 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.710
 one more gameplay of the call of duty goes I 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.599
 I bring a gameplay of a new way of 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.099
 Nor is it game of the other world 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.380
 it has simply been spoken in this way 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.089
 game or like inside what's inside 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.670
 of what is this game mode that 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.170
 now it has what it is I have done 21 7 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.510
 a 21 7 that the truth the best of the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.580
 game and 21-7 for this the truth is 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.990
 which is quite acceptable of had in 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.060
 account what is the game mode is called 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.710
 hunted as you have read in the title and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.080
 it's a new game mode the truth that 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.369
 he decides to start with enough bolt 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.360
 Play the truth that I love not 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.250
 because they are not typical 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.930
 we find we always find all 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.750
 comes a little always always good 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.930
 a little variation of changes and that's 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.180
 a game mode in which we are good 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.489
 two teams logically 6 against 6 and 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.660
 we all started with gun then what 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.910
 it will happened along the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.350
 departure is going to be coming the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.809
 helicopters that release packages of 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.969
 help on the map but they are not packages of 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.539
 help with streaks and nothing similar are 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.800
 help packages with weapons and weapons if 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.870
 We arrived without ammunition to recharge 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.540
 you have your weapon with your charger 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.950
 main and until you found it 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.240
 put this as many times as I want to 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.880
 example he took the shotgun and returned to 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.200
 come to replace and I have married this 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.640
 they are pretty light machine gun 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.270
 funny that looks almost like a submachine gun 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.590
 of these fat and heavy but not and as 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.670
 You see here I started to distribute a lot 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.320
 fabric or the truth is that this weapon 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.090
 I was pretty good at some I tried it 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.010
 in the multiplayer to see how 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.660
 good when I find myself against someone 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.400
 better with an assault rifle is not going to 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.650
 go very well but as you can see it is the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.300
 I decided to take it because it was pretty good 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.520
 since it has a pretty large charger 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.740
 and as you can see I can go refilling weapons 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.850
 from the soil constantly what I do not 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.440
 agreement is if I can have exactly 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.360
 two but good too 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.280
 this is the game with two courses 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.630
 throw and every time they kill you 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.490
 you reappear with the gun until 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.119
 you pick up a weapon or soil 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.680
 you recover this from the box and as you see 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.660
 here I started to shoot like crazy 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.820
 killed anyone and my mother returned with the 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.200
 pipe nothing I'm already lost starts that 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.670
 this knife please do not tell me that 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.500
 I did not give him there because I think that 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.410
 I gave him and when he killed me I said 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.780
 Petite pugs but good is 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.800
 what there is and is a new game that good 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.640
 If you have not tried, you can try it 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.950
 because the truth is that it 's pretty 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.900
 fun of 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.370
 / has enough because the other ones 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.170
 fixed here with my pistolita I come by 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.269
 behind and the real gun until the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.310
 gun runs out of ammunition so that 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.349
 You shall see what will be fixed 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.620
 pretty pretty and that's a way of 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.989
 game where you are all the time 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.030
 picking up new weapons and that and every 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.090
 low as it tells you every time 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.260
 you kill someone is a point that eats 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.640
 is added to your team and as you see then the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.590
 final scoring limit is like if 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.599
 it was split by teams that are 75 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.840
 low we ended up winning by quite 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.220
 beating and the thing is to do it right 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.920
 this game mode simply be of the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.200
 first to pick up a gun and for alante 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.890
 it's like you see only every time I take 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.870
 a weapon 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.239
 I let go of the one I already had so 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.769
 so much I can be so he follows me 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.019
 I can take all the weapons 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.519
 that I want it from the package helps and 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.630
 leave my colleagues with nothing 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.950
 what will be foolish because the only thing 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.099
 that would serve so that we will lose 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.750
 let's lose or if I am one of the last 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.370
 so there's also I can catch more and 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.900
 so the enemy stays like this without weapons 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.130
 although good maybe after what 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.959
 can pick up a single now that what 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.330
 I'm thinking but they are released enough 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.310
 help packages for all 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.900
 so it's good enough what 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.490
 I can play this is fun because it's 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.500
 something different, not that you have to win 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.030
 a little bit of life and they will always see 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.640
 the people who are going to run around and claver 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.560
 It has knives but well 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.300
 not many problems and always 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.400
 it appears that that with two two knives 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.290
 throwing and with a kind of grenade 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.730
 it has arrived here good how nice that if 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.500
 this one and go down this one too and you 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.090
 we cut off the head and this mayor 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.280
 we throw the knife we ​​fail we go to 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.500
 throw we do not throw we give not us 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.630
 we throw but we kill him that the truth and 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.490
 good feels this very stable that 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.050
 It is not only parties, nor is it 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.610
 a lot of advice is a bit talking about 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.080
 this way a game in case not yet what 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.450
 had tasted we had not even been 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.890
 fixed who knows if you have fixed us and 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.480
 every time you kill people as you see 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.980
 they also give me advantages or now 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.690
 get the hunter advantage that 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.550
 while he pointed as faster and good 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.900
 here touches the time that total or that is 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.550
 half an hour trying to stay at this 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.050
 little man that by the way there seems to be 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.490
 he had given but good every time 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.540
 that you kill one I think it 's give you a 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.890
 streak can be because now I'm finished 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.600
 from to red another although I think now 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.880
 I'm going to die or not come, I'm going to kill one 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.290
 more to simulate a blanquita streak since 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.359
 let's leave me they're going to leave the block 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.510
 fixed but you know fixed since 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.870
 You know how to give a liking to favorites that 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.580
 forever 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.199
 helps me a lot here I kill myself with a 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.960
 pipe that shame pablo you can not do 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.460
 that please do not be so stupid and nothing 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.389
 the game is about to end not 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.280
 I remember if I make the definitive withdrawal 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.199
 but I hope you enjoyed this 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.460
 small informational gameplay 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.380
 I hope that you pass a position of kids 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.729
 as always the diego and I'll let you finish 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.199
 the last 10 seconds of gameplay for 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.729
 do not put me in past a two-year course 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.889
 kids care a lot to go up is if not 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.490
 you have done already until then 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.490
 God
