00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.789
 making an analysis that in one of two 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.550
 images that the developers of 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.220

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.429

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.229
 image here and here as you can 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.949
 see the water is a different color 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:37.079
 People are kind of fucking like that. 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.870
 What a great show. 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.629
 look only when the swamp begins to color the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.210

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.039

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.609

 and they also said that the distance 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.429
 For you to see, it's like 1 km 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.470
 will be much better in the distance and a 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.420
 processor will be much better then 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.290
