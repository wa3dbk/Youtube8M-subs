its<00:02:02.590> blue<00:02:02.829> color<00:02:03.130> which<00:02:03.670> will<00:02:03.850> make<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.119> easier

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
its blue color which will make it easier

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.330 
its blue color which will make it easier
to<00:02:04.689> distinguish<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.409> model<00:02:05.770> from<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.130> mold

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
to distinguish the model from the mold

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.480 
to distinguish the model from the mold
we<00:02:07.210> weigh<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:07.750> mix<00:02:07.960> our<00:02:08.140> material<00:02:08.590> in<00:02:08.800> this

finally<00:02:25.630> we<00:02:25.810> are<00:02:25.840> ready<00:02:25.960> to<00:02:26.290> pour<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.560> repro

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100

in the mold cavity

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.080 
in the mold cavity
notice<00:02:29.170> how<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.410> thin<00:02:29.770> viscosity<00:02:29.980> allows<00:02:30.820> for

notice how the thin viscosity allows for

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.210 
notice how the thin viscosity allows for

repro<00:04:03.780> one<00:04:04.050> like<00:04:04.590> repro<00:04:05.010> NS<00:04:05.400> is<00:04:05.610> non-settling

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
repro one like repro NS is non-settling

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.850 
repro one like repro NS is non-settling
meaning<00:04:07.140> that<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:07.380> does<00:04:07.500> not<00:04:07.650> require

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
meaning that it does not require

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.600 
meaning that it does not require
mechanical<00:04:08.700> agitation<00:04:09.440> we<00:04:10.440> measure<00:04:10.650> 260

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
mechanical agitation we measure 260

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.540 
mechanical agitation we measure 260
grams<00:04:11.640> of<00:04:12.060> Part<00:04:12.270> A<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.860> 260<00:04:13.860> grams<00:04:13.890> of<00:04:14.280> Part<00:04:14.490> B

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
grams of Part A and 260 grams of Part B

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.210 
grams of Part A and 260 grams of Part B
and<00:04:14.880> mix<00:04:15.450> them<00:04:15.630> together<00:04:15.780> then<00:04:16.709> we<00:04:16.859> pour<00:04:17.130> the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
and mix them together then we pour the

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.150 
and mix them together then we pour the
mixture<00:04:17.489> in<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:17.940> new<00:04:18.090> Cup

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
mixture in a new Cup

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.129 
mixture in a new Cup
finally<00:04:21.160> we<00:04:21.489> pour<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.910> repro<00:04:22.270> into<00:04:22.750> our<00:04:22.900> mold

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
finally we pour the repro into our mold

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.800 
finally we pour the repro into our mold
again<00:04:23.889> we<00:04:24.100> pour<00:04:24.370> slowly<00:04:24.700> in<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.150> narrow<00:04:25.419> stream

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
again we pour slowly in a narrow stream

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.510 
again we pour slowly in a narrow stream
in<00:04:26.020> order<00:04:26.200> to<00:04:26.410> make<00:04:26.560> sure<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.770> material<00:04:27.040> flows

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
in order to make sure the material flows

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.670 
in order to make sure the material flows
easily<00:04:27.970> into<00:04:28.300> all<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.169> highly<00:04:29.470> detailed

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
easily into all of the highly detailed

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.590 
easily into all of the highly detailed
areas<00:04:31.440> once<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.650> repro<00:04:33.040> cures<00:04:33.400> we<00:04:33.910> use<00:04:34.120> wedges

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
areas once the repro cures we use wedges

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.270 
areas once the repro cures we use wedges
to<00:04:34.750> lift<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.110> cured<00:04:35.350> part<00:04:35.620> from<00:04:35.860> our<00:04:36.010> mold

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
to lift the cured part from our mold

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.190 
to lift the cured part from our mold
notice<00:04:37.150> how<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.450> de<00:04:37.570> mold<00:04:37.780> cleanly<00:04:38.350> and<00:04:38.500> easily

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.720 

finally<00:04:42.200> we<00:04:42.590> remove<00:04:42.920> the<00:04:43.070> bolts<00:04:43.370> from<00:04:43.580> our

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
finally we remove the bolts from our

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.570 
finally we remove the bolts from our
part

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
part

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.149 
part
our<00:04:45.900> mold<00:04:46.900> is<00:04:47.080> now<00:04:47.319> ready<00:04:47.620> to<00:04:47.800> be<00:04:47.919> put<00:04:48.129> back

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
our mold is now ready to be put back

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.639 
our mold is now ready to be put back
into<00:04:48.580> service
