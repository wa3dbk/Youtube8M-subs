00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
so you got just enough clearance over

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.450 
so you got just enough clearance over
your<00:02:39.390> head<00:02:39.510> couple<00:02:39.900> windows<00:02:40.130> looks<00:02:41.130> like<00:02:41.310> we

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
could probably put a window back there I

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.240 
could probably put a window back there I
imagine<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.910> windows<00:02:45.150> are<00:02:45.300> all<00:02:45.420> recycled

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250
