techniques<00:00:56.830> very<00:00:57.370> important<00:00:57.850> we<00:00:58.300> still<00:00:58.510> got<00:00:58.660> a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
techniques very important we still got a

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.990 
techniques very important we still got a
number<00:00:58.990> of<00:00:59.050> players<00:00:59.830> either<00:01:00.160> quite<00:01:00.550> young<00:01:00.790> and

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
number of players either quite young and

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.280 
number of players either quite young and
this<00:01:01.150> actually<00:01:01.570> probably<00:01:01.870> missed<00:01:02.110> some

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
this actually probably missed some

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.720 
this actually probably missed some
development<00:01:02.770> coming<00:01:02.920> through<00:01:03.160> the<00:01:03.280> academies

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
development coming through the academies

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.850 
development coming through the academies
or<00:01:03.910> teams<00:01:04.120> so<00:01:04.360> we<00:01:04.629> still<00:01:05.140> take<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.440> time<00:01:05.620> or<00:01:05.800> in

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
or teams so we still take the time or in

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.160 
or teams so we still take the time or in
a<00:01:05.920> way<00:01:06.040> to<00:01:06.210> push<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.360> technique<00:01:07.780> over

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
a way to push the technique over

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.500 
a way to push the technique over
anything<00:01:08.530> else<00:01:08.740> we<00:01:09.040> don't<00:01:09.220> lift<00:01:09.370> heavy<00:01:09.510> given

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
anything else we don't lift heavy given

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.490 
anything else we don't lift heavy given
the<00:01:10.600> volume<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.080> nature<00:01:11.350> of<00:01:11.380> our

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
the volume and the nature of our

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.920 
the volume and the nature of our
training<00:01:11.890> so<00:01:12.060> technique<00:01:13.060> is<00:01:13.210> very<00:01:13.330> important

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
training so technique is very important

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.040 
training so technique is very important
I<00:01:14.700> repeat<00:01:15.700> a<00:01:15.729> lot<00:01:16.150> of<00:01:16.270> things<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.540> Pena<00:01:16.840> the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
I repeat a lot of things to Pena the

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.420 
I repeat a lot of things to Pena the
individual<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.650> and<00:01:17.920> some<00:01:18.100> of<00:01:18.190> them<00:01:18.280> are<00:01:18.400> very

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
individual is and some of them are very

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.190 
individual is and some of them are very
good<00:01:18.790> listener<00:01:19.120> so<00:01:19.300> you<00:01:19.390> keep<00:01:19.570> on<00:01:19.720> saying<00:01:20.020> it

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
good listener so you keep on saying it

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.020 
good listener so you keep on saying it
and<00:01:20.410> repeating<00:01:20.979> it<00:01:21.040> until<00:01:21.160> they<00:01:21.400> do<00:01:21.460> get<00:01:21.760> it<00:01:21.910> or

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
and repeating it until they do get it or

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.990 
and repeating it until they do get it or
they<00:01:22.060> stay<00:01:22.390> here<00:01:22.600> until<00:01:22.840> they<00:01:22.960> get<00:01:23.110> it<00:01:23.200> right

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
they stay here until they get it right

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.650 
they stay here until they get it right
yeah<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.030> think<00:01:25.210> is<00:01:25.300> something<00:01:25.450> we've<00:01:25.630> been

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
yeah I think is something we've been

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.060 
yeah I think is something we've been
trying<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.020> change<00:01:26.260> to<00:01:26.560> off<00:01:26.710> when<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:26.979> walk

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
trying to change to off when you walk

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.469 
trying to change to off when you walk
into<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.369> gym<00:01:27.520> not<00:01:27.700> just<00:01:27.940> rope<00:01:28.090> your<00:01:28.270> players

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
into a gym not just rope your players

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.240 
into a gym not just rope your players
with<00:01:28.720> Joe<00:01:28.900> Bloggs<00:01:29.170> they<00:01:29.410> go<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.770> load<00:01:30.070> up<00:01:30.100> the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
with Joe Bloggs they go and load up the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.010 
with Joe Bloggs they go and load up the
bar<00:01:30.550> or<00:01:30.790> whatever<00:01:31.060> it<00:01:31.180> isn't<00:01:31.450> trying<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.720> smash

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
bar or whatever it isn't trying to smash

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.940 
bar or whatever it isn't trying to smash
it<00:01:32.200> out<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.950> comes<00:01:33.100> back<00:01:33.400> to<00:01:33.610> their<00:01:34.920> technique

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
it out it comes back to their technique

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.889 
it out it comes back to their technique
taking<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.580> time<00:01:36.759> to<00:01:36.940> warm<00:01:37.119> up<00:01:37.240> properly<00:01:37.509> so

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
taking the time to warm up properly so

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.440 
taking the time to warm up properly so
we<00:01:38.080> really<00:01:38.680> making<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.399> focus<00:01:39.790> on<00:01:39.910> emphasis

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
we really making it a focus on emphasis

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.300 
we really making it a focus on emphasis
at<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:41.110> moment<00:01:41.440> just<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.649> warm-up<00:01:41.950> property

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
at the moment just the warm-up property

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.210 
at the moment just the warm-up property
before<00:01:42.490> we<00:01:42.729> do<00:01:42.910> that<00:01:42.940> do<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.540> working<00:01:43.810> seats

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
before we do that do the working seats

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.830 
before we do that do the working seats
normally<00:01:45.220> during<00:01:45.580> a<00:01:45.729> World<00:01:46.240> Series<00:01:46.330> that'll

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
normally during a World Series that'll

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.300 
normally during a World Series that'll
depend<00:01:46.930> on<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.350> facilities<00:01:47.830> we've<00:01:47.979> got<00:01:48.130> about

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
depend on the facilities we've got about

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.560 
depend on the facilities we've got about
we<00:01:48.550> can<00:01:48.700> see<00:01:48.850> here<00:01:49.030> we're<00:01:49.149> training<00:01:49.360> at<00:01:49.509> the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
we can see here we're training at the

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.090 
we can see here we're training at the
hotel<00:01:49.899> so<00:01:50.080> there's<00:01:50.229> not<00:01:50.290> too<00:01:50.350> much<00:01:50.560> available

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
hotel so there's not too much available

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.230 
hotel so there's not too much available
that<00:01:51.220> it<00:01:51.280> probably<00:01:51.550> does<00:01:51.670> suit<00:01:51.910> today's

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
that it probably does suit today's

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.880 
that it probably does suit today's
session<00:01:52.600> because<00:01:52.750> it's<00:01:52.869> quite<00:01:53.020> light<00:01:53.229> but<00:01:53.800> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
session because it's quite light but the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.020 
session because it's quite light but the
back<00:01:54.040> end<00:01:54.070> of<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.369> week<00:01:54.490> will<00:01:54.640> probably<00:01:54.880> try

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
back end of the week will probably try

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.090 
back end of the week will probably try
and<00:01:55.119> get<00:01:55.240> a<00:01:55.270> little<00:01:55.420> power<00:01:55.990> circuit<00:01:56.410> and<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.770> day

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
and get a little power circuit and a day

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.430 
and get a little power circuit and a day
out<00:01:57.310> from<00:01:57.580> torment

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.500
