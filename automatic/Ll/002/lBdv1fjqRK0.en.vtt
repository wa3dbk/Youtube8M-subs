00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.590
 all this day is just a new 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.560
 video today the video would be on the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.900
 presentation of the cellar that valley so 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.439
 to leinster two cities so it's gone 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.810
 So we're going to beg the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.939
 can then so on the first floor we 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.949
 have an opening like an opening 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:37.230
 like all couples to that then we 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:40.410
 have a moment to see my neck she 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.600
 pass she iron youtube she red 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.770
 a little bit but not much because 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.879
 it's his favorite game 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.620
 and here she loves it 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.789
 after we have a small feeder 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.969
 purple case do not hear because the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.350
 wood chips are not high enough 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.910
 I know very well that the chips of 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.920
 woods are not good for hamsters 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.400
 but when I went to the town hall 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.229
 he no longer had litter chamber du 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.880
 I was the first 1000 chips 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.659
 of wood that it was going to be 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.750
 empty 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.330
 and that's after we have small 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.290
 mini mansion houses like this so 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:24.030
 with a small flower inside us 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.150
 have two of the small purple tones 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.030
 as a concern this is mac art because 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.500
 his wines so look at the package is 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.650
 like that you 're well done 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.830
 he gives little later on the package of the coup 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.160
 it's not good at all but it's when 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.680
 even 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:47.110
 vansummeren foam novice marten 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:50.950
 hence these two watts for hamster and 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:55.780
 other rodents so here it is after my 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:59.050
 son is mounted on the second floor as 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.720
 so this mont Albert borrows the 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.150
 way as is my case he takes the 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.140
 grown bull arriving while there 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.140
 arrive at the top 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:20.770
 the opening of this ariel she she she 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:25.570
 red and art have mostly she does not eat 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.370
 woman who killed because it's too complicated 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.070
 for her so it's a bar of 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.880
 cereals stick to the honey she adores I 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.980
 remove the g from all because if 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.320
 because if I put the seeds of 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.100
 sunflower that will arrive at toni kroos and 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.110
 it's not good because on Rome it's there 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.930
 had plenty of sunflower the couple there in 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.620
 had at least 10 and did not see for 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:54.970
 hamsters here then after us 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:58.620
 have his toilet 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:02.350
 like this so with so-called prices 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.640
 in so we'll remove it because I 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.530
 introduced my guys so so not logical 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.550
 and there she does not know that's all 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.440
 that it's her maintaining so she's getting 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.810
 roll in and one more so sedan 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.020
 names like these so give him a 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.690
 little tidbit Cheese and well 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.670
 she mine in any case I know 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:31.810
 not why as you can see keys 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:35.170
 to toglou I learned yesterday we have that 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.080
 I do not advise you did not touch 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.940
 at all because it makes a lot of noise I 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.150
 know that it's full of rhythm and I 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:49.480
 to change I'm going to buy a 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:52.360
 wheel that on noises and more 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:56.020
 move the cage after we have a 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:59.440
 little bottle montrouge as matched to 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:03.340
 the cage would worry part because the 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.170
 can remove it only to men 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.640
 policies 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.090
 sorry for the fruit but I had it 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:14.860
 well hung the Roman 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.590
 otherwise after we could small bowl 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.479
 book going on I'm sure you're going 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.940
 say it in comment but salsa ragga 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.729
 you already have a small bowl at the bottom 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.590
 according to i'm going to explain to you then in 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.410
 did I forget to tell you that in 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.350
 this little bowl that I come 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.770
 to buy with my girlfriend I will put 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.780
 the little treats and all that the 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.760
 dance is kamel game but that his 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.160
 food so like this she already has 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.850
 writes nyos and put him a seed of 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.760
 sunflower 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.560
 because I give him one a week and the 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.380
 crds is the kind of joke but she 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:57.130
 has already eaten it you would not say but 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.600
 we have striking like those here we 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.039
 she rolls in 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:06.570
 it is 4-4 of finally the inverse glusica 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:09.220
 Dell rolls of seconds of time and 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.770
 she is spending months and twenty seven to 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.780
 flap it does its needs and in addition 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.870
 she rolls around so it's hyper 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:21.670
 fun after said she but also in August 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.290
 where she hides little things nothing 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:28.320
 which is practical with this fear to 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:30.550
 gbagbo young woman because soon if 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.370
 after i will show you 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.410
 so I'm going to do but no because there is 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.840
 a second opening so I can 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.150
 open by the water like these one a 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:44.080
 third apology opening so the 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:48.400
 first the first the second which is 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:51.730
 the same and the last term orassara 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.940
 press that just does not suffer I can by 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.670
 example caught that i can catch my 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:04.050
 little vanilla when she is there and everything 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:07.980
 we are here at the end like these 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.980
 after we have 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:15.320
 also this cage is very convenient because 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:18.410
 no longer carry it like this so 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.570
 it's still heavy carrias are full 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.960
 things 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:25.780
 So that's all for the fund 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.430
 from me a mystery 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.850
 Monday attributes for new videos 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.720

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.720
