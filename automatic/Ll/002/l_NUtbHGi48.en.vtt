safe<00:00:30.140> cell<00:00:30.320> technology<00:00:31.330> so<00:00:32.330> I<00:00:32.480> love<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.080> fact

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
safe cell technology so I love the fact

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.710 
safe cell technology so I love the fact
that<00:00:33.500> everything<00:00:34.070> on<00:00:34.339> the<00:00:34.460> seats<00:00:34.699> you<00:00:35.210> can<00:00:35.449> see

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720

move they move out of place with the hug
safe<00:00:52.190> cell<00:00:52.430> technology<00:00:53.030> as<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:54.199> tighten

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:54.619 
safe cell technology as you tighten

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:57.549 
safe cell technology as you tighten
they're<00:00:55.250> tethered<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:56.479> the<00:00:56.750> seat<00:00:57.080> as<00:00:57.290> you<00:00:57.439> can

they're tethered to the seat as you can

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.259 
they're tethered to the seat as you can
see<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:57.799> tethers<00:00:58.159> down<00:00:58.430> there<00:00:58.699> they<00:00:59.239> are

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
see the tethers down there they are

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.609 
see the tethers down there they are
tethered<00:00:59.689> to<00:00:59.780> the<00:00:59.869> seat<00:01:00.049> so<00:01:00.199> they're<00:01:00.320> always

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:00.619 
tethered to the seat so they're always

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:02.890 
tethered to the seat so they're always
going<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:01.040> find<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.519> proper<00:01:02.000> position<00:01:02.689> for

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
going to find the proper position for

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.229 
going to find the proper position for
your<00:01:03.559> child<00:01:03.979> and<00:01:04.220> depending<00:01:04.729> on<00:01:04.790> what<00:01:04.939> child

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
your child and depending on what child

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.060 
your child and depending on what child
you're<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:05.930> site<00:01:06.140> of<00:01:06.320> your<00:01:06.409> child<00:01:06.680> so<00:01:06.860> these

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
you're the site of your child so these

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.460 
you're the site of your child so these
humps<00:01:07.460> are<00:01:07.580> going<00:01:07.700> to<00:01:07.759> move<00:01:08.060> with<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:09.170> harness

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
humps are going to move with the harness

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.440 
humps are going to move with the harness
so<00:01:10.070> that's<00:01:10.220> why<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:10.430> hugs<00:01:10.790> were<00:01:10.970> safe<00:01:11.210> cell

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
so that's why the hugs were safe cell

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.539 
so that's why the hugs were safe cell
technology<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.560> just<00:01:12.860> as<00:01:13.070> an<00:01:13.159> added<00:01:13.430> bonus

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549

that<00:01:13.760> safety<00:01:14.330> feature<00:01:14.360> just<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:14.870> convenience

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
that safety feature just a convenience

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.160 
that safety feature just a convenience
feature<00:01:15.650> is<00:01:16.160> the<00:01:16.520> easy

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
feature is the easy

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.140 
feature is the easy
harness<00:01:17.920> buckle<00:01:18.310> here<00:01:18.550> now<00:01:18.760> look<00:01:18.940> at<00:01:19.030> this

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
harness buckle here now look at this

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.420 
harness buckle here now look at this
this<00:01:19.690> piece<00:01:19.960> is<00:01:20.170> sewn<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.800> seat<00:01:21.070> so<00:01:21.310> it's

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
this piece is sewn to the seat so it's

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.520 
this piece is sewn to the seat so it's
not<00:01:21.520> gonna<00:01:21.700> fall<00:01:22.030> off<00:01:22.270> all<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.630> time<00:01:22.840> on<00:01:23.110> you
