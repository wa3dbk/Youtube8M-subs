00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.020
 a kind of imitation of 50 shadows 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.140
 of great in which we have as 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.280
 protagonist to charisma carpenter who 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.309
 So he lived the honeys of success 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.730
 the buffy vampire hunter series and in the

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.549
 has accompanied by one of the brothers 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.860
 baldwin in particular also doing 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.750
 time we did not see it even in the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.740
 little shit big screen and that 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.159
 I was like the pretty hat 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.460
 the movie for sure it's a 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.180
 supreme but sure crap 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.970
 according to sure he will have more nudes and 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.490
 who knows if any more scene 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.280
 remarkable that the hollywood version 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.009
 where a pasture is going to be spent and 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.770
 that you can buy for a long time 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.530
 the tickets even though its premiere 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.080

 ourselves if it has better 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.830
 paint that 50 happy shadows if you think 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.990
 It's going to be crap if you think 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.860
 the two are going to be a mess or 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.080
 On the other hand, this channel really 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.940

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.260
 reach us ' by watching all the videos 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.250
