00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.240
 well here we have the jewel in the crown 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.250
 is a laptop designed by and for the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.670
 company the environment is a successful job 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.250
 it has the completely linear contours is 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.060
 fantastic port of standard size is 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.270
 of 100,000 usb communications ports 4g 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.040
 socket so here we have even a total 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.270
 to enter the mark for 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.460
 electronic ports vga standard hdmi 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.800
 booking port all designed in magnesium 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.450
 and now it's good that the team is 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.430
 off in the no light does not make a 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.230
 hot test let's see how much 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.170
 late starts I'll give the button less 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.980
 ready prepared will see as you see is 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.050
 illuminates the keyboard 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.220
 let's see this is a test of fire 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:54.010
 and the team has already started this is 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.290
 technology does not reach 5 seconds and 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.199
 the zero team starts a system 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.510
 operative then all this technology of 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.160
 toshiba whatever it does is the 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.009
 first boot that the system has 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.630
 operative stores it on the plane 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.190
 then if there have been no changes and it is 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.229
 operative what it does is start everything 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:17.040
 and with the ss of what makes receive it 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.040
 fast and that's why it starts up energy 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.149
 from 799 massive basic configurations 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.140
 and 5 with 128 and from there we can get 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:31.780
 up to the thousand 999 euros touch with an i7 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.490
 with 16 gigas of ram with 106 gigas of 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.800
 storage but good that they are already 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.920
 very specific configurations but that 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.530
 entry of range from massive 799 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.170
 a laptop an ultrabook this is a 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.380
 porte and as you can see is a laptop 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.590
 microlight 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.800
 extremely robust that what has 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.830
 it is a concept that is that you can 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.790
 remove the screen and the screen is 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.710
 tactile 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.720
 how can you then observe all the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.720
 technology is here is a technology 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.670
 designed for professionals to focus on 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.530
 details such as precipitation 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.390
 that you when you have a portal of this 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.370
 we're going to fuck you with the hand 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.500
 happens if I take him here and nothing that 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.840
 you need refrigeration could not breathe 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.560
 and in the end the team would end up with 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.970
 laxatives 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.680
 then they have got refrigeration 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.330
 redundant so that it would continue as of 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.790
 this way the team was for this 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.290
 slit of this other by active by the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.570
 also it incorporates other engines and 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.580
 which gives a spectacular battery and 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.950
 look at that type mentally we have 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.350
 used to put a usb port of 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.920
 standard size also take out the cds 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.770
 ajami micro hdmi also connections lte 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.850
 and if we use as laptop we go before 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.350
 line that perfectly anka the own 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.540
 own keyboard of this technology and 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.490
 it also has a vga ethernet port 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.510
 which is standard in all 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.340
 professionals 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.680
 and I knew night of my payment is a 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:05.819
 technology that has usb ports with what 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.819
 what what we are good 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.240
 an 11- inch tablet in format 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.240
 full hd
