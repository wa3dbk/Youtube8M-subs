00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.090
 Mr. Shirakuma , I thought I would do a chat today . 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.780
 Well Yes the picture with the video 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.870
 Get the Gold World of the Cabina 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.470
 Fine taste with the coarse-grained method 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.470
 It is written 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.250
 The package is my sister and it 's brownish- it's cool and it's cool , so it's an approximation. 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.390
 Cavy 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.520
 It is written with gold wild to train 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.690
 A cigarette splash 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:43.750
 I like this gradation of brown 662 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.750
 I think that it is written in the approximation with Nishitani Gold World but I do not think it 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.850
 There is no smell 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.540
 I smell a leaf 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.470
 Speaking of this, there is no feature this is nice 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.470
 In you have smoked 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.850
 Putsu 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.540
 Let's introduce 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.720
 I think that tar is 8 m 5 people are 0.720 minutes 440 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.720
 Yes 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.369
 I think cabin mother is usually delicious 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:29.170
 that 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.170
 At 82 I am just fine but there is a country 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.590
 It is common 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.590
 I was surprised 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.670
 Or I'd thought in the loss and the cabin and would blend hoc or alternative to this 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.540
 Nde not recently filtrate roast blend it does not also have smoked 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.540
 but see the 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.240
 Number of common use 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.690
 that 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.460
 Would it does not mean there is or the kind of Amami and this I N a little bit more bitter 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.460
 It is the second floor 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.709
 I 'm getting stuffy but it's a loose number, so it's fast 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.050
 In the south without blowing customers 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.050
 It is amazing 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.760
 What 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:35.069
 There is also a solid rich, I do not have at all 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.840
 It was written roughly 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.840
 I thought it was a strange child 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.099
 Hey that 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.800
 Marla 9 and so on 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:49.490
 It seems that it is the closest expression or not 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.670
 I liked the Toka classic miles, such as I think that it is like for dark liked 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.670
 Ne 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.220
 You should think that it is usually delicious 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.140
 This will collect as you get closer to the freeter 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.550
 Cut food 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.550
 The amount you can shake is normal 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.630
 a ha a naa 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.140
 It took only three and a half minutes 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.140
 After putting on 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.840
 Only about 2 minutes not a budget I SukaWaka is fast reduced but ne 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.280

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.660
 It was goal 5i-of the cabin this time 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.460
 I already finished early so maybe I can talk a little 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.460
 There is no need to mess up when thinking 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.740
 Well I see. If you are at work, you are the director 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.319
