00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.990 
just loved the fact that Jimmy was
playing<00:01:55.619> with<00:01:55.860> confidence<00:01:56.189> he's<00:01:56.759> been

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
playing with confidence he's been

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.240 
playing with confidence he's been
aggressive<00:01:57.630> out<00:01:58.020> there<00:01:58.049> looking<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.679> make

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
aggressive out there looking to make

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.429 
aggressive out there looking to make
place<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.580> teammates<00:02:00.179> but<00:02:00.360> also<00:02:00.539> being

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
place for teammates but also being

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.139 
place for teammates but also being
mindful<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:02.009> make<00:02:02.159> place<00:02:02.429> for<00:02:02.459> himself<00:02:02.759> at<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
mindful to make place for himself at the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.480

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.770 
right times and I think he's making the
effort<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> defensive<00:02:06.420> end<00:02:06.539> of<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.720> floor

there's a lot of guys that have all the
physical<00:03:40.599> tools<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:41.290> be<00:03:41.440> good<00:03:41.650> defensive

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
physical tools to be good defensive

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.949 
physical tools to be good defensive
players<00:03:42.250> that<00:03:42.580> I<00:03:42.790> really<00:03:43.360> don't<00:03:43.569> want<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.780> buy

into<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.770> end<00:03:44.980> of<00:03:45.099> the<00:03:45.160> court<00:03:45.400> at<00:03:45.520> all

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
into that that end of the court at all

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.240 
into that that end of the court at all
times<00:03:45.910> but<00:03:46.239> I<00:03:46.480> think<00:03:47.050> team<00:03:47.290> defense<00:03:47.800> is<00:03:48.010> where

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
times but I think team defense is where

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.680 
times but I think team defense is where
is<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.670> most<00:03:48.880> important<00:03:49.330> thing<00:03:49.450> because

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
is the most important thing because

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.660 
is the most important thing because
you're<00:03:49.810> never<00:03:49.930> going<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.260> have<00:03:50.500> five<00:03:51.190> great

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
you're never going to have five great

defensive players on the court at all

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.510 
defensive players on the court at all
time<00:03:53.350> that's<00:03:53.680> where<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:53.980> have<00:03:54.040> that<00:03:54.130> five

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520
