00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
okay the second to the last process on

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.039 
okay the second to the last process on
our<00:00:03.840> table<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.380> we're<00:00:04.560> going<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.740> sand<00:00:05.069> it<00:00:05.250> okay

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.049 
our table is we're going to sand it okay

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.900 
our table is we're going to sand it okay
sanding<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.140> probably<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.589> biggest<00:00:07.740> pain<00:00:08.340> do

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
sanding is probably the biggest pain do

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.459 
sanding is probably the biggest pain do
but<00:00:09.179> it's<00:00:09.300> one<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.599> most<00:00:09.809> important

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
but it's one of the most important

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.999 
but it's one of the most important
things<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:11.010> really<00:00:11.700> finish<00:00:12.120> your<00:00:12.450> piece<00:00:12.719> out

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
things to really finish your piece out

things to really finish your piece out
okay<00:00:14.009> with<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.519> I'm<00:00:14.670> going<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.849> use<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> palm

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
okay with that I'm going to use a palm

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.529 
okay with that I'm going to use a palm
sander<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.850> what<00:00:17.850> I've<00:00:17.970> done<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.420> I've

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
sander and what I've done is I've

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.390 
sander and what I've done is I've
selected<00:00:18.900> two<00:00:19.470> different<00:00:19.890> grits<00:00:20.160> of

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
selected two different grits of

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.540 
selected two different grits of
sandpaper<00:00:21.109> okay<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.800> way<00:00:22.980> if<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.250> notice

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
sandpaper okay the way if you notice

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.720 
sandpaper okay the way if you notice
these<00:00:23.730> numbers<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:25.130> I've<00:00:26.130> got<00:00:26.369> 220<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.470> 150

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
these numbers here I've got 220 and 150

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.479 
these numbers here I've got 220 and 150
this<00:00:29.730> smaller<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.720> number<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:31.679> 80<00:00:31.949> grit<00:00:32.279> is

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
this smaller the number like 80 grit is

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.819 
this smaller the number like 80 grit is
very<00:00:33.059> rough<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.809> higher<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.079> number<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
very rough the higher the number the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.000 
very rough the higher the number the
finer<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.579> grit<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.719> finish<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.260> up<00:00:37.380> okay

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
finer the grit is to finish it up okay

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.130 
finer the grit is to finish it up okay
now<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> lot<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.000> carpenters<00:00:39.690> high-end

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
now a lot of carpenters high-end

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.319 
now a lot of carpenters high-end
carpenters<00:00:40.710> they'll<00:00:40.950> go<00:00:41.129> from<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> 60<00:00:42.120> grit

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
carpenters they'll go from the 60 grit

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.240 
carpenters they'll go from the 60 grit
up<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:44.090> 325<00:00:45.090> grit<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.980> basically<00:00:46.980> use

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
up to like a 325 grit I basically use

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.760 
up to like a 325 grit I basically use
just<00:00:47.730> these<00:00:47.940> two<00:00:48.300> something<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.530> with

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
just these two something like this with

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.740 
just these two something like this with

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the the fact that I used plywood and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.900 
the the fact that I used plywood and
scrap<00:00:52.079> wood<00:00:52.350> I'm<00:00:52.680> kind<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.039> what<00:00:53.250> they<00:00:53.399> call<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
scrap wood I'm kind of what they call a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.840 
scrap wood I'm kind of what they call a
paint<00:00:54.329> grade<00:00:54.719> wood<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.710> other<00:00:56.280> words<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.730> want

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
paint grade wood in other words I want

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.569 
paint grade wood in other words I want
to<00:00:56.969> sand<00:00:57.239> all<00:00:57.539> these<00:00:57.930> lines<00:00:58.410> out<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.070> get<00:00:59.399> rid

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
to sand all these lines out and get rid

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.299 
to sand all these lines out and get rid
of<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.820> lot<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.600> discrepancies<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:02.160> what

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
of a lot of the discrepancies but what

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.609 
of a lot of the discrepancies but what
I've<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> situation<00:01:03.239> where<00:01:03.750> staining

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
I've got is a situation where staining

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.950 
I've got is a situation where staining
might<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:05.309> look<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.700> best<00:01:05.939> probably<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
might not look the best probably the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.149 
might not look the best probably the
best<00:01:07.170> thing<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> paint<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.520> okay<00:01:10.159> so

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
best thing to do is to paint it okay so

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.410 
best thing to do is to paint it okay so
we're<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.880> start<00:01:12.150> out<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:14.420> 150

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
we're going to start out with the 150

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.000 
we're going to start out with the 150
it's<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.810> nice<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.380> between<00:01:17.100> side<00:01:17.520> okay

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:02:47.990 

and<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.730> stand<00:01:24.000> away

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.030
