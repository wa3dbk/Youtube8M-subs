everything in-house in the UK here's a
look<00:00:21.470> at<00:00:21.619> how<00:00:21.740> we<00:00:21.800> make<00:00:22.070> up<00:00:22.279> on<00:00:22.460> four<00:00:22.640> from

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
look at how we make up on four from

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.359 
look at how we make up on four from
scratch<00:00:26.529> the<00:00:27.529> first<00:00:27.800> step<00:00:28.039> is<00:00:28.220> the

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
scratch the first step is the

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.279 
scratch the first step is the
application<00:00:28.789> of<00:00:29.000> a<00:00:29.089> gel<00:00:29.300> coat<00:00:29.539> into<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.080> mold

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
application of a gel coat into the mold

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.160 
application of a gel coat into the mold
generally<00:00:31.039> we<00:00:31.310> use<00:00:31.339> a<00:00:31.849> white<00:00:32.090> polyester<00:00:32.390> coat

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
generally we use a white polyester coat

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.200 
generally we use a white polyester coat
this<00:00:33.650> gives<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.010> smooth<00:00:34.340> finish<00:00:34.700> you<00:00:35.059> get
