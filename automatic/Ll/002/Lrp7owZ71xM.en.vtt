what they look like this is your
dispensers<00:02:23.680> here<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.370> then<00:02:24.700> these<00:02:24.879> are<00:02:25.060> your

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
dispensers here and then these are your

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.360 
dispensers here and then these are your
Pistons<00:02:25.540> here<00:02:26.019> that<00:02:26.379> are<00:02:26.500> blocking<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.099> door

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
Pistons here that are blocking the door

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.759 
Pistons here that are blocking the door
and<00:02:27.579> then<00:02:27.730> above<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.329> lava<00:02:28.689> pool<00:02:29.079> that

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
and then above it is a lava pool that

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.399 
and then above it is a lava pool that
drops<00:02:30.069> down<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.700> coached<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.870> dispensers

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
drops down and coached the dispensers

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.649 
drops down and coached the dispensers
and<00:02:32.620> shoots<00:02:33.040> out<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.370> fire<00:02:33.579> arrows<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.450> all

and shoots out the fire arrows and all

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.470 
and shoots out the fire arrows and all
this<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.110> hooked<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:36.069> rapid<00:02:36.730> pulser<00:02:37.090> which<00:02:37.329> I

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
this is hooked to a rapid pulser which I

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.640 
this is hooked to a rapid pulser which I
will<00:02:37.659> be<00:02:37.690> showing<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.140> guys<00:02:38.170> how<00:02:38.319> to<00:02:38.470> make

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
will be showing you guys how to make

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.149 
will be showing you guys how to make
this<00:02:38.769> wrapped<00:02:39.010> up<00:02:39.099> ulcer<00:02:39.459> on<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:41.159> Redstone

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
this wrapped up ulcer on the Redstone

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.699 
this wrapped up ulcer on the Redstone
minute<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:43.150> there<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.840> go<00:02:43.900> that's<00:02:44.349> what<00:02:44.590> it

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
minute so there you go that's what it

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.789 
minute so there you go that's what it
looks<00:02:44.859> like<00:02:45.010> there<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.750> all<00:02:46.750> these<00:02:47.230> are<00:02:47.590> all

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
looks like there and all these are all

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.140 
looks like there and all these are all
connected<00:02:48.069> together<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.819> have<00:02:48.909> all<00:02:49.000> the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
connected together so you have all the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.479 
connected together so you have all the
turrets<00:02:49.359> here<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:50.590> yeah<00:02:50.709> there's<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.190> think

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
turrets here so yeah there's I think

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.860 
turrets here so yeah there's I think
there's<00:02:51.609> a<00:02:51.700> total<00:02:51.879> of<00:02:52.000> six<00:02:52.090> in<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.840> whole

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
there's a total of six in the whole

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.849 
there's a total of six in the whole
entire<00:02:53.049> fortress<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:54.840> that's<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.019> guys<00:02:56.200> now

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
entire fortress and that's it guys now

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.319 
entire fortress and that's it guys now
the<00:02:57.519> zombie<00:02:57.909> fortress<00:02:58.329> has<00:02:58.659> a<00:02:59.099> I<00:03:00.299> guess<00:03:01.299> a

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
the zombie fortress has a I guess a

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.619 
the zombie fortress has a I guess a
protection<00:03:02.319> system<00:03:02.859> it's<00:03:03.819> got<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:03.970> tourist

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
protection system it's got a tourist

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.849 
protection system it's got a tourist
been<00:03:05.019> on<00:03:05.530> this<00:03:05.769> um<00:03:06.480> not<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.510> long<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:08.200> mean

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
been on this um not that long I mean

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.500 
been on this um not that long I mean
once<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.220> figure<00:03:09.489> out<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.329> build

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
once you figure out the the build

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.789 
once you figure out the the build
because<00:03:10.690> I<00:03:10.900> build<00:03:11.079> them<00:03:11.230> all<00:03:11.379> in<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.590> back<00:03:11.769> and

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
because I build them all in the back and

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.009 
because I build them all in the back and
I<00:03:12.519> figure<00:03:12.819> out<00:03:12.849> like<00:03:13.150> what<00:03:13.389> i'm<00:03:13.510> going<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.810> do

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
I figure out like what i'm going to do

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.289 
I figure out like what i'm going to do
and<00:03:14.290> then<00:03:14.500> i<00:03:14.530> just<00:03:14.680> i<00:03:15.069> take<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.879> then<00:03:16.030> I

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
and then i just i take that and then I

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.690 
and then i just i take that and then I
you<00:03:17.079> know<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.230> have<00:03:17.530> something<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.579> need
