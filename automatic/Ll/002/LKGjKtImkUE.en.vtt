00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.260
 with the possible exit of diego colotto to the sports the coruña atlas continues 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.410
 his preparation for the match that will hold this Saturday before the set 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.820
 of processes 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.870
 the sportsman has set his eyes on the captain rojinegro diego colotto for 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.449
 replace the fabricio defense coloccini 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.419
 before the possible departure of the central defender we bet forcibly now the 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.419
 opportunity to sing 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.620
 last week I always work for 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.620
 In addition, winning a position is canceled 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.270
 now they will be the recipients of remittances 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.410
 but good we hope 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.920
 with the work of 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.150
 already from day to day 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.930
 When a person 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.630
 it is a bit bad 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.990
 the spaces of the home to shoot to be able to play but the real one I'm not 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.880
 aware of nothing until after summer 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.420
 7 maybe here you do what you can do 4 there is nothing concrete 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.920
 I told him to wait 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.160
 until that moment 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160
 I hope for the well-off that he decides to speak the best option is the one 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.380
 You must say we are not here working for each other 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.600
 the appropriate attestation was presented taking advantage of it 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.600
 this type of patent litigation 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 not the man that from the center of all the bulbs 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.500
 I think about that trying to denigrate a better football 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.810
 in this case the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.549
 aladro present protagonists of this edition for that we work day by day 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.300
 to be successful 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.540
 if you get out, you are aware of what you are always looking for 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.710
 we could not people 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.560
 For his part diego colotto has stated that he only thinks of the atlas and the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.560
 match they will hold before blue cross next saturday 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.240
 for those who will train this afternoon at the Jalisco stadium to continue with their 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.130
