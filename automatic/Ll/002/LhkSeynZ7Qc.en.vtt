Hi this is Sharon with Nappy Hair Nation for
another awesome review of our Camille Rose

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.160
Naturals line, and today we're going to be
reviewing the Almond Jai Twisting Butter with

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.160
another fellow 4A,B,C natural. Tell us why
you LOVE this product (she's been ranting

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:32.619
and raving about it). I love it I've been
doing all summer the wash and go and decided

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.239
to play around with this product finally this
week and let me tell you a roller set with

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.239
this ROCKIN'! I am loving my hair! I love
how soft it is. You put it in umm, you roll

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.739
it and it just sucks in that moisture and
then the next day it just feels wonderful

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.839
and then you can do it again dry. You can
use it wet or dry just put it back in re-roll

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.480
it and the second night I did I re-rolled
it with larger rollers and it just came out

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.110
gorgeous! Just GORGEOUS! But you know what
really takes the cake on this one? "Takes

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.110
the CAKE" Takes the cake, tell us about the
cake! The cake is yummy goodness! Yes, it

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.830
does smell like cake! Straight up cake batter!
And look I've used it several times and its

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.080
just you don't need a lot. How much do you
use? Each strand is about maybe that much.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.700
What do you mean "each strand'? Section, each
section. When I go to roll it up. Ok and how

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.700
big are your sections? Nice size, a nice quarter
size. And I just kind of smooth it through...I

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.360
know, cake batter! Cake batter! I know it
smells amazing! I definitley recommend this.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.360
I love this. Somebody's mom is gonna get some
of this because I really really really love

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.400
it. Yo momma! Oh yeah she'll love it too she's
a 4. She is going to love this it does WONDERS.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.200
It just makes your hair so soft. Your mom
asked about that build up I had none of that

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.200
sticky build up feel. No flaking? No flaking,
no nothing. It wasn't greasy, it wasn't heavy.

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:23.510
It was light, it just made my hair feel like butter!
So here's a question did that scent stay in

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.510
your hair all day? No I noticed it maybe in
the morning but...ok but it's pleasant when

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.069
you apply it. Yes so pleasant! Thank you Camille
Rose Naturals for sending us this awesome

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.000
sample and as you can see, a 4 loves it. Loves
it!!
