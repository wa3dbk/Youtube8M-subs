 two tablespoon knew the ingredients give 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.530
 Now you just in a mixing bowl and 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.530

 Now most of the work has been done 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:05.140
 So here is my finished shows 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.140

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:35.319
 You can already reach the oven at 200 degrees 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.350

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.890
 continue right away 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:06.390
 The whole thing looks like this with me 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:10.349
 from here they are still sticking in the top 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.349
 with a fork 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:47.659
 need for the filling of the cake 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.799
 under par and exactly one kilo 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:52.730
 we need three eggs 125 milliliters 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.700

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.859
 we need 100 grams of sugar and something 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.170

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.090
 and then rhubarb as you can see 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.489
 my here pretty much liquid that 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.200
 because of that very fresh from the 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.060

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.549
 sugar is loaded with the liquid 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.239
 pulls because otherwise who else if you 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:19.430
