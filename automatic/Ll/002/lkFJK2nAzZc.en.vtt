00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
repeating the steps all the way down now

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.369 
repeating the steps all the way down now
as<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.879> move<00:02:09.000> lower<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.720> lower<00:02:09.929> on<00:02:10.229> this

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
as you move lower and lower on this

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.440 
as you move lower and lower on this
braid<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.860> gets<00:02:11.099> harder<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.760> harder<00:02:11.819> it's

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
braid it gets harder and harder it's

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.690 
braid it gets harder and harder it's
definitely<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> great<00:02:13.230> arm<00:02:13.560> exercise<00:02:14.220> if<00:02:14.519> you

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
definitely a great arm exercise if you

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.580 
definitely a great arm exercise if you
find<00:02:14.909> it<00:02:15.030> hard<00:02:15.180> doing<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.140> back<00:02:16.349> I

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
find it hard doing it in the back I

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.259 
find it hard doing it in the back I
would<00:02:16.830> suggest<00:02:17.040> bringing<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.700> hair<00:02:17.879> on<00:02:18.090> the

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
would suggest bringing the hair on the

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.119 
would suggest bringing the hair on the
side<00:02:18.480> personally<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.170> still<00:02:19.500> think<00:02:19.799> that<00:02:19.980> it

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
side personally I still think that it

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.589 
side personally I still think that it
works<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> best<00:02:20.700> when<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.150> do<00:02:21.299> it<00:02:21.390> in<00:02:21.510> the

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
works the best when you do it in the

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.000 
works the best when you do it in the
back<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:22.049> just<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.349> knots<00:02:22.560> or<00:02:22.740> more<00:02:22.950> aligned

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
back it's just the knots or more aligned

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.259 
back it's just the knots or more aligned
I think<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.400> hairstyle<00:02:24.670> is<00:02:24.879> all<00:02:25.060> about

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
I think this hairstyle is all about

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.059 
I think this hairstyle is all about
practice<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:26.080> keep<00:02:26.260> doing<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.769> and<00:02:26.950> you're

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
going to get better and better as you do

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:36.539 
going to get better and better as you do
it<00:02:32.939> and<00:02:33.939> once<00:02:34.900> I've<00:02:35.110> secured<00:02:35.500> my<00:02:35.650> last<00:02:35.890> knot<00:02:36.189> I

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
it and once I've secured my last knot I

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:51.500 
it and once I've secured my last knot I
am<00:02:37.450> finished
