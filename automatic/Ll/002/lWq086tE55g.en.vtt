00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.210 
think it looks pretty good for them from
now<00:02:14.720> it'll<00:02:15.080> look<00:02:15.320> a<00:02:15.470> lot<00:02:15.620> better<00:02:15.830> once<00:02:16.070> I

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
now it'll look a lot better once I

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.530 
now it'll look a lot better once I
actually<00:02:16.340> get<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.610> body<00:02:16.910> kit<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.420> can

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
actually get the body kit and it can

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.090 
actually get the body kit and it can
attach<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.050> pieces<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:20.260> but<00:02:21.260> it'll<00:02:21.830> look<00:02:21.920> a

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
attach the pieces to it but it'll look a

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.160 
attach the pieces to it but it'll look a
lot<00:02:22.250> better<00:02:22.540> because<00:02:23.540> there's<00:02:23.750> going<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:23.990> be<00:02:24.050> a

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
lot better because there's going to be a

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.520 
lot better because there's going to be a
lot<00:02:24.380> more<00:02:24.410> LEDs<00:02:25.070> on<00:02:25.430> there<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:26.510> i'll<00:02:27.170> make<00:02:27.500> a
