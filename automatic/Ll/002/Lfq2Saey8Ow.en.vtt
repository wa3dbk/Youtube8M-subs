00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
actual shop I connected the electrical

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:35.059 
actual shop I connected the electrical
wire<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:26.159> my<00:03:26.280> electrical<00:03:26.670> box<00:03:33.799> this<00:03:34.799> is<00:03:35.040> the

a 100m breaker takes egg spots in my

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.869 
a 100m breaker takes egg spots in my
panel<00:03:41.670> so<00:03:42.239> now<00:03:42.450> it's<00:03:42.840> full<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.489> even<00:03:44.489> had<00:03:44.640> to

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
panel so now it's full I even had to

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.270 
panel so now it's full I even had to
remove<00:03:45.209> one<00:03:45.689> breaker<00:03:45.989> from<00:03:46.470> my<00:03:46.709> actual<00:03:47.159> shop

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
remove one breaker from my actual shop

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.610 
remove one breaker from my actual shop
then<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.609> mark<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.329> shop<00:03:51.629> placement<00:03:52.139> in<00:03:52.260> my

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
then I mark the shop placement in my

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.250 
then I mark the shop placement in my
back<00:03:52.829> yard<00:03:52.859> do<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.760> think<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.180> now<00:03:54.450> looks<00:03:54.720> like

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
back yard do you think it now looks like

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.170 
back yard do you think it now looks like
a<00:03:55.290> game<00:03:55.560> field<00:03:55.859> and<00:03:56.069> now<00:03:56.549> come<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:56.970> first

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
a game field and now come the first

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.030 

then<00:04:18.609> Oh<00:04:18.940> was<00:04:19.540> dug<00:04:19.780> all<00:04:20.019> around<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.829> shop

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
then Oh was dug all around the shop

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:29.989 
then Oh was dug all around the shop
walls

00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:29.999 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.449 

the<00:04:30.449> second<00:04:30.809> man<00:04:30.989> made<00:04:31.619> sure<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.009> depth<00:04:32.279> is

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:32.459 
the second man made sure the depth is

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:44.550 
the second man made sure the depth is
the<00:04:32.849> same<00:04:33.119> all<00:04:33.329> around

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.469 

after<00:04:45.560> several<00:04:45.830> hours<00:04:46.009> I<00:04:46.460> have<00:04:46.789> a<00:04:46.819> big<00:04:47.210> hole<00:04:47.449> in

my backyard this really marks the start

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.239 
my backyard this really marks the start
of<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.539> construction<00:04:51.139> but<00:04:51.590> it<00:04:51.710> didn't<00:04:52.039> stay

00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:52.249 
of the construction but it didn't stay

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:54.429 
of the construction but it didn't stay
pretty<00:04:52.490> like<00:04:52.819> this<00:04:53.029> for<00:04:53.389> long<00:04:53.599> because<00:04:54.110> it

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:54.439

can see this but it's full of mud all
the<00:07:21.780> way<00:07:21.960> around<00:07:22.260> so<00:07:22.560> I<00:07:23.010> add<00:07:23.220> a<00:07:23.250> load<00:07:23.670> of<00:07:23.880> sand

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090 
the way around so I add a load of sand

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.510 
the way around so I add a load of sand
delivered<00:07:24.690> so<00:07:25.200> that<00:07:25.350> Rene<00:07:25.650> and<00:07:25.890> I<00:07:25.980> can<00:07:26.250> spread

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 
delivered so that Rene and I can spread

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.160 
delivered so that Rene and I can spread
it<00:07:26.640> around<00:07:26.760> the<00:07:27.060> footing<00:07:27.420> to<00:07:27.810> create<00:07:28.140> a

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.170 
it around the footing to create a

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.080 
it around the footing to create a
cleaner<00:07:28.620> space<00:07:29.070> so<00:07:29.580> we<00:07:29.700> could<00:07:29.910> continue

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.090 
cleaner space so we could continue

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:37.010 
cleaner space so we could continue
working<00:07:30.600> on<00:07:30.870> the<00:07:31.020> forms<00:07:35.150> the<00:07:36.150> exterior<00:07:36.450> was

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 
working on the forms the exterior was

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.200 
working on the forms the exterior was
much<00:07:37.530> easier<00:07:37.560> to<00:07:38.010> backfill<00:07:38.520> than<00:07:39.030> the

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.210 
much easier to backfill than the

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.460 
much easier to backfill than the
interior

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:42.470 

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.160 

I<00:07:43.120> will<00:07:44.120> end<00:07:44.270> the<00:07:44.390> construction<00:07:44.870> of<00:07:44.990> my

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.170 
I will end the construction of my

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.380
