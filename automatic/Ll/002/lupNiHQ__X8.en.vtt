the pillar pretty physical bein 52 this
video<00:00:04.850> is<00:00:05.210> about<00:00:05.420> the<00:00:05.720> age<00:00:05.899> of<00:00:06.290> the<00:00:06.410> earth<00:00:06.439> how

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
video is about the age of the earth how

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.210 
video is about the age of the earth how
old<00:00:07.040> is<00:00:07.189> it

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
old is it

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.860 
old is it
this<00:00:08.520> is<00:00:08.640> sort<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.000> similar<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.360> my<00:00:09.540> old<00:00:09.660> videos

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
this is sort of similar to my old videos

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.650 
this is sort of similar to my old videos
where<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:10.860> actually<00:00:11.460> presented<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.210> positive

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
where I actually presented a positive

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.210 
where I actually presented a positive
case<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:13.290> something<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.740> actually<00:00:13.830> said

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
case for something I actually said

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.129 
case for something I actually said
something<00:00:14.460> 1<00:00:14.850> i'll<00:00:15.210> be<00:00:15.270> able<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.690> give<00:00:15.870> night

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
something 1 i'll be able to give night

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.380 
something 1 i'll be able to give night
some<00:00:16.350> coffee

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
some coffee

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.110 
some coffee
so

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.120 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.200 

it<00:00:20.690> is

oh by the way this NSS for in the 19th
century<00:00:26.460> science<00:00:27.460> took<00:00:27.640> a<00:00:27.730> dramatic<00:00:27.880> paradigm

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599

to<00:00:31.390> be<00:00:31.419> several<00:00:32.019> thousand<00:00:32.500> years<00:00:32.529> old<00:00:32.829> but

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
to be several thousand years old but

four and a half billion years old there

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.130 
four and a half billion years old there
are<00:01:13.430> two<00:01:13.610> main<00:01:13.820> scientific<00:01:14.210> reasons<00:01:14.990> where

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
are two main scientific reasons where

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.390 
are two main scientific reasons where
the<00:01:15.229> earth<00:01:15.320> must<00:01:15.620> be

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
the earth must be

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.400 
the earth must be
one<00:01:16.940> of<00:01:17.030> them<00:01:17.150> establishes<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.260> earth

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
one of them establishes that the earth

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.900 
one of them establishes that the earth
is<00:01:18.530> relatively<00:01:19.010> old<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.730> the<00:01:19.820> other

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
is relatively old and the other

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.910 
is relatively old and the other
establishes<00:01:20.570> that<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.230> earth<00:01:21.350> is<00:01:21.440> about<00:01:21.710> four

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
establishes that the earth is about four

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.990 
establishes that the earth is about four
and<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:22.040> half<00:01:22.070> billion<00:01:22.490> years<00:01:22.850> old

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and a half billion years old

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.340 
and a half billion years old
the<00:01:24.240> first<00:01:24.510> is<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.750> there<00:01:25.110> are<00:01:25.200> certain

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the first is that there are certain

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.660 
the first is that there are certain
features<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> earth<00:01:26.190> that<00:01:26.430> are<00:01:26.460> only

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
features of the earth that are only

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.550 
features of the earth that are only
explainable<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.510> theorists<00:01:27.960> as<00:01:28.080> millions<00:01:28.470> of

explainable of theorists as millions of
years<00:01:28.650> old<00:01:28.890> I'll<00:01:29.490> present<00:01:29.820> doing<00:01:30.210> these

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
years old I'll present doing these

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.600 
years old I'll present doing these
features<00:01:30.660> today<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.770> first<00:01:32.010> of<00:01:32.130> them<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
features today the first of them is the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.460 
features today the first of them is the
strata<00:01:32.940> layers<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.540> earth<00:01:33.600> all<00:01:33.900> young

earth creationist acknowledge that it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.100 
earth creationist acknowledge that it

would take millions of years for the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.050 
would take millions of years for the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
offered one is that the rate of decay is

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.200 
offered one is that the rate of decay is
not<00:03:37.500> constant

not constant

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.390

the<00:03:40.020> implication<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:41.220> rate<00:03:41.370> of

the implication is that the rate of

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.610 
the implication is that the rate of

this<00:07:17.510> is<00:07:17.660> based<00:07:17.930> on<00:07:18.080> the<00:07:18.230> faulty<00:07:19.010> math<00:07:19.160> by

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.370 
this is based on the faulty math by

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.820 
this is based on the faulty math by
Walker<00:07:19.580> moon<00:07:20.510> is<00:07:20.660> receding<00:07:20.960> at<00:07:21.170> 3.8

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:21.830 
Walker moon is receding at 3.8

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.650 
Walker moon is receding at 3.8
centimeters<00:07:22.040> per<00:07:22.460> year<00:07:22.610> since<00:07:23.270> the<00:07:23.420> moon<00:07:23.570> is

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:23.660

tenth power centimeters from the earth

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.070 
tenth power centimeters from the earth
this<00:07:27.860> is<00:07:28.010> already<00:07:28.250> consistent<00:07:28.910> with<00:07:29.360> an<00:07:29.480> order

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 
this is already consistent with an order

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.570 
this is already consistent with an order
of<00:07:30.170> magnitude<00:07:30.200> the<00:07:31.010> earth-moon<00:07:31.550> system

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.580 
of magnitude the earth-moon system

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.129 
of magnitude the earth-moon system
billions<00:07:32.180> of<00:07:32.390> years<00:07:32.510> old

billions of years old

billions of years old
therefore<00:07:34.949> because<00:07:35.460> of<00:07:35.490> the<00:07:35.879> relative<00:07:36.539> lead

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:37.219 
therefore because of the relative lead

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:39.409 
therefore because of the relative lead
relative<00:07:38.219> age<00:07:38.340> of<00:07:38.520> the<00:07:38.610> earth<00:07:38.669> established<00:07:39.330> by

exact age of the earth establishment
radiometric<00:07:44.490> dating<00:07:44.699> and<00:07:45.150> by<00:07:46.080> the<00:07:46.139> inadequacy

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919

of the young earth creationist arguments
I<00:07:48.990> believe<00:07:49.770> that<00:07:49.800> that<00:07:50.490> the<00:07:50.639> earth<00:07:50.819> is

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.060 
I believe that that the earth is

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.439 
I believe that that the earth is
four-and-a-half<00:07:51.569> billion<00:07:51.990> years<00:07:52.139> old
