about being in third person you're
invincible<00:01:06.730> which<00:01:07.540> is<00:01:07.660> pretty<00:01:07.900> cool<00:01:08.050> and<00:01:08.350> oh

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
invincible which is pretty cool and oh

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.840 
invincible which is pretty cool and oh
you've<00:01:11.170> got<00:01:11.850> unlimited<00:01:12.850> ammo<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:15.340> there's<00:01:15.640> a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
you've got unlimited ammo so there's a

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.180 
you've got unlimited ammo so there's a
bunch<00:01:16.090> of<00:01:16.240> cool<00:01:16.390> things<00:01:16.660> about<00:01:16.960> this<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.920> only

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
bunch of cool things about this the only

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.700 
bunch of cool things about this the only
bad<00:01:18.400> thing<00:01:18.430> I<00:01:19.060> have<00:01:19.330> to<00:01:19.510> say<00:01:19.540> is<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.410> fact<00:01:20.620> that

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
bad thing I have to say is the fact that

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.710 
bad thing I have to say is the fact that
there's<00:01:20.950> no<00:01:21.130> crosshairs<00:01:21.490> which<00:01:22.450> are<00:01:22.600> their

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
there's no crosshairs which are their

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.840 
there's no crosshairs which are their
little<00:01:22.930> Amy<00:01:23.080> things<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:27.220> you<00:01:27.310> can<00:01:27.460> still<00:01:27.670> do

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
little Amy things but you can still do

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.910 
little Amy things but you can still do
it<00:01:27.880> without<00:01:28.090> them

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.530 

you<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:34.490> face<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.520> watch<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.710> credit

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
you do face to watch your like credit

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.700 
you do face to watch your like credit
yeah<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> guess<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:41.009> note<00:01:41.780> crosses<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.560> no

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
yeah so I guess the note crosses the no

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.429 
yeah so I guess the note crosses the no
aiming<00:01:44.130> thing<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:45.330> kind<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.810> made<00:01:45.899> up<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.229> by

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
aiming thing is kind of made up for by

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.719 
aiming thing is kind of made up for by
the<00:01:46.619> fact<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.950> you're<00:01:47.130> invincible<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
the fact that you're invincible and

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.190 
the fact that you're invincible and
you've<00:01:47.909> got<00:01:48.060> unlimited<00:01:48.210> Atma<00:01:48.720> which<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
you've got unlimited Atma which is I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.120
