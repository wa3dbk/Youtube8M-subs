in your seventh year in office what have

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.639 
in your seventh year in office what have
you<00:00:06.390> learned<00:00:06.569> about<00:00:06.600> pacing<00:00:06.960> yourself<00:00:07.140> and

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
you learned about pacing yourself and

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.190 
you learned about pacing yourself and
managing<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.130> stress<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.580> job<00:00:09.080> you<00:00:10.080> know

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
managing the stress of the job you know

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.519 
managing the stress of the job you know
the<00:00:10.320> truth<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:12.679> I'm<00:00:13.679> lucky<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.309> by

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
the truth is that I'm lucky to by

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.990 
the truth is that I'm lucky to by
inclination<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.890> temperament<00:00:17.279> be<00:00:17.490> fairly

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
inclination and temperament be fairly

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.460 
inclination and temperament be fairly
studying<00:00:18.510> your<00:00:18.630> Hawaiian<00:00:18.750> roots<00:00:19.199> yeah

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
studying your Hawaiian roots yeah

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.960 
studying your Hawaiian roots yeah
exactly<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.949> think<00:00:20.369> that's<00:00:20.490> probably<00:00:20.640> what<00:00:20.850> it

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
exactly I think that's probably what it

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.939 
exactly I think that's probably what it
is<00:00:21.029> good<00:00:21.270> weather<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.199> just<00:00:22.710> like<00:00:22.830> today

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
is good weather and and just like today

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.900 
is good weather and and just like today
yeah<00:00:24.529> so<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.560> don't<00:00:25.740> get<00:00:25.890> too<00:00:26.010> high<00:00:26.189> don't<00:00:26.699> get

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
yeah so I don't get too high don't get

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.810 
yeah so I don't get too high don't get
too<00:00:27.090> low<00:00:27.680> I've<00:00:28.680> been<00:00:28.949> very<00:00:29.160> consistent<00:00:29.580> about

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
too low I've been very consistent about

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.730 
too low I've been very consistent about
exercising<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.019> morning<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.439> that

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
exercising in the morning that that

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.479 
exercising in the morning that that
helps<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:33.559> but<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.590> think<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.340> most

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
helps I but I think that the most

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.310 
helps I but I think that the most
important<00:00:36.030> I'm<00:00:36.390> very<00:00:36.600> consistent<00:00:37.140> about

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
important I'm very consistent about

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.799 
important I'm very consistent about
spending<00:00:37.950> time<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.340> family<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.719> know

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
spending time with family and you know

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.330 
spending time with family and you know
when<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.110> dinner<00:00:40.290> with<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.710> your

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
when you have dinner with you your

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.660 
when you have dinner with you your
daughters<00:00:41.730> particularly<00:00:42.420> teenage<00:00:42.809> daughters

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
daughters particularly teenage daughters

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.590 
daughters particularly teenage daughters
they'll<00:00:44.670> keep<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.500> place<00:00:46.680> and

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
they'll keep you in your place and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.279 
they'll keep you in your place and
they'll<00:00:48.600> teach<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.809> something<00:00:49.230> about

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
they'll teach you something about

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.410 
they'll teach you something about
perspective<00:00:49.940> but<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.000> think<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.300> most

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
perspective but I think the most

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.209 
perspective but I think the most
important<00:00:51.870> thing<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.590> take<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.010> long<00:00:53.190> view

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
important thing is to take the long view

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.720 
important thing is to take the long view

history<00:01:32.700> everybody<00:01:33.450> said<00:01:33.659> ah<00:01:33.810> he's<00:01:34.710> handling

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
history everybody said ah he's handling

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.670 
history everybody said ah he's handling
this<00:01:35.280> terribly<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.210> year<00:01:37.049> later<00:01:37.259> nobody<00:01:37.439> was

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
this terribly a year later nobody was

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.499 
this terribly a year later nobody was
talking<00:01:37.799> about<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.610> retrospect<00:01:38.939> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
talking about it and in retrospect it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.260 
talking about it and in retrospect it
turns<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.860> handled<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:41.670> well

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
turns out that we handled that as well

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.260 
turns out that we handled that as well
as<00:01:42.509> any<00:01:42.869> environmental<00:01:43.909> crisis<00:01:44.909> has<00:01:45.060> been

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
as any environmental crisis has been

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.639 
as any environmental crisis has been
handled<00:01:45.860> Ebola<00:01:47.329> remember<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.649> obviously

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
handled Ebola remember that obviously

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.800 
handled Ebola remember that obviously
it's<00:01:49.890> still<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.189> serious<00:01:50.909> problem<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.630> we've

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
it's still a serious problem and we've

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.130 
it's still a serious problem and we've
got<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.079> get<00:01:52.200> down<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.500> zero<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:53.990> that<00:01:54.990> was

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
got to get down to zero but that was

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.399 
got to get down to zero but that was
probably<00:01:55.320> one<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> most<00:01:55.799> effective

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
probably one of the most effective

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.109 
probably one of the most effective
international<00:01:58.409> public<00:01:59.219> health<00:01:59.250> responses<00:02:00.000> in

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
international public health responses in

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.690 
international public health responses in
history<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.719> was<00:02:00.930> led<00:02:01.200> by<00:02:01.649> us<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:02.369> we

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
history and that was led by us if we

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.209 
history and that was led by us if we
hadn't<00:02:03.000> acted<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:04.110> would<00:02:04.350> still<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.619> raging

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
hadn't acted it would still be raging

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.789 
hadn't acted it would still be raging
and<00:02:05.369> everybody<00:02:05.729> else<00:02:05.880> would<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.060> at<00:02:06.240> risk<00:02:06.420> and

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
and everybody else would be at risk and

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.370 
and everybody else would be at risk and
so<00:02:07.799> those<00:02:08.640> experiences<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.509> think<00:02:09.690> remind<00:02:10.619> you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
so those experiences I think remind you

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.150 
so those experiences I think remind you
