00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:13.329
Do you really need a good reason to upgrade
to an IQ series medium format digital back?

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.869
Existing Phase One users will 
no doubt be looking with envy

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.079
at the new IQ series backs.

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.539
The old backs were great: Image 
quality was the best available,

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.310
the backs were rugged and reliable, 
and the controls were efficient.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.390
Your current Phase One back is 
still a great investment butâ€¦

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.040
For professionals, upgrading to an IQ
series back is a business decision.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.640
The fact that the IQ back has a sexy
touch screen which you swipe lovingly

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.000
with your finger has 
nothing to do with it.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.499
The speed with which you can review and 
enlarge your files is a great time saver.

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:58.000
Underneath your fingertips you 
will find some great new tools.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.740
For instance, the exposure warning
feature has been joined by the

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.970
focus mask feature that's 
found in Capture One.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.290
How useful is it to glance down at the 
LCD screen and see your subject size

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.060
painted green instantly confirming 
that you've nailed the focus.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.960
Shooting architecture, you'll want 
all your levels to be perfect

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.420
even if you don't use the IQ 
backs' built-in leveling display, 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.280
Capture One can adjust the horizon for you
automatically as you import your RAW files.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.440
Talking architecture and landscape
or any photography where you're using

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.680
a technical camera I'd be remiss not 
to mention the new Live View feature.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.460
Being able to focus directly on the sensor
is liberating and another great time saver.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.270
It's simply a game changer for 
high end technical photography.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.840
Functionally, the new IQ series backs 
simply work better and more quickly.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.800
The capture rate is faster and they 
are still as rugged and robust as the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.540
previous Phase One backs.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.859
If what you really want from a medium
format digital back is image quality

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.610
then you have no choice.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.600
The Phase One IQ180 provides the 
highest image quality available,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.300
and its 80 megapixels will test everything 
you ever thought about sharpness

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.109
and dynamic range.

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:22.309
There's some pretty compelling reasons
to upgrade your existing Phase One back,

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:26.019
and I believe there's some pretty
compelling upgrade offers as well.

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.029
Perhaps your first step is to have a 
chat to your local Phase One dealer.

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:32.859
Welcome to the Phase One IQ club.
