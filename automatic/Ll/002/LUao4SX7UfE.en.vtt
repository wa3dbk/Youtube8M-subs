00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.060
 tennis like last year it was a 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.830
 very nice final of the internationals of 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.380
 France feminine and like last year 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.690
 the american chris evert lloyd beat 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.260
 his compatriot martina navratilova after 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.430
 two hours and three sets 2 6 6 3 6 3 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.199
 comment lionel chamoulaud this is the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.150
 seventh time chris evert lake does 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.260
 this gesture to paris seven titles to 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.250
 international of France 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.990
 she's consolidating her record yet it's 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.480
 martina navratilova who had the best 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.020
 started this 69th meeting between 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.940
 two players 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.520
 Navratilova wins the first run 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.899
 6-2 then chris evert lloyd rules his 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.040
 costs and more particularly its 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.520
 passings his tears absolute of 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.520
 US 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.230
 an average net climb of 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.829
 navratilova and she is immediately 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.550
 punished and when martina decides to stay 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.199
 at the bottom of the court 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.590
 chris shows a precision 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.590
 unbelievable 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.670
 today chris evert either they had 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:17.640
 every shot in his racket there 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.860
 including the lobe with a nail polish 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:30.810
 matched to his crisis skirt even came 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:31.200
 score points at the net the super 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.630
 class 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:40.229
 she strengthens her second run 6-3 by 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:42.090
 im crisis and let down martina son 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.149
 will have three match points for 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.560
 win a new title 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.149
 this final did not reach the intensity 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.340
 from last year's 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.939
 maybe because chris was too 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.939
 strong today 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.520
 a low volley to conclude 6 3 in 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.520
 the third set 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.429
 martina is a great champion she 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.500
 is still world number 1 despite 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.550
 this defeat that too is the class 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.550
 sad bravo
