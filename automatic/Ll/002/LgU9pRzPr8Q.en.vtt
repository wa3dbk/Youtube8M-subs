00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820 
holds but it's all changing we had to

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.480 
holds but it's all changing we had to
evolve<00:07:20.150> and<00:07:20.680> sometimes<00:07:21.680> to<00:07:21.890> evolve<00:07:22.190> it<00:07:22.310> means

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490 
evolve and sometimes to evolve it means

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.250 
evolve and sometimes to evolve it means
going<00:07:22.730> back<00:07:23.030> and<00:07:23.210> doing<00:07:23.270> your<00:07:23.540> research<00:07:23.780> and

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:38.600 
and still photography in the future will

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.940 
and still photography in the future will
need<00:07:38.780> to<00:07:38.840> become<00:07:38.930> better<00:07:39.370> storytellers
