00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
speech allowed this lady to have her

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.279 
speech allowed this lady to have her
opinion<00:01:43.819> and<00:01:44.819> he<00:01:45.390> felt<00:01:45.600> she<00:01:45.750> went<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.080> bit

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
opinion and he felt she went on a bit

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.620 
opinion and he felt she went on a bit
and<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:47.039> think<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.369> stage<00:01:47.520> after<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> minute

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
and I think at that stage after a minute

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.059 
and I think at that stage after a minute
or<00:01:48.690> so<00:01:48.810> he<00:01:48.899> had<00:01:49.020> certainly<00:01:49.350> had<00:01:49.470> enough<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.979> me

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
or so he had certainly had enough for me

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.219 
or so he had certainly had enough for me
the<00:01:50.159> key<00:01:50.280> takeaway<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:52.670> policy<00:01:53.670> of

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
the key takeaway is that the policy of

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.449 
the key takeaway is that the policy of
unmanned<00:01:55.229> drone<00:01:55.440> strikes<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.920> needs<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.369> be

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
unmanned drone strikes it needs to be

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.430 
unmanned drone strikes it needs to be
changed<00:01:56.850> Obama<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.569> definitely<00:01:58.020> trying<00:01:58.289> to

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
changed Obama is is definitely trying to

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.289 
changed Obama is is definitely trying to
move<00:01:58.830> responsibility<00:01:59.789> for<00:01:59.909> ground<00:02:00.060> strikes

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
move responsibility for ground strikes

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.910 
move responsibility for ground strikes
drone<00:02:00.690> strikes<00:02:00.929> out<00:02:01.080> of<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.259> shadow<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
drone strikes out of the shadow of the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.980 
drone strikes out of the shadow of the
CIA<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.399> into<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.939> Department<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.420> Defense

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
CIA and into the Department of Defense

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.410 
CIA and into the Department of Defense
and<00:02:04.890> he's<00:02:05.430> certainly<00:02:05.850> trying<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.329> do

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
and he's certainly trying to do

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.569 
and he's certainly trying to do
something<00:02:06.719> about<00:02:06.780> Guantanamo<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.160> think

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:08.579 
something about Guantanamo but I think

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:10.099 
something about Guantanamo but I think
the<00:02:08.670> key<00:02:08.820> takeaway<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.299> the<00:02:09.359> key<00:02:09.479> lesson<00:02:09.750> is

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:10.109 
the key takeaway in the key lesson is

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.759 
the key takeaway in the key lesson is
that<00:02:10.200> these<00:02:11.009> two<00:02:11.280> elements<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:12.269> US<00:02:13.109> policy<00:02:13.560> of

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
that these two elements of US policy of

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.099
