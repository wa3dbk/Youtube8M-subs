00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
cover the the actual pipeline used to

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.140 
cover the the actual pipeline used to
create<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.900> game's<00:00:18.900> character<00:00:19.789> using<00:00:20.789> ZBrush

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
create a game's character using ZBrush

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.170

my<00:00:24.470> 2011<00:00:25.470> will<00:00:26.279> be<00:00:26.310> covering<00:00:27.470> the<00:00:28.470> actual

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
my 2011 will be covering the actual

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.830 
my 2011 will be covering the actual
supply<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.790> concept<00:00:32.790> or<00:00:32.969> illustration<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.719> you

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
supply of concept or illustration to you

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.010 
supply of concept or illustration to you
and<00:00:34.020> how<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:34.770> start<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.370> model<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.630> character

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
and how we start to model the character

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.709 
and how we start to model the character
using<00:00:37.380> Z<00:00:37.590> spheres<00:00:37.890> then<00:00:38.550> we're<00:00:38.760> moving<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
using Z spheres then we're moving to the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.690 
using Z spheres then we're moving to the
basic<00:00:40.110> sculpting<00:00:40.739> or<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> moving<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
basic sculpting or the moving of the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.060 
basic sculpting or the moving of the
base<00:00:41.879> mesh<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.780> then<00:00:43.020> we'll<00:00:43.200> subdivide<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
base mesh and then we'll subdivide and

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.299 
base mesh and then we'll subdivide and
start<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.820> put<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.030> more<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.600> more<00:00:45.690> detail

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
start to put in more and more detail

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.520 
start to put in more and more detail
we'll<00:00:47.309> also<00:00:47.460> cover<00:00:47.879> doing<00:00:48.530> customized

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
we'll also cover doing customized

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.779 
we'll also cover doing customized
brushes<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.930> we<00:00:51.930> will<00:00:52.140> also<00:00:52.530> cover<00:00:52.860> use<00:00:53.489> doing

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
brushes and we will also cover use doing

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.160 
brushes and we will also cover use doing
3d<00:00:54.770> doing<00:00:55.770> UV<00:00:56.160> layouts<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.879> poly<00:00:57.690> painting

I<00:01:07.470> will<00:01:07.830> show<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.130> how<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> apply<00:01:08.790> normal<00:01:09.570> maps

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
I will show you how to apply normal maps

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.740 
I will show you how to apply normal maps
and<00:01:10.049> displacement<00:01:10.799> maps<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.450> basically<00:01:12.450> get

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
and displacement maps and basically get

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.859 
and displacement maps and basically get

shown a quick thing on how to bind a

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.429 
shown a quick thing on how to bind a
skeleton<00:01:25.670> onto<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> actual<00:01:27.090> model<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.600> look

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
skeleton onto the actual model and look

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.710 
skeleton onto the actual model and look
at<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.770> way<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.340> deforms<00:01:30.259> and<00:01:31.259> I've<00:01:31.470> also

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
at the way that it deforms and I've also

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.359 
at the way that it deforms and I've also
covered<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.750> displacement<00:01:34.259> map<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.220> bit

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
covered the displacement map in a bit

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.640 
covered the displacement map in a bit
more<00:01:35.520> detail<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.840> hope<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.200> enjoy<00:01:37.470> this

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
show you the ZBrush model that we will

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.039 
show you the ZBrush model that we will
be<00:01:49.530> working<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.689> model<00:01:51.840> of

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
be working with and this is the model of

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.719 
be working with and this is the model of
the<00:01:52.170> base<00:01:52.320> mesh<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.829> has<00:01:52.979> been<00:01:53.220> Rita

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the base mesh that has been Rita

the base mesh that has been Rita
pologize<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:55.680> turn<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.250> off<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:57.200> taking

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
pologize and I turn that off and taking

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.770 
pologize and I turn that off and taking
it<00:01:58.290> through<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.619> levels<00:01:59.509> until<00:02:00.509> we<00:02:00.600> get<00:02:00.719> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
it through the levels until we get to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.410 
it through the levels until we get to
the<00:02:00.990> finish<00:02:01.259> sculpting<00:02:01.500> stage<00:02:02.149> which<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.299> at

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the finish sculpting stage which is at

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.010 
the finish sculpting stage which is at
level<00:02:03.719> 7

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.860 

this<00:02:07.020> model<00:02:07.350> at<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.650> point<00:02:08.780> contains<00:02:11.870> about

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
this model at this point contains about

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.950 
this model at this point contains about
seven<00:02:14.030> seven<00:02:15.030> million<00:02:15.210> polygons<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.750> I'll

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
seven seven million polygons and I'll

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:28.490 
seven seven million polygons and I'll
show<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:19.470> colorized

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.890 

and<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:30.490> there<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:30.820> go<00:02:30.850> we<00:02:31.330> can<00:02:31.450> see<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.750> model

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
and so there we go we can see the model

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.170 
and so there we go we can see the model
and<00:02:32.230> seal<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.650> detail<00:02:33.040> all<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.580> these<00:02:33.730> little
