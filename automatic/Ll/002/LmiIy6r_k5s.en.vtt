chicken breast is dry as fuck and the

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.219 
chicken breast is dry as fuck and the
chicken<00:01:41.789> drumsticks<00:01:42.789> are<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.000> thighs<00:01:43.210> are<00:01:43.660> so

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
chicken drumsticks are the thighs are so

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.230 
chicken drumsticks are the thighs are so
chooses<00:01:44.619> because<00:01:44.710> they<00:01:44.920> have<00:01:45.039> a<00:01:45.070> lot<00:01:45.310> more<00:01:45.340> lot

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.820 
chooses because they have a lot more lot
more<00:01:46.420> blood<00:01:46.630> that's<00:01:47.020> called<00:01:47.200> dark<00:01:47.409> meat<00:01:47.650> and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
more blood that's called dark meat and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.830 
more blood that's called dark meat and
white<00:01:47.920> meat<00:01:48.549> white<00:01:49.030> meat<00:01:49.060> it's<00:01:49.540> like<00:01:49.690> the

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
white meat white meat it's like the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.359 
white meat white meat it's like the
third<00:01:50.049> you<00:01:50.229> know<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.440> fastest<00:01:50.860> most<00:01:51.070> it's<00:01:51.220> not

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
third you know the fastest most it's not

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.950 
third you know the fastest most it's not
a<00:01:51.400> lot<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.549> blood<00:01:51.790> in<00:01:51.850> there<00:01:52.000> it's<00:01:52.659> not<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.840> lot

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
a lot of blood in there it's not a lot

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.260 
a lot of blood in there it's not a lot
of<00:01:52.990> mother<00:01:53.260> country<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:53.890> lot<00:01:54.100> of<00:01:54.130> nuclei<00:01:54.549> so

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
of mother country and a lot of nuclei so

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.460 
of mother country and a lot of nuclei so
it's<00:01:55.450> just<00:01:55.510> longer<00:01:55.780> than<00:01:55.960> we<00:01:56.020> cover<00:01:56.260> because

it's just longer than we cover because

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.570 
it's just longer than we cover because
you<00:01:56.590> guys<00:01:56.740> know<00:01:56.890> what<00:01:57.010> are<00:01:57.100> your<00:01:57.190> blood<00:01:57.400> you

you guys know what are your blood you

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.920 
you guys know what are your blood you
can't<00:01:57.760> recover<00:01:57.970> anything<00:01:58.330> no<00:01:58.570> muscle<00:01:58.840> can

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
can't recover anything no muscle can

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.240 
can't recover anything no muscle can
grow<00:01:59.049> without<00:01:59.200> your<00:01:59.409> blood<00:01:59.590> right<00:01:59.830> the<00:02:00.010> blood

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
grow without your blood right the blood

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.969 
grow without your blood right the blood
brings<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.850> oxygen<00:02:01.330> in<00:02:01.420> your<00:02:01.450> blood<00:02:01.979> shuttles

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
so firm also has a lot of fucking it's

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.520 
so firm also has a lot of fucking it's
slow<00:02:09.820> push<00:02:10.119> meaning<00:02:10.390> has<00:02:10.510> a<00:02:10.540> lot<00:02:10.989> of<00:02:11.019> red<00:02:11.320> blood

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
slow push meaning has a lot of red blood

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.090 
slow push meaning has a lot of red blood
cells<00:02:11.590> like<00:02:12.600> that<00:02:13.600> means<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:14.019> recovers<00:02:14.560> faster

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
cells like that means it recovers faster

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.530 
cells like that means it recovers faster
than<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.310> fucking<00:02:15.700> thing<00:02:15.940> faster<00:02:16.360> than<00:02:16.480> a

than you fucking thing faster than a
motherfucker<00:02:17.049> you<00:02:17.230> know<00:02:17.260> 24<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.890> 48<00:02:18.190> hours

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
motherfucker you know 24 to 48 hours

motherfucker you know 24 to 48 hours
you'll<00:02:19.239> you're<00:02:19.480> slow<00:02:19.690> those<00:02:19.870> muscles<00:02:20.260> have

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
you'll you're slow those muscles have

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.170 
you'll you're slow those muscles have
already<00:02:20.830> recovered<00:02:21.310> after<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.820> trained<00:02:22.030> them

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
already recovered after you trained them

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.300 
already recovered after you trained them
because<00:02:22.750> they<00:02:22.870> have<00:02:22.989> so<00:02:23.290> much<00:02:23.470> more<00:02:23.739> support

day doesn't my philosophy on the whole
nuclei<00:02:35.469> out<00:02:35.560> they<00:02:35.799> examine<00:02:36.459> philosophy<00:02:36.819> so

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
nuclei out they examine philosophy so

t-shirt it's proven a muscle and the

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.739 
t-shirt it's proven a muscle and the
more<00:02:42.280> red<00:02:42.579> blood<00:02:42.609> cells<00:02:43.060> muscle<00:02:43.299> has<00:02:43.540> the

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:43.749 
more red blood cells muscle has the

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:45.750 
more red blood cells muscle has the
fastest<00:02:44.230> gonna<00:02:44.409> grow<00:02:44.590> them<00:02:44.769> on<00:02:44.859> nuclei<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.609> has

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
fastest gonna grow them on nuclei it has

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.839 
fastest gonna grow them on nuclei it has
the<00:02:46.480> more<00:02:46.659> mitochondria<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:48.250> faster<00:02:48.670> gonna

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
the more mitochondria the faster gonna

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.610 
the more mitochondria the faster gonna
grow<00:02:49.030> after<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.389> stimulated<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.469> gonna

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:54.219 
be you know more more efficient than the

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.099 
be you know more more efficient than the
muscle<00:02:54.579> that<00:02:54.609> only<00:02:54.879> has<00:02:55.120> like<00:02:55.389> fucking<00:02:55.840> arm
