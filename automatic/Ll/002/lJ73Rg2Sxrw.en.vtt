so pirates hearin many people wondering
how<00:00:22.390> to<00:00:22.450> take<00:00:22.720> down<00:00:22.990> these<00:00:23.140> manor<00:00:23.470> wars

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
how to take down these manor wars

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.269 
how to take down these manor wars
without<00:00:24.190> getting<00:00:24.700> their<00:00:24.880> ships<00:00:25.150> fully<00:00:25.510> just

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
without getting their ships fully just

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.190 
without getting their ships fully just
demolished<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:28.300> I've<00:00:28.420> kind<00:00:28.630> of<00:00:28.720> figured<00:00:28.900> out<00:00:29.110> a

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
demolished so I've kind of figured out a

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.370 
demolished so I've kind of figured out a
way<00:00:30.060> which<00:00:31.060> is<00:00:31.240> like<00:00:31.270> blocking<00:00:31.869> off<00:00:31.990> the<00:00:32.169> ship

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
way which is like blocking off the ship

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.960 
way which is like blocking off the ship
shipping<00:00:32.770> lane<00:00:32.950> while<00:00:33.220> he's<00:00:33.370> busy<00:00:33.579> fighting

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
shipping lane while he's busy fighting

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.700 
shipping lane while he's busy fighting
now<00:00:34.329> you<00:00:34.360> can<00:00:34.660> as<00:00:34.780> well<00:00:34.810> do<00:00:35.140> it<00:00:35.290> while<00:00:35.620> they're

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
now you can as well do it while they're

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.470 
now you can as well do it while they're
just<00:00:35.920> cruising<00:00:36.310> around<00:00:36.400> by<00:00:36.730> themselves<00:00:36.910> but<00:00:37.450> I

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
just cruising around by themselves but I

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.910 
just cruising around by themselves but I
find<00:00:37.780> it<00:00:37.900> best<00:00:38.050> when<00:00:38.290> they're<00:00:38.410> busy<00:00:38.560> fighting

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
find it best when they're busy fighting

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.890 
find it best when they're busy fighting
another<00:00:39.250> ship<00:00:39.670> because<00:00:40.360> they're<00:00:40.510> too<00:00:40.630> focused

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
another ship because they're too focused

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.490 
another ship because they're too focused
on<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.410> fight<00:00:42.750> as<00:00:43.750> you<00:00:43.900> can<00:00:44.020> see<00:00:44.230> as<00:00:44.350> I'm
