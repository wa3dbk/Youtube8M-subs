00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.459
 so my most beautiful tennis memory 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.699
 I think it will remain my quarter of 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.400
 final against roger federer at wimbledon 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:23.070
 where I come back from two sets to zero and I 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.439
 only imposes india in five sets 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.109
 a prestigious victory for me it's 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.670
 and federer rodger on the central to 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.800
 wimbledon 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.210
 I am the only player to beat him 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.210
 while leading two sets to zero 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.899
 the meaning super good I played I played 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.789
 a lot of recent matches 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.100
 weeks I trained very well 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:55.600
 so I hope I'm going to be on top 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.769
 for the fortnight and mentally that's it 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.769
 it's true that lately 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:04.330
 it was not great but I tell myself that I 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.130
 played a lot of matches in my career 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.770
 last week it was his themes 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.810
 increased 300th victory over the on the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.720
 turn so I rely on this kind of 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.420
 things to tell me that this is 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.380
 experience and everything you need to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.380
 to be a better player 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:35.170
 so my strong point tennis it remains my 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.280
 service i think i have a natural service 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.869
 the first time I play tennis 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.610
 the first gesture that I was it was a 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.289
 service is the first gesture that was 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.149
 clean 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.830
 the first time it was such service 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.830
 it's something natural for me 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.780
 that's ready I think my second 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.110
 quality is to believe often in 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.940
 the impossible 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:04.310
 that brought me where I am 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:06.500
 today to have fun because 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.570
 it's a sport it's a great sport 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.550
 in which it can be it must be 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.640
 passionate because there are times and 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.790
 difficult times and for for 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.540
 continue to fight and hang on there 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.010
 must really like that so I think that 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:35.630
 because at first the most 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:37.640
 important this is what he had a 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.310
 particular influence bah yes because 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.750
 that he won roland garros so 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:47.140
 necessarily we our results next to 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.140
 his face for small results
