half full tank of gasoline I'm not very
good<00:00:47.969> at<00:00:48.180> shifting<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.379> third<00:00:49.620> gear

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
good at shifting so the third gear

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.000

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.840 

and<00:01:09.510> well<00:01:10.510> it<00:01:11.050> just<00:01:11.110> keeps<00:01:11.590> up<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:15.580> might

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
and well it just keeps up so it might

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.109 
and well it just keeps up so it might
not<00:01:15.910> be<00:01:16.090> very<00:01:16.240> impressive

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.240 

I<00:01:22.289> sure<00:01:23.289> that<00:01:23.560> looks<00:01:23.859> of<00:01:24.310> cars<00:01:24.969> do<00:01:25.539> much<00:01:26.530> better

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.919 

but<00:01:30.250> for<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.700> car<00:01:31.060> that<00:01:31.090> weighs<00:01:31.590> 1,600<00:01:32.590> kilos

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
but for a car that weighs 1,600 kilos

horsepower<00:01:41.130> 163<00:01:42.130> in<00:01:42.250> Belgium<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.670> be<00:01:42.909> exact<00:01:43.270> I

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
horsepower 163 in Belgium to be exact I

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.899 
horsepower 163 in Belgium to be exact I
think<00:01:45.369> it's<00:01:45.520> not<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.759> bad<00:01:45.909> result<00:01:47.459> of<00:01:48.459> course<00:01:48.759> as

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
think it's not a bad result of course as

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.639 
think it's not a bad result of course as
you<00:01:49.060> can<00:01:49.090> see<00:01:49.450> I<00:01:49.630> don't<00:01:49.990> know<00:01:50.200> if<00:01:50.319> you're<00:01:50.469> able

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
you can see I don't know if you're able

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.839 
you can see I don't know if you're able

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
to sweets I will try to adapt oh this

00:01:54.849 --> 00:02:06.359 
to sweets I will try to adapt oh this
might<00:01:55.390> be<00:01:55.630> too<00:01:55.810> bright<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:02.170> better<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:05.560> it's

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
might be too bright it's better so it's

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.339 
might be too bright it's better so it's
still<00:02:06.789> s<00:02:07.560> okay<00:02:08.560> I<00:02:08.910> am<00:02:09.910> not<00:02:10.450> sure<00:02:10.989> if<00:02:11.019> you're

still s okay I am not sure if you're
able<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.709> see<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.069> but<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.730> average<00:02:13.150> fuel

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
able to see it but the average fuel

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.530 
able to see it but the average fuel
consumption<00:02:13.900> now<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.849> 13.1<00:02:17.400> allow<00:02:18.400> try<00:02:19.120> to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
consumption now is 13.1 allow try to

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.660 
consumption now is 13.1 allow try to
have<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:20.230> constant<00:02:20.980> speed<00:02:21.129> of<00:02:21.310> 100<00:02:21.940> km/h<00:02:22.120> and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
have a constant speed of 100 km/h and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.830 
have a constant speed of 100 km/h and
put<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.760> in<00:02:24.910> 6th<00:02:25.269> gear

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.600 

and<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:30.200> shows<00:02:30.590> me<00:02:31.780> 9.2<00:02:32.780> but<00:02:33.410> it's<00:02:33.770> going<00:02:34.370> a

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
and that shows me 9.2 but it's going a

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:44.510 
and that shows me 9.2 but it's going a
pill<00:02:36.670> here<00:02:39.850> 9.1

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.080 

of<00:02:45.000> course<00:02:45.390> should<00:02:45.600> have<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:46.370> certain<00:02:47.370> distance

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
of course should have a certain distance

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.040 
of course should have a certain distance
to<00:02:48.510> cover<00:02:49.050> I'm<00:02:49.980> gonna<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.220> weigh<00:02:50.520> 8.9<00:02:51.420> okay

to cover I'm gonna I weigh 8.9 okay

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:59.710 
to cover I'm gonna I weigh 8.9 okay
that's<00:02:52.800> more<00:02:53.040> like<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:55.430> it's<00:02:56.480> really<00:02:58.220> this<00:02:59.220> car

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
that's more like it it's really this car

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.990 
that's more like it it's really this car
has<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:01.020> high<00:03:01.230> fuel<00:03:01.650> consumption<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.670> cannot

has a high fuel consumption it cannot

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.210 
has a high fuel consumption it cannot

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
5.5 liters with this car that's just not

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.570 
5.5 liters with this car that's just not
possible<00:03:12.380> certainly<00:03:13.380> not<00:03:13.740> if<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.040> put<00:03:14.280> on<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580

and navigation system and all that but

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.020 
and navigation system and all that but
so<00:03:22.770> you<00:03:23.640> know<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:23.820> see<00:03:24.180> seven<00:03:25.110> point<00:03:25.380> eight

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
so you know you see seven point eight

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.410 
so you know you see seven point eight
100<00:03:27.030> kilometers<00:03:27.510> per<00:03:27.540> hour

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.260 
100 kilometers per hour
68<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.690> think<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:33.450> if<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:33.840> want<00:03:34.050> to

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.730 

you<00:03:36.840> can

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
you can

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.890 
you can
drive<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.640> economically<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:42.220> what<00:03:43.030> is<00:03:43.180> what

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
drive it economically and what is what

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.280 
drive it economically and what is what
concerns<00:03:44.650> power<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:45.130> think<00:03:45.310> there's<00:03:45.940> no<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.480> have

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
concerns power I think there's no I have

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.030 
concerns power I think there's no I have
no<00:03:47.410> trouble<00:03:47.650> with<00:03:49.200> head<00:03:50.200> rice<00:03:50.440> goods

well I'm driving in Germany now but

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:37.790 
well I'm driving in Germany now but
nonetheless<00:05:35.059> the<00:05:36.059> speed<00:05:36.330> is<00:05:36.479> limited<00:05:36.599> to<00:05:36.929> 120

nonetheless the speed is limited to 120
km/h<00:05:38.399> -<00:05:39.059> so<00:05:40.610> it<00:05:41.610> makes<00:05:41.879> no<00:05:42.029> difference<00:05:42.089> at

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
km/h - so it makes no difference at
