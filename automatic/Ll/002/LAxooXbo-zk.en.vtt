stuff<00:05:41.770> by<00:05:41.950> the<00:05:41.979> way<00:05:42.250> I<00:05:42.669> cut<00:05:43.240> wires<00:05:43.479> that

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
stuff by the way I cut wires that

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.930 
stuff by the way I cut wires that
weren't<00:05:43.900> needed<00:05:44.169> I<00:05:45.070> got<00:05:45.400> a<00:05:45.430> new<00:05:45.550> power<00:05:45.760> supply

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
weren't needed I got a new power supply

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.750 
weren't needed I got a new power supply
is<00:05:46.720> the<00:05:46.780> one<00:05:47.020> I<00:05:47.050> was<00:05:47.860> working<00:05:48.099> on<00:05:48.400> and<00:05:48.610> they've

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
is the one I was working on and they've

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.140 
is the one I was working on and they've
totally<00:05:49.000> fried<00:05:49.599> so<00:05:50.250> with<00:05:51.250> a<00:05:51.340> monitor<00:05:51.789> and

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
totally fried so with a monitor and

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.270 
totally fried so with a monitor and
everything<00:05:52.599> else<00:05:52.690> is<00:05:52.930> working<00:05:53.289> well<00:05:53.500> but<00:05:54.099> that

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
everything else is working well but that

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.710 
everything else is working well but that
power<00:05:54.460> supply<00:05:54.700> was<00:05:55.000> hold<00:05:55.300> that

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
power supply was hold that

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:10.950 
power supply was hold that
to<00:05:55.990> be<00:05:56.110> at<00:05:56.230> least<00:06:08.220> difference<00:06:09.220> but<00:06:09.960> it

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
to be at least difference but it

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.790 
to be at least difference but it
definitely<00:06:11.230> helps<00:06:11.800> to<00:06:12.250> the<00:06:12.820> overall

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
definitely helps to the overall

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.280 
definitely helps to the overall
worthiness<00:06:14.800> of<00:06:15.190> the<00:06:15.250> machine<00:06:15.960> go<00:06:16.960> ahead<00:06:17.140> and

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
worthiness of the machine go ahead and

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:24.630 
worthiness of the machine go ahead and
lock<00:06:17.530> that<00:06:17.800> back<00:06:18.100> up<00:06:18.370> and<00:06:22.800> other<00:06:23.800> than<00:06:24.070> that<00:06:24.280> I

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
lock that back up and other than that I

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.330 
lock that back up and other than that I
mean<00:06:24.790> we<00:06:25.480> got<00:06:25.630> the<00:06:25.810> Marquis<00:06:26.500> running<00:06:26.950> oh<00:06:27.130> yeah
