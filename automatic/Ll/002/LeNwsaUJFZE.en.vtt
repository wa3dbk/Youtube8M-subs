00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.610

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.450
 and what cool youtube friends in this 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.920

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.810
 assault the lord of the armory good 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.370
 let's find where it is marked 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.290
 We have to arrive 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.969
 I'm just a little bit short and I'm going 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.010
 arriving 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.940
 well this good trick is not a trick is 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.610
 how to say a discovery that you have 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.860
 what to go 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.300
 well this since many youtube already 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.090
 they talk about having in their channel or already what 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.920
 has but this I wanted to have in the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.630
 Well that's why I bring it here to 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.040
 that we all see 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:01:00.060
 or rather you because I already know 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.110
 to see you arrive here you go near 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.110
 to take out your weapon 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.399
 and you are going to approach 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.810
 and he's going to send me the fuck again 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.760
 I'm going to open a little bit to be able 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.680
 tell it 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.680
 I'm going to aim slowly 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.130
 Athens you can have or try with me 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.600
 car to see and tatum 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.600
 let's put my car here 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.420
 I'm going to put it here to open 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.250
 I'm going out 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.170
 I'm going to get my gun 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.390
 turning off the light and I will bring 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.790
 little 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.800
 I'm going to kill him, you can see that 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.900
 kill now I'm running to where 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.520
 there's the box I'm going to write down the letter 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.520
 of the register he shot 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.500
 I already have it now I 'm going to the next 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.910
 over the next cash register and 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.270
 I'm going to shoot him to dry the 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.270
 money 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.240
 as you can see here is the money 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.240
 and so 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.650
 I think this was all 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.920
 in that tone 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.210
 and then this was all I hope you have 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.990

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.990
