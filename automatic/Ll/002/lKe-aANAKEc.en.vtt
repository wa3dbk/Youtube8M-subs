00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.900
 hello my name is ram's horn i 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.730
 photographer 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.830
 and today I would like to tell you about 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.109
 one of his last shootings idea for 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.390
 filming was born completely spontaneously I 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.000
 went to the store art foot on 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.710
 some domestic issues to buy 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.260
 pencil eraser something in this spirit 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.230
 that time I went there, but it was this 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.750
 time my eyes riveted stand with 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.980
 felting wool felting 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.770
 then this kind of needlework 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.649
 it's not so important yellow mustard 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.360
 I won the light I took 3 packs and 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.730
 I thought yes just in case let it be 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.350
 think of something though in my head already 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.140
 began to emerge some kind of abstract 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.329
 nothing well I go to the checkout this see such 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.070
 canvas paper which depicted 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:03.000
 makey makey is a dream and a combination 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.060
 this red mark here this 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.450
 mustard yellow but all this flash 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.260
 just crashed into my head and I immediately 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.090
 I felt the mood of a new image 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.840
 picked up the fabric to the color of 9 meters of fabric 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:25.350
 invited the model and what happened you 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:29.869
 Look now face model 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:33.840
 I covered with white paint for akvagrim 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:40.130
 water based paint with water 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:44.880
 bread and medical and brush and neat 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.159
 separated from the paper flowers led to 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.950
 all visible areas of the body is generally 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.590
 Here is such a sheet for decoupage 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.509
 decoupage this kind of design 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.189
 I stuck the surface randomly 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.759
 there was no plan where 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.460
 like yes they certainly got unstuck 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.860
 in some places in places, well, I knew it was all me 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.060
 I can poison when processing is important to me 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.910
 was getting a picture 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.940
 drawing such on the body for a very long time 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.880
 which decoupage method is the most 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.650
 perfect and my view before that 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.500
 I'm all night 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.160
 crawled these same flowers sealed 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.650
 cut and knew that they and 4 glued 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.260
 among themselves Whatman A1 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.740
 this is the perfect solution to the background to the intended 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.510
 image that is, he and the body of the same color 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.250
 absolutely 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.150
 the guys in the studio helped prepare bye 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.400
 I made the frame hairstyle 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.420
 the next step was more precise the last 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.910
 the dress is no secret that the dress was held on 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.210
 pins on gum on honest word well 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.820
 as it usually happens I used 9 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.100
 meters as I have said come up with 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.680
 dress on the go I knew that he should 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.620
 be so lush interesting support 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.070
 hairstyles but how exactly did not know 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.610
 everything was born already in place and at the very 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.130
 last moment I decided to add more 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.830
 props to our shooting this thing 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.850
 ordinary glass with streaks of the village in 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.530
 the tone of the dress and hairstyle white gouache 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.170
 All the preparation took about three seconds. 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.709
 half hours model olga 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.300
 by that time she was cold and tired but 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.100
 selflessly went to the film set 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.560
 pad and was ready for any 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.530
 madness is very good such 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:42.620
 models have an improvised background and 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:47.070
 stuck on tape to the wall several times 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.620
 changed the light schemes and one source and 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.739
 2 and 3 that just did not do differently 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.830
 I tried first of all 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:59.280
 achieve the volume as if she took a step 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.650
 from this wall to us as if it were the most 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.319
 the real part of this canvas 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.859
 flower 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.170
 I also wanted to achieve the effect 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:12.230
 understatement to have a lot of shadows 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.260
 so that every texture every line was 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.100
 underlined how it happened you 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.160
 Now you can see and it was very much fun 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.070
 interesting moments frame this very 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.880
 heavy very heavy 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.970
 in used reflectors yes and 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.979
 the silver side of the gold is no 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.280
 there was a script everything was going like it went like 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.759
 it felt like that and went the last stage 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.880
 I thought of shooting 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:46.520
 full frame 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.000
 I wanted her to be straight tylo on the background 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:53.030
 black background two people you looked like 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.530
 I cut tissues around 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.780
 they were the same length of three or four 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.250
 meter olgu planted on a black table 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.979
 which still gave on a black background 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.889
 she relied on socks and such 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:10.400
 the effect was getting flying interesting me 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.080
 hands put her hand showed and 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.110
 the emotion that she herself felt in this 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.870
 the moment and here these details allowed 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.919
 we generally get such an interesting 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.320
 picture as you can see everything can be done 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.900
 do it yourself 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.270
 process by the way was the process of parsing 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.320
 the image was no less interesting than his 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:36.740
 preparation that's what we got I 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:39.620
 rented Row format jpeg format I just 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.070
 I have not mastered the days so comfortable that is 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.380
 only brush drawing only 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.719
 I have little processing right now here 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.539
 I just fixed some defects where 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:53.930
 stick off the paper worked a little 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:06:02.170
 With light, a shadow has drawn and light is all 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:05.630
 manually try everything with a brush 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.520
 look for a snowball start ideas here 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.190
 one another lay together are born 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.220
 need a little imagination and sincere 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.630
 the desire to be able to truly 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.270
 to create and receive from this grand 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:21.400
 pleasure explain your stylist 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.400
 try it yourself the main thing do not sit still
