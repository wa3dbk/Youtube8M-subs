because<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.470> don't<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:28.829> know<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.250> story

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
because I don't really know the story

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.460 
because I don't really know the story
all<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.970> well<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.540> sometimes<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> bit

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470
