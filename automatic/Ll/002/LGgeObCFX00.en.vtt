00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.670 
favorite the end product is great it
doesn't<00:00:33.239> dry<00:00:33.510> out<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.899> lot<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.260> times<00:00:34.469> when

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
doesn't dry out a lot of the times when

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.410 
doesn't dry out a lot of the times when
you<00:00:34.739> put<00:00:34.860> protein<00:00:35.489> powder<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.000> microwave

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
you put protein powder in the microwave

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.600 
you put protein powder in the microwave
it<00:00:36.630> will<00:00:37.050> dry<00:00:37.290> out<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:37.950> with<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.340> recipe

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610

any of those and they're not very good

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.710 
any of those and they're not very good
so<00:02:21.220> start<00:02:21.790> with<00:02:21.910> one<00:02:22.060> minute<00:02:22.299> and<00:02:22.420> we'll<00:02:22.540> check

so start with one minute and we'll check

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.170 
so start with one minute and we'll check
on<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.430> after<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.459> minute<00:02:24.610> you'll<00:02:24.850> notice

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
on it and after a minute you'll notice

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.539 
on it and after a minute you'll notice
that<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.630> top<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.470> cake<00:02:26.680> is<00:02:26.860> cooked<00:02:27.010> but

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
that the top of the cake is cooked but

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.280 
that the top of the cake is cooked but
still<00:02:27.850> a<00:02:28.120> little<00:02:28.299> bit<00:02:28.510> gooey<00:02:28.840> down<00:02:29.110> at<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
still a little bit gooey down at the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.690 
still a little bit gooey down at the
bottom<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:29.680> what<00:02:29.769> we'll<00:02:29.920> do<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.160> stick<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.430> back

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
bottom so what we'll do is stick it back

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.840 
bottom so what we'll do is stick it back
in<00:02:30.910> there<00:02:31.090> for<00:02:31.299> 30<00:02:31.870> seconds<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.430> with<00:02:33.549> this<00:02:33.640> one

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
in there for 30 seconds so with this one

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.850 
in there for 30 seconds so with this one
I<00:02:34.030> ended<00:02:34.420> up<00:02:34.510> microwaving<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.260> for<00:02:35.440> one<00:02:35.590> minute

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
I ended up microwaving it for one minute

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.340 
I ended up microwaving it for one minute
and<00:02:35.950> then<00:02:36.160> three<00:02:36.690> 30-second<00:02:37.690> intervals<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:38.290> 2

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
and then three 30-second intervals so 2

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.229 
and then three 30-second intervals so 2
minutes<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.100> 30<00:02:39.430> seconds<00:02:39.880> total

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
minutes and 30 seconds total

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.240 
minutes and 30 seconds total
but<00:02:40.720> those<00:02:41.049> intervals<00:02:41.500> are<00:02:41.680> important<00:02:42.070> so<00:02:42.160> you

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
but those intervals are important so you

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.860 
but those intervals are important so you
don't<00:02:42.400> overcook<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.970> now<00:02:43.420> we're<00:02:43.570> going<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.720> do

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
don't overcook it now we're going to do

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.199 
don't overcook it now we're going to do
is<00:02:44.110> just<00:02:44.290> take<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.470> knife<00:02:44.709> scrape<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.760> out<00:02:45.880> along

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
is just take a knife scrape it out along

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.940 
is just take a knife scrape it out along
the<00:02:46.360> sides<00:02:46.600> it<00:02:46.900> should<00:02:47.140> just<00:02:47.290> pop<00:02:47.410> right<00:02:47.620> out

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
the sides it should just pop right out

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.440 
the sides it should just pop right out
because<00:02:48.370> we<00:02:48.610> sprayed<00:02:48.880> nonstick<00:02:49.239> cooking

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
because we sprayed nonstick cooking

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.180 
because we sprayed nonstick cooking
spray<00:02:49.570> on<00:02:49.840> there<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.170> then<00:02:50.650> just<00:02:50.799> put<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.040> on<00:02:51.160> a

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
spray on there and then just put it on a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.699 
spray on there and then just put it on a
plate<00:02:51.519> and<00:02:51.700> then<00:02:52.390> just<00:02:52.570> cut<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:53.110> half<00:02:53.350> and

plate and then just cut it in half and

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.500 
plate and then just cut it in half and
these<00:02:54.040> protein<00:02:54.489> cakes<00:02:54.790> will<00:02:55.060> taste<00:02:55.269> great

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
these protein cakes will taste great

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.540 
these protein cakes will taste great
