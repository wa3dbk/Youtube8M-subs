he bought as a you know VX for 90 but

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.709 
he bought as a you know VX for 90 but
way<00:00:59.100> back<00:00:59.309> whenever<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.600> an

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
way back whenever so this is an

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.479
