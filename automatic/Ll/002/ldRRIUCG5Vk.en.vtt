00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.970
 hello my name is mathieu bonnier and 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.099
 I take care of the concept development 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.660
 lifeboat hello my name is olivier 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.150
 katalin and I am a state patent a 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.100
 rowing monitor is so today 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.079
 we will show you the use of 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.180
 boat especially the gestures 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.530
 techniques to make it easy 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.530
 used accessible to everyone 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.910
 so we left for our outing to 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.820
 move the boat forward we will come 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.750
 group and legs in front we will come 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.330
 hold out your arms 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.369
 m these oars in the water and then we go 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.020
 come to be able to push with his feet on 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.990
 the board of foot so we will wait 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.570
 legs keeping arms well 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.340
 tense and keeping your back straight 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.830
 so we push on people makes you 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.659
 to advance the boat one pushes one pushes 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.369
 on the legs we open a little body 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.080
 and in the end we hold a little bit on 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.840
 arms and another rowing 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.060
 effect we took the oars out of the water to 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.700
 not braked and the boat slips and so 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.470
 forward then we will redo the gesture a 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.090
 a little bit the opposite we will come tender 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.229
 arms 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.570
 swing the shoulders over the 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.039
 pelvis and come bend the legs and we 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.740
 feel the boat slipping under the 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.929
 buttocks and we start again a blow 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.690
 the oars in the water the legs are 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:50.110
 bent the arms are stretched the right doe 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.899
 and we push on people we keep 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:58.479
 arms well tense back in support and we 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:01.390
 redo rowing again and 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.890
 it's gone to row as much time 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.890
 we want and have fun 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.539
 so what's important in rowing 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.790
 it must be kept in mind that this is 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.860
 a sport of sliding a sport one must 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.879
 to please and it is also a sport 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.069
 that makes all parties work 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.560
 of the body to advance his boat 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.239
 the most important thing is to succeed in 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.760
 well push on his legs and have 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.470
 the back supports it so that 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.709
 the force is transmitted at the level of 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.069
 ram in rowing one pushes especially with his 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.590
 legs 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.000
 then the back also work a part 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.830
 time and arms are just coming 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.650
 Finally the plane hit must not 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.420
 look to pull too much on the arms he 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.099
 must really try to push with 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.519
 the whole body and mainly 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.519
 legs 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.500
 in fact rowing is a sport of 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:12.030
 slip and we have a time in the water the 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.500
 propulsion phase that goes that considers 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.180
 that it's a time for two times out 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.850
 water where we recover that is to say that 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.040
 the phase where we are in the air we come back 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.280
 on the back of the boat she is over 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.320
 slow than the phase where we draw then the 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.230
 difficulty of rowing is that we have 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.960
 trend when we start wanting 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.490
 shoot with his arms when in fact the 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.390
 propulsion of a rowing boats she 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.740
 is ensured at 70% by the legs and 25% 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.040
 with the back 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.100
 the difficulty is to transmit 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.450
 power is there the power of the legs 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.590
 in environments then for that 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.750
 must keep the back straight 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.000
 the first time of rowing are 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.530
 only the legends who works I 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.940
 go very slowly there and it's really 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.030
 when the legs are stretched that the 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.730
 So flex brave the heavy 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.090
 work is done by the legs and 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.340
 I still do it in slow motion there and it's 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.800
 on the end we think and finish 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:16.160
 here and then have to have hands 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:21.570
 pass the knees and then we flex 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:24.030
 legs a rower who starts he goes 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.260
 tend to want to come back very 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.970
 quickly on the back 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.070
 so he will lift his legs and obviously 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.690
 the arms do not pass anymore while the 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.750
 good sequence is first the arms 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:38.300
 arms stretched and then we come back all 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.300
 gently and let the boat net 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.100
 2 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.250
 no
