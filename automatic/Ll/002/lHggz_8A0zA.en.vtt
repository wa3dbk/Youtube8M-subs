now<00:01:25.860> what<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:26.939> think<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.240> reason<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
now what do you think the reason is and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.109 
now what do you think the reason is and
then<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.380> will<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.250> know<00:01:29.369> be<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:29.729> I

then we will like you know be like I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.420 
then we will like you know be like I
guess<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.780> not<00:01:30.930> as<00:01:31.110> motivated<00:01:31.320> as<00:01:31.740> before<00:01:32.250> you

guess we not as motivated as before you
know<00:01:32.549> that's<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.939> main<00:01:33.119> reason<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
know that's the main reason so but I

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.710 
know that's the main reason so but I
think<00:01:35.369> for<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.790> tournament<00:01:36.030> both<00:01:36.420> Daniel
