 It does the many as consultation from customers 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:27.019
 Recently, the fuel consumption has dropped, and the shock of the mission has become very anxious 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:31.160
 There is a consultation such as that the abnormal noise from the engine is very anxious or the white smoke comes out 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:37.430
 White smoke came out of the 5 car muffler 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.760
 I don't feel like the sound of the engine has become a bit noisy compared to the beginning

 I thought that 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:51.690
 What is the high-performance engine of a recent car ? 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:55.130
 The salt is well dependent on performance so the oil bank is of course included in its addition 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.970
 The additives contained in the

 Eco facts appear one after another by singing 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:26.050
 Hearing that oil washes the inside of the engine and the carbon dioxide discarded has been reduced 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.190
 I will 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:36.730
 The engine is also delighted by the improved combustion efficiency 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.730
 It will also lead to the improvement of the endurance life of the car

 Dirt that can not be removed by machine cleaning 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.280
 Break down the oxide by running 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.540
 I will reduce and wash 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.460
 It is generated by the generation of metal abrasion powder and the participation of oil 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.000
 Reduce deposits and deposits 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:42.590
 Keep the engine live in a clean environment 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.670
 Moreover , the volume of oxide is prevented by continuing use

 Engine note this has become a tremendous quiet 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:58.720
 It was the fuel consumption of that, but I measured the empi to that one, but this improved dramatically 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.630
 Beneath Nichia most no longer have seed
