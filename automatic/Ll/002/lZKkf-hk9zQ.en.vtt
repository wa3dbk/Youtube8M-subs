00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.920
 from the age of seven the format of the table 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.890
 tooth becomes trapezoidal 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.110
 this format goes until the age of 14 already 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.200
 from the age of 15 the dental table 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.660
 begins to have the triangular shape observed 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.610
 this detail as you can see the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.950
 The teeth of the corners have the shape 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.250
 triangular with the vertex of the 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.670
 triangle points outwardly on the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.309
 center the vertex points inward that 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.019
 format goes to 17 years 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.120
 age 18 to 22 approximately 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.970
 dental table has the shape of a triangle 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.690
 isosceles ie the sides are more 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.940
 completed and equal and the base is less 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.530
 these forms are subjective and therefore 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.190
 difficult to judge 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.680
 they serve as an aid to assessing 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.380
 age we should only take into account 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.430
 the incisor teeth that are the teeth of the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.220
 front 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.950
 they are six in number so much above 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.140
 how much underneath most 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.290
 Comments should be made on the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.280
 the animal's lower jaw 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.640
 be easier to check out this madiba 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.600
 Let's study the teeth in detail. 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.100
 of the extremities are called corners 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.100
 these others who are beside the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.170
 are referred to as middles and the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.020
 central are the calipers 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.619
 from now on we will only use these 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.079
 terminologies these two teeth that 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.539
 are located after the corners that 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.090
 are different from those with 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.890
 acute are the canines 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.259
 they are born at the age of five 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.060
 about 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.070
 these teeth are rarely present 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.020
 in females 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.030
 notice these two jaws 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.420
 left has only remnants of the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.640
 canines was from a female already the mandible 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.039
 the right has the canines well 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.000
 therefore probably 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.000
 animal was male
