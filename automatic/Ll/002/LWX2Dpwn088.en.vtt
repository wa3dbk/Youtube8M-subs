00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
it can be really helpful yeah I think

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.560 
it can be really helpful yeah I think
some<00:00:19.470> fraternities<00:00:19.920> are<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.190> campus<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.760> not

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
some fraternities are on campus have not

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.600 
some fraternities are on campus have not
naming<00:00:21.840> any<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.440> think<00:00:22.740> some<00:00:22.950> have<00:00:23.190> a<00:00:23.220> bit

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
naming any but I think some have a bit

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.050 
naming any but I think some have a bit
of<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.760> negative<00:00:23.940> reputation<00:00:24.330> because<00:00:25.020> of<00:00:25.289> past

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
of a negative reputation because of past

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.689 
of a negative reputation because of past
easing<00:00:27.740> rumors<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.949> stuff<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.670> know

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
easing rumors and stuff or you know

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.900 
easing rumors and stuff or you know
suspensions<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.440> think<00:00:31.680> overall<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
suspensions but I think overall the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.030 
suspensions but I think overall the
opportunities<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.540> campus<00:00:33.720> aren't<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.290> bad<00:00:34.440> so

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
opportunities on campus aren't so bad so

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.670 
opportunities on campus aren't so bad so

it's definitely a good way to get

it's definitely a good way to get
involved<00:01:31.130> Jamie<00:01:31.490> I<00:01:31.850> think<00:01:32.149> they<00:01:32.240> do<00:01:32.299> a<00:01:32.420> lot<00:01:32.750> to

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
involved Jamie I think they do a lot to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.499 
involved Jamie I think they do a lot to
offer<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.500> community<00:01:34.040> but<00:01:34.250> it<00:01:34.610> is<00:01:35.180> a<00:01:35.210> very

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
offer to the community but it is a very

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.490 
offer to the community but it is a very
huge<00:01:35.720> time<00:01:35.930> commitment

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
huge time commitment

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.080 
huge time commitment
and<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.070> think<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.370> for<00:01:38.520> people<00:01:38.700> who<00:01:38.880> are

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and I think it's for people who are

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.060 
and I think it's for people who are
willing<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.780> channel<00:01:40.230> their<00:01:40.350> energy<00:01:40.380> more

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
willing to channel their energy more

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.270 
willing to channel their energy more

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
towards one things as it was for someone

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
know as the old saying goes it's not

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.589

I<00:02:43.620> think<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.680> Greek<00:02:44.890> life<00:02:45.040> is<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.220> great<00:02:45.340> thing

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
I think the Greek life is a great thing

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.970 
I think the Greek life is a great thing
on<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:46.030> lot<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.480> people<00:02:46.780> especially<00:02:47.319> since<00:02:47.890> I'm

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
on a lot of people especially since I'm

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.949 
on a lot of people especially since I'm
a<00:02:48.040> music<00:02:48.310> major<00:02:48.430> they're<00:02:48.700> very<00:02:49.060> compliant<00:02:49.720> by

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
a music major they're very compliant by

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.750 
a music major they're very compliant by
who<00:02:50.739> they<00:02:50.860> hang<00:02:51.010> out<00:02:51.160> with<00:02:51.280> because<00:02:51.400> of<00:02:51.579> their

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
who they hang out with because of their

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.039 
who they hang out with because of their
major<00:02:51.940> because<00:02:52.150> their<00:02:52.390> schedules

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
major because their schedules

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.229 
major because their schedules
I<00:02:53.079> think<00:02:53.560> brief<00:02:53.769> life<00:02:54.040> allows<00:02:54.459> everybody<00:02:55.090> to

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
I think brief life allows everybody to

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.550 
I think brief life allows everybody to
kind<00:02:55.390> of<00:02:55.480> come<00:02:55.660> together<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:56.019> one<00:02:56.140> place<00:02:56.290> and

at<00:04:06.740> college<00:04:07.100> I<00:04:07.430> do<00:04:07.790> think<00:04:08.210> Greek<00:04:08.420> life<00:04:08.660> is

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
at college I do think Greek life is

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.720 
at college I do think Greek life is
worthwhile<00:04:09.080> you<00:04:09.590> make<00:04:09.770> great<00:04:09.980> friends<00:04:10.190> and

worthwhile you make great friends and
it's<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.060> way<00:04:11.210> to<00:04:11.270> get<00:04:11.510> connected<00:04:11.990> especially

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
it's the way to get connected especially

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.880 
it's the way to get connected especially
when<00:04:12.530> you<00:04:12.650> first<00:04:13.190> come<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.430> Jammu<00:04:13.940> I

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
when you first come to Jammu I

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.870 
when you first come to Jammu I
personally<00:04:15.890> just<00:04:15.920> don't<00:04:16.280> have<00:04:16.610> time<00:04:16.820> for

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
personally just don't have time for

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.530 
personally just don't have time for
Greek<00:04:17.299> life<00:04:17.510> because<00:04:18.020> theater<00:04:18.790> life<00:04:19.790> takes<00:04:20.270> up

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
Greek life because theater life takes up

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.840 
Greek life because theater life takes up
all<00:04:20.810> my<00:04:20.870> time

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
all my time

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.210 
all my time
but<00:04:22.850> there<00:04:23.210> are<00:04:23.330> people<00:04:23.480> who<00:04:23.870> are<00:04:24.650> able<00:04:24.680> to

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
but there are people who are able to

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.940 
but there are people who are able to
kind<00:04:25.580> of<00:04:25.670> balance<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:26.330> two<00:04:26.540> and<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:27.620> feel<00:04:27.830> like

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
kind of balance the two and I feel like

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.070 
kind of balance the two and I feel like
if<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:28.520> fits<00:04:28.730> your<00:04:28.820> personality<00:04:29.030> then<00:04:29.900> it's

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
if it fits your personality then it's

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.960 
if it fits your personality then it's
definitely<00:04:30.590> worthwhile<00:04:30.770> but<00:04:31.580> if<00:04:31.700> there<00:04:31.880> are

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
definitely worthwhile but if there are

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.280 
definitely worthwhile but if there are
other<00:04:32.120> things<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.540> you're<00:04:32.660> more<00:04:32.840> interested
