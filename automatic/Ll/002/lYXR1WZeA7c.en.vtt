00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello guys are the welcome girls 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.650
 once again to cook with darío this 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.870
 Once we are going to make one of the dishes 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.379
 more traditional of Italy than 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.619
 We speak 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.599
 labruce that is the bros that is 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:18.289
 clearly European ingredients 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.060
 Italians but that has an ingredient 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:25.830
 South American that gave reinforcement to all 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.189
 this elaboration and that left a mark 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.439
 very deep the pomodoro not in Italian 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.680
 the tomato is called as hard and follow me 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.650
 to teach him the ingredients for 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.520
 perform our bruschetta we need 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.320
 basil leafs and basil flowers 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.040
 we throw kalamata olives too 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.520
 called olives olives or olives 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.860
 botija in Peru we are some tomatoes 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.710
 expert type chopped garlic we need 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.950
 balsamic vinegar olive oil and a 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.510
 good loaf of bread then with these 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.650
 ingredients we proceed to perform 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.620
 our 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.360
 bruce that is good continuing with 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.270
 our recipe let's proceed to 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.850
 process our tomato by cutting and 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.520
 doing 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:24.670
 a with tomato coffee but with skin and 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.610
 with pep to the pepa to carry certain 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.970
 acidity to this elaboration and we're going to 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.549
 proceed to reserve it in a bowl for 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.850
 can then mix all our 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.220
 ingredients in that position to 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.720
 then we do the same with 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.540
 our kalamata olives 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.480
 we split them in half and then 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.460
 we proceed to give him a chopping does not have 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.010
 that being a sin a bit too much 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.660
 often because what we want is that 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:00.970
 have texture and feel good and 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.730
 recognize what ingredient 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.820
 depending on the plate that we are 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.580
 elaborating then the same way 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.130
 we proceed 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.590
 to add all the ingredients inside 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.630
 of our vote continuing with our 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.360
 recipe let's add a little bit of 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.380
 our chopped garlic inside our 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.320
 elaboration and let's let it be there 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.210
 to then mix it with the last 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.200
 ingredient that we would miss that would be 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.810
 the basil the balsamic and the oil of 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.630
 olive good here we have our loaf 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.010
 of bread let's cut here a good one 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.500
 slice of bread that is something thick what 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.600
 it feels good bread we already have a fan 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.690
 fabulous that we do them they have the 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.040
 recipe already there in the channel and they can 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.930
 perform it at any time then 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.840
 this bread we had with a little 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.659
 and nothing else we are going to 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.540
 pass a little garlic not too much 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:08.730
 but just a touch so you can 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.319
 perfumed and we take it to grilling in a 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.140
 in a machine it will be for ninis that a 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.210
 then we show it 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.880
 below inside our grill 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.480
 let's add our pancito and go 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.230
 to let him seal for a few minutes and 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.060
 then we turn it to change the 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.060
 squares and form a good grip 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.970
 as we can see already our bread has been 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.910
 marked let's just give it 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.280
 change the address and finish 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.370
 grilling to get a gang very 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.409
 beautiful 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.590
 as we can see we already have our 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:49.140
 Toast or our grilled bread are going to 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.420
 reserve it there a little way and 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.099
 we will proceed to continue this 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.739
 elaboration remember that the olives 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.330
 they have salt point then we are not going to 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.239
 add too much salt simply to 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.430
 end to rectify let's stir 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.790
 all the ingredients we leave there 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.450
 one minute we take our little leaves 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.470
 basil 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.800
 perfect and we will roll them 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.540
 in this way we do as it is a 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.669
 kind of 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:24.490
 carlotto to then process to take out 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:28.539
 some birds siphon 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:32.050
 is how you call this cut in sheets and 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:35.199
 So, here we have some guys 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.960
 sometimes very beautiful basil ranging 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.830
 to scent this elaboration very well 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.400
 then we add them 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.390
 we also add a little oil 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.390
 olive 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:53.740
 and we are going to add vinegar also 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.360
 balsamic a few droplets so that it 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.360
 mix then gentlemen this 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.650
 elaboration has very very flavors 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:06.370
 strong with a lot of much like 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.790
 I tell them personality then 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.620
 continue with the next step 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.710
 continuing with our recipe we are going to 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.230
 give you here a little equal to 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.390
 our bread because always good the stick 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.370
 it's not always the same here we're going to give it 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.040
 also a small equality and is a 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.690
 our parents and there we already have some 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.349
 pretty croutons, let's cut them like this 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.720
 in 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:34.390
 rectangles we leave it here 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.430
 we have another bread they look 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.890
 the word bruschetta I will explain 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.710
 a little bit comes from the word brochado 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.810
 what does a little burned mean 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.000
 then as practically toasted 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.570
 then that bread is toasted and there what 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.110
 we have let's leave it here for 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.730
 our plate we will accommodate to see if 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.820
 is that we can accommodate him for this 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.280

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.560
 perfect there are six toasts are going to be 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:07.300

 be a nice perfect sample there 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:16.190
 then simply what we have to 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:19.160
