00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
with the current economic climate it's

with the current economic climate it's
not<00:00:20.250> really<00:00:20.490> viable<00:00:20.730> at<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.240> stage<00:00:21.480> for

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
not really viable at this stage for

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.679

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
so with that in mind they now need to

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.040 
so with that in mind they now need to
look<00:00:26.820> at<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> long-term<00:00:27.330> cost<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.900> ownership

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050

and<00:00:28.500> we've<00:00:29.130> seen<00:00:29.340> certain<00:00:30.029> trends<00:00:30.210> into

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
and we've seen certain trends into

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.139 
and we've seen certain trends into
investing<00:00:31.380> into<00:00:31.500> service<00:00:31.949> contracts<00:00:32.550> which

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
costs have become very important to me

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.540 
costs have become very important to me
just<00:00:39.090> through<00:00:39.469> having<00:00:40.469> running<00:00:41.250> older

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550

probably<00:01:50.549> fundamentally<00:01:51.149> driven<00:01:51.479> by<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
probably fundamentally driven by the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.539 
probably fundamentally driven by the
multinational<00:01:52.310> supermarkets<00:01:53.310> they're

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
multinational supermarkets they're

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.510 
multinational supermarkets they're
driving<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.210> costs<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.649> end<00:01:56.070> produce

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
driving the costs of the end produce

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.270 
driving the costs of the end produce
down<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> final<00:01:57.450> penso<00:01:57.990> milk<00:01:58.710> producers

and bearable producers and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.570 
and bearable producers and
alike<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.680> being<00:02:01.860> driven<00:02:02.070> down<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
alike have being driven down to the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.150 
alike have being driven down to the
final<00:02:03.270> costs<00:02:03.720> of<00:02:03.870> what<00:02:04.020> they<00:02:04.140> produce<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:05.040> in

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
final costs of what they produce so in

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.650 
final costs of what they produce so in
turn<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.730> the<00:02:05.880> farmer<00:02:06.240> needs<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.570> know

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
turn the the farmer needs to know

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.810 
turn the the farmer needs to know
the<00:02:06.810> cost<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.200> their<00:02:07.350> machinery<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.399> entering

the cost of their machinery and entering

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.249 
the cost of their machinery and entering

to a service agreement they can

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.960 
to a service agreement they can
understand<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.920> costs<00:02:11.400> are<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.850> out

what<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:15.000> schemes<00:02:15.780> are<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.530> basically<00:02:17.160> full

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
what the schemes are is basically full

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.720 
what the schemes are is basically full
manufacturers<00:02:18.690> backed<00:02:18.990> warranty<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.100> there's

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
manufacturers backed warranty so there's

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.160 
manufacturers backed warranty so there's
very<00:02:21.030> very<00:02:21.120> few<00:02:21.360> exclusions<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.470> those<00:02:22.709> and

very very few exclusions in those and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.800 
very very few exclusions in those and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
what the benefits of that is when our

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.870 
what the benefits of that is when our
