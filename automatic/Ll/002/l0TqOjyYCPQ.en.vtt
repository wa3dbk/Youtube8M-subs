00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:04.670
 To counteract the problems associated with resin use 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.470
 come 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.280
 The PGO has agreed to be developed and patented by Bishop 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:15.459
 Used to remove old resin from the surface of the ball 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.490
 in the delivery of pit often 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.330
 No user manual is provided which is simply the time 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.009
 Peep show is often served 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.619
 First, the main switch is turned from position 0 to 1 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.279
 then the green will be 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.750
 which starts the machine 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.670
 the ball is held like this 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.310
 that the warm air 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.100
 Softens the resin 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.300
 when the resin is softened 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.250
 which takes a few seconds 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.250
 becomes the softened area 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.020
 turned against the brush 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.400
 we held against the rotating brush 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.450
 whereby the old resin from the surface of the bath becomes the Fed 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.970
 The ball is also removed from the brush 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.970
 and a new area will lie 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.740
 after just a few seconds 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.649
 he can be seen again percent Hartz disappears from the ball 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.490
 follow our guidelines for everything 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.490
 the old resin disappears without effort 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.290
 the process 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.430
 continued 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.790
 until the whole ball 2 of Hartz is the sample surface of the ball he holds it 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.140
 the original form 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.110
 and the surface is soft again and of high quality 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.700
 the life is extended and the ball behind can not be black 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.760
 Resin drove 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.760
 at the hall floor more 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.280
 if the ball for Lich is clean 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.600
 the table is switched off with a press of the routes switch 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.759
 you should wish to secure the machine against further use 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:16.119
 a padlock can be easily adorned at the main switch and 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.979
 this prevents improper use
