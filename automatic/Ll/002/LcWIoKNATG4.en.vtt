00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
areas but in all others it's kind of

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.349 
areas but in all others it's kind of
similar<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.960> i'll<00:00:22.680> explain<00:00:22.830> what<00:00:23.250> i<00:00:23.279> mean<00:00:23.369> so

as you will see on here the main parts

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.630 
as you will see on here the main parts
of<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> car<00:00:27.840> like<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.830> main<00:00:29.010> features

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
of the car like that the main features

of that specific bumper a specific hood

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.090 
of that specific bumper a specific hood
they<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.480> they're<00:00:34.020> very<00:00:34.200> similar<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.070> way

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
they have they're very similar in a way

the front of the car and the spoiler

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.860 
the front of the car and the spoiler
being<00:00:40.890> higher<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.030> bonnet<00:00:42.390> having<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
being higher and the bonnet having the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.139 
being higher and the bonnet having the
funnel<00:00:43.260> for<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.649> breathe<00:00:43.829> underwater

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
funnel for it to breathe underwater

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.209 
funnel for it to breathe underwater
those<00:00:45.149> parts<00:00:45.660> are<00:00:45.750> very<00:00:46.050> similar<00:00:46.379> across<00:00:46.860> all

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
those parts are very similar across all

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.790 
those parts are very similar across all
spattered<00:00:48.120> all<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> cars<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.379> spec

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
spattered all of the cars in that spec

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830 
spattered all of the cars in that spec
and<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.399> kind<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.239> way<00:00:51.390> because

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and I kind of like that in a way because

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.600 
and I kind of like that in a way because
it<00:00:52.110> allows<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.620> keep<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.949> main<00:00:53.190> feature

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
it allows you to keep the main feature

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.790 
it allows you to keep the main feature
of<00:00:53.789> wanting<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.510> part<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.079> still<00:00:55.469> fits

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
of wanting that part but it still fits

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.860 
of wanting that part but it still fits
that<00:00:56.129> guy<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.820> get<00:00:56.969> what<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.120> mean<00:00:57.210> say<00:00:57.780> for

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that guy if you get what I mean say for

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.920 
that guy if you get what I mean say for
example<00:00:57.899> you're<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.520> very<00:00:59.930> very

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
example you're going to get very very

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.450 
example you're going to get very very
difference<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.559> between<00:01:01.800> Carter<00:01:02.070> mean<00:01:02.280> you're

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
difference in between Carter mean you're

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.609 
difference in between Carter mean you're
not<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.789> put<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.030> Camaro<00:01:03.510> bumper<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.170> the

not going to put a Camaro bumper on the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.850 
not going to put a Camaro bumper on the
front<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.400> 370z<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:07.200> that's<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> main

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
front of a 370z but that's the main

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.660 
front of a 370z but that's the main
reason<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.159> want<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.369> show<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
reason I want to show you the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.000 
reason I want to show you the
customization<00:01:09.299> clip<00:01:09.689> which<00:01:09.869> tunas<00:01:10.439> sent<00:01:10.830> in

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
customization clip which tunas sent in

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.570 
customization clip which tunas sent in
once<00:01:11.280> again<00:01:11.490> over<00:01:11.960> 370<00:01:12.960> z<00:01:13.170> now<00:01:13.860> what<00:01:14.430> I've

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
once again over 370 z now what I've

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
once again over 370 z now what I've
noticed<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.299> handling<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.810> 370z<00:01:16.350> as

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
noticed with the handling of 370z as

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.649 
noticed with the handling of 370z as
well<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:16.979> much<00:01:17.250> lighter<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:18.030> haven't<00:01:18.570> had

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
well is it's much lighter I haven't had

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.660 
well is it's much lighter I haven't had
the<00:01:18.810> chance<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.200> drive<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.799> lighter<00:01:20.070> car<00:01:20.430> yet

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the chance to drive a lighter car yet

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.749 
the chance to drive a lighter car yet
and<00:01:20.850> going<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.360> be<00:01:21.479> buying<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:22.700> r34<00:01:23.700> skyline

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
and going to be buying a r34 skyline

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.330 
and going to be buying a r34 skyline
later<00:01:24.689> today<00:01:24.990> for<00:01:25.290> when<00:01:25.740> i'm<00:01:25.860> doing<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.189> video

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
later today for when i'm doing a video

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.120 
later today for when i'm doing a video
but<00:01:27.240> i'm<00:01:28.020> gonna<00:01:28.229> make<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.590> video<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.950> kind<00:01:29.100> of

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
but i'm gonna make a video and kind of

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.920 
but i'm gonna make a video and kind of
like<00:01:29.340> comparing<00:01:29.820> how<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> handling<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.689> but

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
like comparing how the handling is but

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.380 
like comparing how the handling is but
by<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.110> looks<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.220> 370z<00:01:32.909> doesn't

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
by the looks of it the 370z doesn't

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.469 
by the looks of it the 370z doesn't
slide<00:01:33.750> as<00:01:33.990> much<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.680> doesn't<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.820> know<00:01:35.850> flop

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
slide as much it doesn't you know flop

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.420 
slide as much it doesn't you know flop
around<00:01:36.659> as<00:01:37.049> much<00:01:37.200> as<00:01:37.380> my<00:01:37.560> Camaro<00:01:37.979> does<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
around as much as my Camaro does and

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.950 
around as much as my Camaro does and
that's<00:01:38.579> probably<00:01:38.939> because<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.630> lot

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
that's probably because it's a lot

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.770 
that's probably because it's a lot
lighter<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:41.009> i'm<00:01:41.369> wondering<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.630> actually

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
lighter but i'm wondering if it actually

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.060 
lighter but i'm wondering if it actually
gives<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.290> much<00:01:43.470> more<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.710> an<00:01:43.799> advantage

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
gives you much more of an advantage

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.609 
gives you much more of an advantage
because<00:01:44.340> what<00:01:44.579> I've<00:01:44.700> noticed<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.259> 370z<00:01:46.259> s<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
because what I've noticed is 370z s that

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.490 
because what I've noticed is 370z s that
I've<00:01:46.770> raced<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.700> much<00:01:48.210> faster<00:01:48.540> much<00:01:48.960> more

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500

maneuverable<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.460> I'm<00:01:50.850> really<00:01:51.090> wondering<00:01:51.450> if

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
maneuverable and I'm really wondering if

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.230 
maneuverable and I'm really wondering if
I<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:52.950> kind<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.399> catch<00:01:53.610> up<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:53.970> with

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
I can kind of catch up to that with

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.819 
I can kind of catch up to that with
upgrading<00:01:54.689> parts<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> can't<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.710> level

something that's kind of making me
