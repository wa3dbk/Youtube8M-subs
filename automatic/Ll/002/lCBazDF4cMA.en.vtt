00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.190
 welcome to the project's site, the 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.670
 DC home.de 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.090
 Here you will find a lot of information 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:21.720
 videos texts pictures tests and so on 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.029
 on the topic DC house now likes 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.029
 many ask themselves a direct current 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.230
 what is that now that is one 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.010
 really unique project worldwide 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.739
 I will be an existing one 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.960
 family house with many 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.800
 equip solar modules and the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.420
 DC current through these solar modules 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.280
 it will not be produced 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.089
 converted into ac no 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.859
 is consumed directly in the house 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.239
 through these lines can become 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.030
 no alternating current flow but 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.679
 DC and all devices are themselves 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.319
 here are included 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:04.199
 heating control and what it all 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:09.150
 in a household who give about this 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.820
 direct solar power run and what else 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.870
 unique is not the videos 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.730
 produce the goods including the 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.140
 cut calculator and so on with one 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.470
 solar power operated that is the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.380
 camera right now she is running her 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.030
 energy from the sun 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:32.490
 the server on the whole housing up 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.100
 he charged on co2 so be there 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.240
 this project is really unique 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.430
 and I try within a year 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.010
 this project completely finished too 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.510
 Do not get that house with everything 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:51.090
 What's going on in DC over here 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:54.640
 that I have a mobility over 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.840
 DC and that 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.490
 when i get a movie at the end of the year 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.640
 publish a documentary by 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.709
 almost 90 minutes amount he will also 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.280
 completely produced with solar power 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.160
 his 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.110
 so be it rome it rome 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.240
 there are loads of videos there are each 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.780
 a lot of information to get yourself 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.670
 can and a lot of instructive me 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.709
 I am looking forward to this project 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.709
 while the sun is shining for us
