00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:12.599
 show how to put a roof exit 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:15.150
 aulas move on a slate roof 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.150
 to travel obviously I needed 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.400
 find the placo and that's for good 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.000
 it's not a big deal on simple fermera 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.529
 so to put a touch there he goes 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.099
 first you have to calculate there is 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.289
 the slope of your roof a formula that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.719
 is relatively simple we measure the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.149
 distance in height on a point on 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.640
 measure to one meter and there is a formula 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.730
 mathematical that lets you know if your 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.100
 jobs does between 0 and 30 degrees which 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.350
 will make a first warmer there 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.510
 relatively flat or a slope of 30 to 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.090
 45 degrees so there you will have a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.579
 beaujolais who will have another hour more 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.289
 important values here we are on 34% 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.250
 slope 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.570
 so I'm showing you pretty much what 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.050
 it will give one time asked about the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.140
 roofing 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.080
 so that's the roof plant years 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.850
 that she had and inside will come 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.979
 week so we see in the alignment 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:15.210
 there the leads not that is the soil 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.400
 a sonar hat the stainless steel tube that 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.720
 will come inside and that is going to be 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.180
 fixed big fixing brackets which 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.619
 will come to adapt on the side 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.640
 one of the brackets we see 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.259
 that they are there is a hole is a point 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.920
 it allows once it is asked 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.159
 to adjust the inclination it goes like 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.729
 that on the roof is like that with the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.250
 system can be adjusted so 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.990
 as your exit from your roof exit 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.630
 ie the conduit knox m'assois 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.270
 well 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.100
 be well level what finally to plumb in 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.390
 definitive since we do not speak of 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.750
 levels but plumb on there on that one 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.460
 so here I am preparing you everything and then 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.159
 we go to the next step we go 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.409
 remove the slates so there we go 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.939
 go outside with a ladder 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.920
 of you of course and we will hang on 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.810
 also routed with a rope for 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.810
 stay safe at all times
