00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.500
 powerful option for a smartphone such 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.300

 RAM and device one 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.120
 gigabyte whereas the amount of internal 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.100
 flash memory is 4 gigabytes it can be 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.660
 increase there is a card slot 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.270

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.910
 gigabyte 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.430
 set of additional features is pretty

 Wi-Fi and bluetooth 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.920
 Not without the support of two 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.350
 sim cards since the gadget only has 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.180
 one radio module when talking one by one 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.400
 from simok or when working in the Internet 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.040
 the second card will be out 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.010
 network coverage in standby mode both 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.690
 sim cards are available note that one slot 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.050
 supports work in networks of the second and 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.750
 third generation 2g and 3g 2 works 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.370
 only with 2g network maps in highscreen 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.340
 boost operating system installed 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.110
 android version 412 jellybin 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.910
 that is one of the freshest 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.840
 various services supported 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.030
 google companies 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.650
 This smartphone has the most capacious 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.940
 battery that can be found in 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.709
 currently its capacity is 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.050
 4160 milliampere hour with active 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.959
 load and 10 12 hours 3g 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.000
 20-30 minutes talk per day 5 6 hours 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.950
 Wi fi execution of operations in the menu and with 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.709
 applications such a number 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.810
 discharged at the end of the second day of the case 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.660
 normal use boost lifetime 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.790
 batteries forces in up to 6 days for 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.370
 calls and infrequent attacks into the network 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.150
 highscreen and maybe enough further on 9 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.880
 10 days 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.460
 so the conclusion of the advantages of a long 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.050
 an average work time of 45 days is good 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.660
 screen for a smartphone this price 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.139
 categories of support for two simok loud 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.720
 speaker 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.979
 absolutely not heated there is a slot for 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.169
 micro sd cards 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.120
 the disadvantages are not very 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.770
 quality camera also when 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.410
 maximum volume noticeable 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.330
 deteriorating quality of the main dynamics in 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.370
 as a result, we have quite modern 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.110
 smartphone of the middle class which is to 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.760
 can work very long without 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.190
 recharge up to a week 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.139
 if you are satisfied with the weight of its dimensions 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:03.410
 highscreen boost then this unit can 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.410
 feel free to take it cost about 9000 rubles
