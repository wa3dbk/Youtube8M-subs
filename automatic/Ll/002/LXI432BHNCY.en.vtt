00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.750
 Hello everyone and welcome back to the canal 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.950
 today I will make you the video with swaps on 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.019
 lips and on the hand 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.300
 of all the new lipsticks is that 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.980
 milla have just come out of myth arrived 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.960
 so this morning the store will be a 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.140
 video to let you see colors not for 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.060
 talk about the estate and what exactly 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.590
 I definitely think of these lipsticks 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.869
 because in fact he had no way to 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.119
 try them what I can tell you is that 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.630
 they are very creamy and contain oil 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.399
 jojoba apricot kernel oil e 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.430
 castor oil are therefore are therefore 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.200
 very irritating very comfortable on 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.050
 lips however at the same time I do not vote 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.570
 I failed in different ways on my hands and I don't know if 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.040
 it shows but it is still there because it is not because the 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.720
 store I could not send him away 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.540
 with soap and water he had to use 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.310
 a biphasic and in short some color a 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.770
 then a little darker remained 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.810
 the impression that they are very creamy 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.660
 but I go to fix myself very well 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.430
 precisely the obtained the held only 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.890
 a few minutes on the hand and if they were 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.890
 I will apply the set very well 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.200
 precisely one at a time on the lips the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.759
 packaging really delicious but they are 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.290
 a fool and I forgot to 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.179
 bring a home rearrangement only 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.780
 the text and then I'll put some photos on it 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:19.780
 now 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.550
 the price is 10 euros and 90 so a 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.260
 however competitive price I don't 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.910
 I wear nothing on my lips except a little 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.440
 of cocoa butter which he then removed with a 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.840
 tissue paper so this is the color of 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.370
 my lips have medium pigmentation 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.170
 we say only one nor too clear either 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.860
 too dark then start making you 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.290
 see the lipsticks the 0 1 and periwinkle that 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.290
 from the stick it looks like a burgundy 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.560
 very dark while once blossomed e 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.220
 on the lips it is a brown chocolate 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.190
 very intense chocolate certainly a 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.530
 autumn winter color that 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.130
 summer however a very very beautiful color 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:11.160
 very full 0 2 ounce of bread this 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:14.250
 salmon-colored coral surely this 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.100
 it is a more spring-like summer color 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.810
 and despite being lighter than periwinkle 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:25.200
 of the 0 1 has however a very color 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:30.440
 very full the number 3 was true 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.440
 this red with orange undertone 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.690
 here he is certainly not orange 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:44.730
 these are the colors best suited to me and these 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:50.610
 poppy the 0 4 years history this is a 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.590
 Orange me I compare with 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.590
 papal or the first one 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.690
 the red orange and that's the difference 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:03.480
 this and nissoria clearly more 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:06.600
 orange and this is poppy the 0 5 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.200
 starry sky is a cold baby pink 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.060
 almost a lilac once applied on 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.160
 lips 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.940
 yes this color is bad for me but for 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.860
 who in short to the right colors for these 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.720
 a nice color and despite this 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.180
 type of color both among those more 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.780
 difficult to apply because in any case a 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.990
 a 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.459
 revealed ginosa as you see has not me 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.670
 given absolutely no kind of 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:40.470
 problem in the drafting then this 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:43.500
 starry sky I'll believe 05 10 6 instead 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.590
 crazy strawberry a red indeed what 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.540
 I would define red as a red 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:54.660
 classic here too perfect drafting 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.150
 very high coverage as a texture mi 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.520
 remember I would define it as equal of 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.310
 amplified by mucke with the difference 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.459
 that the amplified that I have but don't have 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.440
 this conference the first pass then 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.370
 logically as I told you 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.350
 regarding duration 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.780
 comfort over time I will let you know 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.440
 in the next videos or on the page 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.780
 of the channel on the store's page 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.090
 find everything in the infobox the various links 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.389
 because precisely this is only one 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.990
 video to show you the colors 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:35.729
 so this repeat is beloved strawberries 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:38.790
 0 7 nigritella a less intense brown 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.940
 of periwinkle the 0 1 now I put them there to you 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.940
 comparison 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.620
 let's say the periwinkle is warmer is a 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.890
 a little bit darker while the nigritella 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.130
 this one is slightly more neutral here 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:59.450
 warm compared to periwinkle and studio 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.860
 lips are a little lighter 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.690
 sorry how lipsticks are applied but 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.970
 now by force of structures with the 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.919
 vigorously wipe mine 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.360
 no longer contour lips start at 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.690
 be on fire 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.020
 however this is the 0 8 xylene is a 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.200
 very very particular color because it is 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.150
 a marroni but seems to have reflections 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:25.229
 bronzed is now said to be compared with 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:30.120
 periwinkle and nigritella this is silene 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:32.520
 nigritella and periwinkle this is beautiful of 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:41.819
 night is a fuchsia really 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:46.919
 beautiful amaranth nice number one 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:50.639
 fuchs such as strawberry this too ve 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:53.430
 I say to do stratospheric we have 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.009
 forgotten number 10 and is at every de 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.870
 scarlet scarlet in name and in fact 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.870
 because it is a beautiful scarlet red 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:10.440
 the number two of CEO leaned a news that 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:12.389
 I would call it color u also the number 13 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.169
 ana galline is a news 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.169
 but on the rosé 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:29.180
 finally the number 14 in the mouth of a lion 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:29.180
 and it is an old rose with some brown 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:35.940
 the last a number 15 to the area and is a 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.860
 beautiful rosé because it was I don't know 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.310
 what you can see in the video camera 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:44.460
 but it has reflections almost on the lilac 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.080
 it almost looks like a duochrome lipstick though 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.779
 at the same time very discreet and 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.909
 above all they are not reflexes 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:52.860
 absolutely pads these were 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:54.690
 then all the new 15 lipsticks 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.569
 alchemilla I hope this overview 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.159
 it was useful for you is one 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:00.810
 overview not a real one 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:02.580
 review because he had no way to 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.949
 try these lipsticks that you still have 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.259
 remember they do not profess themselves as long 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:08.940
 lasting therefore do not profess themselves as 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:10.080
 very long-lasting lipsticks, however, from 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.550
 what I could see if 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.919
 associating them now that after 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.110
 rejected this morning in the store 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:19.199
 lipsticks and I have to say that I am a lot 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:22.319
 very creamy but they don't seem to run away 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:24.630
 out of the contours of the lips and 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:25.259
 above all they seem to fixate a lot 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.900
 very well 

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:32.229
 I will update you soon 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:34.840
 and here on the channel or on the page of 

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:37.270
 channel of the store you find and precisely 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.729
 in the info box you will find the various links on 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.410
 just as I will find myself later with these 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:42.580
 lipsticks will now try to test them a 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.120
 minimum and I 'll let you know 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.120
 see you soon
