00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.279
 the feet 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.470
 at 8 a.m. 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.600
 we will need 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.060
 the little ones argued 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.060
 xerox and so it will be until it expires 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.220
 It disgusts me 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.640
 and most important, some pickets to tie the ujat and eleven caldas 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.940
 We are sorry that I 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.740
 lucy his team that stays on internal hicks as ellipsis 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.740
 arum sherlock of arc 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.510
 what he knows best 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.170
 for this the lighter 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 what happened in action too many Democrats end up burning 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.310
 in this way 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.690
 seize it 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.800
 if I could 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.800
 fernando muñoz pérez 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.259
 we do not forget we drill we do not have a little bit what the contour was looked for 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.620
 so that in times of recession 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.690
 british 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.599
 let's go over 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.409
 has seen how the farms were spent one side not seen 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.049
 and maybe it's physical and logical 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.419
 remains with one thing is clear 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:44.379
 this is another step in a usual way or totanero before anything else we will do 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.519
 a zapayo shoe kitchen 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.539
 and like this simply together 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:55.149
 the junta wants to hide something from three terrorists that were left 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.509
 here it was dark 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:03.899
 and if that 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.899
 concerning 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:16.069
 today only discomfort 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.389
 st 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.389
 we spent a couple of times on youtube 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.499
 this advance as things 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.729
 after going through another side in clear you do not see me that the country passes the refugees 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:37.929
 then the passages these as thing 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.649
 that made 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:44.869
 concocer 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.869
 because it did not bear fruit 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:54.749
 in this show he started to operate 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.379
 alegret a couple of times passes them 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:02.999
 geographically distant basis what we're going to do 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:06.779
 a couple of years 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.979
 although its initial appearance 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.979
 efe after program 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:17.529
 useful ipic 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:21.499
 rejection 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:53.199
 namely 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.199
 he never forgot his sudoku character that he brought 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.330
 button 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
 brazil we forget the second 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.059
 what time itself as the robust of what it will be when defining 

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:27.050
 as the date we have here 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.090
 We're going to have to do a little bit of cachiche obama 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.159
 the woman 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:35.039
 that its function is not so that it cut us reactors three and three 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.729
 escaped to have 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.939
 and also to see the best 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:40.969
 group 8 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.699
 you will not have it easy we had to do 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.699
 only son 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:49.379
 the main part 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:53.119
 that we take we put it as if it were the most revealing caracas 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.279
 productive 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:59.949
 others 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.210
 such reason 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.639
 the mayor 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.639
 your house 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:13.919
 although these either state or 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.220
 that's why budgets a casing to extend the baby rather 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.159
 oscar schémel started walking 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:23.589
 I'm here 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:26.550
 and I take it now 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.009
 the intellectuals 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:30.419
 this merits 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.849
 iker boxes looking for the md train 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:36.989
 efe at times a site acts as michael t 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.259
 I think the house 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.860
 the sec 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.219
 forty of the sleeves almost eight times more with the current hangover 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:48.970
 After the race
