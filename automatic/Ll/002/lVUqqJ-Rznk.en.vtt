a<00:00:04.170> can<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.560> worms<00:00:04.680> recently<00:00:05.640> we've<00:00:05.850> been

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
a can of worms recently we've been

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.210 
a can of worms recently we've been
talking<00:00:06.420> about<00:00:06.480> bearing<00:00:07.109> preload<00:00:07.350> now<00:00:07.980> I'm

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
talking about bearing preload now I'm

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.070 
talking about bearing preload now I'm
going<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.490> show<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:08.820> how<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.360> adjust<00:00:09.690> the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
going to show you how to adjust the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.589 
going to show you how to adjust the
bearings<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.710> your<00:00:11.309> Land<00:00:11.820> Rover<00:00:11.940> axle

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
bearings on your Land Rover axle

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.350 
bearings on your Land Rover axle
generally<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.950> axle<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.790> requires

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
generally this is the axle that requires

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.500 
generally this is the axle that requires
n<00:00:15.750> float<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.440> not<00:00:16.470> preload<00:00:17.449> okay<00:00:18.449> so

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
n float and not preload okay so

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.029 
n float and not preload okay so
basically<00:00:19.020> first<00:00:19.320> we'll<00:00:19.590> get<00:00:19.710> our<00:00:19.830> bearings

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
basically first we'll get our bearings

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.750 
basically first we'll get our bearings
in<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.730> then<00:00:21.240> put<00:00:21.660> our<00:00:22.109> spacer<00:00:22.500> washer<00:00:22.830> which

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
in and then put our spacer washer which

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.490 
in and then put our spacer washer which
is<00:00:23.939> very<00:00:24.150> important<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.720> need<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.320> there

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
is very important you need that in there

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.490 
is very important you need that in there
if<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:25.830> fitted<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> axle<00:00:27.029> okay<00:00:27.720> now<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
if it's fitted to the axle okay now the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.040 
if it's fitted to the axle okay now the
first<00:00:28.590> nut<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.429> adjuster<00:00:30.090> nut<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.840> is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
first nut is the adjuster nut this is

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.560 
first nut is the adjuster nut this is
the<00:00:31.170> one<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.619> will<00:00:31.769> hold<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.489> end<00:00:32.850> float<00:00:33.270> on

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the one that will hold the end float on

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.720 
the one that will hold the end float on
the<00:00:34.050> bearing<00:00:34.469> okay<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.399> need<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.640> adjust

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the bearing okay so we need to adjust

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.360 
the bearing okay so we need to adjust
this<00:00:36.120> up<00:00:36.329> first<00:00:36.660> I've<00:00:37.530> got<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> socket<00:00:38.160> here

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
this up first I've got a socket here

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.330 
this up first I've got a socket here
which<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.700> 52<00:00:39.149> millimeters<00:00:39.860> also<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> half

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
which is 52 millimeters also is a half

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.819 
which is 52 millimeters also is a half
inch<00:00:41.610> drive<00:00:41.910> which<00:00:42.780> means<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.620> use<00:00:43.800> a

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
inch drive which means that I can use a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.150 
inch drive which means that I can use a
wrench<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.940> torque<00:00:45.180> wrench<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.660> and

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
wrench and a torque wrench on it and

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.369 
wrench and a torque wrench on it and

Newton meters first of all while turning
the<00:00:57.000> hub<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:58.109> will<00:00:58.350> seat<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> bearing<00:00:59.190> in

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the hub this will seat the bearing in

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.639 
the hub this will seat the bearing in
first<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.820> all<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.629> where<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.930> should<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.199> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
first of all to where it should be and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.050 
first of all to where it should be and
settle<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.309> alright<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.210> do<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.290> twice<00:01:05.060> click

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
settle it alright I do this twice click

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240 
settle it alright I do this twice click
it<00:01:06.180> twice<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:06.689> turn<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> next

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
it twice then turn it then the next

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.480 
it twice then turn it then the next
thing<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:09.000> turn<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.600> off<00:01:09.720> by<00:01:10.020> 90<00:01:10.830> degrees

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
thing to do is turn it off by 90 degrees

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.859 
thing to do is turn it off by 90 degrees
so<00:01:11.880> actually<00:01:12.270> what<00:01:12.390> you're<00:01:12.510> doing<00:01:12.780> is

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
so actually what you're doing is

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.710 
so actually what you're doing is
slacking<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> bearing<00:01:14.220> off<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.360> see

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
slacking the bearing off as you can see

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.830 
slacking the bearing off as you can see
there<00:01:15.990> 90<00:01:16.680> degrees<00:01:17.070> alright<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.390> already

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
there 90 degrees alright so you already

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.109 
there 90 degrees alright so you already
have<00:01:19.320> some<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.650> float<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> bearing<00:01:20.970> is

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
have some in float and the bearing is

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.249 
have some in float and the bearing is
quite<00:01:21.479> free<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:21.990> move<00:01:22.820> now<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> little

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
quite free to move now this is a little

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.719 
quite free to move now this is a little

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
you by hand by feel to get the end flow

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.889 
you by hand by feel to get the end flow
is<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.770> nip<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.549> bearing<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
is just to nip up the bearing and it

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.300 
is just to nip up the bearing and it
feels<00:01:46.229> nice<00:01:46.680> without<00:01:47.670> any<00:01:48.119> play<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:49.310> now

feels nice without any play in it now
the<00:01:50.970> reason<00:01:51.210> I've<00:01:51.329> got<00:01:51.360> an<00:01:51.570> adapter<00:01:51.840> is

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the reason I've got an adapter is

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.310 
the reason I've got an adapter is
because<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.619> actually<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:54.320> kilogram

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
because I actually have a kilogram

and it shows me what tension on putting
on<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.600> nut<00:02:04.250> there<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> little<00:02:05.670> bit<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.000> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
on the nut there is a little bit of a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.150 
on the nut there is a little bit of a
discrepancy<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.560> discovery

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
discrepancy and this is the discovery

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.100 
discrepancy and this is the discovery
which<00:02:08.489> says<00:02:08.729> tighten<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.209> four<00:02:09.450> new<00:02:09.629> meters

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
which says tighten to four new meters

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.920 
which says tighten to four new meters
which<00:02:10.349> will<00:02:10.530> give<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> hub<00:02:11.160> inflow<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.750> zero

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
which will give you a hub inflow of zero

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.289 
which will give you a hub inflow of zero
point<00:02:13.109> zero<00:02:13.409> one<00:02:13.769> of<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.980> millimeter<00:02:14.700> however

the<00:02:15.510> 300tdi<00:02:16.349> recommends<00:02:17.250> tightening<00:02:17.670> up<00:02:17.849> to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
the 300tdi recommends tightening up to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.149 
the 300tdi recommends tightening up to
ten<00:02:18.480> Newton<00:02:19.019> meters<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:19.739> is<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.040> the

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
ten Newton meters this is on the

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.720 
ten Newton meters this is on the
defender<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.379> the<00:02:22.379> other<00:02:22.560> defenders<00:02:23.159> you<00:02:23.519> can

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
defender and the other defenders you can

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.059 
defender and the other defenders you can
use<00:02:23.969> a<00:02:24.000> dial<00:02:24.480> gauge<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:25.019> get<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.379> N<00:02:25.500> float<00:02:25.829> with

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
use a dial gauge to get the N float with

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.759 
use a dial gauge to get the N float with
so<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.519> would<00:02:26.849> recommend<00:02:27.629> reading<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.379> manual

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
so I would recommend reading the manual

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.470 
so I would recommend reading the manual
and<00:02:28.980> then<00:02:29.219> going<00:02:29.609> from<00:02:29.790> there<00:02:29.879> I'm<00:02:30.239> just

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
and then going from there I'm just

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.929 
and then going from there I'm just
giving<00:02:30.719> you<00:02:30.750> an<00:02:30.900> overview<00:02:31.280> using<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.549> dial

the<00:02:35.879> Land<00:02:36.090> Rover<00:02:36.269> workshop<00:02:36.840> manuals<00:02:37.379> will

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
the Land Rover workshop manuals will

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.069 
the Land Rover workshop manuals will
give<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.730> most<00:02:39.269> accurate<00:02:39.599> way<00:02:40.049> of

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
give you the most accurate way of

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.379 
give you the most accurate way of
getting<00:02:40.530> in<00:02:40.680> float<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.280> they'll<00:02:41.489> do<00:02:41.909> this<00:02:42.180> in

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
getting in float and they'll do this in

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.240 
getting in float and they'll do this in
part<00:02:42.659> two<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.200> show<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.409> how<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.590> do<00:02:43.920> because

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
part two to show you how to do because

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.670 
part two to show you how to do because
we<00:02:44.400> need<00:02:44.579> to<00:02:44.760> learn<00:02:44.939> how<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.569> use<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.230> dial<00:02:46.560> gauge

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
we need to learn how to use a dial gauge

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.610 
we need to learn how to use a dial gauge
for<00:02:47.159> setting<00:02:47.549> things<00:02:47.760> on<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.030> land<00:02:48.299> driver

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
for setting things on a land driver

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.050 
for setting things on a land driver
anyway<00:02:49.620> back<00:02:49.889> to<00:02:49.919> the<00:02:50.159> grindstone

anyway back to the grindstone

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.500 
anyway back to the grindstone
okay<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.230> want<00:02:52.680> about<00:02:53.069> four<00:02:53.639> Newton<00:02:54.150> meters

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
okay so I want about four Newton meters

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.509 
okay so I want about four Newton meters
as<00:02:54.720> recommended<00:02:55.409> by<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.950> land<00:02:56.310> rover

just<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.650> show<00:03:10.859> you<00:03:10.919> it's<00:03:11.159> a<00:03:11.219> little<00:03:11.250> bit<00:03:11.730> tight

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
just to show you it's a little bit tight

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.580 
just to show you it's a little bit tight
than<00:03:12.239> hand<00:03:12.480> tight<00:03:12.810> did<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.109> see<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.409> I'll

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
than hand tight did you see that I'll

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.440 
than hand tight did you see that I'll
move<00:03:13.799> that<00:03:13.829> socket<00:03:14.579> with<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.760> socket<00:03:15.090> very

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
move that socket with a socket very

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.949 
move that socket with a socket very
easily<00:03:15.689> so<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.889> it<00:03:17.040> as<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.250> judge<00:03:17.909> by<00:03:18.389> hand<00:03:18.720> you

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
easily so is it as a judge by hand you

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.110 
easily so is it as a judge by hand you
could<00:03:19.109> get<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.349> socket<00:03:19.650> just<00:03:20.010> nip<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.459> up<00:03:20.609> all

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
could get the socket just nip it up all

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.589 
could get the socket just nip it up all
right<00:03:21.419> and<00:03:21.690> that's<00:03:22.290> good<00:03:22.620> enough<00:03:22.879> that<00:03:23.879> is<00:03:24.209> the

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
right and that's good enough that is the

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.960 
right and that's good enough that is the
right<00:03:24.870> adjustment<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.769> there's<00:03:26.040> no<00:03:26.250> play<00:03:26.669> on

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
right adjustment and there's no play on

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.439 
right adjustment and there's no play on
the<00:03:27.479> hub<00:03:28.189> okay<00:03:29.189> so<00:03:29.250> once<00:03:29.609> you're<00:03:29.790> happy<00:03:29.819> that

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
the hub okay so once you're happy that

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.289 
the hub okay so once you're happy that
you<00:03:30.599> have<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.019> right<00:03:31.260> end<00:03:32.099> float<00:03:32.669> then<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
you have the right end float then the

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.479 
you have the right end float then the
next<00:03:33.510> thing<00:03:33.629> to<00:03:33.780> do<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.650> fit<00:03:34.949> your<00:03:35.099> lock

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
next thing to do is to fit your lock

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.830 
adjuster nut won't move if the lock tab
is<00:03:49.439> actually<00:03:49.590> bent<00:03:49.979> down<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.459> lock<00:03:51.389> nut<00:03:51.659> is

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
is actually bent down and lock nut is

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.319 
is actually bent down and lock nut is
tightened<00:03:52.400> so<00:03:53.400> what<00:03:53.609> we're<00:03:53.759> going<00:03:53.849> to<00:03:53.909> do<00:03:54.120> this

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
tightened so what we're going to do this

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.259 
tightened so what we're going to do this
up<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:55.019> 61<00:03:55.889> Newton<00:03:56.280> meters<00:03:56.699> as<00:03:56.879> is

guess<00:04:02.669> it<00:04:02.909> basically<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:03.989> not<00:04:04.379> really<00:04:05.040> that

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
guess it basically it is not really that

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.780 
guess it basically it is not really that
tight<00:04:05.729> so<00:04:06.659> a<00:04:06.689> pull<00:04:07.229> and<00:04:07.439> click<00:04:08.129> where<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:08.519> go

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
tight so a pull and click where you go

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.089 
tight so a pull and click where you go
that's<00:04:09.239> it<00:04:09.540> that's<00:04:10.019> tight<00:04:10.439> enough<00:04:10.470> that<00:04:10.799> will

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
that's it that's tight enough that will

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.270 
that's it that's tight enough that will
hold<00:04:11.250> that<00:04:11.430> in<00:04:11.579> place<00:04:12.530> okay<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:13.590> there's<00:04:14.069> no

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
hold that in place okay so there's no

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.569

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
drag on the bearings at all and the next

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.509 
drag on the bearings at all and the next
thing<00:04:17.729> I'm<00:04:17.849> going<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:18.030> do<00:04:18.239> is<00:04:18.539> to<00:04:19.049> show<00:04:19.289> you

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
thing I'm going to do is to show you

thing I'm going to do is to show you
bending<00:04:20.519> over<00:04:20.789> the<00:04:20.820> lock<00:04:21.120> tab<00:04:21.419> in<00:04:21.690> this<00:04:22.320> manner

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
bending over the lock tab in this manner

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.730 
bending over the lock tab in this manner
and<00:04:23.130> you'll<00:04:23.969> need<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.180> chisel<00:04:24.539> to<00:04:25.110> get<00:04:25.320> in<00:04:25.500> there

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
and you'll need a chisel to get in there

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.559 
and you'll need a chisel to get in there
to<00:04:25.919> bend<00:04:26.159> it

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:26.569 
to bend it

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.270 
to bend it
what<00:04:27.569> I<00:04:27.630> usually<00:04:27.810> do<00:04:28.169> is<00:04:28.349> get<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.650> as<00:04:28.800> far<00:04:29.039> as<00:04:29.190> I

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
what I usually do is get it as far as I

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.980 
what I usually do is get it as far as I
can<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.610> then<00:04:29.910> whack<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.449> with<00:04:30.569> a<00:04:30.599> hammer<00:04:30.870> to

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
can and then whack it with a hammer to

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.309 
can and then whack it with a hammer to
get<00:04:31.229> it<00:04:31.349> flat<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:32.190> it's<00:04:32.400> on<00:04:32.610> one<00:04:33.090> flat<00:04:33.509> okay

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
get it flat so it's on one flat okay

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:38.689 
get it flat so it's on one flat okay
that's<00:04:34.979> locked<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.699> adjuster<00:04:36.419> side<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:37.699> on

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
that's locked the adjuster side and on

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.820 
that's locked the adjuster side and on
the<00:04:38.789> locknut<00:04:39.150> side<00:04:39.479> you<00:04:39.750> want<00:04:39.960> to<00:04:40.020> bend<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:40.560> the

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
the locknut side you want to bend it the

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.490 
the locknut side you want to bend it the
other<00:04:41.130> way<00:04:41.460> okay<00:04:41.910> now<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:42.569> can<00:04:42.720> get<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.050> chisel

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
other way okay now you can get a chisel

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.150 
other way okay now you can get a chisel
in<00:04:43.590> there<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.009> bend<00:04:45.000> it<00:04:45.120> over<00:04:45.270> as<00:04:45.690> such<00:04:46.620> now

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
in there and bend it over as such now

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.760 
in there and bend it over as such now
that<00:04:47.940> will<00:04:48.120> be<00:04:48.150> locked<00:04:48.509> and<00:04:48.870> we<00:04:49.410> should<00:04:49.620> be

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
that will be locked and we should be

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.770 
that will be locked and we should be
happy<00:04:49.979> that<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.370> isn't<00:04:50.699> going<00:04:50.819> to<00:04:50.910> go<00:04:51.090> anywhere
