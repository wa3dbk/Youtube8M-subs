 fit that I really like to put on 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.140
 once in a while and then this video starts 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.890
 already and well here we begin the process of 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.890
 all so 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.929
 for this delicious snack we are going to occupy 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.329
 avocado we are also going to occupy 2 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.829
 slices of sliced bread so that we 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.049
 is with a delicious flavor we are going to 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.240
 occupy two cheeses to give that touch 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.429
 super great also some seeds 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.310
 sesame seed and to give it a little 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.020
 taste a little pepper and finally 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.909
 the basil 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.460
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.799
 split the avocado in half after 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.189
 that we're going to remove the avocado from the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.549
 shell and let's break it into pieces 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.829
 young children after that we are going to prepare 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.840
 our bread mold putting cheese and 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.880
 then let's put it in our mini 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.679
 stove or a furnace so that we 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.700
 melt I know that I am cost us 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:17.220
 these great milestones then when you take them out 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.319
 of the half myth we are going to put the avocado 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.170
 over the cheese then let's cut in 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.400
 small pieces of basil leaf I seriously 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.310
 I'm telling you that the basil leaf 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.950
 is super cool in this combination and 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.829
 let's incorporate the pepper too 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.299
 let's add sesame seeds 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.220
 you have put this super food 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.700
 healthy and I know that you are going to 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.510
 love 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.519
 for dessert, I will eat blueberry 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.060
 many of these granites called 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.250
 grÃ¡ndola and also occupy this yoghurt 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.950
 super delicious I make a confession 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.019
 this is the easiest thing to do and the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.420
 that I loved the most, you just have to 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.750
 put granola on the yogurt and then give 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.250
 the fruit and put blueberries seriously 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.260
 that I liked too much this 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.280
 combination the truth is super fast 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.280
 super rich and healthy 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.770
 now I 'm going to show you my outfit this 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.480
 off I liked it very much because it has a 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.280
 basic style but it also has a 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.230
 street style and that's what I most 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.090
 like everything interesting about this 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.760
 outfit is that I will tie my shirt 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.500
 grid that is black with red but 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.450
 The most important thing of all is that you 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.520
 you feel comfortable with what you occupy and what 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.470
 that I like most of all this outfit is 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.170
 the white shirt I like to occupy 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.660
 a lot of basic clothes that do not have any 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.400
 drawing or anything like that last 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.260
 to add these shoes I like them 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.880
 very many because they hit the outfit and 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.880
 They are also super comfortable 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.550
 they know something every time I go to centers 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.860
 commercials there is always food of all 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.900
 dude there's chicken there's all this 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.940
 but my favorite snack for the afternoon 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.860
 it is delicious its great that always 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.260
 you can put everything you can 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.420
 put fruit chocolate cream 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.030
 hazelnuts excuses and take the best 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.700
 of all is that super natural yogurt and in 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.680
 serious has a super distinctive flavor not 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.840
 is compared to no natural yogurt that I have 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.370

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.919
