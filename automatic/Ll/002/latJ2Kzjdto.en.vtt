00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:32.510
 I would like to study hard today 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:35.770
 Thank you in advance I was able to do it by experience at the time of junior high school only once 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.130
 Because I remember it was difficult 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.289
 this time too 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:45.489
 The day 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:45.489
 Masute result KirièŽ‰ do there is also a fear that Dekirukana But want to do my best I think 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.960
 There is a wind between bases 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.399
 A total of 6 songs per hour are different 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.399
 Finally deeper than the Shinkansen 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.679
 I think just to say 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.260
 Come on here 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.480
 Made in mid-paid 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.480
 After all it was entering 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:23.720
 When I went to junior high school, I was not going at all deeply 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.010
 So this time too 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.700
 At that time I'd was also the feeling that done to say makes the okay that'll be 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.930
 After all the power became stronger than 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.770
 I wonder if they are still better at that time 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:42.909
 Yes I needed the damage and power I thought 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:49.659
 At first I thought that it might not be difficult for women but 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:54.069
 Once you have taught you once , you will be able to teach you relatively easy candidates. 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:56.729
 I wanted you to challenge people to help their lives 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.729
 Yes 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:11.290
 As a body that was still the first time today experience from Well is stable is a lot of people doing this is 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:14.140
 Really and who Tteyuu are doing remember the high firm steps I think that come in each prefecture 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.430
 It is reliable and many more 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:22.109
 issue 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:23.470
 Corner is amazing Japan If you become something in the environment to say anymore anyone can Rutte with confidence what or 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.080
 Become 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.120
 Something like that 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:36.110
 I hope you can become such a country that can cope with emergencies . 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.110
 Nice and I thought that only I will do my best even longer their own 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.470
 For two people each 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:56.830
 Properly you write a message to the one by one person without'm 2 reset 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:03:00.070
 Since I had a dream of becoming a nurse and wanting to help people since I was such a student, this place today 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:05.350
 It was a great honor to be invited to 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.630
 Precisely because Tokyo participants were people who've been practicing a lot 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.560
 2 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:16.550
 I think I was able to do a great job with outside team work 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:20.900
 So let a lot of people take part in this Red Cross Society aed workshop and everyone fights dead 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:24.260
 I think if you can become an environment that can help 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.620
 And I was impressed by the fact that to enhance the technology 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.000
 To participate this time 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:34.379
 What I understood is teamwork with people around me 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.989
 Cooperation was once again realized that Tteyuu really Do'm important 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:43.260
 And it is after that aed is just to know many people the Toka how your ad 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.610
 I can save the lives of more people 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.890
 I think it would be nice to be e- group yes 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.360
 It was so great that I was able to learn the right way of heart massage properly this time 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.350
 I think 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:01.390
 After all after all ad become very familiar ones recently 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:05.020
 It is also installed in shopping centers and schools, so many people with the right knowledge 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:12.730
 I want you to be in an environment where you can save a lot of lives 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:18.190
 It is such an iron law that after all you settle down and deal with it exactly and accurately 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:24.310
 Because it is not possible to take classes after taking classes, so many people receive classes 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:25.010
 We will tell young people as official messengers to be able to 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.380
 like 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.380
 I think I want to do my best
