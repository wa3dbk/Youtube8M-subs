previous<00:01:26.640> design<00:01:27.829> another<00:01:28.829> feature<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
previous design another feature of the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
ergo two is a seamless strap design now

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.490 
ergo two is a seamless strap design now
there<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> seam<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:33.869> what<00:01:34.350> we're

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
there is a seam here but what we're

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.490 
there is a seam here but what we're
saying<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.520> piece<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.119> fabric<00:01:36.500> actually

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
saying is this piece of fabric actually

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.710 
saying is this piece of fabric actually
extends<00:01:37.979> entirely<00:01:38.610> through<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> through<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
extends entirely through the through the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.260 
extends entirely through the through the
straps<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.979> back<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.820> underside<00:01:42.240> of

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
straps so the back and the underside of

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.359 
straps so the back and the underside of
the<00:01:42.360> straps<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:42.930> all<00:01:43.110> one<00:01:43.409> continuous<00:01:43.619> piece

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the straps are all one continuous piece

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.460 
the straps are all one continuous piece
of<00:01:44.729> fabric<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> strap<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.930> never<00:01:46.200> come

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
of fabric so the strap can never come
