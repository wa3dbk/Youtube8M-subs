step three of the Easter egg is to

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.400 
step three of the Easter egg is to
retrieve<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> maintenance<00:00:33.390> man<00:00:33.570> or<00:00:33.840> ozs

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
retrieve the maintenance man or ozs

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.260 
retrieve the maintenance man or ozs
access<00:00:34.920> card<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.640> guys<00:00:35.760> missed<00:00:36.030> part

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
one or two then I will have it linked

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.470 
one or two then I will have it linked
down<00:00:37.920> below<00:00:37.980> obviously<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.030> can't<00:00:39.270> go<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
down below obviously you can't go to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.690 
down below obviously you can't go to
step<00:00:39.870> 3<00:00:39.899> if<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.620> haven't<00:00:40.890> gotten<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.250> step<00:00:41.460> 2

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
step 3 if you haven't gotten this step 2

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.340 
step 3 if you haven't gotten this step 2
before<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> even<00:00:42.450> start<00:00:42.840> some<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.260> guys

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
before I even start some of you guys

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.840 
before I even start some of you guys
might<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.649> wondering<00:00:43.950> why<00:00:44.309> I'm<00:00:44.430> not<00:00:44.460> playing

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850

as<00:00:45.000> oz<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> reason<00:00:45.840> for<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.289> because

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
as oz and the reason for that is because

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.049 
as oz and the reason for that is because
you<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.739> actually<00:00:46.770> complete<00:00:47.370> these<00:00:47.610> steps<00:00:47.670> in

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
you can actually complete these steps in

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.760 
you can actually complete these steps in
solo<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.899> when<00:00:49.079> you're<00:00:49.200> doing<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.649> real

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770

solo but when you're doing it for real
with<00:00:49.950> four<00:00:50.190> players<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.940> Easter<00:00:51.270> Egg<00:00:51.420> the

with four players in the Easter Egg the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.510 
with four players in the Easter Egg the
