 of ignorance is a reflection on

 phenomenology of the action of the person

 comparisons 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:33.540
 the overall central theme of the book is 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.320
 the first sony change is the essence 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.230
 of life itself in the ritual the 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.650
 change and the law of nature a 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.930
 which every Mason must obey and must 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.930
 also be inspired by his actions 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.050
 a law that involves us directly 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.460
 all the Masonic life and reflection of the 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.140
 life of the Italians 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:03.660
 we want and we must distinguish ourselves 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.350
 not only must we distance ourselves 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.750
 from selfish behaviors 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.780
 but we must promote good practices e 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.440
 we must set an example 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.050
 young people are the future but if the wise 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.800
 do not follow the natural law of 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.070
 change 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.220
 the future will never present itself to the 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.250
 door of the temple and of our society 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.090
 civil will live an eternal barren
