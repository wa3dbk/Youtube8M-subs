00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.920

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.580
 hello dear hungry right now it comes 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.230
 me as if all world birthday 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.000
 would have been from my known and 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.740
 For example , there is a family circle today 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.110
 a seventh and tomorrow one 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.880
 seventieth birthday and there 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.920
 got around that I can pack 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.600
 thanks youtube certainly left 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.520
 I want to deny such 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.500
 festivities then of course asked 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.600
 It should not be the pie again 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.790
 with the number on it so I have 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.979
 considered and researched and am with 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.489
 This birthday cake is here 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.110
 become 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.449
 I do not want to be with strangers 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.850
 feathers decorate the recipe comes from 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.370
 tobi's at kuchenbecker dot com 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.320
 blogs successfully and from this point 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.949
 also thanks to him for this great 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.379
 suggestions 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:05.950
 we need baking powder vanilla 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:08.790
 sugar milk sugar flour cake klausur 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.590
 or even cora door-ground hazelnuts 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.190
 but also depending on the taste 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.410
 can replace ground almonds and 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.060
 chocolates and if he likes the martins h &amp; m 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.080
 or take completely different course 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.020
 let you 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.340
 a completely different alternative would be in 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.650
 Gummy bears in a bowl we give 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.540
 the eggs the sugar nature and the 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.380
 vanilla sugar and stir everything 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.380
 frothy with each other 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.829
 then comes the possible and everything 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.380
 is well mixed with each other in one 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.750
 other bowl we add the flour 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.539
 add the ground hazelnuts and that 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:54.159
 baking powder and mix everything 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:56.619
 Thoroughly give each other step by step 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.200
 Now we mix with the sugar 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.789
 mix and mix everything with the mixer 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.729
 so long until a smooth batter 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.530
 originated 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.119
 We prepare a baking sheet by him 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.950
 lay it out with baking paper and me 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.239
 recommend in this case no again 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.860
 suitable to use 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.860
 We'll give it to the dough 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.500
 defend evenly and help 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.989
 if necessary with a dough scraper 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.750
 something and now he comes in the 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.830
 preheated oven at 180 degrees 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.459
 circulated air 160 degrees for about 25 to 30 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.920
 minutes 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.390
 Now we need to pay templates or 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.489
 you can of course also free hand 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.440
 But I'm not so good as I am 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.360
 she just as possible on din a4 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.459
 printed out and me your templates 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.900
 cut out 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.390
 these are now on the plate 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.819
 placed and along the edges with a 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.260
 dough wheels or sharp knives the 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.860
 corresponding number from the dough 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.170
 sliced 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.060
 another note should be on the spot 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.069
 when baking the dough on the surface 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.010
 but its become a bit hilly 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.079
 then just apply it and put that 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:08.260
 templates on the former of ours 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:10.150
 side of the dough plate what he with the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.780
 dough makes him equal 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.370
 inviting popstars to tinker she became 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.530
 remains frozen for bad times 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.630
 break completely but bad 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.350
 times do not come anymore 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.450
 straight lines are natural 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.760
 cut out more easily at a zero like 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.930
 Here you have to be on one 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.209
 fit a little formula 1 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.620
 and when we are ready then the 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.200
 have cut out numbers 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.239
 we melt the correction or the 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.370
 curves klausur give this in stages 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.650
 pay on the dough 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.150
 that reminds me maybe i should 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.780
 bake a cake according to the principle 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.579
 nachzahlen rule back so again 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.180
 chocolate on the dough and the number 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.980
 generously a surface and the sides 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.530
 coat with chocolate 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.079
 and now comes the funny part superior 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.880
 the outside and inside edge with colorful 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.799
 chocolate coins you can get here 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.349
 Of course, also on a set or 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.870
 outside edge a color in a color 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.760
 I like a little bit more colorful 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.340
 tip if the chocolate as here 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.590
 the 7 has already become something solid then 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.760
 Simply fill in the short time draufhalten 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.040
 it melts and becomes smooth again 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.739
 the procedure with chocolate coins too 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.970
 repeat here and then the can 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.970
 be birthday table covered 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.610
 i like this idea i think that 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.860
 she suddenly turns off and is something 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.940
 other 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.830
 I hope you yours 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.080
 birthday children will be happy about it 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.220
 I wish you a lot of fun baking 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.389
 and pretty good appetite 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.610
 but if you have something for the birthday 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.160
 Maybe something else wanted to bake 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.110
 mini cheese cake or a stuffed 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.910
 chocolate cake heart then look 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.949
 just into these videos 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.449
 here remains to say until 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.449
 Next time bye
