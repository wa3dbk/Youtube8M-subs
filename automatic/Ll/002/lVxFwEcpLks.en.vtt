00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.170
 Hello dear friends with you dog and 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.080
 Now I would like to show you the mod 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.960
 which adds 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.800
 the car will 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.560
 so let's say back the future of the mod so he 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.760
 adds three eggs calling for why 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.300
 called the creature 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:30.050
 that they are alive and recipe is usually almost 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:35.170
 let's start with the blackboard 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.170
 board well and stranger 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.760
 ok no it seemed we did not look 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.420
 very epic like boards that it can they 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.540
 there is still some function i don't know 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:55.840
 you can even break blocks into it 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:01:00.350
 there is no way to break a flea 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.930
 it was the first board now i wanted 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.170
 would show you the second board 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:09.500
 less cool who is pink girly too 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.330
 flying like this it looks like 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.540
 Thorny can't do anything just 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.540
 board 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:25.720
 and so now he is presented to oracle i 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:33.390
 unplug the game mod so and who can 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:33.390
 drink should be applied to run so now 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:44.860
 now we run well and I'll go now 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.270
 shown run so i'm here again we 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 sort of ran off let's see 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.229
 how many restores from feces 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:57.280
 drink drink drink drink drink one and us 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.250
 empty bottle well I will say so 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.259
 restored rally can not when 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.610
 look how she craft well let's 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:11.140
 Now let's get to the head quite so I 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.120
 probably turn on the game mod so turn on 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.800
 crap you let's find but more or 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:24.450
 less flat terrain here is such a 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:27.250
 the car is very big so square 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.440
 so as not to show how much I do not know 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.440
 is it possible to go somewhere on it 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.790
 So 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.550
 knife 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.099
 but we press space we accelerate 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.489
 we accelerate 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.519
 need to ask 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.519
 and 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.870
 nothing 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:12.420
 oh there were lightning but yes probably such a glitch 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.420
 with time travel or something 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.080
 it is necessary 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.080
 this is necros 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.599
 watch him moving again here 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.120
 here here here here so okay with me 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.370
 there was a glitch I don't know what 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.510
 happened 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:40.349
 these do not nobody calls I look like 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.050
 would probably be the future or something like that 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:47.560
 I don't understand what happened in general 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.489
 probably you will understand this mod 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:55.060
 somehow I did not count him much 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:04:01.380
 I looked some letplayi something 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.380
 review mods like everything works 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.049
