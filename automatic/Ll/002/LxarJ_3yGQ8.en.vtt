00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
really ideal for shotgunners because

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.649 
really ideal for shotgunners because
this<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> close-range<00:01:17.610> map<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.210> general

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this is a close-range map in general

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.480 
this is a close-range map in general
Bartee<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.590> you're<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> shotgunner

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
Bartee if you're a shotgunner

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.550 
Bartee if you're a shotgunner
then<00:01:20.850> pretty<00:01:21.180> much<00:01:21.390> everything<00:01:21.960> here<00:01:22.229> right

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
then pretty much everything here right

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.140 
then pretty much everything here right
now<00:01:22.740> everything<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.220> anyone<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.790> can<00:01:23.909> see

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
will be in shotgun distance and also

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.800 
will be in shotgun distance and also
thermal<00:01:26.729> sights<00:01:26.939> they'll<00:01:27.180> work<00:01:27.330> out<00:01:27.509> very

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
thermal sights they'll work out very

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.310 
thermal sights they'll work out very
well<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:29.040> crazy<00:01:29.340> absolutely

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
insane event that happens to the map it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.730 
insane event that happens to the map it
all<00:01:32.700> goes<00:01:32.880> foggy<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.900> does<00:01:34.020> last<00:01:34.259> about<00:01:34.470> 30

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.069 
will fade away I'm not sure you can
activate<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.549> again<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.780> event

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
