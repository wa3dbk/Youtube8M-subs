00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.919
 areas of instability are beginning to 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.870
 spread from the region to the region 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.990
 center of Brazil and arrive also 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.059
 in areas of the southeast all this the personnel 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.390
 because now I do not have one more 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.220
 atmospheric blocking condition I do not 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.830
 I have subtropical high Atlantic 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.710
 and preventing the flow of moisture from the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.930
 region of northern Brazil to areas of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.510
 also passing through the center 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.390
 west in the next 15 days. 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.940
 area should have 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.860
 rainfall to the volume of rainfall 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.989
 up to 110 115 millimeters 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.329
 We're arriving at the end of the month there . 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.250
 January and until the 28th that we should 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.200
 expect from the weather conditions then the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.170
 personal dominance is much more 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.750
 there a condition of strong sun and heat there 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.730
 during the morning and afternoon and the blows 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.469
 should concentrate on the period 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.510
 afternoon and evening 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.030
 the northeastern region of brazil still follows 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.780
 with a low rainfall condition 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.670
 long a ii 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.770
 next week we should also have 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.140
 little rainfall in some areas of the region 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.840
 south of Brazil, especially on the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.299
 state of rio grande do sul until day 2 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.330
 February and we can see it 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.850
 that this moisture bond between the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.330
 northern region and the southeastern region of brazil 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.170
 gets pretty bad there until day 2 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.390
 February 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.640
 we should have a condition of more rain 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.210
 concentrated in areas of the Amazon and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.650
 acre 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.689
 we must also have a condition of 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 rainstorms still on account of the 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.950
 circulation of a little moisture over 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.189
 state of sÃ£o paulo and the entire south center 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.990
 of mines general and also personnel in 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.149
 to leave rio de janeiro in the river region 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.670
 Great Southern the amount of rain should 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.920
 be there much smaller and coming 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.780
 finally there in the last penta people 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.890
 must be there by February 7 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.689
 folks 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.060
 the formation of new areas of 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.430
 instability between area getting out of mines 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.439
 general the north center of mines and the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.240
 of the holy spirit in which to bring 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.670
 there are some rain problems that can 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.020
 to 150 millimeters 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.940
 We have here also the spreading 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.310
 of some areas of instability 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.050
 the west center the formation there of areas of 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.050
 instability due to the strong heat
