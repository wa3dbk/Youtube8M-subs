would be underground yeah I would say
you<00:03:39.400> guys<00:03:39.640> maybe<00:03:39.970> make<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.209> staircase<00:03:40.540> here<00:03:40.989> and

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
you guys maybe make a staircase here and

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.160 
you guys maybe make a staircase here and
then<00:03:41.440> that<00:03:41.620> would<00:03:42.450> hello<00:03:43.450> we<00:03:43.659> have<00:03:43.750> teleported
