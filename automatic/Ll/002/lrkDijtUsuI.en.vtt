00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.520
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.820
not a footprint to be seen.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.180
A kingdom of isolation

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.440
and it looks like I'm the queen.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.580
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.640
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I tried.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.020
Don't let them in, don't let them see.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.920
Be the good girl you always have to be.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.900
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.740
Well, now they know!

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.180
Let it go,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.160
let it go!

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.720
Can't hold it back any more.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.880
Let it go,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.660
let it go!

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.340
Turn away and slam the door.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.220
I don't care

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.680
what they're going to say.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.200
Let the storm rage on.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.880
The cold never bothered me anyway.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.240
It's funny how some distance,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.920
makes everything seem small.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.660
And the fears that once controlled me,

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.300
can't get to me at all

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.820
It's time to see what I can do,

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.600
to test the limits and break through.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.920
No right, no wrong, no rules for me.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.760
I'm free!

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.920
Let it go,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.940
let it go.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.400
I am one with the wind and sky.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.420
Let it go,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.340
let it go.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.000
You'll never see me cry.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.240
Here I'll stand,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.900
and here I'll stay.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.460
Let the storm rage on.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.560
My power flurries through the air into the ground.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.680
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.260
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.320
I'm never going back,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.680
the past is in the past!

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.020
Let it go,

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.120
let it go.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.580
And I'll rise like the break of dawn.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.460
Let it go,

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.540
let it go

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.100
That perfect girl is gone

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.540
Here I stand, in the light of day.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.040
Let the storm rage on!

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.940
The cold never bothered me anyway...
