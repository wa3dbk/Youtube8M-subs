00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.500
 Carlos is seen in the emotion of 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.510
 time to sing they want to learn 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.780
 I want you to take advantage of that here in the 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.139
 mouth 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.930

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.470

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.470
 ahead 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.500

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.850
 this love 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.590
 in solution my breathing 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.570
 it escaped me inside 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.739

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.200
 the clock I can not 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.510
 after all the stars with that 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.060
 it shelters you this white night of wax that 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.810
 it went between your skin 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.810
 where was he 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.590
 A) Yes 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.609
 I can not 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.609
 and I felt 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.270
 everyone 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.570
 you forgot the sky 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.570
 850 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.360
 sounds that if you leave me I can no longer 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.860
 walk 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.090
 God 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.090
 no longer has 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.519
 that is to say the whole world 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.220
 ayayay now I do not know if it's about this 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.090
 in the end he learned from kalimba or the cougar 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.590
 I have a doubt there I have a doubt 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.930
 I think the master's bunk fence the 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.380
 near the kalimba master as he felt is 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.700
 Kalimba as he felt his lead song 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.700
 from kalimba a little bit of his song 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.260
 I could be old 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.440

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.020

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.670
 our forgetting that heaven there 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.959

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.959

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.819
 my life 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.799
 kalimba is your song you have 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.379
 sung how he felt that interpretation 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:55.540

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.540
 singing carlos you know it's fantastic 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.610

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.300

 problems with time keep watching 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.370
 especially in a blues this is a blues 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.040
 and you have to make the connection to the pocket 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.959
 what is to throw the song back waters 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.760
 with time but interpretation and 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.780
