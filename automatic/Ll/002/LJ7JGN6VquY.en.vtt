00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.220
 how are we going and what is this bark 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.830
 this tree that is sick 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.280
 look at the center centers of 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.280
 alvear 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:37.100
 the last word 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.790
 because they did not submit a proposal for 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.860
 see a rule and the diagnosis that of 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.890
 the engineers first is alternatives 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.180
 of decisions 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.940
 They can not but vote because they do not 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.020
 prime lights a scoundrel very cured 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.020
 video with her tree of tomorrow 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.899
 it's not an argument that that tree is 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.460
 I was rotting because there you can see 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.250
 any of the citizens can see 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.520
 that is not an argument the tree is 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.520
 good 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.950
 the mayor at that time is saying 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.230
 in the media that he does not 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.670
 has no responsibility for the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.840
 I'm going to say that if 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.489
 has responsibility because the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.030
 mayor part of the board of directors of 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.290
 the corporation the mayor is the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.870
 responsible for any situation that 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.840
 occur has the municipality of tumbaya and 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.489
 he knew about this situation and that he 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.049
 has nothing to do then because he sent 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.250
 of the vans and the officials of the 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.250
 municipality to knock down the tree 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.540
 but I have 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.750
 because there is a reason why there is a 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.180
 higher reason you are a candidate for 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:01.620
 mayoralty is amount of more or less the 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:09.060
 ask what I want to do with this 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:10.920
 I agree that they have or not but I do not know 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.190
 technical issue I really did not face 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.769
 a technician and for the strike they committed 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.319
 from provenance that they had from some 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.930
 public city hearing zone that says and 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.180
 together we will decide if we are 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.390
 agree to knock down what you can not 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.390
 to buy 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.030
 and today 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.370
 and the tree of alcalÃ¡ jesÃºs 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.409
 it also shows his church of 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.659
 clay so many houses raised her talk 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.400
 with him that way from alcalÃ¡ two 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.980
 working hours in the technical treatment 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.019
 if we leave with the argument that 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.650
 those trees are your data caused 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:04:00.000
 because I had the two that the inventors 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.000
 but good 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.250
 and here is a much more situation 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.850
 complicated and it is the environmental welfare 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.040
 of the squirrels on that tree there was a 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.190
 squirrels community that is increasingly 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.890
 they are removing the possibility that 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.110
 squirrels have where to live they did not think 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.060
 in what is usually to be thought 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.060
 it really does not come back 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.130
 yes
