00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello this video was made thanks to 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.000
 the request of a subscriber you can also 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.629
 ask me to make a video by 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.350
 private message 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.350
 thank you 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.859
 I answer a whole program 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.849
 hello to all these mysteries goes from 97 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.960
 accompanied by damien tussac 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.269
 this is for presentations 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.859
 today little video about 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.019
 transitions that can be done with a 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.250
 gokon camera then this camera gopro 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.579
 no longer mine now she 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.809
 belongs to oblivion and then now 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.339
 currently it's at the end of the film with 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.760
 a your projects your three more black 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:40.070
 edition 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.159
 and besides that we go outside confers 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.989
 the transition yeah yeah 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:47.300
 at all right now so now 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.399
 we are going to make the sacred transition from 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.500
 film transition in the first person 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.469
 then no I do not have straps yet 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.870
 for the head so I use the drool 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.300
 so little trick if you want to do 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.640
 a transition with fuzziness 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.079
 filming by centering 25 images cd pass 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.290
 like that thanks to the excavations after the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.470
 transition 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.470
 so 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.240
 it 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.700
 and washing yourself without changing it 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.149
 room 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.149
 voltage 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.980
 vasco the camera of yesteryear 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.980
 of course work is excellent 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.840
 Yes 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.530
 that's when we had other ideas 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.450
 transition that we can do to 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.439
 the first person then for example 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.509
 when we are in the process of 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.920
 wander and then we put nomads go 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.810
 us and then for example we do a 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.009
 360 degree turn and then like that after 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.789
 we can make a change of place where 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.220
 two people 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.409
 or otherwise there is still one 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.700
 something else for example the person who 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.610
 is filming is in the process of 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.489
 walk and I go in front of her I do not 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.709
 do not you know you were then 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.110
 the blur of movement when it is in 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.610
 bend down 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.140
 we make the transition and that's it 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.140
 now small preview 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.600
 m 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.310
 now we are going to make a 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.010
 new transition it will be done 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.730
 with the go paul then there is hugo paul 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.380
 homemade with a pvc tube with 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.360
 two caps so that it floats 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:51.070
 and then we put the handlebar mount 19 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.680
 mm that goes up to 26 in 35 mm maximum 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.630
 then just enough time 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.210
 as your arm for example and then 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.040
 you turn it quickly turn you 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.040
 quickly the camera and then that goes 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.080
 create a blur and then we can do 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.080
 the transition now overview 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.660
 m 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.490
 and now here's a new transition 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.770
 the transition of the slap 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.810
 so for this transition it does not take 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.660
 not that the filmer this movie itself 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.070
 otherwise on the video it will stay fixed and 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.730
 for the transition this is not going to give 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:33.120
 super good it is necessary that they film gold 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:36.810
 finally, other than himself, and enough 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.990
 simply that he gives a slap in 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.960
 a certain sense for example from left to 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.060
 right and that the sequence that the 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.210
 next sequence be filmed in the 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.580
 same meaning so that the transition from 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.320
 better either it is he himself who gives the 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.480
 slap or be it can be someone 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:59.270
 else for example there I come to him 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.270
 hebbadj from nick clegg now preview 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.600
 now new transition the 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.880
 transition from off 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.320
 finally she is quite known enough 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.410
 just to hide the lens with 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.750
 your hand and then goes away create black 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.670
 in your sequence and then you 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.300
 can make the transition now 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.300
 small outline 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.719
 now to do one last 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:31.249
 transition 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:34.020
 a transition that is done with water 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:35.400
 so make sure you have the 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.800
 water resistant protection if one 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.069
 you can say goodbye to your camera 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.650
 is just when you 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:46.740
 do not enter the water you can do the 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.539
 transition because there will be water that will 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.469
 will put in front of the lens this will be fuzzy 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.180
 you will be able to make the transition 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:53.180
 now small preview 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.880
 m 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.880
 m 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.500
 but here's hoping that at this video 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.040
 you will have pleased and served you for 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.220
 do your future editing thank you to louis 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.700
 beltrami and admin jack for their 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.840
 participation to make this video 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.880
 damien jack is currently not there 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.880
 because he is working 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.370
 also this video was made 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.950
 finally ordered under different weather 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.640
 because in Switzerland during the period of 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.730
 July August 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.770
 we saw a lot of rain that's why 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.340
 maybe there are temporal inconsistencies 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.560
 in the video is also simply 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.150
 if you have the time and if you have 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.450
 want to laugh a little click on the 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.640
 blooper right now on mom is 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.750
