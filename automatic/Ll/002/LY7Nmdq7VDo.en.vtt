on the screen and there's a huge
emphasis<00:00:43.510> on<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:45.280> not<00:00:45.850> just<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.239> creative

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
emphasis on the not just the creative

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.139 
emphasis on the not just the creative
process<00:00:46.989> of<00:00:47.079> designing<00:00:47.440> but<00:00:47.739> also<00:00:47.890> on<00:00:48.370> the

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
process of designing but also on the

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.969 
process of designing but also on the
actual<00:00:49.510> process<00:00:49.899> of<00:00:50.019> making<00:00:50.199> and<00:00:50.589> technique

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
actual process of making and technique

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.549 
actual process of making and technique
which<00:00:51.309> is<00:00:51.519> in<00:00:51.850> my<00:00:52.659> view<00:00:52.719> one<00:00:53.199> of<00:00:53.319> the<00:00:53.379> most

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
which is in my view one of the most

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.680 
which is in my view one of the most
important<00:00:54.039> things<00:00:54.219> to<00:00:54.429> know<00:00:54.699> how<00:00:54.879> to<00:00:54.969> do<00:00:55.149> if

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
important things to know how to do if

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.129 
important things to know how to do if
you<00:00:56.079> want<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.289> design<00:00:56.679> effectively<00:00:58.139> current

00:00:59.129 --> 00:00:59.139 
you want to design effectively current

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:01.289 
you want to design effectively current
spaces<00:00:59.679> that<00:01:00.460> you're<00:01:00.639> working<00:01:00.819> them<00:01:01.149> and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
spaces that you're working them and

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:02.489 
spaces that you're working them and
they're<00:01:01.420> very<00:01:01.449> much<00:01:01.809> that<00:01:02.019> they<00:01:02.139> are<00:01:02.260> very

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
they're very much that they are very

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:03.599 
they're very much that they are very
they're<00:01:02.859> really<00:01:03.190> hectic

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
they're really hectic

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.210 
they're really hectic
it<00:01:03.819> is<00:01:03.969> really<00:01:04.180> crammed<00:01:04.570> and<00:01:04.920> having<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:05.980> bigger

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
it is really crammed and having a bigger

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.340 
it is really crammed and having a bigger
space<00:01:06.490> would<00:01:06.760> be<00:01:06.790> really<00:01:07.300> great<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:07.780> work<00:01:08.080> in

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
space would be really great to work in

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.380 
space would be really great to work in
to<00:01:08.530> be<00:01:08.650> able<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.890> do<00:01:09.160> pieces<00:01:09.910> which<00:01:10.090> are<00:01:10.240> like

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
to be able to do pieces which are like

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.480 
to be able to do pieces which are like
really<00:01:10.810> huge<00:01:11.380> as<00:01:11.650> opposed<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.070> just<00:01:12.310> sort<00:01:12.430> of

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
really huge as opposed to just sort of

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.010 
really huge as opposed to just sort of
balancing<00:01:12.970> them<00:01:13.090> or<00:01:13.270> folding<00:01:13.630> them<00:01:13.750> up<00:01:13.840> on

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
balancing them or folding them up on

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.900 
balancing them or folding them up on
easels<00:01:14.410> and<00:01:14.620> just<00:01:15.220> try<00:01:15.370> and<00:01:15.460> fit<00:01:15.640> them<00:01:15.790> in

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
easels and just try and fit them in

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.180 
easels and just try and fit them in
seeing<00:01:16.660> as<00:01:16.810> our<00:01:16.990> syllabus<00:01:17.830> is<00:01:17.980> such<00:01:18.160> a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
seeing as our syllabus is such a

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.060 
seeing as our syllabus is such a
technical<00:01:19.350> syllabus<00:01:20.350> involving<00:01:20.770> lots<00:01:20.950> of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
technical syllabus involving lots of

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.370 
technical syllabus involving lots of
pattern<00:01:21.430> cutting<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:22.390> rather<00:01:22.720> large<00:01:23.020> scale

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
pattern cutting and rather large scale

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.100 
pattern cutting and rather large scale
work<00:01:23.680> it's<00:01:24.490> very<00:01:24.700> important<00:01:25.120> to<00:01:25.240> have<00:01:25.420> the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
work it's very important to have the

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.920 
work it's very important to have the
space<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.620> work<00:01:26.800> in<00:01:26.860> really<00:01:27.820> effectively<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:28.900> I

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
space to work in really effectively so I

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.350 
space to work in really effectively so I
think<00:01:29.260> that<00:01:30.130> will<00:01:30.310> be<00:01:30.550> one<00:01:30.970> of<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.150> really

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
think that will be one of the really

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.450 
think that will be one of the really
lovely<00:01:31.690> things<00:01:32.020> about<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.230> bigger<00:01:32.830> design

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
lovely things about a bigger design

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.100 
lovely things about a bigger design
department<00:01:33.970> would<00:01:34.150> be<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.360> ability<00:01:34.570> to<00:01:34.780> come

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
department would be the ability to come

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.070 
department would be the ability to come
in<00:01:35.230> and<00:01:35.380> work<00:01:35.560> perhaps<00:01:36.310> out<00:01:36.730> of<00:01:36.910> lessons<00:01:37.330> where

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
in and work perhaps out of lessons where

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.660 
in and work perhaps out of lessons where
there<00:01:38.230> might<00:01:38.440> be<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.650> class<00:01:38.920> going<00:01:39.250> on<00:01:39.400> but<00:01:39.580> you

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
there might be a class going on but you

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.970 
there might be a class going on but you
can<00:01:39.820> work<00:01:40.000> in<00:01:40.180> your<00:01:40.270> own<00:01:40.330> space<00:01:40.720> I<00:01:41.080> think<00:01:41.860> it

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
can work in your own space I think it

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.320 
can work in your own space I think it
would<00:01:42.160> be<00:01:42.280> brilliant<00:01:42.490> if<00:01:42.790> we<00:01:42.910> could<00:01:43.030> have<00:01:43.180> lots

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
would be brilliant if we could have lots

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.930 
would be brilliant if we could have lots
more<00:01:43.450> shared<00:01:43.840> spaces<00:01:44.170> so<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.950> sort<00:01:45.910> of

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
more shared spaces so that the sort of

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.930 
more shared spaces so that the sort of
the<00:01:46.300> process<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.380> creating<00:01:47.740> could<00:01:48.220> be<00:01:48.370> more<00:01:48.550> of

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
the process of creating could be more of

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.750 
the process of creating could be more of
interlinked<00:01:49.600> as<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.590> core<00:01:50.920> group<00:01:51.070> of<00:01:51.220> students

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
interlinked as a core group of students

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.670 
interlinked as a core group of students
we<00:01:52.390> look<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.810> initial<00:01:53.140> designs<00:01:53.440> from<00:01:53.590> the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
we look to the initial designs from the

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.890 
we look to the initial designs from the
architect<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:54.550> we<00:01:54.820> showed<00:01:55.180> we<00:01:55.570> showed<00:01:55.750> them

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
architect and we showed we showed them

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.690 
architect and we showed we showed them
what<00:01:56.020> we've<00:01:56.140> really<00:01:56.440> thought<00:01:56.800> was<00:01:57.010> a<00:01:57.190> good<00:01:57.520> a

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
what we've really thought was a good a

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.940 
what we've really thought was a good a
good<00:01:57.940> move<00:01:58.180> for<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.480> building<00:01:58.840> as<00:01:59.380> opposed<00:01:59.770> to

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
good move for the building as opposed to

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.160 
good move for the building as opposed to
what<00:02:00.130> kind<00:02:00.700> of<00:02:00.850> didn't<00:02:01.300> need<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.450> be<00:02:01.659> there<00:02:01.900> and

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
what kind of didn't need to be there and

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.110 
what kind of didn't need to be there and
the<00:02:02.530> teachers<00:02:02.890> as<00:02:03.010> well<00:02:03.159> have<00:02:03.400> had<00:02:03.430> many

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
the teachers as well have had many

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.820 
the teachers as well have had many
different<00:02:04.330> inputs<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.350> designs<00:02:05.650> have

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
different inputs and the designs have

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.290 
different inputs and the designs have
really<00:02:06.100> changed<00:02:06.310> from<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.700> beginning<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
really changed from the beginning the

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.149 
really changed from the beginning the
initial<00:02:07.420> designs<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:08.319> now<00:02:08.649> nothing<00:02:08.860> like

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:09.159 
initial designs and now nothing like

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:10.859 
initial designs and now nothing like
what<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.429> final<00:02:09.610> designs<00:02:10.000> look<00:02:10.240> like<00:02:10.420> but

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
what the final designs look like but

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.270 
what the final designs look like but
that's<00:02:10.990> that's<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.500> good<00:02:11.680> thing<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.069> in<00:02:12.160> the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
that's that's a good thing and in the

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.420 
that's that's a good thing and in the
sense<00:02:12.490> that<00:02:12.730> now<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.510> building

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
sense that now the building

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.979 
sense that now the building
has<00:02:14.489> been<00:02:14.579> adapted<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:15.180> what<00:02:15.359> we<00:02:15.540> really<00:02:15.810> need

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
has been adapted to what we really need

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.800 
has been adapted to what we really need

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
of the new Art and Design Center and I

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.770 
of the new Art and Design Center and I
really<00:02:56.639> feel<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:56.849> it<00:02:57.269> will<00:02:57.389> be<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.540> milestone

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
really feel that it will be a milestone

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.110 
really feel that it will be a milestone
I<00:02:59.810> think<00:03:00.810> it's<00:03:01.169> fabulous<00:03:01.409> that<00:03:01.709> people<00:03:02.430> who<00:03:02.909> go

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
I think it's fabulous that people who go

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.959 
I think it's fabulous that people who go
to<00:03:03.150> videos<00:03:03.599> then<00:03:03.989> feel<00:03:04.349> that<00:03:04.739> it<00:03:05.219> they<00:03:05.760> got

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
to videos then feel that it they got

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:07.819 
to videos then feel that it they got
enough<00:03:06.269> out<00:03:06.419> of<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.719> then<00:03:07.019> give<00:03:07.349> back<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.739> the

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
enough out of it then give back to the

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.649 
enough out of it then give back to the
school<00:03:07.919> I<00:03:08.069> think<00:03:08.219> that's<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.639> a<00:03:08.849> very<00:03:09.510> good

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
school I think that's a a very good

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.809 
school I think that's a a very good
reflection<00:03:10.469> on<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.700> work<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.540> we<00:03:12.810> do<00:03:12.959> here

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
reflection on the work that we do here

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.089 
reflection on the work that we do here
and<00:03:13.969> I<00:03:14.510> think<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.079> legacy<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.530> goes<00:03:15.769> forward

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
and I think the legacy that goes forward

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.569 
and I think the legacy that goes forward
is<00:03:16.810> an<00:03:17.810> incredibly<00:03:18.349> valuable<00:03:18.590> one<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.280> we

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
is an incredibly valuable one that we

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.000 
is an incredibly valuable one that we
can<00:03:19.760> still<00:03:19.969> look<00:03:20.150> at<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.390> buildings<00:03:20.750> that<00:03:21.650> we

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
can still look at the buildings that we

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.979 
can still look at the buildings that we
have<00:03:22.040> around<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.579> campus<00:03:22.969> and<00:03:23.209> remember<00:03:23.900> the

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
have around the campus and remember the
