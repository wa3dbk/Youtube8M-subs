00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.059 

okay<00:00:05.720> so<00:00:05.810> let's<00:00:05.990> get<00:00:06.050> a<00:00:06.110> little<00:00:06.260> more<00:00:06.380> advanced

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
okay so let's get a little more advanced

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.220 
okay so let's get a little more advanced
with<00:00:07.250> the<00:00:07.310> rhythm<00:00:07.700> right<00:00:07.910> so<00:00:08.480> what<00:00:08.960> we've<00:00:09.080> done

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
with the rhythm right so what we've done

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.140 
with the rhythm right so what we've done
is<00:00:09.410> we've<00:00:09.559> talked<00:00:09.799> about<00:00:09.950> big<00:00:10.400> rhythms<00:00:10.760> things

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
is we've talked about big rhythms things

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.690 
is we've talked about big rhythms things
lasting<00:00:11.570> for<00:00:11.750> four<00:00:12.020> and<00:00:12.440> two<00:00:12.770> and<00:00:13.129> one<00:00:13.400> beat<00:00:13.670> or

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
lasting for four and two and one beat or

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.279 
lasting for four and two and one beat or
three<00:00:14.090> beats<00:00:14.240> now<00:00:14.780> let's<00:00:15.049> talk<00:00:15.230> about

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
three beats now let's talk about

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.950 
three beats now let's talk about
breaking<00:00:16.100> down<00:00:16.129> one<00:00:16.730> beat<00:00:17.180> so<00:00:17.510> we're

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
breaking down one beat so we're

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.290 
breaking down one beat so we're
subdividing<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:18.920> beat<00:00:19.100> so<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:19.850> first<00:00:20.060> way<00:00:20.270> to

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
subdividing the beat so the first way to

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.450 
subdividing the beat so the first way to
subdivide<00:00:20.750> it<00:00:21.170> is<00:00:21.290> something<00:00:21.980> called<00:00:22.250> eighth

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
subdivide it is something called eighth

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.480 
subdivide it is something called eighth
notes<00:00:22.760> right<00:00:23.120> so<00:00:23.750> an<00:00:23.960> eighth<00:00:24.110> note<00:00:24.380> is<00:00:24.620> what<00:00:25.460> I

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
notes right so an eighth note is what I

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.340 
notes right so an eighth note is what I
like<00:00:25.730> to<00:00:25.850> think<00:00:26.030> of<00:00:26.090> it<00:00:26.210> as<00:00:26.300> two<00:00:26.600> notes<00:00:26.930> in<00:00:27.170> a

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
like to think of it as two notes in a

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:37.970 
like to think of it as two notes in a
beat<00:00:27.560> right<00:00:28.100> so<00:00:28.370> one<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.270> two<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.740> three

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.310 

right<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.670> I'm<00:00:38.730> playing<00:00:38.910> two<00:00:39.120> strums<00:00:39.450> per<00:00:39.720> beat

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
right so I'm playing two strums per beat

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.260 
right so I'm playing two strums per beat
the<00:00:40.770> next<00:00:41.100> one<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.520> talk<00:00:41.730> about<00:00:41.910> are

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
the next one we can talk about are

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600 
the next one we can talk about are
called<00:00:42.570> sixteenth<00:00:43.260> notes<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.220> now<00:00:44.460> I'm

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
called sixteenth notes so now I'm

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.670 
called sixteenth notes so now I'm
subdividing<00:00:45.330> the<00:00:45.360> beat<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.930> more<00:00:46.110> time<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
subdividing the beat one more time and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.660 
subdividing the beat one more time and
so<00:00:47.070> now<00:00:47.280> there's<00:00:47.520> four<00:00:48.030> notes<00:00:48.900> per<00:00:49.290> beat<00:00:50.250> now

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
so now there's four notes per beat now

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.740 
so now there's four notes per beat now
so<00:00:50.970> you<00:00:51.090> could<00:00:51.270> say<00:00:51.480> it

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
so you could say it

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.240 
so you could say it
one<00:00:52.170> E<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.520> two<00:00:53.520> E<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.820> three<00:00:54.630> E<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.200> four<00:00:55.950> E

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
one E and two E and three E and four E

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.100 
one E and two E and three E and four E
and<00:00:56.520> write<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.510> might<00:00:57.660> sound<00:00:57.809> like<00:00:57.960> this

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
and write and that might sound like this

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.939 
and write and that might sound like this
one

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.860 

one<00:01:04.600> afternoon

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.030 

now<00:01:09.870> I've<00:01:10.020> been<00:01:10.140> doing<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.440> with<00:01:10.560> cords<00:01:10.920> but

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
now I've been doing that with cords but

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.680 
now I've been doing that with cords but
you<00:01:11.130> could<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.460> could<00:01:11.610> use<00:01:11.760> notes<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.270> well<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
you could you could use notes as well it

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.000 
you could you could use notes as well it
just<00:01:12.870> happens<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.380> I'm<00:01:13.560> playing<00:01:13.800> with

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
just happens to be I'm playing with

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.400 
just happens to be I'm playing with
cords<00:01:14.400> another<00:01:15.180> subdivision<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:15.990> beat<00:01:16.230> is

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
cords another subdivision of the beat is

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.790 
cords another subdivision of the beat is
called<00:01:17.340> triplets<00:01:18.000> right<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.170> little<00:01:19.500> tricky

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
called triplets right as a little tricky

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.800 
called triplets right as a little tricky
this<00:01:19.980> is<00:01:20.100> three<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.700> one<00:01:20.970> beat<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
this is three in one beat and it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.530 
this is three in one beat and it
actually<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.040> way<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.760> triplet<00:01:24.150> sounds

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
actually the the way the triplet sounds

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.110 
actually the the way the triplet sounds
is<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.800> word<00:01:25.980> triplet<00:01:26.670> right<00:01:26.910> so

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
is just like the word triplet right so

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.050 
is just like the word triplet right so
it's<00:01:27.240> triple<00:01:28.140> triple<00:01:28.830> triple<00:01:31.910> check

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
it's triple triple triple check

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:44.420 
it's triple triple triple check
I'm<00:01:34.570> 1<00:01:34.900> 2<00:01:35.200> 1<00:01:35.920> 2<00:01:35.950> 3<00:01:36.280> 1<00:01:36.610> 2<00:01:37.000> 1<00:01:37.990> 2<00:01:38.020> 1<00:01:38.619> 2

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.859 

right<00:01:45.430> so<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:45.700> can<00:01:45.850> hear<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.299> three-in-one

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
right so you can hear the three-in-one

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.810 
right so you can hear the three-in-one
be<00:01:47.320> right<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:47.890> then<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.280> last<00:01:48.399> one<00:01:48.579> we<00:01:48.700> can

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
be right and then the last one we can

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.690 
be right and then the last one we can
talk<00:01:48.970> about<00:01:49.119> is<00:01:49.420> six<00:01:50.259> in<00:01:50.500> one<00:01:50.530> beat<00:01:51.040> some

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
talk about is six in one beat some

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.490 
talk about is six in one beat some
people<00:01:51.759> call<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.119> six<00:01:52.390> tuplet<00:01:52.869> it<00:01:53.020> sounds

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
people call it a six tuplet it sounds

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.090 
people call it a six tuplet it sounds
like<00:01:53.619> this<00:01:53.740> 1<00:01:54.130> 2<00:01:54.159> 3<00:01:54.369> 4<00:01:54.820> 5<00:01:55.000> 6<00:01:55.240> 1<00:01:55.479> 2<00:01:55.540> 3<00:01:55.930> 4<00:01:56.200> 5<00:01:56.380> 6<00:01:56.590> 1<00:01:56.710> 2<00:01:56.890> 3

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.100 
like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3
4<00:01:57.369> 5<00:01:57.729> 6<00:01:57.970> so<00:01:58.030> you<00:01:58.060> can<00:01:58.149> imagine<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:58.750> just<00:01:58.930> keep

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
4 5 6 so you can imagine you just keep

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.929 
4 5 6 so you can imagine you just keep
subdividing<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.890> beat<00:02:00.009> I'm<00:02:00.340> just<00:02:00.549> trying<00:02:00.759> to

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
subdividing the beat I'm just trying to

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.730 
subdividing the beat I'm just trying to
include<00:02:01.450> all<00:02:01.780> those<00:02:01.930> notes<00:02:02.229> in<00:02:02.350> one<00:02:02.500> beat

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
include all those notes in one beat

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.270 
include all those notes in one beat
right<00:02:02.979> so<00:02:03.399> 1<00:02:03.700> 2<00:02:03.909> 3<00:02:03.939> 4<00:02:04.270> 5<00:02:04.750> 6<00:02:04.960> 1<00:02:05.080> 2<00:02:05.259> 3<00:02:05.500> 4<00:02:05.710> +<00:02:06.189> 1<00:02:06.520> 2

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.759 

one<00:02:09.520> two<00:02:09.730> three<00:02:09.970> four

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.170 

so<00:02:16.769> there<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.010> go<00:02:17.099> some<00:02:17.580> advanced<00:02:17.849> rhythms

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
so there you go some advanced rhythms

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.540 
so there you go some advanced rhythms
for<00:02:18.420> you
