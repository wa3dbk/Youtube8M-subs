00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.960
 to resolve 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.980
 I think you're in a different room 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.399
 must sit down 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.260
 you see you just so the home office 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.910
 hey when critical it would be you 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.800
 just a little deeper in the game 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.719
 before you can catcher and good images 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.940
 at battlefield I drink that in itself 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.270
 what faster can still there you have one 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.520
 point 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.500
 or you get them and you go the single price I go 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.840
 the soul but I already had that last night 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.610
 sent did enjoy this three 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.649
 she would swap out for a minute 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.199
 for room and you can start the camera 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.920
 with a few moments that is also species 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.920
 holy 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.860
 leaves nice chips naja that too 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.119
 immediately sort of 80 in it 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.460
 battlefield 4 diary 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.640
 because like most sweat through e-mail 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.740
 and received the game yesterday 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.090
 and to review a game by 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.840
 impression play well of course 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.520
 I'm going to review him along with JJJ 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.560
 been busy last night 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.299
 are just busy on xbox live myself 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.240
 I am mainly concerned with a single player 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.900
 and thinges i just like very much 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.170
 to tell 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.100
 so I just go immediately then 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.720
 I was a bit upset here why me 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.130
 of course I got the game a while ago 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.020
 already seen in sticks 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.590
 yes and I have been able to do it a number of times 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.250
 play on the pc yes and now i play on the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.600
 xbox and I still notice the current one 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.430
 generation of consoles 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.100
 I may not replace and say the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.560
 Mahdi will look exactly right anyway 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.869
 really good for hitting car is now me 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.790
 I also used to go next shit I 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.770
 have seen the basket and now like me 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.950
 one minute to watch the sessions 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.929
 and I know that 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.489
 just i like a good sense of one 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.819
 game that I am so very good I still 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.250
 no looking but take that funnel with 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.959
 foot or is become I have I really whole 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.000
 have fun already in energy on medical 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.370
 now already width then is in training the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.209
 previous battlefield so make you absolutely 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.160
 press 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.650
 but it is mainly the large environments 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.180
 where I notice that the xbox steam it 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.269
 will stretch the many things 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.670
 effects achieved birdie round 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.769
 shadow effect that are different and that 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.959
 I think it is mainly because I am 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.730
 I just got the nexgen in the back of my mind 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.610
 I already heard that with Guerilla 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.069
 were actually most proud of that 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.989
 Your fresh things can show you 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.400
 gone because you are going to be little things 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.870
 week or have already talked about more often 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.140
 to walk on the cart and that sort of thing 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.900
 stuff 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.130
 they are very much in this game me 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.380
 never had any problems with it 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.180
 and now in action and you are used to it 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.640
 Suddenly problems with it and I will take this 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.860
 game the not too much on that 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.120
 judge because and that's even for the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.900
 Wii had you know that could not 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.849
 better 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.880
 and this is probably the extreme 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.799
 what the xbox and playstation 3 can do 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.380
 but I think it's a pity and me 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.250
 think a lot of people are behind 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.690
 scratching his ears 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.090
 just like me indeed i got a grade 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.500
 luschen dennis well that's why I had it too 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.139
 actually all my intention 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.549
 not a smell and jenn meter and you play 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.920
 also opens nothing in 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.959
 just so everyone should have with you 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.700
 and that we know I'm sure you're the one 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.930
 so the pain current and action game 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.970
 land which in this case 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.889
 battlefield but you do because I heard 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.819
 a people shayk year the time it is 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:45.220
 not the new step is not as big as 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.620
 the parents really really like this stuff 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.989
 then see the PC version or later in Excel 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.480
 version then believe that step is fucking 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.980
 the big one and that really is one thing 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.389
 what what i what more have to order 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.160
 very many people say through you 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.599
 steps is not that big 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.340
 and at the end goal shit hey that's goals 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.989
 urine spaces just a bit spoiled 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.920
 yes because I am the last person who and 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.620
 then I could 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.140
 the new playstation 4 games play as 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.910
 you really are nice and quiet of none 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.560
 to jack up people around you 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.239
 then you really have rain from craftsman this is 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.550
 nothing and I am really looking forward to it 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.169
 I now have that feeling so I think 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.329
 just that you get in the pie so much 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.330
 things coming past what a whole 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.240
 big step and in the meantime must 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.950
 you do it with a number of upgrades 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.419
 as you see now with the 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.370
 us they are four but if you really 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.960
 good watching and I just noticed how 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.060
 quickly to the den 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.270
 because yes the new graphics the cinema not 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.070
 older is immediately ugly yes but good 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.240
 it is all about picking up or 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.639
 a currently making flower 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.810
 hook up because rogier the xbox hole 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.820
 take it 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.450
 I am very happy with 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.450
 battlefield 4
