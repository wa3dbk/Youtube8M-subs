00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
call evolution there are certain

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.480 
call evolution there are certain

you can completely redo the map alter
the<00:02:25.530> map<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:25.920> play<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.610> game<00:02:26.820> in<00:02:27.060> that

the map and play the game in that

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.820 
the map and play the game in that
situation<00:02:27.930> for<00:02:28.080> example<00:02:28.170> there's<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.650> map

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
situation for example there's a map

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.140 
situation for example there's a map
called<00:02:29.010> flood<00:02:29.310> zone<00:02:29.520> where<00:02:29.700> if<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.850> take<00:02:30.000> out

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
called flood zone where if you take out

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.090 
called flood zone where if you take out
a<00:02:30.180> dam<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.900> flood<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.230> streets<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:31.890> have

a dam you flood the streets and you have
to<00:02:32.280> take<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.640> fight<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.180> rooftops<00:02:33.720> so

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
to take the fight to the rooftops so

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.500 
to take the fight to the rooftops so
there<00:02:34.530> are<00:02:34.590> instances<00:02:35.370> like<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.420> can

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
there are instances like that that can

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.810 
there are instances like that that can
change<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.959> map<00:02:37.200> they're<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.650> too<00:02:37.950> big<00:02:38.310> but

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
change a map they're not too big but

they're kind of unique to know that you

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.020 
they're kind of unique to know that you
can<00:02:40.530> change<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.830> pace<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.520> game<00:02:41.700> at<00:02:41.880> any

this<00:05:18.150> game<00:05:18.389> about<00:05:18.540> an<00:05:18.810> 8<00:05:18.990> out<00:05:19.200> of<00:05:19.229> 10<00:05:19.350> as<00:05:20.280> it

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
this game about an 8 out of 10 as it

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.830 
this game about an 8 out of 10 as it
currently<00:05:20.639> stands<00:05:21.060> I'd<00:05:21.270> probably<00:05:21.450> give<00:05:21.690> it<00:05:21.720> a

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
currently stands I'd probably give it a

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.530 
currently stands I'd probably give it a
safe<00:05:22.080> six<00:05:22.639> not<00:05:23.639> being<00:05:23.850> able<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.060> accurately

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540

safe six not being able to accurately
hit<00:05:24.810> a<00:05:24.840> person<00:05:25.290> is<00:05:25.500> probably<00:05:26.130> a<00:05:26.220> big<00:05:26.520> flaw<00:05:26.880> you

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
hit a person is probably a big flaw you

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.629 
hit a person is probably a big flaw you
can<00:05:27.930> adjust<00:05:28.320> to<00:05:28.440> it<00:05:28.650> so<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:28.979> is<00:05:29.070> not<00:05:29.100> as<00:05:29.430> painful

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
can adjust to it so it is not as painful

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.790 
can adjust to it so it is not as painful
as<00:05:29.970> people<00:05:30.300> think<00:05:30.540> but<00:05:30.960> that's<00:05:31.500> still

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
as people think but that's still

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.260 
as people think but that's still
something<00:05:31.860> that<00:05:32.220> the<00:05:32.340> average<00:05:32.580> player<00:05:33.000> should

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
something that the average player should

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.870 
something that the average player should
not<00:05:33.450> have<00:05:33.720> to<00:05:33.900> be<00:05:34.020> accustomed<00:05:34.320> to<00:05:34.680> so<00:05:35.430> with

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
not have to be accustomed to so with
