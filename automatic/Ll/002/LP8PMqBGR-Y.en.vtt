anything<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:13.530> know<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.650> think<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:14.250> think<00:02:14.570> our

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
anything you know I think I think our

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.180 
anything you know I think I think our
thought<00:02:15.810> process<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.500> going<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.739> be<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.010> take

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
thought process is going to be to take

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.850 
thought process is going to be to take
the<00:02:17.310> best<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.970> best<00:02:18.090> player<00:02:18.390> available<00:02:18.860> at

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
the best the best player available at

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.580 
the best the best player available at
whatever<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.430> position<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.570> do<00:02:22.019> think<00:02:22.440> Matt

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
whatever the position is I do think Matt

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.039 
whatever the position is I do think Matt
shop<00:02:22.860> has<00:02:23.100> several<00:02:23.489> years<00:02:23.970> left<00:02:24.239> in<00:02:24.450> him<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:24.750> a

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
shop has several years left in him as a

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.770 
shop has several years left in him as a
quarterback<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.180> also<00:02:27.330> think<00:02:27.720> that

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
quarterback but but I also think that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.440 
quarterback but but I also think that
you<00:02:28.019> gotta<00:02:28.459> always<00:02:29.459> plan<00:02:29.730> for<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.090> future

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
you gotta always plan for the future

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.690 
you gotta always plan for the future
and<00:02:30.830> there'll<00:02:31.830> be<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.980> there'll<00:02:32.370> be<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.489> point

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700
