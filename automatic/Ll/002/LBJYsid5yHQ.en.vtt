given you cheek from behind the camera

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.100 
given you cheek from behind the camera
yeah<00:02:33.860> what<00:02:35.800> happened<00:02:37.510> what<00:02:38.510> happened<00:02:38.540> another

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
yeah what happened what happened another

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.780 
yeah what happened what happened another
shit<00:02:39.470> throw

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:03:11.360 

yeah

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.080 

now<00:03:12.370> this<00:03:12.580> guy<00:03:12.820> here<00:03:13.230> he's<00:03:14.230> known<00:03:14.470> as<00:03:15.090> European

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
now this guy here he's known as European

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.770 
now this guy here he's known as European
cop<00:03:16.600> I've<00:03:16.810> caught<00:03:17.080> them<00:03:17.320> before<00:03:17.850> right<00:03:18.850> but

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
cop I've caught them before right but

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.350 
cop I've caught them before right but
what<00:03:19.900> I'm<00:03:19.930> gonna<00:03:20.050> be<00:03:20.200> doing<00:03:21.120> gonna<00:03:22.120> start
