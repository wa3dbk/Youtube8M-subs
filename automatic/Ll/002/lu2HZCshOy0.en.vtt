00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
this dinosaur as beautiful and feminine

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.380 
this dinosaur as beautiful and feminine
as<00:01:19.409> possible<00:01:24.290> we<00:01:25.290> want<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.799> nice<00:01:26.460> generous

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
as possible we want a nice generous

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.810 
as possible we want a nice generous
layer

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
layer

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.710 
layer
I'm<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.360> dolloping<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.200> there<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.920> top<00:01:32.720> then

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
I'm just dolloping on there on top then

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.749 
I'm just dolloping on there on top then
I<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:34.020> spread<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.590> around<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.490> move

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
I can spread that around and just move

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.319 
I can spread that around and just move
it<00:01:35.790> around<00:01:36.000> where<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.979> rather<00:01:37.979> than

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
it around where I want it rather than

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.850 
it around where I want it rather than
because<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.450> don't<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.140> keep<00:01:40.320> going<00:01:40.619> back

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
because I don't like to keep going back

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.270 
because I don't like to keep going back
to<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> bowl<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:42.259> bringing<00:01:43.259> crumbs<00:01:43.649> back<00:01:43.979> to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
to the bowl and bringing crumbs back to

00:01:44.280 --> 00:02:02.230 
to the bowl and bringing crumbs back to
my<00:01:45.979> main<00:01:46.979> ganache<00:01:47.520> sauce

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.030 

we<00:02:02.780> want<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.409> be<00:02:03.440> as<00:02:03.830> smooth<00:02:04.729> as<00:02:05.090> possible

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
we want this to be as smooth as possible

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.309 
we want this to be as smooth as possible
because<00:02:07.040> any<00:02:09.970> bumps<00:02:10.970> lumps<00:02:11.480> imperfections

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
because any bumps lumps imperfections

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.040 
because any bumps lumps imperfections
then<00:02:13.040> it's<00:02:13.220> harder<00:02:13.730> for<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:14.180> when<00:02:14.840> you're

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
then it's harder for you when you're

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.120 
then it's harder for you when you're
adding<00:02:15.440> your<00:02:15.470> fondant<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:17.240> it<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:21.620> we<00:02:21.860> want<00:02:22.069> it

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
adding your fondant to it so we want it

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:35.410 
adding your fondant to it so we want it
to<00:02:22.190> be<00:02:22.430> as<00:02:22.610> perfect<00:02:23.000> as<00:02:23.569> what<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:23.900> can<00:02:24.140> get<00:02:24.410> it

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.630 

and<00:02:35.540> as<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.320> can<00:02:36.470> see<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.920> ganache<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.310> all

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
and as you can see the ganache is all

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.610 
and as you can see the ganache is all
really<00:02:38.120> nice<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.600> soft<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.170> easy<00:02:39.410> to

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
really nice and soft and easy to

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.510 
really nice and soft and easy to
maneuver<00:02:43.870> if<00:02:44.870> it's<00:02:45.290> too<00:02:45.680> hard<00:02:46.010> then<00:02:46.340> you're

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
maneuver if it's too hard then you're

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.710 
maneuver if it's too hard then you're
starting<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:47.270> lift<00:02:48.190> cake<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.720> you're

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
starting to lift cake and you're

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.510 
starting to lift cake and you're
shifting<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.290> around<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.860> we<00:02:51.980> don't<00:02:52.160> want<00:02:52.430> to

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
shifting it around and we don't want to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.650 
shifting it around and we don't want to
do<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.910> because<00:02:53.150> then<00:02:53.420> you're<00:02:53.570> just

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
do that because then you're just

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.040 
do that because then you're just
creating<00:02:54.820> work<00:02:55.820> for<00:02:56.150> yourself<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.840> making

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
creating work for yourself and making

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.110 
creating work for yourself and making
things<00:02:57.440> more<00:02:57.830> difficult<00:02:59.500> if<00:03:00.500> your<00:03:01.430> inner<00:03:01.790> core

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
things more difficult if your inner core

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.590 
things more difficult if your inner core
is<00:03:02.300> pretty<00:03:02.930> hot<00:03:03.260> here<00:03:03.530> where<00:03:03.800> I<00:03:03.830> am<00:03:04.360> but<00:03:05.360> in

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
is pretty hot here where I am but in

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.720 
is pretty hot here where I am but in
