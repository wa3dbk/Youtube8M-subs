00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
confidence they got some stops on

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.809 
confidence they got some stops on
defense<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.530> also<00:03:43.829> brought<00:03:44.250> confidence

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
defense and that also brought confidence

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:52.640

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.689 
Jerry
I<00:05:08.599> see<00:05:09.599> we<00:05:09.750> took<00:05:09.960> 17<00:05:10.560> threes<00:05:10.860> but<00:05:11.190> I<00:05:11.220> don't<00:05:11.610> know

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
I see we took 17 threes but I don't know

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.460 
I see we took 17 threes but I don't know
how<00:05:11.820> many<00:05:11.880> we<00:05:12.120> took<00:05:12.449> eleven<00:05:12.960> of<00:05:13.080> them<00:05:13.199> in<00:05:13.349> the

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
how many we took eleven of them in the

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.820 
how many we took eleven of them in the
second<00:05:14.190> half<00:05:14.340> when<00:05:14.550> they<00:05:14.639> played<00:05:14.910> zone<00:05:15.210> four

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
second half when they played zone four

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.129 
second half when they played zone four
basically<00:05:16.830> 19<00:05:17.460> minutes<00:05:17.760> in<00:05:19.909> 30<00:05:20.909> seconds<00:05:21.449> 40

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
basically 19 minutes in 30 seconds 40

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.000 
basically 19 minutes in 30 seconds 40
seconds<00:05:22.590> so<00:05:23.990> we<00:05:24.990> took<00:05:25.169> a<00:05:25.229> majority<00:05:25.740> of<00:05:25.770> them

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
seconds so we took a majority of them

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.279 
seconds so we took a majority of them
then<00:05:26.250> but<00:05:26.610> if<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:26.909> saw<00:05:27.389> a<00:05:27.419> shot<00:05:27.780> chart<00:05:28.110> I<00:05:28.229> would

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
then but if I saw a shot chart I would

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.290 
then but if I saw a shot chart I would
say<00:05:28.590> that<00:05:28.800> there<00:05:29.340> were<00:05:29.460> quite<00:05:29.699> a<00:05:29.729> few<00:05:29.849> of<00:05:30.090> our

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
say that there were quite a few of our

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.600 
say that there were quite a few of our
