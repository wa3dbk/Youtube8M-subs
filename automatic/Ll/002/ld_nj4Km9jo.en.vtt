function keys how to write a check and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.189 
function keys how to write a check and
issue<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.220> check<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:30.539> does<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.929> password

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
issue a check it does have a password

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.780 
issue a check it does have a password
function<00:00:32.480> and<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.770> call<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.579> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
function and we have a call it's a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.350 
function and we have a call it's a
global<00:00:36.300> check<00:00:36.840> writer<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.730> we<00:00:38.730> call<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
global check writer and we call it's the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.690 
global check writer and we call it's the
16<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.610> it<00:00:41.610> gives<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.530> 16<00:00:43.530> different<00:00:44.219> styles

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
16 so it gives you 16 different styles

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.790 
16 so it gives you 16 different styles
of<00:00:44.910> currency<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:46.309> on<00:00:47.809> that<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.170> press<00:00:49.530> in

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
of currency on on that so you press in

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.700 
of currency on on that so you press in
whatever<00:00:49.980> code<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.670> may<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.500> then<00:00:52.500> that

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
whatever code it may be and then that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.260 
whatever code it may be and then that
would<00:00:54.020> that<00:00:55.020> would<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.590> example<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:56.190> use<00:00:56.430> I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
would that would be for example we use I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.500 
would that would be for example we use I
suggest<00:00:57.899> using<00:00:58.079> code<00:00:58.530> 2<00:00:58.920> which<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> US

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
suggest using code 2 which is the US

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.119 
suggest using code 2 which is the US
dollar<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.640> how<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> operate<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.539> machine

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
dollar so on how to operate the machine

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.930 
dollar so on how to operate the machine
basically

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.810 

what<00:01:08.510> we<00:01:08.570> want<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:08.810> do<00:01:08.900> is<00:01:09.050> turn<00:01:10.010> it<00:01:10.070> on<00:01:11.410> okay<00:01:12.820> to

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
what we want to do is turn it on okay to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:21.940 
what we want to do is turn it on okay to
set<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.960> code<00:01:15.580> we<00:01:16.580> go<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:18.250> see<00:01:19.250> two<00:01:20.710> shows<00:01:21.710> up

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
set the code we go to see two shows up

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.010 
set the code we go to see two shows up
co2<00:01:22.600> so<00:01:23.600> that'll<00:01:23.960> be<00:01:24.140> printing<00:01:24.740> our<00:01:24.890> US<00:01:25.490> dollar

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
co2 so that'll be printing our US dollar

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:34.180 
co2 so that'll be printing our US dollar
symbol<00:01:27.020> as<00:01:27.230> I<00:01:28.070> showed<00:01:28.370> you<00:01:28.400> earlier<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:33.560> to

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
symbol as I showed you earlier so to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.030 
symbol as I showed you earlier so to
write<00:01:35.000> a<00:01:35.060> check<00:01:35.420> basically<00:01:36.230> what<00:01:36.470> we<00:01:36.650> would<00:01:36.800> do

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
write a check basically what we would do

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.260 
write a check basically what we would do
is<00:01:37.370> we<00:01:37.880> take<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.630> check<00:01:39.200> block<00:01:39.470> off<00:01:40.000> we<00:01:41.000> didn't

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
is we take the check block off we didn't

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.880 
is we take the check block off we didn't
search<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.690> check<00:01:42.020> wherever<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:42.530> want<00:01:42.740> to

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
search the check wherever you want to

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.440 
search the check wherever you want to
set<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.400> amount<00:01:43.700> if<00:01:43.850> you're<00:01:44.000> going<00:01:44.150> to<00:01:44.240> write

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
set the amount if you're going to write

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.100 
set the amount if you're going to write
the<00:01:44.480> check<00:01:45.020> this<00:01:45.980> is<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.250> chip<00:01:47.150> amount<00:01:47.540> that's

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
the check this is a chip amount that's

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.470 
the check this is a chip amount that's
the<00:01:48.410> line<00:01:48.620> that<00:01:48.650> you<00:01:49.010> would<00:01:49.160> set<00:01:49.520> your<00:01:49.880> your

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
the line that you would set your your

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.950 
the line that you would set your your
check<00:01:50.870> upon<00:01:51.760> and<00:01:52.760> then<00:01:52.940> let's<00:01:53.180> just<00:01:53.390> say<00:01:53.600> okay

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
check upon and then let's just say okay

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.510 
check upon and then let's just say okay
so<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.380> would<00:01:54.560> be<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.800> line<00:01:55.010> then<00:01:55.250> what<00:01:55.400> we

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
so that would be the line then what we

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.290 
so that would be the line then what we
do<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:55.700> we<00:01:56.030> lock<00:01:56.330> that<00:01:56.660> check<00:01:57.020> in<00:01:57.290> position<00:01:57.950> and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
do is we lock that check in position and

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.520 
do is we lock that check in position and
let's<00:01:59.300> say<00:01:59.450> we<00:01:59.570> wanted<00:01:59.810> to<00:01:59.900> write<00:02:00.050> a<00:02:00.080> check<00:02:00.500> for

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
let's say we wanted to write a check for

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.960 
let's say we wanted to write a check for
a<00:02:00.860> hundred<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.610> twenty<00:02:01.970> three<00:02:02.180> dollars<00:02:02.479> and

a hundred and twenty three dollars and

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.940 
a hundred and twenty three dollars and
forty-five<00:02:04.970> cents<00:02:05.510> like<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:06.140> one<00:02:06.440> two<00:02:06.650> three

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
forty-five cents like that one two three

forty-five cents like that one two three
four<00:02:07.220> five<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.910> then<00:02:07.970> go<00:02:08.840> ahead<00:02:09.640> verify<00:02:10.640> it

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
four five and then go ahead verify it

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:21.720 
four five and then go ahead verify it
and<00:02:11.000> this<00:02:11.120> press<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.630> print<00:02:12.290> button<00:02:16.600> unlock

and<00:02:21.819> that's<00:02:22.510> what<00:02:22.750> your<00:02:22.900> check<00:02:23.080> looks<00:02:23.319> like

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
and that's what your check looks like

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.449 
and that's what your check looks like
nice<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.420> neat
