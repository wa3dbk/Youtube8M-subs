hi<00:00:05.910> there<00:00:06.240> I<00:00:06.620> am<00:00:07.620> going<00:00:07.860> to<00:00:08.010> show<00:00:08.190> you<00:00:08.250> how<00:00:08.580> to

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
hi there I am going to show you how to

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.690 
hi there I am going to show you how to
sample<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.510> import<00:00:09.840> audio<00:00:10.309> sounds<00:00:11.309> like

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
sample and import audio sounds like

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.709 
sample and import audio sounds like
speech<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.389> your<00:00:12.480> PPG<00:00:13.170> wave<00:00:13.200> generator<00:00:14.719> for

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
speech in your PPG wave generator for

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.279 
speech in your PPG wave generator for
this<00:00:16.100> we<00:00:17.100> need<00:00:17.310> two<00:00:17.850> additional<00:00:18.450> apps<00:00:18.750> that

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
this we need two additional apps that

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.669 
this we need two additional apps that
you<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.619> get<00:00:19.800> for<00:00:20.310> free<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.060> App<00:00:21.240> Store

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:21.679 
you can get for free in the App Store

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:27.769 
you can get for free in the App Store
the<00:00:22.679> first<00:00:22.980> one<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.029> apt<00:00:25.490> that<00:00:26.599> stands<00:00:27.599> for

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the first one is the apt that stands for

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.439 
the first one is the apt that stands for
acoustic<00:00:28.439> picture<00:00:28.949> transmitter<00:00:29.490> which

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
acoustic picture transmitter which

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.080 
acoustic picture transmitter which
converts<00:00:30.929> any<00:00:31.259> audio<00:00:31.769> from<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.340> iPad<00:00:32.790> mic

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
converts any audio from the iPad mic

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.990 
converts any audio from the iPad mic
into<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.720> picture<00:00:34.350> containing<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> spectral

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
into a picture containing the spectral

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.930 
into a picture containing the spectral
data<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.750> sound<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.980> let's<00:00:38.989> show<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:43.940> there

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
data of the sound so let's show it there

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.450 
data of the sound so let's show it there
we<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:46.190> as<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:48.890> while<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.100> speak

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
we have it as you can see while I speak

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.069 
we have it as you can see while I speak
it<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.300> recording<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> spectral<00:00:52.530> data<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
it is recording the spectral data and

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.619 
it is recording the spectral data and
now<00:00:55.079> let's<00:00:55.440> take<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> sample<00:00:59.149> twinkle<00:01:00.149> little

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
now let's take a sample twinkle little

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.640 
now let's take a sample twinkle little
star<00:01:04.280> we<00:01:05.280> tap<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> skin<00:01:06.120> and<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
star we tap on the skin and then the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.789 
star we tap on the skin and then the
recording<00:01:08.190> is<00:01:08.340> stopped<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.030> now<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:10.080> save

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
recording is stopped and now we can save

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.410 
recording is stopped and now we can save
it<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.310> our<00:01:11.490> photo<00:01:11.850> library<00:01:12.500> which<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.979> now

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.410 

and<00:01:18.950> now<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.460> need<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.970> second<00:01:21.360> app<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:22.200> an<00:01:22.470> app

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
and now we need the second app is an app

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
and now we need the second app is an app
to<00:01:24.650> edit<00:01:25.650> pictures<00:01:27.079> I'm<00:01:28.079> using<00:01:28.409> Photoshop

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
to edit pictures I'm using Photoshop

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.149 
to edit pictures I'm using Photoshop
Express<00:01:29.939> which<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:31.250> also<00:01:32.250> free<00:01:33.950> available<00:01:34.950> on

Express which is also free available on
the<00:01:35.280> App<00:01:35.430> Store<00:01:37.159> now<00:01:38.159> let's<00:01:39.049> load<00:01:40.049> our<00:01:40.890> photo

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
the App Store now let's load our photo

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.700 
the App Store now let's load our photo
which<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.759> should<00:01:44.759> be<00:01:44.880> here<00:01:45.149> okay<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
which is should be here okay this is the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:56.750 
which is should be here okay this is the
one<00:01:47.960> now<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.850> cop<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.450> picture

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.270 

to<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.480> data<00:01:57.720> we<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:57.990> recorded<00:01:58.770> with<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
to the data we have recorded with the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:07.440 
to the data we have recorded with the
speech<00:02:00.210> before

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.650 

okay<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:09.520> second<00:02:09.849> step<00:02:10.030> we<00:02:10.209> have<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.509> do

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
okay and the second step we have to do

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.400 
okay and the second step we have to do
here<00:02:10.899> is<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.709> rotate<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.400> that's<00:02:13.390> because<00:02:13.660> the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
here is to rotate it that's because the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.690 
here is to rotate it that's because the
apt<00:02:15.190> app<00:02:15.459> records<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.780> spectro<00:02:17.650> from<00:02:17.980> left<00:02:18.580> to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
apt app records the spectro from left to

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.040 
apt app records the spectro from left to
right<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.590> PPG<00:02:21.099> wave<00:02:21.280> generator<00:02:22.090> reads

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
right but the PPG wave generator reads

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.860 
right but the PPG wave generator reads
it<00:02:23.319> from<00:02:23.590> top<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:23.950> bottom<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:24.819> I'm<00:02:25.360> going<00:02:25.690> to

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
it from top to bottom so I'm going to

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:36.420 
it from top to bottom so I'm going to
rotate<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:27.959> like<00:02:28.959> this<00:02:30.959> okay<00:02:34.590> but<00:02:35.590> now<00:02:35.830> let's

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
rotate it like this okay but now let's

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.160 
rotate it like this okay but now let's
save<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:38.190> well<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:39.970> all<00:02:40.360> we<00:02:40.630> have<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:41.019> do

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
save it well this is all we have to do

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.990 
save it well this is all we have to do
with<00:02:41.380> these<00:02:42.130> two<00:02:42.370> apps<00:02:42.840> now<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.870> want<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:45.000> start

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
with these two apps now I want to start

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.570 
with these two apps now I want to start
the<00:02:46.120> wave<00:02:46.330> generator<00:02:48.180> for<00:02:49.180> this<00:02:49.390> it's

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
the wave generator for this it's

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.300 
the wave generator for this it's
important<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:51.610> we<00:02:52.019> adjust<00:02:53.019> some<00:02:53.980> parameters

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.210 

at<00:02:57.310> first<00:02:57.580> we<00:02:57.760> need<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.720> complete<00:02:59.590> wave<00:02:59.890> doc

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
at first we need the complete wave doc

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.280 
at first we need the complete wave doc
and<00:03:00.549> second<00:03:01.330> we<00:03:01.569> need<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:02.470> set<00:03:03.250> our<00:03:03.790> envelope<00:03:04.540> V

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
and second we need to set our envelope V

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.979 
and second we need to set our envelope V
times<00:03:05.560> for<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:05.920> wave<00:03:06.100> eyes<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.480> linear

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
times for the wave eyes to a linear

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.830 
times for the wave eyes to a linear
slope<00:03:08.410> as<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:09.040> can<00:03:09.220> see<00:03:09.430> here<00:03:10.769> so<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:13.660> when

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
slope as you can see here so that when

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.920 
slope as you can see here so that when
we<00:03:14.170> play<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.590> sound<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.790> complete<00:03:16.739> wave<00:03:17.739> is

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
we play the sound the complete wave is

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.970 
we play the sound the complete wave is
played<00:03:20.700> we<00:03:21.700> should<00:03:22.019> we<00:03:23.019> put<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.440> in<00:03:23.620> linear

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
played we should we put it in linear

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.870 
played we should we put it in linear
mode<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.670> now<00:03:25.180> let's<00:03:25.450> draw<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.290> path<00:03:26.850> so<00:03:27.850> we

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
mode and now let's draw the path so we

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.130 
mode and now let's draw the path so we
have<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.180> path<00:03:28.540> thus<00:03:28.959> goes<00:03:29.380> to<00:03:29.739> all<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.100> waves

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.400 

okay<00:03:35.760> at<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.910> end<00:03:37.090> of<00:03:37.239> my<00:03:37.480> video<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:38.230> will
