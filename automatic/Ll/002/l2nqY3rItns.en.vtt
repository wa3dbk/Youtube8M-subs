 Acts and their consequences 15 years later 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.350
 I said that I always had 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.850
 this fantasy once a bank 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.090

 Motorcycle according purely in a truck 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.120

 motorcycle

 script written that I knew

 We are certain to film together 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.340
 close 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.990
 it was great that already each other 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.820
 they had shot in the world 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.890
 you can create wonderful work 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.780
 I enjoy the same 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.760
 Filmmakers work to develop one 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.470
 a blind understanding of the first 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.270
 film we could at the second immediately 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.400

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.380

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.120
 really magic he brings from all this 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.980
 the best for the show or the casting 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.450
 from avery bradley had one with me 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.860
 leave a lasting impression 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:03.700
 I already have the script with me 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:05.290
 bradley in the background wrote one 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.540
 complex role in a complex 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.870
 Some real police officers have history 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.920
 I really helped them to play 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.900
 that is our problem the problem 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.190
 our dÃ©partements and I do them 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.650
 attentive because it's mine 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.450
 damn duty film I have in mind 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.400
 all because of the action free and ryan 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.000
 I wanted to be part of your gosling 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.000
 environment are 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.150
 there is the best in his films 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.850
 I had to learn by car through the car 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.680
 curves to hurl 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.159
 I actually drove myself and 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.970
 completed my stunts 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.799
 I have motorcycle riding with Rick Miller 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.940
 trains when batman rides a motorcycle 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.250
 then that's rake miller 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.900
 So I learned from the best and 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.650
 the action scenes in the film should be one 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:55.650
 to radiate certain danger 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:57.390
 what are you doing because they are real i leave 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.489
 not to get us both ready 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.390
 there is a way out but he will 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.730
 asked me 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.970
 a trip to the audience awaits 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.220
 which one should be ready to show it is 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.720
 An epic journey on the 17 years 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.880
 long the lifelines of humans 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.410
 cross and in a wonderful way 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.780
 and wise rib software 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.700

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.750
 can hang him what the movie is about 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.280
 fathers and sons 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.380
 I feel like stories 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.669
 families because I believe that 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:29.280
 Families full of secrets 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.780
 if you drive like a flash it will 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.780
 catch you like a thunder strike 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.380

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.380
