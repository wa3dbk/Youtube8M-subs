little girl thinks up it becomes real I

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.819 
little girl thinks up it becomes real I
mean<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.510> can't<00:00:39.660> even<00:00:39.750> be<00:00:39.870> stopped<00:00:40.320> by<00:00:40.620> any

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829

outside<00:00:40.920> force<00:00:41.460> except<00:00:41.910> by<00:00:42.000> its<00:00:42.149> own

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
outside force except by its own

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.139 
outside force except by its own
imagination<00:00:43.440> that's<00:00:44.100> pretty<00:00:44.340> awesome<00:00:44.520> pretty

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
imagination that's pretty awesome pretty

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.150 
imagination that's pretty awesome pretty
epic<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.260> don't<00:00:46.620> think<00:00:46.860> that's<00:00:46.980> actually

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
epic and I don't think that's actually

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.979 
epic and I don't think that's actually
really<00:00:47.489> possible<00:00:48.059> but<00:00:48.239> that's<00:00:48.539> beside<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
really possible but that's beside the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:49.459 
really possible but that's beside the
point

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
point

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.100 
point
but<00:00:50.010> how<00:00:50.129> powerful<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:51.750> unknown

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
but how powerful is just one unknown

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.610 
but how powerful is just one unknown
well<00:00:52.800> let's<00:00:53.760> find<00:00:54.000> out<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.989> battle<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.469> not

staged in any way in fact one battle I

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.830 
staged in any way in fact one battle I
had<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.260> was<00:00:58.530> staged<00:00:58.920> didn't<00:00:59.820> actually<00:01:00.239> look

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
had that was staged didn't actually look

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.580 
had that was staged didn't actually look
as<00:01:01.170> fake<00:01:01.620> as<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.129> does

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.590 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.680 

now<00:01:05.590> I<00:01:05.890> decided<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.400> send<00:01:06.610> out<00:01:06.700> my<00:01:06.850> Jolteon<00:01:07.420> and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
now I decided to send out my Jolteon and

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.650 
now I decided to send out my Jolteon and
he<00:01:07.840> sends<00:01:08.110> out<00:01:08.170> his<00:01:08.260> Darkrai<00:01:08.770> I<00:01:09.010> decide<00:01:09.490> to

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
he sends out his Darkrai I decide to

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.880 
he sends out his Darkrai I decide to
substitute<00:01:10.660> because<00:01:10.870> every<00:01:11.320> duck<00:01:11.560> I<00:01:11.650> come

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
substitute because every duck I come

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.070 
substitute because every duck I come
across<00:01:11.980> his<00:01:12.340> Dark<00:01:12.640> Void<00:01:12.850> no<00:01:13.390> exception<00:01:13.810> here

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
across his Dark Void no exception here

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.790 
across his Dark Void no exception here
send<00:01:14.680> my<00:01:14.740> agility<00:01:15.040> was<00:01:15.520> that<00:01:15.670> my<00:01:15.790> stats<00:01:16.090> and

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
send my agility was that my stats and

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.650 
send my agility was that my stats and
then<00:01:17.800> he<00:01:18.040> breaks<00:01:18.220> my<00:01:18.480> substitute<00:01:19.480> with

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
then he breaks my substitute with

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.470 
then he breaks my substitute with
spatial<00:01:20.020> rend<00:01:20.200> no<00:01:20.560> surprise<00:01:20.950> there<00:01:21.400> so<00:01:22.270> then<00:01:22.390> I

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
spatial rend no surprise there so then I

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.950 
spatial rend no surprise there so then I
substitute<00:01:23.050> again<00:01:24.210> hoping<00:01:25.210> he<00:01:25.510> uses<00:01:25.750> Dark

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
substitute again hoping he uses Dark

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.350 
substitute again hoping he uses Dark
Void<00:01:26.140> again<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:27.640> course<00:01:27.880> he<00:01:28.090> does

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
Void again and of course he does

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.660 
Void again and of course he does

he's<00:01:44.230> my<00:01:44.650> pattern<00:01:44.980> already<00:01:45.280> but<00:01:45.910> I

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
he's my pattern already but I

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.490 
he's my pattern already but I
substituted<00:01:46.600> again<00:01:46.840> because<00:01:47.200> he's<00:01:47.320> confused

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
substituted again because he's confused

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.350
