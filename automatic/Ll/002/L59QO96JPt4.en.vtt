00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
when you play that video but I think

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.069 
when you play that video but I think
that<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.500> program<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.760> easy<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.600> use

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
that this program is just easy to use

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.139 
that this program is just easy to use
and<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.590> worth<00:00:46.890> buying<00:00:49.160> I'm<00:00:50.160> being<00:00:50.640> prompted

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
and it's worth buying I'm being prompted

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.619 
and it's worth buying I'm being prompted
to<00:00:51.329> put<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.600> DVD<00:00:51.899> into<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.620> DVD<00:00:53.070> Drive<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.699> use

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
to put a DVD into the DVD Drive I use

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.160 
to put a DVD into the DVD Drive I use
DVD<00:00:55.170> -<00:00:55.649> are<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.520> -<00:00:56.910> are<00:00:57.149> means<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.930> more

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
DVD - are the - are means it's more

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.400

compatible<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:58.890> most<00:00:59.340> DVD<00:01:00.090> players<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.289> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
compatible with most DVD players and you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.979 
compatible with most DVD players and you
give<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.800> title<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.719> tell

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
give it a title and it is going to tell

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.940 
give it a title and it is going to tell
you<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.880> burn<00:01:05.880> at<00:01:06.299> half<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.080> speed<00:01:09.950> right

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
you to burn at half the speed right

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.499 
you to burn at half the speed right
there<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:14.070> I'll<00:01:14.430> change<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.409> eight<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.909> I'll

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
there so I'll change that eight and I'll

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.469 
there so I'll change that eight and I'll
click<00:01:18.720> burn<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:22.939> haven't<00:01:23.939> gotten<00:01:24.150> into

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
click burn I haven't gotten into

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.320 
click burn I haven't gotten into
renaming<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.710> titles<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.549> I'm<00:01:26.790> sure<00:01:27.030> that's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
renaming the titles but I'm sure that's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.690 
renaming the titles but I'm sure that's
something<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.320> probably<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
something you can do probably in the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.810 
something you can do probably in the
bottom<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.259> program<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.280> operation

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
