eyes<00:05:36.089> mascara<00:05:36.329> this<00:05:37.199> is<00:05:37.349> one<00:05:37.529> of<00:05:37.559> my<00:05:37.769> favorites

for<00:05:38.489> applying<00:05:38.879> under<00:05:39.179> lower<00:05:39.599> lash<00:05:39.839> line<00:05:40.110> the

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:40.679 
for applying under lower lash line the

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:42.769 
for applying under lower lash line the
reason<00:05:41.039> is<00:05:41.249> because<00:05:41.489> it's<00:05:41.879> very<00:05:42.029> volumizer

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:42.779 
reason is because it's very volumizer

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:46.639 
reason is because it's very volumizer
and<00:05:43.199> it<00:05:43.499> has<00:05:43.679> a<00:05:43.709> really<00:05:44.189> quick<00:05:44.399> build<00:05:44.759> up<00:05:45.649> the

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:46.649 
and it has a really quick build up the

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:48.559 
and it has a really quick build up the
only<00:05:46.919> reason<00:05:47.219> why<00:05:47.339> I<00:05:47.369> don't<00:05:47.729> use<00:05:47.909> this<00:05:48.119> on<00:05:48.360> my

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:48.569 
only reason why I don't use this on my

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:50.659 
only reason why I don't use this on my
upper<00:05:48.929> lashes<00:05:49.110> is<00:05:49.529> because<00:05:49.919> it<00:05:50.099> gives<00:05:50.309> so<00:05:50.549> much

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
upper lashes is because it gives so much

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.209 
upper lashes is because it gives so much
volume<00:05:50.999> and<00:05:51.659> it<00:05:51.809> builds<00:05:52.019> up<00:05:52.229> so<00:05:52.439> much<00:05:52.619> that<00:05:52.679> can

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:53.219 
volume and it builds up so much that can

00:05:53.219 --> 00:06:19.730 
volume and it builds up so much that can
make<00:05:53.549> the<00:05:53.759> upper<00:05:54.059> lashes
