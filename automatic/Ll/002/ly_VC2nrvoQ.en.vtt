00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.740
 Peña grandson when mother to the seagull 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.840

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.950

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.229

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.960
 an inveterate batman fan but 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.300

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.659

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.719
 it was the first and from there I trauma 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:57.770
 I always saw him coming back from school 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:59.329

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.399
 death of cri link and then it was made 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.879
 something typical I also remember that I cry 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.849
 the first day they released dragon ball 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:16.010

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.989

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.440
 coincided with a government report and 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.970
 the chapter cut half thank you 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.680
 presidency of the republic then 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.599
 also to gather all the pinches 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.980
 dragonball cases and I cried too 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.890
 When Chau dies trying to 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.329
 defeat napa and says there was there 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.940
 better than raising your hands to help 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.099
 something that in its gene removes I like to think 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.690
 May thanks to my hair I set myself the 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.310
 I agree that once I dressed up as a goya 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.080
 in high school and it was not halloween 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.670
 and for some reason I was also carrying a 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.500
 wheelchair backpack that my mom had 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.120
 given and that I was sorry to say 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.280
 that I did not like because of casters and 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.750
 they made fun of my colleagues were 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.360
 very difficult times but certainly to 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.810
 goku helped me overcome them an example of 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.590
 dedication of overcoming pil to the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.810
 red patrol such paipai picor or vegueta 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.120
 freezer held reads ma jin wook pib and 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.000
 all the evil dragon dragons are 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.069
 they beat her very bastard goku which 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.799
 makes one wonder if there will be someone in some 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.630
 moment that I beat goku because 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.390
 let's accept it sooner or later the new 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.400
 villain bills from the movie dragonball 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.060
 z the battle of the gods is going to 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.940
 peel attacking another so the truth to me 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.410
 ask what could be someone who 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.959
 I could put on the ropes 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.150
 really to goku so talking about 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.709
 cinema the name of superman came out because 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.959
 although I'm not such a fan I am 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.780
 quite excited also for the new 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.269
 movie the steel man that 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.770
 it practically comes out already but going back to 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.820
 theme who would win 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:58.240
 or superman from my point of view and 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.770
 after an extensive analysis done in 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.970
 the place par excellence where all 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.360
 Men are dedicated to philosophizing to think 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.760
 to meditate 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.620
 and study all the important things 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.750
 of life if I'm talking about the bathroom 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.550
 while my answer finally ends 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.910
 about who to win in a fight I'm still 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.760
 cv or superman is that really never 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.890
 we would get to know it because both 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.160
 characters could start fighting for 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.720
 any dispute whatsoever but both are 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.360
 too good to not get to 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.060
 an understanding they would become friends and 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.520
 maybe they could fight for fun but 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.250
 they would never go so far as to put 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.919
 risk the life of the other so there what 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.750
 have that is my official answer is 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.140
 a fight that would never happen for the 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.410
 nature of both characters but there 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.610
 what do I know? 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.490
 leave me your comments who would win 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.320
 goku or superman in a fight we leave 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.120
