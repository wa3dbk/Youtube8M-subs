00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 it is at the formula 1 sebastian 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.609
 vettel has defeated his home curse and 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.620
 for the first time in his career 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.900
 won great prize from germany 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.880
 With his victory at the Eifel Crime on the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.099
 legendary nürburgring also built his 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.199
 This was overshadowed by the leadership 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.119
 Turbulent race from an accident 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.080
 A boxing stop with a cameraman 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.859
 was injured 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.080
 march finally has it too 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.090
 home worked in the sixth attempt won 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.310
 sebastian vettel the big prize of 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.900
 Germany has a good 50,000 spectators 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.850
 nürburgring cheered with the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:42.030
 local hero over the first home win 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:43.649
 the champion I 've never been 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.289
 So slowly on the way back to the box 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.200
 and to get so much support 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.230
 People also cheer to hear themselves in the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.120
 car was something very special and 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.129
 I am very happy and will be with you 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.030
 Do not forget safety 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.949
 Decisive for the triumph before the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.809
 State drew straight on the first meters 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.820
 vettel at pole man lewis hamilton 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.739
 also teammate mark webber 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.630
 hamilton surprised right at the beginning 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.450
 The Australian had to be in the first 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.810
 But turn behind vettel on position 2 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.090
 a pure because this order remained 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.770
 is up to Weber's momentous first 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.720
 Boxing stop in round nine 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.580
 because although the right one is behind you 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.320
 red bull was not mounted properly 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.140
 or weather from his crew again 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.360
 sent the 15 kilo heavy tire 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.280
 broke away and met a cameraman 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.229
 He was immediately flown to the hospital 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.659
 but apparently only slight 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.100
 violations 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.390
 the mature was loose that is allowed of course 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.159
 not happen 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.509
 the cameraman but luckily only 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.590
 cuts and bruises 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.590
 that is the most important thing 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.190
 Red Bull was later joined by the 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.910
 race commissars to 30,000 dollars penalty 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.500
 sentenced 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.600
 mark webber fell after the incident 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.760
 far back at the end was still 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.860
 seventh little later the next 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.080
 excitement of the maria of jules bianchi 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.270
 fell fire after a engine failure 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.130
 and not enough after that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.110
 Frenchman had gotten out of bed 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.650
 dare to head back onto the track 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.119
 luckily without consequences sebastian vettel 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.770
 did not let any of these things happen 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.720
 do not impress from the attacks 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.820
 the lotus pilots kimi raikkonen and 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.830
 roma great with the leaders in the 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.760
 Closing phase of the race ever closer 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.130
 to turn the corner 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.110
 vettel drove after 60 laps 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.470
 a total of thirtieth prix triumphs 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.450
 home 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.460
 but what seemed so easy and simple 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.410
 was a hard work 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.510
 I can imagine it then 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.690
 It looks pretty much like controlling it though 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.070
 it's really very similar 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.080
 Almost lotus was a tick faster 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.520
 the victory passed sebastian vettel 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.770
 can and croissant 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.600
 when you alonso became fourth before lewis 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.670
 hamilton nico rosberg in the second 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.620
 silver arrow , however, came only one 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.000
 disappointing ninth-ranking yes very 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.770
 difficult day today was just not 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.570
 Nice to drive, yes, just from the beginning 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.400
 not fast enough to be quite the opposite 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.590
 to sebastian vettel the world champion 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.140
 built his advantage in the driver-wm 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.310
 with the victory at the nürburgring on now 34 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.310
 points out
