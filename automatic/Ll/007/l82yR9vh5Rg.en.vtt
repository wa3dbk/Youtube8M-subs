actually focus more on mass building
workouts<00:03:36.410> or<00:03:37.190> mass<00:03:37.400> building<00:03:37.790> exercises<00:03:38.210> kind

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
workouts or mass building exercises kind

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.450 
workouts or mass building exercises kind
of<00:03:38.540> like<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.720> barbell<00:03:39.080> curls<00:03:39.410> or<00:03:39.650> the
