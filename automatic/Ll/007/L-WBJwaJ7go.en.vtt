index.php I'm going to click create new
file<00:00:51.870> that's<00:00:52.500> created<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.399> here<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:53.969> me

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
file that's created that in here for me

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.990 
file that's created that in here for me
now<00:00:55.079> I'm<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.649> click<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.010> code<00:00:56.370> editor<00:00:56.760> so

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
now I'm going to click on code editor so

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.470 
now I'm going to click on code editor so
we<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.239> start<00:00:57.510> editing<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:58.079> file<00:00:59.390> okay<00:01:00.390> so

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
we can start editing this file okay so

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.970 
we can start editing this file okay so
obviously<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.960> first<00:01:00.989> thing<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.440> want<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.710> do

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
obviously the first thing we want to do

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.380 
obviously the first thing we want to do
is<00:01:02.219> create<00:01:02.640> PHP<00:01:03.059> tags<00:01:03.860> now<00:01:04.860> if<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.210> mail

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
is create PHP tags now if the mail

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.390 
is create PHP tags now if the mail
function<00:01:06.659> basically<00:01:07.080> looks<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
function basically looks like this and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.240 
function basically looks like this and
it<00:01:08.760> takes<00:01:08.970> typically<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> case<00:01:11.130> that

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
it takes typically in the case that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.490 
it takes typically in the case that
we're<00:01:11.369> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.640> four<00:01:11.970> parameters<00:01:12.630> one

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
we're going to do four parameters one

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.840 
we're going to do four parameters one
after<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.040> optional<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.460> think<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.670> takes

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
after that is optional I think it takes

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.780 
after that is optional I think it takes
5<00:01:15.090> parameters<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:16.080> total<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.610> go<00:01:17.729> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
5 parameters in total but you can go to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.920 
5 parameters in total but you can go to
the<00:01:18.030> pier<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.049> manual<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.560> look<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.830> up

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
the pier to be manual to look that up

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.859 
the pier to be manual to look that up
now<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.830> need<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.159> create<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.640> few<00:01:24.030> variables<00:01:24.060> in

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
now we need to create a few variables in

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.719 
now we need to create a few variables in
order<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.320> put<00:01:25.650> into<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.070> function<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
order to put into this function the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.020 
order to put into this function the
first<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.630> 2<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.460> email<00:01:29.790> address

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
first one is 2 this is the email address

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.140 
first one is 2 this is the email address
that<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> email<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.710> sent<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.150> so
