00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.140
 Y 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.469
 hello friends today let's see a little how 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.440
 you can get more out of it like this 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.970
 debuted several years ago 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.490
 Manu was a slightly decaffeinated debut 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.920
 because while it's true that in 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.240
 America in case they had enough functions 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.160
 interesting from the beginning in the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.650
 rest of countries because it was quite 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.439
 limited but with the passage of time it 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.070
 has been improving and maybe because 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.480
 users from outside the US because we 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.329
 we are with that first site and that of 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.950
 little served and that is quite different 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.440
 to which there is today that really we 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:46.030
 offers quite interesting utilities 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.520
 much faster accesses allow us 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.900
 save time and they also offer us 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.940
 a lot of information 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.860
 good without even needing 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.770
 unlock the device let's see 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.440
 some examples then for less than 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.870
 you may use and keep trying new 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.860
 things for example something let's start 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.490
 for the most basic how is 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.060
 set an alarm if we press go 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.060
 to press on itself 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.539
 or the series 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.960
 very good I want you to wake me up more 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.950
 I'll touch the button if I do not 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.510
 listen out 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.960
 I want you to wake me up tomorrow 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.960
 8 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.590
 the alarm is set for the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.960
 easy ideas 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.680
 configuring the weapon that is already 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.630
 activated could also configure 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.759
 reminders and even reminders 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.799
 complexes that is not typical 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.409
 reminder of the two remind me 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.880
 even by location for example 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.380
 siri tomorrow when I get home 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.560
 remind me that I have to call my 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.560
 father 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.760
 this is your reminder for tomorrow 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:57.460
 I 'll let you know when it tells you a reminder 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.820
 How good, then, that when I get to 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.800
 home 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.210
 by location I have to call my 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.140
 father also says it to me 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.180
 automatically sets an hour to the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.560
 nine I do not know why it will mean that 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.770
 it will be the time when they only arrive home 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.970
 I do not know, but well, yes, no, yes, 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.150
 nine I have not come home because 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.770
 will also warn me good to others 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.030
 also quite basic functions 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.340
 would be for example him 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.020
 the enable and disable bluetooth wi-fi 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.810
 or even the mode not be for example 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.080
 let's see it is go and deactivate the 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.080
 bluetooth 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.350
 and off I can also the no mode 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.240
 bother 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.240
 if you activate the non-discomfort mode 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.410
 and without even having to unlock 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.090
 the device I insist everything with the 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.750
 locked device and only 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.940
 having to press the start button 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.340
 there are also other functions for example 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.350
 results of parts for example we are going to 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.840
 see that as I give in Madrid against 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.290
 the seville is to go and how was yesterday the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.290
 real madrid 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.420
 Yesterday Real Madrid beat Sevilla 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.270
 by a narrow margin with a result of 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.390
 3 to 2 as you see all information 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.970
 fairly detailed scoring results 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.090
 where was the soccer game quite 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.710
 complete also a for example not 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.660
 only football there are other sports 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.210
 that also gives you information but not 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.560
 everyone 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.560
 How did the NBA go? 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.930
 here is the table of results of 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.790
 all divisions the central 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.790
 Atlantic of this all divisions 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.640
 Dain of all classifications 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.750
 it offers them on the screen 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.590
 can also help us find 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.390
 Nearby restaurants for example 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.450
 siri recommends me a restaurant 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.450
 Italian 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.910
 look what I have found offers me then 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.240
 four different restaurants a 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.540
 different distances and also on top 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.790
 with references to them to be able 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.780
 see user reviews for 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.730
 example let's see this one that has eight 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.610
 reviews on tripadvisor you see gives me the 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.110
 map your phone location and eight 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.150
 trip advisor reviews that I can 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.090
 access directly from it 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.040
 screen 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.110
 you see that I have here I can even 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.660
 register a visit or add my own 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.479
 review I insist all this with the screen 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.979
 blocked without accessing 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.820
 have to unlock the device or 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.350
 even put the password more things 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.689
 for example the movies that they cast in 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.459
 cinema 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:44.459
 siri that there are films in cinema 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.690
 look, I found 6 movies that 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.900
 can see today is quite far from 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.730
 guadix as you see gives me the movies that 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.550
 there is closer here and automatically 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:01.650
 choose 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:03.900
 a movie theater and well, since I can 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.880
 even access information about the 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.260
 movie if I pulse on it tells me 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:14.880
 schedules tells me so good actors 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.319
 for how much the age for which is 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.199
 recommended a summary of the film 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:22.060
 enough information even if he put in 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.660
 the top part, it tells me where 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.580
 is the cinema and schedules about the 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.630
 movies for example in usa so you 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.630
 also allows to buy tickets 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.849
 here for the moment, we do not have to 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.300
 wait 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.159
 and more things also allows me 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.040
 directly that calculates me from the route 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.720
 to somewhere 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.490
 siri 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.380
 make me the route to get to madrid 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.190
 you want me to help you with something give me the 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.190
 route to get to madrid 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.470
 here you have the indications up 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.470
 Madrid 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.030
 here is going to ask you to unlock the 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.900
 device and already calculates the route 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.040
 towards asia madrid as you can always 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.980
 different routes with the different 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.770
 schedules so that I choose the one that the 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.139
 prefer 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.930
 let's go back to that 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.789
 and now we are going to show other 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.870
 other possibilities offered such as 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:30.620
 to make a call or directly 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.620
 send a message 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.830
 sir and send a message to my wife 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.970
 agree what you want to tell 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.970
 hope of santiago 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.100
 I'll be late it's not mine 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:07:01.850
 I do not send it quite simple enough and 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.930
 good as you can see during all the 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.280
 different plants that the done the 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.460
 language that you can use is a 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:11.509
 pretty natural language there is no no 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:14.710
 you need to speak in tarzan mode in mode 

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:18.350
 robot is a quite natural language and 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.970
 practically all the questions 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.340
 that you realize you understand them to the 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:26.449
 first and you do not need to go around repeating 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.160
 to get good results are 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:29.720
 only some examples there are many 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.930
 more things that can be done open 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.930
 applications and such a man if it would improve 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.520
 a lot if apple gave you access to 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.710
 good developers could happen to 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.990
 the best in mine 9 and be able to send 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.520
 whatsapp and be able to send emails 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.400
 electronic from other applications 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.650
 different than emails or playing music 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.840
 of spotify but good with its 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:53.440
 limitations does not stop being quite 

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.940
 interesting what it does offer us 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.940
 that's all until next time
