00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:10.440
 then if you want to dedicate yourself to the 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.160
 do self-repair yourself what you do 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.800
 we strongly advise you not to do of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.510
 do not do and replace the radiator 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.850
 hot air from the fiat punto since 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.930
 we are exactly seven hours we are 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:33.530
 here more or less and we have taken apart 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:39.079
 practically all the cockpit interior 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.079
 to find this little object here 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:56.750
 the result is this the block of the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.750
 air conditioning and was mounted 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.710
 so what we recommend 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.590
 strongly do not do if it breaks 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:17.790
 ask an expert remember a 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:24.030
 expert here is practically necessary 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:27.740
 dismantle everything, starting with 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.900
 steering column steering wheel 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:37.790
 tunnel dashboard 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:43.580
 then what else in short all the part that 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.510
 the passenger compartment is the part of the 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.820
 instrumentation 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:52.940
 in short, afterwards, then in the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:02:02.660
 meanwhile unscrew I don't know if they are seen 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:06.880
 well there are a series of 7 8's from of that 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:11.030
 practically stop the bridge at 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.310
 very narrow and very difficult frame 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.130
 to find 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.420
 but the skilled hands or chocolate there 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:26.360
 I managed to sneak in there 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:29.239
 naturally then these happen 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.480
 small inconveniences that we remember 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:36.110
 they still had a vine leaf 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:40.880
 they will advance and God send us good 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.480
 to reassemble all thanks 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.470
 attention 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.470
 see you later
