00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.440
 how about guys and girls today I bring you 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.770
 a new video in which I will show you 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.049
 another page as you teach me before in 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.570
 another video to get points and with 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.960
 these points because I can get things 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.119
 OK 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.670
 good what you have to do basically 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.440
 is to make challenges worth 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.090
 for example I'm there we go 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.720
 come on there's nothing that the pages I for 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.340
 example 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.340
 and give new life to Andalusia 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:45.610
 and now if you want to say this to have 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.610
 a little more information about the challenge 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.880
 a little more from Andalusia 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:58.050
 and answering these questions or with those 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.120
 things you can already earn points worth 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.470
 and for example which province is the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.600
 capital of the column 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.890
 Seville 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.290
 which of all these solutions 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.290
 old have left their mark in Andalusia 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.930
 no no no no 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.250
 I believe that all is worth and happy everything 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.219
 look 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.970
 but what you do not know is worth 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.780
 I do not have a fucking idea either but 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.780
 gave priority to guarantees 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.710
 and now give us here the points that 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.610
 we won with beige does not earn 40 points 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.860
 of 100 is worth now but that all 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.760
 challenges 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.760
 now we have 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.940
 1,663 is worth when they have many points 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.460
 how do you spend? 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.510
 because it's here to the shopping center and it gives 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.510
 Our catalog is worth 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.970
 and look what you can get worth 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.390
 here choose what you want for 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.570
 example leisure sport technology in this 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.570
 case 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.129
 with technology 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.460
 as you have seen 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.430
 how can you win iphone 5 a hard drive 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.610
 of 2 terabytes a samsung galaxy a the 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.650
 fact of winning mobile mouse 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.150
 etc 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.690
 at hand leisure 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.550
 to see that there is the ad 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.000
 What I mean is that this 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.790
 as time goes by, 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.040
 varying knows this is not the only thing 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.820
 will always see is always not going 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.120
 to be the nintendo 3ds and to 54,000 and not 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.970
 the ps vita will always be there already 89,000 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.840
 it's not going to change and they're also going to change 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.930
 the price and those things are worth 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.819
 you can also give 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.609
 the loss of chacao which is what the 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.609
 people most often redeem vouchers 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.010
 look how you see an acoustic guitar 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:49.170
 and electric English an oil and are 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:54.580
 four but see them point to get 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:59.260
 a macbook voucher and a canon camera 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.520
 robot I think to clean read and 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.710
 in pre banking 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.590
 These are deposits that study 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.180
 well in what you put a quantity of 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.120
 points and together after a 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:16.100
 time then 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:20.120
 the 7 sum is worth I invested 2000 points 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.690
 on this day he wins on this day 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.560
 and how much the paid ones earn between 3 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:31.280
 percent would be 180 in total I would give 2 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.650
 180 thousand worth 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.949
 and one thing when you have 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.830
 investment this these can not 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.419
 use 1 p I think when they have 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.689
 investment or you can use both these 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.000
 that neither these that is worth 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:50.220
 I can not use what I hope 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.110
 I do not know for sure I'm in shape and when 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.139
 I will answer it and those things too 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.689
 can you? 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.629
 you can also invite your friends 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:05.060
 when you invite your friends because there 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:08.229
 points on the page now earns points no 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.229
 I know how many points it is worth 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.200
 and I also want to say what I wanted that 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:19.150
 this is a lie that I do not know no lie 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.150
 ok I asked for a cup of 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.390
 ask for a message or pen cup 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.569
 solidary 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.699
 and I was attracted to home 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.860
 it took a little bit but I was attracted to 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.639
 house is good and I hope you have 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.009
 liked what 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:39.340
 work I leave to participate to that 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:43.560

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.560
 things and see you the next video bye bye
