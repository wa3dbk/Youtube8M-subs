asked<00:00:05.670> me<00:00:05.730> what<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.240> think<00:00:06.629> about<00:00:06.720> modeling

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
asked me what I think about modeling

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.320 
asked me what I think about modeling
software<00:00:07.410> versus<00:00:08.130> analog<00:00:08.490> amplifier

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330

simulation<00:00:09.990> pedals<00:00:10.320> so<00:00:10.950> let's<00:00:11.460> get<00:00:11.610> into<00:00:11.820> this

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
simulation pedals so let's get into this

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.270 
simulation pedals so let's get into this
I<00:00:12.120> wanted<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.900> start<00:00:13.200> by<00:00:13.349> saying<00:00:13.769> I've<00:00:14.070> just

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
I wanted to start by saying I've just

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.550 
I wanted to start by saying I've just
had<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.460> chance<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:15.299> use<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.690> full<00:00:15.900> version<00:00:16.350> of

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
had a chance to use the full version of

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.490 
had a chance to use the full version of
bias<00:00:17.330> from<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.630> guys<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:19.080> make<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
bias from the guys that make the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.330 
bias from the guys that make the
software<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.390> while<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:21.810> really<00:00:22.619> in-depth

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
software and while it's really in-depth

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.550 
software and while it's really in-depth
and<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.150> do<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.660> much<00:00:24.869> with<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.470> it

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
and you can do so much with it and it

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.300 
and you can do so much with it and it
sounds<00:00:26.130> quite<00:00:26.939> good<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.710> found<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.010> little

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
sounds quite good I found it a little

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.450 
sounds quite good I found it a little
over<00:00:29.760> complicated<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:31.560> people<00:00:31.769> who<00:00:31.920> are

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
over complicated so for people who are

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.370 
over complicated so for people who are
new<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.790> home<00:00:33.090> recording<00:00:33.690> or<00:00:33.870> they're<00:00:34.200> just

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
new to home recording or they're just

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.160 
new to home recording or they're just
starting<00:00:34.680> out<00:00:34.920> with<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.219> kind<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.550> stuff<00:00:35.820> I

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
starting out with this kind of stuff I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.959 
starting out with this kind of stuff I
honestly<00:00:37.170> say<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:38.070> amplifier

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
honestly say that the amplifier

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.440 
honestly say that the amplifier

simulation pedals by tech 21 or joyeux

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.260 
simulation pedals by tech 21 or joyeux
are<00:00:42.450> definitely<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> way<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.260> go<00:00:43.620> if<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.550> know

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
are definitely the way to go if you know

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.819 
are definitely the way to go if you know
what<00:00:45.570> kind<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.899> sound<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.500> if<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.800> like

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
what kind of sound you like if you like

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.279 
what kind of sound you like if you like
a<00:00:46.980> Fender<00:00:47.460> tone<00:00:48.149> then<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.480> go<00:00:48.690> get<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.020> blonde

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
a Fender tone then you go get the blonde

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.380 
a Fender tone then you go get the blonde

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.380 
pedal by tech 21 or the American sound
pedal<00:00:51.719> or<00:00:52.219> you<00:00:53.219> could<00:00:53.370> go<00:00:53.550> get<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.030> mess<00:00:54.210> of

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
pedal or you could go get the mess of

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.150 
pedal or you could go get the mess of
boogie<00:00:54.660> version<00:00:55.320> or<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.530> Mesa<00:00:55.800> Boogie

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
boogie version or the Mesa Boogie

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.069 
boogie version or the Mesa Boogie
version<00:00:56.670> depending<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.090> where<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.270> live<00:00:57.420> so

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
version depending on where you live so

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.720 
version depending on where you live so
yeah<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:59.039> get<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.609> specific<00:01:00.149> pedal<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
yeah you can get a specific pedal a

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.270 
yeah you can get a specific pedal a
specific<00:01:02.730> sound<00:01:02.969> what<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.049> benefit<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
specific sound what the benefit of the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.120 
specific sound what the benefit of the
software<00:01:05.700> does<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.930> does<00:01:07.080> everything<00:01:07.500> but

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
software does is it does everything but

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.190 
software does is it does everything but
the<00:01:08.520> trade-off<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.080> be

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the trade-off for that is you have to be

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.100 
the trade-off for that is you have to be
somewhat<00:01:10.590> technically<00:01:11.159> minded<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:12.030> set<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.020> up

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
somewhat technically minded to set it up

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.289 
somewhat technically minded to set it up
I've<00:01:13.380> been<00:01:13.770> doing<00:01:14.100> audio<00:01:14.670> engineering<00:01:15.090> for

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
I've been doing audio engineering for

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.050 
I've been doing audio engineering for
years<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.710> found<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> little<00:01:17.610> more

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
years and I found it a little more

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.969 
years and I found it a little more
complicated<00:01:18.420> than<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.930> thought<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.409> set<00:01:19.619> up<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
complicated than I thought to set up and

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.789 
complicated than I thought to set up and
I've<00:01:20.700> also<00:01:20.880> been<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.299> ITV's<00:01:21.780> I'm<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> server

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.350 
admin I've done websites I've done lots
of<00:01:24.689> stuff<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.250> guy<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.610> myself<00:01:27.000> we

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
of stuff so for a guy like myself we

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.170 
of stuff so for a guy like myself we
spent<00:01:27.689> last<00:01:27.930> 7<00:01:28.320> years<00:01:28.350> straight<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.070> IT<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
spent last 7 years straight in IT to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.390 
spent last 7 years straight in IT to
find<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.509> complicated<00:01:30.710> yeah<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.950> kind<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.250> put

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
find it complicated yeah it kind of put

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.950 
find it complicated yeah it kind of put
me<00:01:32.430> off<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.850> little<00:01:33.090> bit<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> got<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.750> work

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
me off it a little bit I got it to work

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.399 
me off it a little bit I got it to work
and<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:35.189> does<00:01:35.430> sound<00:01:35.759> really<00:01:36.090> good<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.720> sounds

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and it does sound really good it sounds

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.130 
and it does sound really good it sounds
great<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:38.030> context<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.150> recordings<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:39.990> you're

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
great in context to recordings if you're

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.580 
great in context to recordings if you're
just<00:01:40.409> using<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.210> recording<00:01:42.210> at<00:01:42.299> home<00:01:42.590> it's

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
just using it for recording at home it's

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.289 
just using it for recording at home it's
going<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:43.979> fine<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.549> know<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
going to be fine just know that the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.660 
going to be fine just know that the
technical<00:01:45.630> side<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.409> how<00:01:47.280> much<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
technical side of it and how much you

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.980 
technical side of it and how much you
can<00:01:47.820> tweak<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.299> may<00:01:48.479> outweigh<00:01:48.960> your

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
can tweak it may outweigh your

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.819 
can tweak it may outweigh your
productivity<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.100> think<00:01:50.909> sometimes<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.840> amp

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
productivity I think sometimes the amp

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.859 
productivity I think sometimes the amp
simulation<00:01:53.579> pedals<00:01:53.970> I've<00:01:54.390> got<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.780> my

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
simulation pedals I've got one on my

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.100 
simulation pedals I've got one on my
desk<00:01:55.229> right<00:01:55.590> now<00:01:55.880> it's<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.329> easy<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.869> use

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
desk right now it's just so easy to use

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.780 
desk right now it's just so easy to use
and<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.710> use<00:01:58.890> all<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.219> your<00:01:59.520> existing

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
and you can use all of your existing

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.030 
and you can use all of your existing
pedals<00:02:00.390> with<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.750> some<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> modeling

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
pedals with it some of the modeling

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.330 
pedals with it some of the modeling
software<00:02:02.420> like<00:02:03.420> bias<00:02:03.719> for<00:02:04.110> example<00:02:04.500> doesn't

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
software like bias for example doesn't

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.119 
software like bias for example doesn't
have<00:02:05.490> pedal<00:02:05.820> effects<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.890> wanted<00:02:08.069> to

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
have pedal effects and if you wanted to

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.850 
have pedal effects and if you wanted to
use<00:02:08.310> your<00:02:08.429> pedals<00:02:08.819> with<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.170> good<00:02:10.170> luck<00:02:10.379> you'd

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
use your pedals with it good luck you'd

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.420 
use your pedals with it good luck you'd
have<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.160> maybe<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.550> it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
have to maybe do it

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.250 
have to maybe do it
after<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:13.000> fact<00:02:13.209> we'll<00:02:13.450> see<00:02:13.629> how<00:02:13.780> they<00:02:13.959> sound

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
after the fact we'll see how they sound

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.369 
after the fact we'll see how they sound
as<00:02:14.560> an<00:02:14.709> extra<00:02:15.069> VST<00:02:15.640> plug-in<00:02:16.599> on<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.989> particular

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
as an extra VST plug-in on a particular

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.559 
as an extra VST plug-in on a particular
section<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.099> song<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.730> don't<00:02:19.150> know<00:02:19.359> how

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
section of the song I don't know how

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.729 
section of the song I don't know how
that's<00:02:19.689> going<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:19.989> sound<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.349> haven't<00:02:20.620> tested

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
that's going to sound I haven't tested

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:21.449 
that's going to sound I haven't tested
that<00:02:21.069> yet

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
that yet

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.220 
that yet
but<00:02:21.969> if<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.299> already<00:02:22.420> love<00:02:22.540> your<00:02:22.900> pedal<00:02:23.200> board

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
but if you already love your pedal board

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.979 
but if you already love your pedal board
and<00:02:24.129> you<00:02:24.250> want<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.879> just<00:02:25.030> record<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.569> in<00:02:25.689> a<00:02:25.780> very

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
and you want to just record it in a very

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.500 
and you want to just record it in a very
simple<00:02:26.200> way<00:02:26.500> for<00:02:26.769> me<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:28.120> can't<00:02:28.359> go<00:02:28.480> past

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
simple way for me you can't go past

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.610 
simple way for me you can't go past
those<00:02:29.319> amplifier<00:02:30.040> simulation<00:02:30.670> pedals<00:02:31.000> I

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
those amplifier simulation pedals I

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.319 
those amplifier simulation pedals I
actually<00:02:32.620> bought<00:02:33.040> one<00:02:33.430> by<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.849> company<00:02:34.239> called

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
actually bought one by a company called

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.490 
actually bought one by a company called
NOx<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.079> it's<00:02:36.069> an<00:02:36.159> amp<00:02:36.340> digital<00:02:36.849> amplifier

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
NOx and it's an amp digital amplifier

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.110 
NOx and it's an amp digital amplifier
simulation<00:02:38.500> pedal<00:02:38.799> it<00:02:39.219> does<00:02:39.459> all<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.819> fender

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
simulation pedal it does all the fender

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.449 
simulation pedal it does all the fender
amps<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:40.689> forth<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.799> thing<00:02:42.069> sounds

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
amps and so forth and that thing sounds

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.709 
amps and so forth and that thing sounds
amazing<00:02:42.730> as<00:02:43.060> well<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.269> you<00:02:43.420> can<00:02:43.480> run<00:02:43.689> your

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:43.719 
amazing as well and you can run your

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.390 
amazing as well and you can run your
pedals<00:02:44.139> into<00:02:44.409> that<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:44.799> there<00:02:44.980> are<00:02:45.129> other

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
pedals into that so there are other

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.000 
pedals into that so there are other
options<00:02:45.700> than<00:02:46.239> just<00:02:46.450> tech<00:02:46.870> 21<00:02:47.260> or<00:02:47.379> joyeux<00:02:47.590> and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
options than just tech 21 or joyeux and

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.640 
options than just tech 21 or joyeux and
there'll<00:02:49.000> be<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.120> video<00:02:49.269> posted<00:02:49.959> on<00:02:50.139> my<00:02:50.260> youtube

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
there'll be a video posted on my youtube

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.009 
there'll be a video posted on my youtube
channel<00:02:50.680> pretty<00:02:51.159> soon<00:02:51.489> with<00:02:52.269> a<00:02:52.299> demo<00:02:52.750> about

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
channel pretty soon with a demo about

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.069 
channel pretty soon with a demo about
that<00:02:53.439> pedal<00:02:53.769> so<00:02:54.040> great<00:02:54.609> question<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:55.269> thanks

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
that pedal so great question and thanks

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.709 
that pedal so great question and thanks
to<00:02:56.230> Giulio<00:02:56.590> for<00:02:57.389> submitting<00:02:58.389> that<00:02:58.540> on

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:58.719 
to Giulio for submitting that on

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.110 
to Giulio for submitting that on
Facebook<00:02:59.319> because<00:02:59.650> yeah<00:03:00.129> really<00:03:00.459> cool<00:03:00.700> topic

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
Facebook because yeah really cool topic

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.869 
Facebook because yeah really cool topic
and<00:03:01.469> it's<00:03:02.469> yeah<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:02.980> hope<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.489> answers<00:03:03.849> the

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
and it's yeah I hope that answers the

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.690 
and it's yeah I hope that answers the
question<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.480> think<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.840> comes<00:03:05.049> down<00:03:05.230> to

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
question I think it comes down to

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.390 
question I think it comes down to
productivity<00:03:06.700> versus<00:03:07.629> tweak<00:03:07.900> ability<00:03:08.400> versus

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
productivity versus tweak ability versus

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.550 
productivity versus tweak ability versus
technical<00:03:09.879> knowledge<00:03:10.030> versus<00:03:10.840> non<00:03:11.049> technical

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
technical knowledge versus non technical

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.459 
technical knowledge versus non technical
knowledge<00:03:11.739> in<00:03:12.159> terms<00:03:12.849> of<00:03:13.209> warmth<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:14.019> tone

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:14.469 
knowledge in terms of warmth of tone

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:16.770 
knowledge in terms of warmth of tone
both<00:03:15.040> of<00:03:15.280> them<00:03:15.430> still<00:03:15.700> sound<00:03:15.969> good<00:03:16.209> but<00:03:16.659> I'm

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
both of them still sound good but I'm

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.270 
both of them still sound good but I'm
still<00:03:17.139> going<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.349> lean<00:03:17.560> towards<00:03:18.069> the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
still going to lean towards the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.189 
still going to lean towards the
amplifier<00:03:19.120> simulation<00:03:19.720> pedal<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.079> that's

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:20.199 
amplifier simulation pedal so that's

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.159 
amplifier simulation pedal so that's
just<00:03:20.319> my<00:03:20.590> two<00:03:20.650> cents
