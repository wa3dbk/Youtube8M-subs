and<00:01:47.040> work<00:01:47.100> my<00:01:47.310> way<00:01:47.549> around

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.849 

in<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.520> website<00:01:57.119> says<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:58.350> don't<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.770> do

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
this twice I do I feel like it needs it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.950 
this twice I do I feel like it needs it
twice<00:02:04.729> because<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:06.060> stuff<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.329> not<00:02:06.719> very

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
twice because this stuff is not very

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.430 
twice because this stuff is not very
thick<00:02:07.859> you<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:10.519> powdery<00:02:11.519> although<00:02:12.440> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
thick you know it's powdery although it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.890 
thick you know it's powdery although it
doesn't<00:02:13.620> go<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:14.010> like<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.280> powder<00:02:14.750> which<00:02:15.750> is

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
doesn't go on like a powder which is

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.190 
doesn't go on like a powder which is
nice<00:02:16.700> all<00:02:17.700> right<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.750> then<00:02:18.870> you're<00:02:19.049> going<00:02:19.140> to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
nice all right and then you're going to

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.640 
nice all right and then you're going to
use<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:20.239> coverage<00:02:21.239> one<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> little<00:02:22.440> tiny

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
use the coverage one just a little tiny

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.300 
use the coverage one just a little tiny
one<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.530> think<00:02:25.620> you're<00:02:25.860> still<00:02:26.069> supposed<00:02:26.190> to
