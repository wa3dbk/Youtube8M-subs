00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:12.019
 two 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.019
 do not 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.910
 why 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.870
 friends 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.110
 suda51 returns to your console with dolly pop 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.840
 6 or the mind responsible for games like 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.940
 no more heros or shadows of them signature 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.290
 another surreal action game that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.600
 take advantage of the pull that the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.000
 zombies in recent years throws a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.900
 look at the olive game show and discover if 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.900
 fits in your profile 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.399
 juliette is a university cheerleader 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.290
 that has it all is popular has a 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.110
 boyfriend that he loves very much and is 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.760
 point to celebrate his birthday the only 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.680
 inconvenience in your life is that the 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.960
 city where you live is infested 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.810
 of zombies and that does not make any easy 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.119
 little boyfriend's birthday 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.680
 just infected and the only way to 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.229
 prevent him from becoming a dead 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.500
 living is to separate your head from the rest 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.500
 of the body 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.750
 so giulietta ends up facing 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.580
 the zombies with their mechanical saw in 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.000
 hand and the head of her boyfriend like 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.990
 keychain to folklore 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.530
 zombie 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.530
 do not 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.420
 Hello 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.750
 the operation of lollipop chainsaw 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.000
 it's pretty basic at an essential level 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.260
 only one possible path and many areas in 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.210
 which will be locked with 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.040
 crowd of zombies and those that do not 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.229
 you can leave until you have finished 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.759
 with all of them from time to time 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.680
 You will find special sections to 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.810
 mechanical level like driving a 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.000
 tractor or the winks to videogames 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.620
 classics of the arcade and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.420
 different sequences based on the 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.250
 rapid response events that bring 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.250
 a little color to the general tonic 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.480
 and of course at the end of each screen 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.860
 a final boss who will follow a pattern not 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.860
 too difficult to intervene 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.519
 when the two hours of play expire 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.170
 approximately you will receive a 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.359
 grenade launcher that will change the focus of 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.310
 the fighting of the game the hack and slash 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.349
 of three buttons will lose exclusivity 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.150
 and you will have the possibility to aim and 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.519
 shoot as long as you have bullets 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.109
 in the bedroom in response to this 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.239
 you will start to find creatures that 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.280
 they attack from the air zombies in flames and 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.200
 loaded with dynamite and barrels 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.639
 explosives that burn or freeze everything 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.639
 he who walks near the explosion 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.310
 as the adventure advances and you go 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.200
 perfecting our game you will receive 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.090
 gold coins to exchange for improvements 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.610
 of health and strength for juliette or new 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.110
 techniques with the chainsaw and coins 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.940
 silver that you can invest in new 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.550
 outfits for the protagonist to look 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.340
 or extra content like songs or 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.410
 production designs the negative point 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.270
 in this section it puts a control something 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.100
 rough despite the completeness that can 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.050
 get to appear on paper the 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.700
 camera does not help either and the zombies 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.980
 interrupt your chains of combos 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.690
 constantly because of a kind of 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.550
 delay in the control that causes 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.740
 little speed that prints juliette in 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.780
 every movement is something that you 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.760
 you get used to the end and it can even be 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.890
 something intentional but not just 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.850
 convince and get you never feel 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.850
 that you master the control 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.109
 you are already seeing that graphically 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.659
 lollipop 6 or does not break any mold in 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.829
 general is correct makes a very good use 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.219
 of the aesthetics of American comics 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:03.920
 classic in its interfaces and of course 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:05.810
 as in the whole game of suda51 the 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.629
 sense of humor takes care of 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.739
 the singing voice of the wing 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.739
 Stephen Hawking 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.630
 and the absurd and spicy jokes are the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.360
 the guiding thread of this game in fact 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.130
 thinking for a second a cheerleader 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.410
 very good to see that he is wearing the head of his 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.000
 boyfriend as a key chain and a chainsaw for 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.190
 kill all the zombies of his 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.490
 city â€‹â€‹without sense of humor 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.840
 this game would have neither feet nor head 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.100
 fortunately he has it and it turns out 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.100
 tremendously funny 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.819
 in summary lollipop chainsaw is one of 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.409
 those games that I have not seen coming and that 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.020
 I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:02.060
 is far from the podium of its kind but 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.949
 If you like the action and the sense of 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.110
 suda51 humor has already made you laugh 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.110
 before sure you have a good time 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:17.599
 they are already 6
