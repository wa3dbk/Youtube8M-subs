make a v cut okay so when you do the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.720 
make a v cut okay so when you do the
v-cut<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:27.390> easiest<00:03:27.870> way<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.080> do<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.290> v<00:03:28.590> cut<00:03:28.730> is

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
v-cut the easiest way to do a v cut is

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:39.350 
v-cut the easiest way to do a v cut is
to<00:03:29.970> fold<00:03:30.660> your<00:03:30.870> ribbon<00:03:33.050> like<00:03:34.050> so<00:03:34.940> cap<00:03:37.819> cut<00:03:38.819> at
