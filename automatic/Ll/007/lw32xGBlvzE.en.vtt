is as here which is um rapid strike I'll
show<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.290> as<00:02:21.410> an<00:02:21.500> example<00:02:21.800> I've<00:02:22.790> still<00:02:23.060> got

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
show you as an example I've still got

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.020 
show you as an example I've still got
some<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.630> tape<00:02:23.840> on<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.230> still<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:25.030> what

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
some of the tape on it still and what

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.760 
some of the tape on it still and what
I've<00:02:26.120> been<00:02:26.150> doing<00:02:26.450> is<00:02:26.690> when<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:27.410> want<00:02:27.590> to

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
I've been doing is when you want to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.400 
I've been doing is when you want to
spray<00:02:28.130> paint<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.490> knife<00:02:28.670> gun<00:02:29.260> well<00:02:30.260> if<00:02:30.350> you

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
spray paint a knife gun well if you

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.580 
spray paint a knife gun well if you
don't<00:02:30.620> want<00:02:30.800> some<00:02:31.040> bits<00:02:31.400> um<00:02:31.820> in<00:02:32.450> some<00:02:33.230> color

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
don't want some bits um in some color

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.560 
don't want some bits um in some color
you<00:02:33.800> can<00:02:34.010> always<00:02:34.160> take<00:02:34.489> them<00:02:34.640> off<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.030> it's<00:02:35.300> a

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
you can always take them off and it's a

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.900 
you can always take them off and it's a
very<00:02:36.170> effective<00:02:36.440> kind<00:02:37.130> of<00:02:37.280> method<00:02:37.580> because

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
very effective kind of method because

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.600

when you have to do is tape tape it down
and<00:02:41.150> as<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.020> can<00:02:42.170> see<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.410> here<00:02:42.590> I'm<00:02:42.800> actually

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
and as you can see you here I'm actually

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.900 
and as you can see you here I'm actually
done<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.459> yet<00:02:43.610> but<00:02:44.080> I've<00:02:45.080> taped<00:02:45.470> off<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:46.160> bits

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
done it yet but I've taped off the bits

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.460

this there's a silver streak down here
and<00:02:52.660> some<00:02:53.660> bits<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.019> can<00:02:54.170> see<00:02:54.320> I'm<00:02:54.410> not<00:02:54.530> sure

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
and some bits you can see I'm not sure

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.870 
and some bits you can see I'm not sure
if<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:54.860> can<00:02:54.950> see<00:02:55.130> but<00:02:55.370> there's<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.170> amazing

if you can see but there's a amazing
line<00:02:58.880> between<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.570> silver<00:02:59.870> and<00:02:59.989> black<00:03:00.019> here

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
line between the silver and black here

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.160 
line between the silver and black here
which<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:02.630> take<00:03:03.260> before<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:05.720> can<00:03:05.930> do<00:03:06.080> it

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.020 
which I take before and you can do it
it's<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.530> very<00:03:06.739> good<00:03:06.860> method<00:03:07.010> for<00:03:07.220> scraping<00:03:07.549> so

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
it's a very good method for scraping so

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.250 
it's a very good method for scraping so

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.850 
if you want to make sure you want to get
this<00:03:09.880> details<00:03:10.880> like<00:03:11.360> separate<00:03:12.110> then<00:03:12.530> make

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
this details like separate then make

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.220 
this details like separate then make
sure<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:13.190> tape<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:13.820> down<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.299> recommend

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
sure you tape it down I recommend

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.319 
sure you tape it down I recommend
masking<00:03:15.799> tape<00:03:16.010> because<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.549> tried<00:03:16.790> packaging

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
masking tape because I tried packaging

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.440 
masking tape because I tried packaging
tape<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:18.160> you<00:03:19.160> can't<00:03:19.370> stay<00:03:19.519> on<00:03:19.640> here<00:03:19.850> but<00:03:20.090> it

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
tape and you can't stay on here but it

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.960 
tape and you can't stay on here but it
did<00:03:20.660> leave<00:03:20.900> some<00:03:21.230> marks<00:03:21.440> because<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.430> tape

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
did leave some marks because the tape

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.490 
did leave some marks because the tape
was<00:03:23.120> quite<00:03:23.390> hard<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.660> get<00:03:23.840> off<00:03:24.019> so<00:03:24.049> make<00:03:24.470> sure

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
was quite hard to get off so make sure

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.770 
was quite hard to get off so make sure
you're<00:03:25.310> still<00:03:25.549> using<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:26.090> right<00:03:26.390> kind<00:03:26.690> of

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
you're still using the right kind of

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.500 
you're still using the right kind of
tape<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:28.239> yeah

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
tape and yeah

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.560 
tape and yeah
make<00:03:30.049> sure<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.910> take<00:03:31.910> your<00:03:31.940> time<00:03:32.030> on<00:03:32.360> it<00:03:32.480> as

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
make sure you take your time on it as

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.150 
make sure you take your time on it as
well<00:03:32.720> obviously<00:03:32.870> this<00:03:33.440> will<00:03:33.680> take<00:03:33.890> quite<00:03:34.040> a

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
well obviously this will take quite a

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.680 
well obviously this will take quite a
bit<00:03:34.220> of<00:03:34.310> time<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.640> tape<00:03:34.820> up<00:03:35.060> bits<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.510> don't

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
bit of time to tape up bits you don't

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:43.570 
bit of time to tape up bits you don't
want<00:03:35.870> painted

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.780 

that<00:03:43.730> I<00:03:43.940> find<00:03:44.510> really<00:03:44.810> good<00:03:45.080> for<00:03:45.770> making<00:03:46.340> sure

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
that I find really good for making sure

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.250 
that your knife gun or what have you
tried<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.820> make<00:03:49.970> it<00:03:50.120> look<00:03:50.270> like<00:03:50.420> looks<00:03:50.780> really

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
tried to make it look like looks really

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.150 
tried to make it look like looks really
realistic<00:03:51.620> it's<00:03:52.460> by<00:03:52.610> adding<00:03:52.940> muscle<00:03:53.180> damage

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
realistic it's by adding muscle damage

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.010 
realistic it's by adding muscle damage
alone<00:03:55.160> I'm<00:03:55.580> not<00:03:56.210> sure<00:03:56.420> if<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.660> see<00:03:56.840> on<00:03:56.930> the

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
part of doing a nerf gun and again I'm

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.930 
part of doing a nerf gun and again I'm
going<00:06:17.370> to<00:06:17.460> use<00:06:18.290> sniper<00:06:19.290> as<00:06:19.500> an<00:06:19.620> example<00:06:20.160> when<00:06:20.910> I

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
going to use sniper as an example when I

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.870 
going to use sniper as an example when I
actually<00:06:21.300> dismantled<00:06:21.690> this<00:06:22.160> I<00:06:23.160> did<00:06:23.640> take

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
actually dismantled this I did take

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.880 
actually dismantled this I did take
photos<00:06:24.360> just<00:06:24.390> to<00:06:24.840> reference<00:06:25.320> to<00:06:25.560> when<00:06:25.740> I<00:06:25.830> was

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
photos just to reference to when I was

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.950 
photos just to reference to when I was
trying<00:06:26.100> to<00:06:26.160> put<00:06:26.280> this<00:06:26.370> thing<00:06:26.430> back<00:06:26.760> together

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
trying to put this thing back together

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.080 
trying to put this thing back together
but<00:06:27.960> if<00:06:28.140> you<00:06:28.320> do<00:06:28.590> decide<00:06:28.740> to<00:06:28.950> dismantle<00:06:29.490> enough

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
but if you do decide to dismantle enough

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.030 
but if you do decide to dismantle enough
going<00:06:30.390> you've<00:06:30.540> got<00:06:30.780> to<00:06:30.930> make<00:06:31.110> sure<00:06:31.140> but<00:06:31.980> you

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040 
going you've got to make sure but you

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.420 
going you've got to make sure but you
know<00:06:32.130> where<00:06:32.490> the<00:06:32.610> pieces<00:06:32.820> all<00:06:33.120> go<00:06:33.330> because<00:06:34.430> the

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
know where the pieces all go because the

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.360 
know where the pieces all go because the
intricate<00:06:36.300> find<00:06:37.200> a<00:06:37.320> design<00:06:37.620> of<00:06:37.800> how<00:06:37.920> to<00:06:37.980> put<00:06:38.280> it

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
intricate find a design of how to put it

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.440 
intricate find a design of how to put it
all<00:06:38.460> back<00:06:38.610> together<00:06:38.820> can<00:06:39.150> be<00:06:39.270> very

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.450 
all back together can be very

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.220 
all back together can be very
complicated

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230 
complicated

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.130 
complicated
nice<00:06:40.830> I<00:06:41.250> spent<00:06:41.850> about<00:06:41.970> an<00:06:42.240> hour<00:06:42.420> trying<00:06:42.750> to<00:06:42.930> get

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.140 
nice I spent about an hour trying to get

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.350 
nice I spent about an hour trying to get
one<00:06:43.860> of<00:06:43.890> the<00:06:44.040> springs<00:06:44.370> back<00:06:44.610> in<00:06:44.790> I<00:06:44.850> think<00:06:45.090> and

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
one of the springs back in I think and

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.320 
one of the springs back in I think and
it<00:06:46.290> was<00:06:46.320> a<00:06:46.440> real<00:06:46.680> pain<00:06:46.980> so<00:06:47.280> make<00:06:47.460> sure<00:06:47.610> although

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
it was a real pain so make sure although

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.510 
it was a real pain so make sure although
it<00:06:48.720> does<00:06:49.080> kind<00:06:49.590> of<00:06:49.650> sound<00:06:49.860> simple<00:06:50.340> though

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
it does kind of sound simple though

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.270 
it does kind of sound simple though
people<00:06:51.000> do<00:06:51.240> forget<00:06:51.420> to<00:06:51.690> do<00:06:51.810> this<00:06:52.050> make<00:06:52.950> sure

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 
people do forget to do this make sure

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.350 
people do forget to do this make sure
that<00:06:54.180> you<00:06:54.960> know<00:06:55.770> where<00:06:56.220> everything<00:06:56.700> goes<00:06:56.850> in

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
that you know where everything goes in

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.790 
that you know where everything goes in

people<00:07:06.210> do<00:07:06.330> show<00:07:06.570> you<00:07:06.630> how<00:07:06.750> to<00:07:06.810> get<00:07:07.650> that

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:07.890 
people do show you how to get that

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.680 
people do show you how to get that
mechanisms<00:07:08.790> all<00:07:08.940> that<00:07:09.090> together<00:07:09.240> but<00:07:09.660> I

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690 
mechanisms all that together but I

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.380 
mechanisms all that together but I
wouldn't<00:07:10.050> I<00:07:10.260> wouldn't<00:07:10.830> rely<00:07:10.980> on<00:07:11.150> just<00:07:12.150> make

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:12.390 
wouldn't I wouldn't rely on just make

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.970 
wouldn't I wouldn't rely on just make
like<00:07:12.930> thinking<00:07:13.350> that<00:07:13.410> they're<00:07:13.650> going<00:07:13.800> to<00:07:13.860> be

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:13.980 
like thinking that they're going to be

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.790 
like thinking that they're going to be
on<00:07:14.160> there<00:07:14.400> when<00:07:15.180> you<00:07:15.660> dismantle<00:07:16.080> the<00:07:16.380> nerf<00:07:16.560> gun

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
on there when you dismantle the nerf gun

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.670 
on there when you dismantle the nerf gun
so<00:07:17.070> make<00:07:17.250> sure<00:07:17.280> you<00:07:17.670> always<00:07:17.820> go<00:07:18.060> away<00:07:18.680> getting

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 
so make sure you always go away getting

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.840 
so make sure you always go away getting
it<00:07:19.770> back<00:07:19.800> together<00:07:20.480> so<00:07:21.480> yeah<00:07:22.160> in<00:07:23.160> the<00:07:23.280> future<00:07:23.700> I

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:23.850
