importantly<00:01:54.509> than<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.170> getting<00:01:55.409> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
importantly than that is getting the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.249 
importantly than that is getting the
size<00:01:55.920> right<00:01:56.340> matching<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.569> hatch<00:01:57.779> I<00:01:58.079> guess

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
size right matching the hatch I guess

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.039 
size right matching the hatch I guess
you<00:01:58.409> could<00:01:58.590> say<00:01:59.240> when<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.359> shatter<00:02:00.599> a<00:02:00.779> lot

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
you could say when the shatter a lot

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:01.719 
you could say when the shatter a lot
smaller

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
smaller

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.370 
smaller
you<00:02:02.729> know<00:02:02.849> I<00:02:02.880> throw<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.539> mainly<00:02:03.779> the<00:02:04.079> shad

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you know I throw it mainly the shad

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.580 
you know I throw it mainly the shad
colors<00:02:05.029> you<00:02:06.029> know<00:02:06.149> probably<00:02:06.450> 70%<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.319> the<00:02:07.409> time

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
colors you know probably 70% of the time

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.190 
colors you know probably 70% of the time
and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.119> the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
and then the

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.440 
and then the
these<00:02:09.770> darker<00:02:10.250> colors<00:02:10.610> can<00:02:10.759> really<00:02:11.030> work<00:02:11.180> good

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
these darker colors can really work good

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.790 
these darker colors can really work good
sometimes<00:02:11.720> too<00:02:12.140> especially<00:02:12.379> when<00:02:12.680> the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
sometimes too especially when the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.430 
sometimes too especially when the
bluegill<00:02:13.220> are<00:02:13.519> up<00:02:14.269> shallow<00:02:14.569> any<00:02:15.019> you<00:02:15.319> know

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
bluegill are up shallow any you know

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.530 
bluegill are up shallow any you know
anytime<00:02:15.709> during<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.190> spawn<00:02:16.430> but<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.300> shad

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
anytime during the spawn but the shad

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.990 
anytime during the spawn but the shad
colors<00:02:17.959> I<00:02:18.110> really<00:02:18.140> love<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.890> throw<00:02:19.160> and

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
colors I really love to throw and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.479 
colors I really love to throw and
matching<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.810> hatch<00:02:20.989> is<00:02:21.200> important<00:02:21.739> and<00:02:21.890> most

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
matching the hatch is important and most

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.030 
matching the hatch is important and most
of<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.790> time<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.660> know<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.870> can't<00:02:24.620> go<00:02:24.800> wrong

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
of the time you know you can't go wrong

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.770 
of the time you know you can't go wrong
with<00:02:25.340> this<00:02:25.489> this<00:02:25.819> is<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.030> three<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.540> half

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
with this this is a three and a half

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.949 
with this this is a three and a half
inch<00:02:27.050> version<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:28.010> lft<00:02:28.910> live<00:02:29.209> magic<00:02:29.720> shad

inch version of the lft live magic shad

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.259 
inch version of the lft live magic shad
in<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:30.890> goes<00:02:31.010> perfectly<00:02:31.250> on<00:02:31.700> this<00:02:31.880> this

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
in it and it goes perfectly on this this

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.170 
in it and it goes perfectly on this this
phoenix<00:02:32.780> vibrating<00:02:33.739> jig<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.310> all<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.760> do<00:02:34.940> is

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
phoenix vibrating jig and all you do is

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.000 
phoenix vibrating jig and all you do is
you<00:02:35.299> just<00:02:35.330> go<00:02:35.660> straight<00:02:36.049> in<00:02:36.260> through<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.830> nose

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
you just go straight in through the nose

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.030 
you just go straight in through the nose
here<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:38.799> you<00:02:39.799> come<00:02:40.040> out<00:02:40.250> right<00:02:40.670> before<00:02:42.040> that

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
here and you come out right before that

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.539 
here and you come out right before that
first<00:02:43.340> swim<00:02:43.910> slot<00:02:44.239> it<00:02:44.480> really<00:02:45.099> fits<00:02:46.099> perfectly

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
first swim slot it really fits perfectly

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.789 
first swim slot it really fits perfectly
on<00:02:46.760> there<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.569> know<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:48.110> want<00:02:48.319> you<00:02:48.530> want<00:02:48.680> that

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
on there you know you want you want that

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.470 
on there you know you want you want that
hook<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.040> be<00:02:49.250> as<00:02:49.370> back<00:02:49.579> as<00:02:49.760> far<00:02:49.940> as<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.239> possibly

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
hook to be as back as far as it possibly

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.289 
hook to be as back as far as it possibly
can<00:02:51.010> but<00:02:52.010> basically<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.579> know<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:52.910> this

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
can but basically you know this this

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.900 
can but basically you know this this
bait<00:02:53.630> is<00:02:53.660> vibrating<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:55.160> skirts<00:02:55.489> moving

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
bait is vibrating and the skirts moving

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.030 
bait is vibrating and the skirts moving
and<00:02:56.060> then<00:02:56.180> you've<00:02:56.269> got<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:57.650> tail<00:02:57.829> back

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
and then you've got the the tail back

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.690 
and then you've got the the tail back
here<00:02:58.280> swimming<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.540> really<00:02:59.720> does<00:02:59.959> a<00:02:59.989> lot

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
here swimming and it really does a lot

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.910 
here swimming and it really does a lot
one<00:03:01.700> thing<00:03:01.880> you<00:03:02.000> want<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.239> do<00:03:02.420> is<00:03:02.920> actually

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
one thing you want to do is actually

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.490 
one thing you want to do is actually
trim<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.579> skirt<00:03:04.880> up<00:03:05.090> especially<00:03:06.019> if<00:03:06.349> you're

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
trim the skirt up especially if you're

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.740 
trim the skirt up especially if you're
throwing<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.920> shorter<00:03:07.400> version<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:08.060> the

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
throwing the shorter version and the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.080 
throwing the shorter version and the
reason<00:03:09.019> behind<00:03:09.110> that<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.980> skirt<00:03:10.849> will

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
reason behind that is the skirt will

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.059 
reason behind that is the skirt will
actually<00:03:11.510> hang<00:03:11.750> down<00:03:12.019> a<00:03:12.049> little<00:03:12.530> bit<00:03:12.680> farther

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
actually hang down a little bit farther

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.309 
actually hang down a little bit farther
than<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:14.120> swim<00:03:14.389> slots<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.109> can

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
than the swim slots and that can

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.599 
than the swim slots and that can
actually<00:03:15.819> impede<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.930> action<00:03:18.380> of<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:19.370> swim

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
actually impede the action of the swim

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:25.180 
actually impede the action of the swim
bait<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:20.980> all<00:03:21.980> I<00:03:22.010> do<00:03:22.220> is<00:03:22.400> just<00:03:23.680> lay<00:03:24.680> your<00:03:24.709> skirt

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
bait so all I do is just lay your skirt

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.900 
bait so all I do is just lay your skirt
down<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:26.120> then<00:03:27.160> you<00:03:28.160> know<00:03:28.190> just<00:03:28.310> cut<00:03:28.790> it

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
down and then you know just cut it

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.759 
down and then you know just cut it
basically<00:03:29.299> right<00:03:29.630> behind<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.230> hook

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.690
