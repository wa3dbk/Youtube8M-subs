00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.910 
roller out and that's gonna help keep
the<00:01:08.450> tightness<00:01:09.970> of<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.710> curl<00:01:14.080> okay<00:01:15.080> I<00:01:15.350> made

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
the tightness of the curl okay I made

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.580 
the tightness of the curl okay I made
sure<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:17.380> roll<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.560> curler<00:01:19.360> all<00:01:20.360> my<00:01:20.869> locks<00:01:21.170> in

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
sure to roll the curler all my locks in

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.699 
sure to roll the curler all my locks in
different<00:01:22.399> directions<00:01:22.759> so<00:01:23.360> that<00:01:23.390> all<00:01:24.200> my

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709 
different directions so that all my

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:26.710 
different directions so that all my
curls<00:01:25.009> aren't<00:01:25.250> facing<00:01:25.640> one<00:01:25.759> way<00:01:25.910> I<00:01:25.940> like<00:01:26.360> the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
curls aren't facing one way I like the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.290 
curls aren't facing one way I like the
way<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:26.929> looks<00:01:27.140> when<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.740> curls<00:01:28.039> are<00:01:28.399> going<00:01:29.209> in

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
way it looks when the curls are going in

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.760 
way it looks when the curls are going in
different<00:01:29.330> directions<00:01:29.599> I<00:01:30.319> just<00:01:30.530> think<00:01:30.679> that

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
different directions I just think that

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.359 
different directions I just think that
that's<00:01:30.979> a<00:01:31.340> more<00:01:31.849> attractive<00:01:32.179> curl<00:01:33.099> but<00:01:34.099> you

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
that's a more attractive curl but you

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.219 
that's a more attractive curl but you
know<00:01:34.490> teaches<00:01:35.209> all<00:01:35.330> that's<00:01:35.509> not<00:01:35.630> necessary

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
know teaches all that's not necessary

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.320 
know teaches all that's not necessary
I<00:01:38.560> need<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:39.679> hurry<00:01:39.860> up<00:01:39.950> because<00:01:40.130> I<00:01:40.580> am<00:01:40.819> on<00:01:41.270> my

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.559 
I need to hurry up because I am on my
way<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:42.050> work<00:01:42.729> when<00:01:43.729> I<00:01:43.970> am<00:01:44.000> with<00:01:44.330> you<00:01:44.539> there's

00:01:44.569 --> 00:02:16.500 
way to work when I am with you there's
no<00:01:44.899> place<00:01:45.020> I'd<00:01:45.349> rather<00:01:45.380> be

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.330 

it<00:02:17.510> took<00:02:17.690> me<00:02:17.810> about<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.350> half<00:02:18.590> an<00:02:18.740> hour<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.160> take

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
it took me about a half an hour to take

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.140 
it took me about a half an hour to take
out<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:20.330> completely<00:02:21.140> dried<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.280> hopefully<00:02:23.000> it

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
out it completely dried so hopefully it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.810 
out it completely dried so hopefully it
stays<00:02:23.330> pretty<00:02:23.690> tight<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.110> little<00:02:24.140> while

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
stays pretty tight for a little while

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.460 
stays pretty tight for a little while
I<00:02:28.690> wonder<00:02:29.690> how<00:02:29.780> I'm<00:02:29.840> gonna<00:02:29.960> work<00:02:30.140> out<00:02:30.260> these

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
basically I left the curlers and for a

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.820 
basically I left the curlers and for a
day<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.209> half<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:48.160> did<00:02:49.160> one<00:02:49.459> lakh<00:02:49.730> per<00:02:50.120> roller

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
day and a half I did one lakh per roller

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.640 
day and a half I did one lakh per roller
okay<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.190> that's<00:02:52.880> why<00:02:53.780> my<00:02:54.140> locks<00:02:54.380> are<00:02:54.530> so

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
okay and that's why my locks are so

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.190 
okay and that's why my locks are so
tight<00:02:54.920> also<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.490> way<00:02:55.580> that<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.760> unravel<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.480> has

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
tight also the way that I unravel it has

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.740 
tight also the way that I unravel it has
a<00:02:57.230> lot<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.440> do<00:02:57.620> with<00:02:57.740> why<00:02:57.890> they're<00:02:58.070> so<00:02:58.220> tight

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750
