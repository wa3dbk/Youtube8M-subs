think we played well tonight the whole

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.990 
think we played well tonight the whole
team<00:00:22.010> yeah<00:00:24.619> it<00:00:25.619> was<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> very<00:00:26.010> open<00:00:26.279> game<00:00:26.789> today

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
team yeah it was a very open game today

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.640 
team yeah it was a very open game today
and<00:00:27.150> there<00:00:27.449> was<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> number<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.930> chances<00:00:28.260> at

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
and there was a number of chances at

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.710 
and there was a number of chances at
both<00:00:28.830> ends<00:00:29.250> perhaps<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.029> another<00:00:30.119> day<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
both ends perhaps on another day the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.540 
both ends perhaps on another day the
score<00:00:31.050> could<00:00:31.289> be<00:00:31.470> completely<00:00:31.859> different<00:00:32.309> and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
score could be completely different and

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.780 
score could be completely different and
we<00:00:32.790> may<00:00:32.969> have<00:00:33.090> got<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> result<00:00:33.630> yeah<00:00:34.380> sure<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
we may have got a result yeah sure the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.660 
we may have got a result yeah sure the
first<00:00:36.059> hard<00:00:36.329> way<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.780> think<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.890> two<00:00:38.489> or

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
first hard way I think we have two or

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.750 
first hard way I think we have two or
three<00:00:38.700> good<00:00:39.660> chances<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.590> score<00:00:40.829> but

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
three good chances to score but

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.330 
three good chances to score but
Tottenham<00:00:42.719> as<00:00:42.870> well<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.469> think<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> good

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
Tottenham as well so I think was a good

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.380 
Tottenham as well so I think was a good
game<00:00:44.550> from<00:00:45.149> both<00:00:45.360> team<00:00:45.660> but<00:00:45.960> yeah<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:47.010> hope<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
game from both team but yeah I hope the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.450 
game from both team but yeah I hope the
next<00:00:48.660> game<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.260> take<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.739> points<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
next game we can take the points and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.020 
next game we can take the points and
yeah<00:00:51.860> did<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.980> feel<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.579> was<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> much

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
yeah did it feel like it was a much

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.660 
yeah did it feel like it was a much
improved<00:00:54.300> performance<00:00:55.260> today<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:56.340> seem<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
improved performance today we seem to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.279 
improved performance today we seem to
play<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> lot<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.390> energy<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.109> lot

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
play with a lot more energy and a lot

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.139 
play with a lot more energy and a lot
higher<00:00:58.710> tempo<00:00:59.250> especially<00:00:59.820> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.969> first

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
higher tempo especially in the first

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.570 
higher tempo especially in the first
half<00:01:00.410> yeah<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.440> think<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> team<00:01:02.579> was<00:01:02.789> ready<00:01:03.030> and

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
half yeah I think the team was ready and

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.800 
half yeah I think the team was ready and
everyone<00:01:05.580> was<00:01:07.640> was<00:01:08.640> ready<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.330> game<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
everyone was was ready for this game and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.800 
everyone was was ready for this game and
I<00:01:10.170> think<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.860> showed<00:01:11.070> us<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> fans<00:01:12.180> was

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
I think we showed us for the fans was

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.039 
I think we showed us for the fans was
very<00:01:13.110> important<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.860> show<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
very important to show this to to

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.359 
very important to show this to to
defence<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.710> yeah<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.900> result<00:01:19.320> was<00:01:19.500> not<00:01:19.530> so

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
defence and yeah the result was not so

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.390 
defence and yeah the result was not so
good<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.880> hopefully<00:01:21.840> Sunday<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.799> better<00:01:23.070> for

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
good so hopefully Sunday is better for
