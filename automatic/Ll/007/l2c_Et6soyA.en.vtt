00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
I will show you some pictures that I've

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.730 
I will show you some pictures that I've
taken<00:00:17.130> from<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.029> soap<00:00:18.270> after<00:00:18.539> they<00:00:19.410> were<00:00:19.470> done

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
taken from the soap after they were done

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.259 
taken from the soap after they were done
and<00:00:21.170> I<00:00:22.170> think<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.710> three<00:00:22.949> week<00:00:23.160> period<00:00:23.519> for<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
and I think a three week period for the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.019 
and I think a three week period for the
cold<00:00:24.630> process<00:00:25.140> soap<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.580> two<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> half

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
cold process soap and a two and a half

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.080 
cold process soap and a two and a half
week<00:00:27.300> period<00:00:28.109> for<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> mountain<00:00:28.949> poor<00:00:29.160> soaps

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
week period for the mountain poor soaps

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.870 
week period for the mountain poor soaps
so<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.960> fragrance<00:00:31.199> tested<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:31.980> both<00:00:32.219> batches

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
so the fragrance tested in both batches

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.680 
so the fragrance tested in both batches
of<00:00:33.030> soap<00:00:33.300> are<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:34.050> same<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.210> you<00:00:36.210> will<00:00:36.570> see

of soap are the same and you will see

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.910 
of soap are the same and you will see
that<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.989> outcome<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.410> pretty<00:00:37.680> different

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that the outcome is pretty different

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.160
