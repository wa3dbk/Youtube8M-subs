it does not have a microSD card which is
unfortunate<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.890> 64<00:01:32.610> gigabyte<00:01:33.060> version

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
unfortunate but the 64 gigabyte version

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.880 
unfortunate but the 64 gigabyte version
costs<00:01:33.869> as<00:01:33.960> much<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:35.369> nexus<00:01:35.820> 5<00:01:36.409> 16<00:01:37.409> gigabyte

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.990 
seems to be working out really nice
because<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.890> phone<00:02:29.190> actually<00:02:29.550> takes

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
because the the phone actually takes

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.910 
because the the phone actually takes
really<00:02:30.300> amazing<00:02:30.810> pictures<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.349> this<00:02:31.530> was<00:02:31.739> the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
really amazing pictures and this was the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.360 
really amazing pictures and this was the
main<00:02:32.099> downfall<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.690> nexus<00:02:34.080> 5<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.920> battery

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
main downfall of the nexus 5 the battery

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.150 
main downfall of the nexus 5 the battery
and<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.700> fact<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.569> takes<00:02:36.870> pretty<00:02:37.739> bad

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
and the fact that it takes pretty bad

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.920 
and the fact that it takes pretty bad
pictures<00:02:39.530> obviously<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.890> camera<00:02:41.489> and

now this is the pre production unit this

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.600 
now this is the pre production unit this
is<00:04:49.120> not<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.509> final<00:04:49.719> release<00:04:50.229> so<00:04:50.860> cyanogenmod

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
is not the final release so cyanogenmod

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.550 
is not the final release so cyanogenmod
will<00:04:51.849> have<00:04:52.060> different<00:04:52.240> icons<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.229> different

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
will have different icons and different

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.860 
will have different icons and different
features<00:04:54.039> and<00:04:54.310> they've<00:04:54.789> even<00:04:55.120> adds<00:04:55.300> that<00:04:55.659> this

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
features and they've even adds that this

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.529 
features and they've even adds that this
phone<00:04:56.050> is<00:04:56.229> water-resistant<00:04:57.189> like<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.639> Moto<00:04:58.210> G

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
phone is water-resistant like the Moto G

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.330 
phone is water-resistant like the Moto G
so<00:04:58.900> they<00:04:59.469> have<00:04:59.620> a<00:04:59.650> bunch<00:04:59.889> of<00:05:00.009> different

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
so they have a bunch of different

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.100 
so they have a bunch of different
features<00:05:00.729> and<00:05:00.990> everything<00:05:01.990> is<00:05:02.139> all<00:05:02.289> cool<00:05:02.680> but

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
features and everything is all cool but

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.159 
features and everything is all cool but
one<00:05:05.110> but<00:05:05.409> there's<00:05:05.770> only<00:05:06.099> one<00:05:06.669> thing<00:05:07.060> that<00:05:07.389> they

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
one but there's only one thing that they

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.379 
one but there's only one thing that they
that<00:05:08.770> they<00:05:08.830> haven't<00:05:09.219> delivered<00:05:09.639> on<00:05:09.939> besides

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
that they haven't delivered on besides

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.330 
that they haven't delivered on besides
the<00:05:10.569> micro<00:05:10.870> SD<00:05:11.199> card<00:05:11.500> and<00:05:11.710> that's<00:05:12.099> really

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
the micro SD card and that's really

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.920 
the micro SD card and that's really
debatable<00:05:12.969> because<00:05:13.090> honestly<00:05:13.689> I<00:05:13.779> don't

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
debatable because honestly I don't

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.369 
debatable because honestly I don't
really<00:05:14.199> need<00:05:14.529> it<00:05:14.740> and<00:05:14.919> it's<00:05:15.669> 64<00:05:16.300> gigabytes<00:05:16.750> so

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:17.379 
really need it and it's 64 gigabytes so

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:19.649 
really need it and it's 64 gigabytes so
long<00:05:17.560> as<00:05:17.740> cyanogenmod<00:05:18.460> isn't<00:05:18.819> like<00:05:18.939> 20

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
long as cyanogenmod isn't like 20

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:21.719 
long as cyanogenmod isn't like 20
gigabytes<00:05:19.930> or<00:05:20.379> something<00:05:20.740> like<00:05:20.860> that<00:05:20.979> then

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
gigabytes or something like that then

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.089 
gigabytes or something like that then
it's<00:05:22.090> alright<00:05:22.629> but<00:05:23.139> they<00:05:23.319> have<00:05:23.560> not<00:05:23.740> delivered

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
it's alright but they have not delivered

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.959 
it's alright but they have not delivered
on<00:05:24.370> their<00:05:24.490> promise<00:05:24.550> that<00:05:25.389> the<00:05:26.080> xperia<00:05:26.710> z1<00:05:27.279> they

on their promise that the xperia z1 they

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.519 
on their promise that the xperia z1 they
hinted<00:05:28.810> they<00:05:29.020> implied<00:05:29.680> that<00:05:30.509> the<00:05:31.509> xperia<00:05:32.020> z1

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:32.529 
hinted they implied that the xperia z1

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:35.040 
hinted they implied that the xperia z1
would<00:05:33.159> it<00:05:33.460> would<00:05:33.639> it<00:05:33.849> would<00:05:34.089> be<00:05:34.479> as<00:05:34.629> big<00:05:34.900> as

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
would it would it would be as big as

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.529 
would it would it would be as big as
experience<00:05:35.650> z1<00:05:36.009> with<00:05:36.219> a<00:05:36.250> 5.5<00:05:36.969> inch<00:05:37.150> display

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
experience z1 with a 5.5 inch display

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.170 
experience z1 with a 5.5 inch display
but<00:05:37.870> unfortunately<00:05:38.800> that<00:05:39.370> did<00:05:39.550> not<00:05:39.759> end<00:05:39.819> up

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
but unfortunately that did not end up

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.969 
but unfortunately that did not end up
turning<00:05:40.330> to<00:05:40.569> be<00:05:40.690> true<00:05:40.960> and<00:05:41.139> it<00:05:41.319> is<00:05:41.589> slightly

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
turning to be true and it is slightly

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.909 
turning to be true and it is slightly
taller<00:05:42.400> than<00:05:43.300> the<00:05:43.479> experience<00:05:43.960> you<00:05:44.110> one<00:05:44.440> but

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
taller than the experience you one but

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.809 
taller than the experience you one but
the<00:05:45.819> width<00:05:46.089> is<00:05:46.330> actually<00:05:47.219> slightly<00:05:48.219> lower

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:48.819 
the width is actually slightly lower

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.200 
the width is actually slightly lower
than<00:05:48.969> the<00:05:49.330> xperia<00:05:49.779> z1<00:05:50.169> so<00:05:51.159> it<00:05:51.310> is<00:05:51.400> a<00:05:51.460> tall<00:05:51.819> phone

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
than the xperia z1 so it is a tall phone

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.769 
than the xperia z1 so it is a tall phone
in<00:05:53.190> comparison<00:05:54.190> but<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.759> width<00:05:54.969> is<00:05:55.180> lower<00:05:55.479> and

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:55.779 
in comparison but the width is lower and

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:57.659 
in comparison but the width is lower and
they<00:05:56.500> have<00:05:56.680> gotten<00:05:57.009> that<00:05:57.129> right<00:05:57.400> which<00:05:57.639> is

they have gotten that right which is
good<00:05:58.000> which<00:05:58.629> is<00:05:58.779> good<00:05:59.020> and<00:05:59.279> that's<00:06:00.279> really<00:06:00.699> my
