00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.030
 very good to all guys I hope that 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.030
 be very 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:10.380
 I am stupid 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.380
 I want to share one thing 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.130
 I give it 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.239
 for me it made me 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.150
 quickly with what is the 1st 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.089
 the brightness forgiveness d 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.379
 and the brightness of the automatic screen 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.530
 activated disables 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.200
 ok that consumes a lot of battery because it is 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.770
 a sensor that we have on all the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.450
 time you are looking for the type of light 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.510
 to balance the brightness of the screen 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.770
 so 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.770
 deactivate let's save 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.030
 I really know why 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.990
 I would not bring that advice 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.990
 serve us 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.579
 we just have to raise the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.679
 control center and how can you see 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.000
 we have the first bar to modify 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:39.070
 the brightness of our 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.570
 it costs nothing to simply upload them and 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.650
 you want more brightness rise they want 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.650
 less brightness go down 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.450
 automatic brightness is no longer going to 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.090
 help a lot to life is battery 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.649
 Another advice that I want to give you is 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.479
 within what is configuration is 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.990
 actually most are within 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.990
 configurations 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.640
 the first one let's start 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.960
 with cellular data 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.090
 the other cell phones 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.360
 being connected to a wifi network 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.490
 they really do not have any use but 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.490
 if they consume a lot of 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.540
 when I leave I leave my house 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.120
 I raise control center 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.010
 and I turn on the data 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.260
 then when I arrived at my house he had 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.060
 another version of wifi control and 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.069
 Deactivated mobile data as they can 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.650
 see I have them disabled 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.500
 and that really helps a lot 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.270
 This right now is right now 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.319
 is at home with your wifi connected and 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.480
 they have the cellular data 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.349
 deactivate it and they will score as the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.340
 battery is discharged less quickly and 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:53.840
 deactivating is optimal 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.840
 if you have it activated 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.680
 they will be able to notice here in this same 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:05.110
 this same section what is a list 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.110
 of the applications that occupy the internet 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.930
 to be able to configure what 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.770
 application they want it to work with 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.770
 3g or 4g data 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.110
 and I do not have 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.620
 they simply deactivate you 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.040
 in the game another application that you 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.040
 do not occupy 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.980
 we go now to what is the section of 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.660
 the background updates the 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.940
 background updates too 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.680
 they consume a lot of battery because if you 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.959
 they come to have heavy games or 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.360
 heavy applications will not know or 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.100
 when 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.390
 update then you continue 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.760
 using your device is going to 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.220
 download faster we will go to what 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.550
 which is general within the settings and 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.340
 let's find the option from ios 7 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.380
 update in the background if 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.640
 we enter we can activate or 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.290
 deactivate the full option and then 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.120
 they will automatically be deactivated 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.519
 all the options and if we activate it 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.859
 we can deactivate the only one that we 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.800
 interested the only ones in his case that 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.390
 interest in my case I the only one that I use 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.860
 it's climate 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.420
 then if it is not enough simply 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.010
 turn it off as you can see it does not give me anymore 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.010
 the options if I activate it 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.280
 scared active then that too 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.150
 He spends a lot of battery and really I know what 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.610
 I recommend 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.400
 you also want to be aware 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.350
 of what application we 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.020
 we generate more use inside the battery 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.000
 we can enter to use and 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.070
 we have in the option this year is 8 of 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.380
 use of the battery thus manage the 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.370
 applications that are using us 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.100
 more battery 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.420
 then I whatsapp I occupy it quite 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.130
 then as you can see is the 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.889
 application that is generating me the most 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.370
 battery spending what is whatsapp 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.439
 I really can not tell you that there is not 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.960
 moment I do not use whatsapp then 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:16.669
 it really is a lot like you can see the 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.029
 consumption generated by that application in 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.029
 account 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.240
 in the applications 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.710
 especially the camera if you use the 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.710
 camera though 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.699
 pleased to be served these tips 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.560
 Any big doubt do not know in the 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:38.030
 comments if they have another with another 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.220
 advice they want to share it for 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.110
 please also the comments a little hand 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.060
 up if they liked it or a little hand down 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.600
 I'm Hector 25 and we'll see each other in a 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.600
 next video
