messed<00:00:38.190> up<00:00:38.340> quite<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> lot<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.149> did<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
messed up quite a lot but I did the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959 
messed up quite a lot but I did the
tutorial<00:00:40.230> as<00:00:40.440> best<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.890> could<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.700> follow

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
tutorial as best as I could so follow

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.729 
tutorial as best as I could so follow
along<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.079> little<00:00:43.260> different<00:00:43.469> from

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
along and it's a little different from

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.200 
along and it's a little different from
the<00:00:43.920> instructions<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.550> you'll<00:00:44.700> see<00:00:44.940> online

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
instead of connecting it to the computer

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.610 
instead of connecting it to the computer
I<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.730> ended<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.059> rebooting<00:00:48.780> or<00:00:49.200> resetting

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
to have to be connected to a Wi-Fi

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.740 
to have to be connected to a Wi-Fi
network<00:02:10.009> for<00:02:10.640> this<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.940> work<00:02:10.970> since<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.630> is

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
network for this to work since it is

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.700 
network for this to work since it is
downloading<00:02:12.260> packages<00:02:12.860> from<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.220> cydia

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
downloading packages from the cydia

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.590 
downloading packages from the cydia
servers<00:02:15.710> and<00:02:15.920> stuff<00:02:16.070> so<00:02:16.760> if<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.210> don't<00:02:17.390> have

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.780 
servers and stuff so if you don't have
Wi-Fi<00:02:17.900> connection<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.650> would<00:02:18.770> want<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.130> go<00:02:19.670> to

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
Wi-Fi connection you would want to go to

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.700 
Wi-Fi connection you would want to go to
a<00:02:19.910> place<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:20.420> has<00:02:20.600> Wi-Fi<00:02:21.050> for<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.410> start

a place that has Wi-Fi for you start

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.100 
a place that has Wi-Fi for you start
after<00:02:22.550> it's<00:02:22.730> done<00:02:22.970> reload<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> springboard

reboots you'll have a signal from your
carrier<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:51.480> you<00:04:51.540> want<00:04:51.720> to<00:04:51.750> be<00:04:51.810> unlocked<00:04:52.230> too

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
carrier that you want to be unlocked too

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.610 
carrier that you want to be unlocked too
and<00:04:54.140> it<00:04:55.140> should<00:04:55.410> all<00:04:55.560> work<00:04:55.590> out<00:04:57.440> now<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.500> other

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
and it should all work out now the other

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.100 
and it should all work out now the other
way<00:04:58.860> that<00:04:59.040> everyone's<00:04:59.460> have<00:05:00.390> on<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:00.840> blogs

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
way that everyone's have on the blogs

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.480 
way that everyone's have on the blogs
and<00:05:01.410> everything<00:05:01.500> they<00:05:01.860> have<00:05:02.040> it<00:05:02.250> so<00:05:02.430> you

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
and everything they have it so you

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.670 
and everything they have it so you
connect<00:05:02.910> it<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.300> your<00:05:03.330> phone<00:05:04.230> and<00:05:04.410> do<00:05:04.530> the

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
connect it to your phone and do the

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.520 
connect it to your phone and do the
activation<00:05:05.310> through<00:05:05.640> there<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:07.440> computer

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
activation through there to the computer

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.820 
activation through there to the computer
and<00:05:08.010> I<00:05:08.760> guess<00:05:08.940> it<00:05:09.300> works<00:05:09.570> for<00:05:09.810> some<00:05:10.110> people<00:05:10.560> it

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
and I guess it works for some people it

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.350 
and I guess it works for some people it
was<00:05:10.950> just<00:05:11.130> not<00:05:11.250> working<00:05:11.550> for<00:05:11.640> me<00:05:11.790> so<00:05:11.880> I<00:05:12.120> try

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
was just not working for me so I try

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:25.710 
was just not working for me so I try
this<00:05:12.420> way<00:05:12.720> and<00:05:12.900> it<00:05:12.990> worked

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.210 

okay<00:05:26.720> so<00:05:26.780> when<00:05:27.140> your<00:05:27.320> phone<00:05:27.590> starts<00:05:28.010> back<00:05:28.190> up

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
okay so when your phone starts back up

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.400 
okay so when your phone starts back up
you'll<00:05:28.580> see<00:05:28.790> the<00:05:28.940> 3g<00:05:29.420> logo<00:05:29.690> just<00:05:29.900> came<00:05:30.050> on<00:05:30.230> it

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
you'll see the 3g logo just came on it

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.980 
you'll see the 3g logo just came on it
says<00:05:30.590> searching<00:05:30.830> and<00:05:31.250> it<00:05:31.400> found<00:05:31.610> Fido<00:05:32.120> so

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
says searching and it found Fido so

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.530 
says searching and it found Fido so
that's<00:05:33.530> a<00:05:33.830> good<00:05:34.220> sign<00:05:34.640> that<00:05:34.700> just<00:05:35.090> means<00:05:35.360> that

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
that's a good sign that just means that

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.050 
that's a good sign that just means that
your<00:05:35.810> phone<00:05:36.140> as<00:05:36.440> successfully<00:05:37.310> unlocked<00:05:37.760> and

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
that you know the phone actually works

00:05:44.690 --> 00:06:01.080 
that you know the phone actually works

and<00:06:01.360> there<00:06:01.780> you<00:06:01.870> go<00:06:01.900> so<00:06:02.650> hopefully<00:06:03.490> this<00:06:03.699> works

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
and there you go so hopefully this works

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.370 
and there you go so hopefully this works
for<00:06:04.330> you<00:06:04.389> guys<00:06:04.510> if<00:06:04.690> it<00:06:04.810> doesn't<00:06:05.110> just<00:06:05.139> fool

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
for you guys if it doesn't just fool

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.710 
for you guys if it doesn't just fool
around<00:06:05.410> with<00:06:05.770> it<00:06:05.919> try<00:06:06.250> it<00:06:06.280> out<00:06:06.490> and<00:06:06.850> if<00:06:07.480> it

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
around with it try it out and if it

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.030 
around with it try it out and if it
doesn't<00:06:07.960> work<00:06:08.050> you<00:06:08.080> can<00:06:08.260> ultimately<00:06:08.470> just

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
doesn't work you can ultimately just

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.890 
doesn't work you can ultimately just
restore<00:06:09.460> your<00:06:09.580> device<00:06:09.930> to<00:06:11.250> whatever<00:06:12.250> it<00:06:12.430> was
