let's let's get our little area here

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.620 
let's let's get our little area here
that<00:00:22.920> we're<00:00:23.130> gonna<00:00:23.190> work<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.210> first<00:00:24.450> thing

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
that we're gonna work in the first thing

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.940 
that we're gonna work in the first thing
I<00:00:24.750> want<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> show<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.530> this<00:00:25.710> first

I want to show you is this first

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.230 
I want to show you is this first
container<00:00:26.370> so<00:00:26.610> this<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.940> synthetic

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
container so this is a synthetic

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.260 
container so this is a synthetic
container<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.200> a<00:00:28.740> very<00:00:29.130> important<00:00:29.730> part<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
container and a very important part a

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.390 
container and a very important part a
very<00:00:30.450> important<00:00:30.870> step<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.950> you<00:00:32.040> want<00:00:32.279> to

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
very important step is that you want to

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.820 
very important step is that you want to
drill<00:00:32.760> a<00:00:32.970> hole<00:00:33.000> if<00:00:33.510> there's<00:00:33.720> not<00:00:33.930> already<00:00:34.290> one

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
drill a hole if there's not already one

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.620 
drill a hole if there's not already one
in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> container<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.940> particular

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
in the container so this particular

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.240 
in the container so this particular
container<00:00:36.870> does<00:00:37.170> not<00:00:37.380> have<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> hole<00:00:37.830> that's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
container does not have a hole that's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.670 
container does not have a hole that's
for<00:00:38.550> drainage<00:00:38.910> if<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.239> don't<00:00:39.570> do<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.050> when

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
for drainage if you don't do this when

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.190 
for drainage if you don't do this when
you<00:00:40.830> water<00:00:41.130> or<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.700> rains<00:00:41.970> this<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.690> fill<00:00:43.020> up

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
you water or it rains this can fill up

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.299 
you water or it rains this can fill up
with<00:00:43.350> water<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.950> kill<00:00:44.280> your<00:00:44.430> plants<00:00:46.309> notice

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
with water and kill your plants notice

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.070 
with water and kill your plants notice
how<00:00:47.430> deep<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.940> container<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.540> that's<00:00:48.720> a<00:00:48.870> lot

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
how deep this container is that's a lot

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.840 
how deep this container is that's a lot
of<00:00:49.260> soil<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.830> that<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.190> expensive<00:00:50.550> you

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
of soil and that can be expensive you

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.100 
of soil and that can be expensive you
know<00:00:50.970> you<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.300> three<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.660> four<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.989> these

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
know you have three or four of these

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.049 
know you have three or four of these
containers<00:00:52.500> you're<00:00:53.129> buying<00:00:53.370> bags<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.970> bags

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
containers you're buying bags and bags

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.369 
containers you're buying bags and bags
of<00:00:54.180> soil<00:00:54.360> let<00:00:54.720> me<00:00:54.780> show<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.019> a<00:00:55.050> little<00:00:55.260> bit<00:00:55.350> of

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
of soil let me show you a little bit of

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.130 
of soil let me show you a little bit of
a<00:00:55.500> trick<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.400> here's<00:00:57.120> our<00:00:57.269> largest<00:00:57.870> plant

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
a trick so here's our largest plant

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.660 
a trick so here's our largest plant
that's<00:00:58.350> going<00:00:58.409> in<00:00:58.769> here<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> canna

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
that's going in here this is the canna

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.509 
that's going in here this is the canna
this<00:01:00.180> probably<00:01:00.750> needs<00:01:01.050> anywhere<00:01:02.040> from<00:01:02.309> eight

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
this probably needs anywhere from eight

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.479 
this probably needs anywhere from eight
to<00:01:02.580> twelve<00:01:03.150> inches<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.839> depth<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.710> pot<00:01:04.980> itself

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
to twelve inches of depth the pot itself

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.520 
to twelve inches of depth the pot itself
much<00:01:06.060> deeper<00:01:06.480> than<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.690> so<00:01:07.350> we're<00:01:07.440> gonna

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
much deeper than that so we're gonna

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.500 
much deeper than that so we're gonna
make<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> false<00:01:08.100> bottom<00:01:08.400> here<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.060> what<00:01:09.360> that's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
make a false bottom here and what that's

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.970 
make a false bottom here and what that's
going<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.780> enable<00:01:09.900> us<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.470> use<00:01:10.620> less

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
going to enable us to do is use less

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.550 
going to enable us to do is use less
soil<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.750> need<00:01:12.870> to<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.380> need<00:01:13.440> to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.840 
soil so what I need to do is I need to
raise<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:14.010> bottom<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.370> this<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.610> what<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> do

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.149 
raise the bottom of this and what I do
is<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.300> I<00:01:15.450> use<00:01:15.870> some<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.110> those<00:01:16.290> old<00:01:16.590> plastic

over the top of all that stuff I put

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.840 
over the top of all that stuff I put
down<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:34.259> make<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.700> things

down and you make and one of the things
you<00:01:35.969> might<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.240> noticed<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
you might have noticed is that this is a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.600 
you might have noticed is that this is a
little<00:01:37.439> bit<00:01:37.590> high<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.799> weights<00:01:38.310> going<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
little bit high the weights going to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.789 
little bit high the weights going to
compress<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> little<00:01:39.539> more<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.350> always

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
compress this a little more so I always

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.520 
compress this a little more so I always
I<00:01:40.950> learned<00:01:41.610> from<00:01:42.060> mistakes<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.079> put<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
I learned from mistakes if you put it to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.170 
I learned from mistakes if you put it to
the<00:01:43.619> exact<00:01:44.039> level<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.549> want<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:44.969> going<00:01:45.119> to

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the exact level you want it's going to

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.510 
the exact level you want it's going to
be<00:01:45.270> even<00:01:45.420> lower<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.619> we'll<00:01:46.920> put<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.340> our

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
be even lower so we'll put in our

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.060 
be even lower so we'll put in our
landscape<00:01:48.450> fabric<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.289> and<00:01:49.530> what<00:01:49.979> you

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
landscape fabric like that and what you

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.069 
landscape fabric like that and what you
can<00:01:50.250> see<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.880> we've<00:01:51.119> created<00:01:51.359> a<00:01:51.780> nice

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
can see is that we've created a nice

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.170 
can see is that we've created a nice
base<00:01:52.560> there<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.219> don't<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.909> all

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
base there so I don't have to have all

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
base there so I don't have to have all
this<00:01:54.450> soil<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.079> there<00:01:55.229> once<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.890> start<00:01:56.130> putting

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
this soil in there once I start putting

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.440 
this soil in there once I start putting
the<00:01:56.460> soil<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.939> that's<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.299> get

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
the soil and that's going to get

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:08.649 
the soil and that's going to get
compressed<00:01:57.869> down

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:08.659 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:15.559 

let's<00:02:09.659> put<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:09.959> our<00:02:10.049> fertilizer<00:02:14.329> let's<00:02:15.329> place

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
let's put in our fertilizer let's place

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.140 
let's put in our fertilizer let's place
in<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.900> canna<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:17.340> can<00:02:17.489> see<00:02:17.609> this<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.909> a<00:02:17.939> nice

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
in the canna you can see this is a nice

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:35.200 
in the canna you can see this is a nice
burgundy<00:02:18.629> one

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.510 

we've<00:02:35.810> got<00:02:36.020> these<00:02:36.230> active<00:02:36.590> areas<00:02:37.010> here<00:02:37.250> or<00:02:37.400> H

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
we've got these active areas here or H

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.820 
we've got these active areas here or H
of<00:02:37.730> area<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.750> can<00:02:38.930> see<00:02:39.170> this<00:02:39.380> is<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.590> very

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
of area and you can see this is a very

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.890 
of area and you can see this is a very
nice<00:02:40.100> succulent<00:02:40.760> plant<00:02:41.000> again<00:02:41.300> not<00:02:41.510> hearty

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
nice succulent plant again not hearty

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.780 
nice succulent plant again not hearty
but<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.440> reason<00:02:42.770> I<00:02:42.860> like<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.460> look<00:02:43.670> at

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
but the reason I like this is look at

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.150 
but the reason I like this is look at
the<00:02:43.940> burgundy<00:02:44.330> with<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.930> leaf<00:02:45.140> when<00:02:46.040> you're

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
the burgundy with the leaf when you're

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.440 
the burgundy with the leaf when you're
putting<00:02:46.340> containers<00:02:46.790> together<00:02:46.970> there's<00:02:47.330> a

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
putting containers together there's a

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.790 
putting containers together there's a
few<00:02:47.660> things<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.140> people<00:02:48.260> like<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.650> think

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
few things that people like to think

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.210 
few things that people like to think
about<00:02:49.330> texture<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:50.660> this<00:02:50.990> texture<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.800> this

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
about texture so this texture and this

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.950 
about texture so this texture and this
texture<00:02:52.640> are<00:02:52.790> very<00:02:53.000> different<00:02:53.270> so<00:02:53.540> by<00:02:53.690> mixing

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
texture are very different so by mixing

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.630 
texture are very different so by mixing
textures<00:02:54.620> we<00:02:54.800> give<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.070> container<00:02:55.400> some

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
textures we give the container some

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.360 
textures we give the container some
interest<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.780> can<00:02:56.960> match<00:02:57.170> this<00:02:57.770> color<00:02:58.040> and

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
interest you can match this color and

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.490 
interest you can match this color and
this<00:02:58.460> color<00:02:58.520> are<00:02:58.910> fairly<00:02:59.210> close<00:02:59.540> together<00:02:59.780> you

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
this color are fairly close together you

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.640 
this color are fairly close together you
can<00:03:00.710> contrast<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:02.510> purple<00:03:02.990> certainly

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
can contrast the purple certainly

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.920 
can contrast the purple certainly
contrasts<00:03:04.190> with<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.430> burgundy<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.660> white

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
contrasts with the burgundy the white

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.160 
contrasts with the burgundy the white
contrast'<00:03:06.830> with<00:03:07.100> everything<00:03:07.820> so<00:03:08.390> we're<00:03:08.930> doing

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
contrast' with everything so we're doing

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.710 
contrast' with everything so we're doing
different<00:03:09.950> textures<00:03:10.460> different<00:03:10.670> colors<00:03:11.480> and

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
different textures different colors and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.900 
different textures different colors and
we're<00:03:11.870> also<00:03:12.080> playing<00:03:12.860> off<00:03:13.160> of<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.430> burgundy

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
we're also playing off of the burgundy

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.610 
we're also playing off of the burgundy
and<00:03:14.270> kind<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.570> matching<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.200> little<00:03:15.440> bit<00:03:15.560> of

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
and kind of matching a little bit of

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.440 
and kind of matching a little bit of
that<00:03:15.680> color<00:03:15.890> with<00:03:16.160> this<00:03:16.310> as<00:03:16.490> well<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:16.880> we've

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
that color with this as well so we've

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.030 
that color with this as well so we've
got<00:03:17.570> a<00:03:17.600> lot<00:03:17.840> going<00:03:18.200> on<00:03:18.320> in<00:03:18.530> this<00:03:18.650> container

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
got a lot going on in this container

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.250 
got a lot going on in this container
even<00:03:19.640> though<00:03:19.760> we're<00:03:19.910> using<00:03:19.940> similar<00:03:20.870> plants

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
even though we're using similar plants

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260 
even though we're using similar plants
also<00:03:21.470> think<00:03:22.220> about<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.580> color<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:23.000> your

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
also think about the color of your

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.310 
also think about the color of your
container<00:03:23.660> itself

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
container itself

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.460 
container itself
alright<00:03:24.740> so<00:03:24.890> we're<00:03:25.040> putting<00:03:25.280> in<00:03:25.550> our<00:03:26.470> fillers

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
watering is very important always

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.030 
watering is very important always
important<00:03:54.840> in<00:03:54.870> containers<00:03:55.349> containers<00:03:55.769> are

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
important in containers containers are

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.550 
important in containers containers are
going<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.310> dry<00:03:56.550> out<00:03:56.760> faster<00:03:56.790> than<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.349> ground
