your<00:00:12.420> brain<00:00:12.780> picks<00:00:13.200> up<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.280> what<00:00:14.570> you<00:00:15.570> get

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
your brain picks up this is what you get

your brain picks up this is what you get
you<00:00:15.780> get<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> schedule<00:00:17.039> we<00:00:17.279> train<00:00:17.789> our

you get on a schedule we train our
bodies<00:00:18.060> for<00:00:18.539> what<00:00:18.750> what<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.619> eat<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.460> more

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
bodies for what what we eat and the more

we<00:00:20.820> train<00:00:21.060> our<00:00:21.210> body<00:00:21.449> for<00:00:22.109> having<00:00:22.500> this

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
we train our body for having this

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.120 
we train our body for having this
inflammatory<00:00:24.380> substance<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.619> put<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:25.949> it

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
inflammatory substance that we put in it

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.490 
inflammatory substance that we put in it
the<00:00:26.670> more<00:00:26.880> inflammation<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.869> put<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.289> so

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
the more inflammation that we put out so

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.830 
the more inflammation that we put out so
it's<00:00:28.920> actually<00:00:29.310> really<00:00:29.640> difficult<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.599> break

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it's actually really difficult to break

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.810 
it's actually really difficult to break
that<00:00:31.080> cycle<00:00:31.349> once<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.920> get<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.430> it

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
that cycle once you get in it and it

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.400 
that cycle once you get in it and it
gets<00:00:33.000> into<00:00:33.210> your<00:00:33.300> endocrine<00:00:33.660> system<00:00:33.690> your

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
gets into your endocrine system your

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.370 
gets into your endocrine system your
brain<00:00:34.649> starts<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> create<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.940> memory<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:37.290> it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
brain starts to create a a memory for it

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.260 
brain starts to create a a memory for it
just<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.620> muscle<00:00:38.010> memory<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.030> mean<00:00:39.180> you

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
just like muscle memory so you mean you

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.060 
just like muscle memory so you mean you
crave<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.600> thing<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.320> you're<00:00:40.500> causing<00:00:40.980> your

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
crave the thing that you're causing your

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.369 
crave the thing that you're causing your
inflammation<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.879> that's<00:00:42.120> um<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:43.110> it's

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
inflammation and that's um it's it's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.860 
inflammation and that's um it's it's
very<00:00:43.770> well<00:00:43.980> known<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.480> there's<00:00:45.480> certain

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
very well known that there's certain

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.440 
very well known that there's certain
things<00:00:46.219> that<00:00:47.219> you're<00:00:47.399> allergic<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.360> you

things that you're allergic to that you

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.660 
things that you're allergic to that you
crave<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.800> lot<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.100> people<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.520> have

that people are having inflammatory
responses<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.409> bad<00:01:04.589> foods<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.430> exactly

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
responses to bad foods it's exactly

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.510 
responses to bad foods it's exactly
right<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.270> top<00:01:06.510> four<00:01:06.960> allergens<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.189> US

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
right the top four allergens in the US

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.140 
right the top four allergens in the US
are<00:01:09.150> casein<00:01:09.659> protein<00:01:10.640> albumin<00:01:11.640> which<00:01:12.000> are

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
are casein protein albumin which are

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.520 
are casein protein albumin which are
found<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.360> eggs<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.750> casein<00:01:13.080> that's<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.320> milk

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.520 
were feeding our chickens corn and
soybean<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:58.880> it's<00:01:59.240> up<00:01:59.450> taking<00:01:59.810> that<00:01:59.960> GMO

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
soybean and so it's up taking that GMO

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.620 
soybean and so it's up taking that GMO
protein<00:02:01.009> into<00:02:01.640> their<00:02:02.060> protein<00:02:02.420> which<00:02:02.600> is

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
protein into their protein which is

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.660 
protein into their protein which is
albumin<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.289> produced<00:02:03.710> in<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.070> eggs<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.550> so

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
albumin and produced in the eggs and so

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.070 
albumin and produced in the eggs and so
we're<00:02:05.000> getting<00:02:05.090> information<00:02:05.479> from<00:02:05.780> that

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
we're getting information from that

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.109 
we're getting information from that
because<00:02:06.619> our<00:02:06.890> were<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.789> we're<00:02:07.910> seeing

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
because our were and we're seeing

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.300 
because our were and we're seeing
allergies<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.899> albumin<00:02:09.410> because<00:02:10.070> it's

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
allergies to the albumin because it's

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.100 
allergies to the albumin because it's
all<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:10.610> GMO<00:02:11.060> feed<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:11.570> were<00:02:11.720> feeding<00:02:11.900> the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
all that GMO feed that were feeding the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.800 
all that GMO feed that were feeding the
chickens<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:13.150> finally<00:02:14.150> gluten<00:02:14.540> well

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
chickens and finally gluten well

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.060 
chickens and finally gluten well
obviously<00:02:14.959> wheat

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
obviously wheat

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.420 
obviously wheat
we're<00:02:16.360> totally<00:02:17.739> throwing<00:02:18.739> me<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.250> it's

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
we're totally throwing me and it's

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.430 
we're totally throwing me and it's
unfertilized<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:21.860> would<00:02:22.580> say<00:02:22.790> low<00:02:23.360> low<00:02:24.019> fertile

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
unfertilized I would say low low fertile

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.430 
unfertilized I would say low low fertile
soils<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.250> fertile<00:02:25.610> soils<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.480> a<00:02:26.959> hybridized

again a GMO rain and your body the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.840 
again a GMO rain and your body the
gluten<00:02:31.970> content<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.510> absolutely<00:02:33.200> insane<00:02:33.850> they

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
gluten content is absolutely insane they

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.060 
gluten content is absolutely insane they
say<00:02:35.030> like<00:02:35.239> spelt<00:02:35.900> that's<00:02:36.079> a<00:02:36.140> real<00:02:36.260> nice<00:02:36.440> world

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070
