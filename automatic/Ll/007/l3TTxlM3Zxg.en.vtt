00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
crust um put it in the oven for a at 350

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.290 
crust um put it in the oven for a at 350
degrees<00:05:10.729> Fahrenheit<00:05:11.729> and<00:05:12.380> you<00:05:13.380> just<00:05:13.560> want<00:05:13.770> to

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
degrees Fahrenheit and you just want to

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.240 
degrees Fahrenheit and you just want to
keep<00:05:15.300> checking<00:05:15.720> back<00:05:15.750> on<00:05:15.870> it<00:05:16.260> you<00:05:16.919> do<00:05:17.159> the

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
keep checking back on it you do the

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.320 
keep checking back on it you do the
toothpick<00:05:17.639> test<00:05:17.789> where<00:05:17.970> you<00:05:18.030> stick<00:05:18.210> to

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
toothpick test where you stick to

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.420 
toothpick test where you stick to
toothpick<00:05:18.750> in<00:05:18.930> and<00:05:19.139> pull<00:05:19.380> it<00:05:19.500> out<00:05:19.620> you<00:05:20.250> don't

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
toothpick in and pull it out you don't

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.950 
toothpick in and pull it out you don't
want<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.210> keep<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:21.389> close<00:05:21.539> eye<00:05:21.690> on<00:05:21.720> it<00:05:21.930> because

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
want to keep a close eye on it because

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.129 
want to keep a close eye on it because
if<00:05:22.260> you<00:05:22.349> don't<00:05:22.590> it's<00:05:22.860> gonna<00:05:23.070> split<00:05:23.760> and<00:05:24.139> get

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
if you don't it's gonna split and get

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.629 
if you don't it's gonna split and get
too<00:05:25.289> big<00:05:25.530> and<00:05:25.680> it'll<00:05:25.889> split<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:26.400> you'll<00:05:26.520> have

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
too big and it'll split and you'll have

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.490 
too big and it'll split and you'll have
a<00:05:26.699> ripped<00:05:27.120> top<00:05:27.599> and<00:05:27.930> that's<00:05:28.050> not<00:05:28.260> going<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.470> be

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
a ripped top and that's not going to be

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.050 
a ripped top and that's not going to be
pretty<00:05:28.680> so<00:05:29.220> make<00:05:29.550> sure<00:05:29.580> you<00:05:29.729> keep<00:05:29.789> an<00:05:29.909> eye<00:05:30.030> on

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
pretty so make sure you keep an eye on

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.000 
pretty so make sure you keep an eye on
it<00:05:30.360> and<00:05:30.389> when<00:05:31.139> you<00:05:31.169> feel<00:05:31.380> like<00:05:31.470> it's<00:05:31.650> ready<00:05:31.770> and

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
it and when you feel like it's ready and

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.770 
it and when you feel like it's ready and
it<00:05:32.070> passes<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:32.400> toothpick<00:05:32.820> test<00:05:32.970> take<00:05:33.510> it<00:05:33.659> out

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
it passes the toothpick test take it out

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.170 
it passes the toothpick test take it out
and<00:05:33.930> then<00:05:34.020> stick<00:05:34.380> it<00:05:34.409> in<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.650> fridge<00:05:35.120> okay<00:05:36.120> so

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
and then stick it in the fridge okay so

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.360 
and then stick it in the fridge okay so
it's<00:05:36.419> in<00:05:36.509> the<00:05:36.570> oven<00:05:36.630> right<00:05:36.870> now<00:05:36.990> 350<00:05:37.919> degrees

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
it's in the oven right now 350 degrees

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.029 
it's in the oven right now 350 degrees
and<00:05:38.720> another<00:05:39.720> little<00:05:40.050> tip<00:05:40.380> that<00:05:40.620> I<00:05:40.680> would<00:05:40.830> have

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
and another little tip that I would have

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.740 
and another little tip that I would have
is<00:05:41.280> to<00:05:41.490> go<00:05:41.639> for<00:05:41.880> it<00:05:42.030> with<00:05:42.240> these<00:05:42.389> proportions

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
is to go for it with these proportions

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.560 
is to go for it with these proportions
go<00:05:43.139> for<00:05:43.349> the<00:05:43.470> smaller<00:05:43.979> pan<00:05:44.490> rather<00:05:45.180> than<00:05:45.330> big

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
go for the smaller pan rather than big

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.689 
go for the smaller pan rather than big
one<00:05:45.750> I<00:05:45.870> think<00:05:46.050> got<00:05:46.199> the<00:05:46.289> 12-inch<00:05:46.889> one<00:05:47.190> and<00:05:47.400> said

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
one I think got the 12-inch one and said

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.370 
one I think got the 12-inch one and said
there<00:05:47.849> was<00:05:47.940> a<00:05:47.970> 10-inch<00:05:48.479> one<00:05:48.690> so<00:05:48.840> i<00:05:48.960> would<00:05:49.229> go

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
there was a 10-inch one so i would go

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.110 
there was a 10-inch one so i would go
ahead<00:05:49.409> and<00:05:49.620> get<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:49.919> 10-inch<00:05:50.250> one<00:05:50.430> because

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
ahead and get the 10-inch one because

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.240 
ahead and get the 10-inch one because
I've<00:05:51.240> never<00:05:51.270> done<00:05:51.509> this<00:05:51.659> before<00:05:51.930> I<00:05:52.620> got<00:05:53.159> the

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
I've never done this before I got the

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.670 
I've never done this before I got the
bigger<00:05:53.460> one<00:05:53.610> yeah<00:05:53.990> and<00:05:54.990> the<00:05:55.169> other<00:05:55.289> thing<00:05:55.380> is

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
bigger one yeah and the other thing is

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.279 
bigger one yeah and the other thing is
that<00:05:56.310> you<00:05:56.400> can<00:05:56.430> check<00:05:56.849> if<00:05:57.060> it's<00:05:57.180> ready<00:05:57.419> is<00:05:57.630> take

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
that you can check if it's ready is take

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:59.990 
that you can check if it's ready is take
another<00:05:58.650> inmate<00:05:58.830> go<00:05:59.250> ahead<00:05:59.460> and<00:05:59.610> shake<00:05:59.849> the

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
another inmate go ahead and shake the

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.499 
another inmate go ahead and shake the
pan<00:06:00.240> and<00:06:00.509> if<00:06:01.050> it's<00:06:01.199> kind<00:06:01.530> of<00:06:01.849> solid<00:06:02.849> then<00:06:03.389> you

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
pan and if it's kind of solid then you

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.120 
pan and if it's kind of solid then you
can<00:06:03.630> do<00:06:03.750> toothpick<00:06:04.199> test<00:06:04.380> if<00:06:04.620> it<00:06:04.680> looks<00:06:04.860> really

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
can do toothpick test if it looks really

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.920 
can do toothpick test if it looks really
liquidy<00:06:05.430> then<00:06:05.970> it's<00:06:06.150> definitely<00:06:06.570> not<00:06:06.690> ready

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
liquidy then it's definitely not ready

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.870 
liquidy then it's definitely not ready
and<00:06:07.199> it<00:06:07.409> needs<00:06:07.560> a<00:06:07.620> couple<00:06:07.800> more<00:06:07.979> minutes<00:06:08.220> so

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
and it needs a couple more minutes so

and it needs a couple more minutes so
I'm<00:06:09.090> just<00:06:09.300> here<00:06:09.539> waiting<00:06:09.750> for<00:06:10.110> it<00:06:10.169> to<00:06:10.349> be

okay<00:06:17.099> so<00:06:17.729> mines<00:06:17.969> broke<00:06:18.300> a<00:06:18.330> little<00:06:18.599> bit<00:06:18.899> but

00:06:19.609 --> 00:06:19.619

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
overnight and when I do eat it I will

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.859 
overnight and when I do eat it I will
show<00:06:32.219> you<00:06:32.279> guys<00:06:32.399> what<00:06:32.669> it<00:06:32.759> looks<00:06:32.789> like<00:06:33.059> so

00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:33.869 
show you guys what it looks like so

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:37.189 
show you guys what it looks like so
that's<00:06:34.019> how<00:06:34.199> it<00:06:34.319> looks<00:06:34.469> on<00:06:34.619> the<00:06:34.679> inside<00:06:36.199> the

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 
that's how it looks on the inside the

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.129 
that's how it looks on the inside the
quest<00:06:37.499> really<00:06:38.129> crumbly<00:06:38.699> it<00:06:39.599> was<00:06:39.719> really<00:06:39.959> hard

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
quest really crumbly it was really hard

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.409 
quest really crumbly it was really hard
to<00:06:40.199> cut<00:06:40.379> through<00:06:40.789> but<00:06:41.789> um<00:06:41.909> it's<00:06:42.059> pretty<00:06:42.119> did

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 
to cut through but um it's pretty did

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.079 
to cut through but um it's pretty did
and<00:06:42.809> I<00:06:42.919> would<00:06:43.919> definitely<00:06:44.039> suggest<00:06:44.519> buying<00:06:44.879> a

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:45.089 
and I would definitely suggest buying a

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:46.969 
and I would definitely suggest buying a
smaller<00:06:45.330> pan<00:06:45.689> and<00:06:46.289> everything<00:06:46.709> else<00:06:46.860> is

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
smaller pan and everything else is
