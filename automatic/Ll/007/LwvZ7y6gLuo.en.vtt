crossbow because I was trying to test
out<00:00:11.710> a<00:00:11.740> new<00:00:11.860> trigger<00:00:12.280> mechanism<00:00:12.879> which<00:00:13.000> i'm

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
out a new trigger mechanism which i'm

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.699 
out a new trigger mechanism which i'm
going<00:00:13.299> to<00:00:13.360> show<00:00:13.450> you<00:00:13.480> now<00:00:13.690> you<00:00:14.200> can<00:00:14.379> see<00:00:14.530> over

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:14.709 
going to show you now you can see over

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.350 
going to show you now you can see over
here<00:00:14.740> there's<00:00:15.129> a<00:00:15.190> notch<00:00:15.400> the<00:00:15.940> string<00:00:16.180> will<00:00:16.299> be

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
here there's a notch the string will be

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.689 
here there's a notch the string will be
held<00:00:16.660> behind<00:00:16.840> this<00:00:17.140> notch<00:00:17.440> so<00:00:18.190> when<00:00:18.430> you<00:00:18.520> pull

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
held behind this notch so when you pull

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.820 
held behind this notch so when you pull
the<00:00:18.730> trigger<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.960> can<00:00:20.170> see<00:00:20.289> the<00:00:20.440> little<00:00:20.560> part

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
the trigger you can see the little part

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.679 
the trigger you can see the little part
of<00:00:20.860> the<00:00:20.980> trigger<00:00:21.220> that<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:22.300> part<00:00:22.570> of<00:00:22.630> the

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
of the trigger that that part of the

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.720 
of the trigger that that part of the
trigger<00:00:22.990> pushes<00:00:23.410> the<00:00:23.710> string<00:00:24.009> art<00:00:24.310> the<00:00:24.519> knot

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
trigger pushes the string art the knot

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.310 
trigger pushes the string art the knot
which<00:00:25.480> shoots<00:00:26.109> the<00:00:26.980> boat<00:00:27.730> that's<00:00:28.539> it<00:00:28.749> I<00:00:28.900> am

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
which shoots the boat that's it I am

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.499 
which shoots the boat that's it I am
using<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.740> same<00:00:29.919> goals<00:00:30.220> as<00:00:30.429> before<00:00:30.849> but<00:00:31.029> in

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
using the same goals as before but in

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.750 
using the same goals as before but in
this<00:00:31.689> one<00:00:31.749> I<00:00:31.900> have<00:00:32.110> actually<00:00:32.380> slightly<00:00:33.190> katama

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
this one I have actually slightly katama

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.390 
this one I have actually slightly katama
flights<00:00:34.030> because<00:00:34.210> it<00:00:35.110> has<00:00:35.410> to<00:00:35.560> fit<00:00:35.740> through

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
flights because it has to fit through

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.100 
flights because it has to fit through
this<00:00:37.920> front<00:00:38.920> side<00:00:39.160> so<00:00:39.969> let's<00:00:40.570> shoot<00:00:40.780> with<00:00:40.989> it

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
this front side so let's shoot with it

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.950 
this front side so let's shoot with it
so<00:00:41.649> to<00:00:42.039> the<00:00:42.190> weapon<00:00:42.489> it<00:00:42.940> all<00:00:43.660> i<00:00:43.719> have<00:00:43.899> to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
so to the weapon it all i have to

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.990 
so to the weapon it all i have to
do<00:00:44.140> is<00:00:44.579> pull<00:00:45.579> this<00:00:45.760> back<00:00:46.000> and<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:47.199> weapon<00:00:48.000> is

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
do is pull this back and the weapon is

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.450 
do is pull this back and the weapon is
caught<00:00:49.359> and<00:00:49.660> you<00:00:50.230> take<00:00:50.379> the<00:00:50.530> ball<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:50.920> just

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
caught and you take the ball and just

00:00:51.460 --> 00:01:01.520 
caught and you take the ball and just
load<00:00:51.969> it<00:00:52.000> as<00:00:52.300> usual<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:55.140> then<00:00:56.140> find<00:00:56.379> a<00:00:56.469> way

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:14.390 

you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:30.510 

you

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:38.770 

you

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.950 

you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.940 

okay<00:01:44.960> even<00:01:45.200> though<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.440> weapon<00:01:45.680> is<00:01:45.770> not

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
okay even though the weapon is not

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.770 
okay even though the weapon is not
accurate<00:01:46.160> is<00:01:46.460> actually<00:01:46.790> quite<00:01:46.940> strong<00:01:47.450> but

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
accurate is actually quite strong but

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.650 
accurate is actually quite strong but
now<00:01:48.650> so<00:01:49.220> I<00:01:49.280> can<00:01:49.520> actually<00:01:49.880> shoot<00:01:50.030> from<00:01:50.600> a

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
now so I can actually shoot from a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.760 
now so I can actually shoot from a
farther<00:01:51.110> distance<00:01:51.350> like<00:01:51.770> 20<00:01:52.490> 15<00:01:52.850> feet<00:01:53.150> but<00:01:53.810> but

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
farther distance like 20 15 feet but but

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.110 
farther distance like 20 15 feet but but
when<00:01:55.010> I<00:01:55.040> choose<00:01:55.250> from<00:01:55.460> such<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.670> long<00:01:55.910> distance

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
when I choose from such a long distance

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.680 
when I choose from such a long distance
the<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.830> board<00:01:58.040> is<00:01:58.400> most<00:01:58.640> likely<00:01:58.910> to<00:01:59.090> go<00:01:59.360> far

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
the the board is most likely to go far

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.280 
the the board is most likely to go far
off<00:01:59.900> from<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.380> target<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:00.890> England<00:02:01.550> so<00:02:02.479> but

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
off from the target and England so but

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.130 
off from the target and England so but
the<00:02:03.560> weapon<00:02:03.830> is<00:02:03.979> strong<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.000> can<00:02:05.390> shoot<00:02:05.960> from

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
the weapon is strong so I can shoot from

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:15.360 
the weapon is strong so I can shoot from
here

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.039 

so<00:02:15.879> I<00:02:15.909> hope<00:02:16.209> you've<00:02:16.360> enjoyed<00:02:16.450> this<00:02:16.840> video
