 - Hi, this is George again! Today I will show you 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.710
 how to paint overgrown gray hair roots. Candy told me 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.769
 that has long been dyeing hair. But her constant 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.699
 the problem is how to completely cover the gray hairs at the roots 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.260
 and at the same time achieve a uniform color over the entire length of the hair. 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.500
 And today I will help her deal with it. 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.989
 - Well, let's get started. 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.149
 - Are you ready? Okay. On average, hair grows on 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.640
 1 cm per month, due to which, unfortunately, gray roots 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.129
 appear fast enough. But today, with the help 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.260
 simple tricks, I'll show you how to paint over gray 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.370
 the roots and get at the same time saturated color. 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.629
 It is very important 48 hours prior to staining to test 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.920
 on an allergic reaction. Do not forget to cover your 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.700
 clothes with a towel, and, of course, wear gloves. 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.110
 Immediately, I note that you need to use paint of the 3rd 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.850
 level of resistance. Shading or brightener 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.630
 can not paint over gray hair. Since the regrown roots 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.530
 differ in color from the bulk of the hair, very 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.970
 it is important to strictly observe the specified staining time. 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.430
 So, first cover your clothes with a towel, 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.740
 open the package. Here we have developing milk, 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.979
 coloring cream, conditioner and instructions for use. 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.450
 So let's get started! 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.689

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.180

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.960
 until the mixture turns into a smooth cream. 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.960
 Fine. And we begin to apply paint to the roots. 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.030
 It is very important to apply a large amount of paint and light. 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.360
 massage in the area of ​​regrown gray roots. 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.300
 Use the applicator to separate the strands. 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.580
 Leave the paint on for 20 minutes. After that we will distribute 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.530
 the remaining paint along the entire length of the hair to achieve 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.670
 perfect uniform result. 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.620
 - Want to try it yourself? 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.570

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.570
 - Come on. Take a strand. Fine. Well done, it's that easy! 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.330
 Make sure you put paint on the entire root area. 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.520
 After 20 minutes, distribute the paint over the entire length of the hair. 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.330
 and leave for another 10 minutes. Start massaging 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.230
 from the roots, distributing the dye through the hair to the tips. 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.340
 So the color will be beautiful and uniform. 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.270

 Massage it into hair, leave for a couple of minutes. 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.430
 and then rinse with water. That's all! Feel the difference?
