to<00:00:33.719> get<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:33.989> flying<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.410> add<00:00:34.590> your<00:00:34.620> own<00:00:34.829> radio

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
to get this flying is add your own radio

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.459 
to get this flying is add your own radio
system<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.390> want<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> use<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> six<00:00:37.140> channel

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469

receiver<00:00:39.510> for<00:00:39.750> example<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> great<00:00:40.410> choice

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
receiver for example be a great choice

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.290 
receiver for example be a great choice
basically<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.700> need<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.910> hook<00:00:42.059> up<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
basically just need to hook up the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.940 
basically just need to hook up the
receiver<00:00:42.600> run<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.379> through<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.559> simple

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
receiver run it through a simple

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.490 
receiver run it through a simple
calibration<00:00:44.219> process<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.329> ready<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> fly<00:00:45.989> so

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
calibration process and ready to fly so

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.340 
calibration process and ready to fly so
very<00:00:46.829> simple<00:00:47.219> very<00:00:47.340> easy<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.670> use<00:00:48.260> pull<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
very simple very easy to use pull the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.569 
very simple very easy to use pull the
cover<00:00:49.530> off<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.739> top<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> scene

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
cover off the top here see the scene

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.939 
cover off the top here see the scene
inside<00:00:51.110> it's<00:00:52.110> quite<00:00:52.320> an<00:00:52.410> advanced<00:00:52.680> flight

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
inside it's quite an advanced flight

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.130 
inside it's quite an advanced flight
controller<00:00:53.420> this<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.600> not<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:54.960> your<00:00:55.079> basic

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
controller this is not just your basic

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.930 
controller this is not just your basic
gyro<00:00:55.890> based<00:00:56.219> controller<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.789> has

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
gyro based controller this has

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.720 
gyro based controller this has
accelerometer<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.899> also<00:00:58.770> has<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> barometer

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
accelerometer and also has a barometer

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.760 
accelerometer and also has a barometer
as<00:00:59.820> well<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.960> barometer<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.680> do

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
as well so with the barometer you can do

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.650 
as well so with the barometer you can do
altitude<00:01:02.250> holding<00:01:02.609> which<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.000> very<00:01:03.239> very<00:01:03.480> nice

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
altitude holding which is very very nice

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.320 
altitude holding which is very very nice
especially<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.680> doing<00:01:05.100> aerial<00:01:05.369> video<00:01:05.729> or<00:01:05.909> fpv

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
especially for doing aerial video or fpv

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.600 
especially for doing aerial video or fpv
and<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.290> accelerometer<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:08.010> course<00:01:08.250> as<00:01:08.460> well

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and the accelerometer of course as well

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.660 
and the accelerometer of course as well
makes<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.869> quad<00:01:10.260> ultra<00:01:11.100> stable<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
makes the the quad ultra stable and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.100 
makes the the quad ultra stable and
gives<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.880> self<00:01:12.119> leveling<00:01:12.450> characteristics

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
gives it self leveling characteristics

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.520 
gives it self leveling characteristics
very<00:01:13.500> good<00:01:13.710> again<00:01:13.950> for<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.250> aerial<00:01:14.820> videos

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
very good again for your aerial videos

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.050 
very good again for your aerial videos

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
thumb to adjust and its position we put

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.260 
thumb to adjust and its position we put
the<00:01:29.100> arms<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.400> different<00:01:29.640> positions<00:01:30.030> where

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the arms in different positions where

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.670 
the arms in different positions where
you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.570> fold<00:01:30.780> them<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.140> transport

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
you can just fold them in for transport
