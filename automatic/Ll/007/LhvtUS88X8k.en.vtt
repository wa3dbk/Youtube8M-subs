investment for only like thirty four
dollars<00:02:09.020> i<00:02:09.440> think<00:02:09.619> that's<00:02:09.770> really<00:02:10.160> good

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
dollars i think that's really good

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.520 
dollars i think that's really good
compared<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.000> like<00:02:11.120> some<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.540> shadows<00:02:11.930> so

compared to like some I shadows so

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.320 
compared to like some I shadows so
expensive<00:02:12.980> like<00:02:13.130> I<00:02:13.280> really<00:02:13.820> want<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.030> one
