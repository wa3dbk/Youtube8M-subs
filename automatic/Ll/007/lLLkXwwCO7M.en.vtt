on<00:00:29.699> next<00:00:29.910> gen<00:00:30.119> they<00:00:30.449> people<00:00:30.779> would<00:00:30.869> think<00:00:30.990> that

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
on next gen they people would think that

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.020 
on next gen they people would think that
they<00:00:31.320> might<00:00:31.349> be<00:00:31.650> delaying<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.340> release<00:00:32.669> date

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
they might be delaying the release date

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.209 
they might be delaying the release date
for<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.870> people<00:00:34.440> were<00:00:34.530> panicking<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
for it so people were panicking and the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.220 
for it so people were panicking and the
ass<00:00:35.399> rock<00:00:35.640> star<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.059> apparently<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.989> release

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
ass rock star and apparently the release

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.410 
ass rock star and apparently the release
date<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.440> still<00:00:37.590> 27th<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.370> January<00:00:38.730> which<00:00:39.210> is

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
date is still 27th of January which is

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.680 
date is still 27th of January which is
all<00:00:39.690> good<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:41.340> system<00:00:41.879> requirements<00:00:42.540> are

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
all good but the system requirements are

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.990 
all good but the system requirements are
slightly<00:00:43.140> strange<00:00:43.680> because<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.789> hard

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
slightly strange because the the hard

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.540 
slightly strange because the the hard
drive<00:00:45.329> space<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:46.110> required<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.100> 20

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
drive space this required is 20

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.029 
drive space this required is 20
gigabytes<00:00:47.760> apparently<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.930> xbox<00:00:49.320> 360<00:00:49.800> he

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
gigabytes apparently and on xbox 360 he

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.299 
gigabytes apparently and on xbox 360 he
was<00:00:50.250> close<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:51.500> surely<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> pc<00:00:53.070> game

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
was close to that surely a pc game

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.279 
was close to that surely a pc game
should<00:00:53.550> require<00:00:54.059> way<00:00:54.480> more<00:00:54.719> hard<00:00:54.930> drive<00:00:55.140> space

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
should require way more hard drive space

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.959 
should require way more hard drive space
I'm<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.800> kind<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.100> confused<00:00:56.280> by<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.789> a

I'm just kind of confused by that a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.240 
still lags on my gaming PC I know it's

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
not the best gaming PC in the world but

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.520 
not the best gaming PC in the world but
it's<00:01:59.430> not<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.030> worst<00:02:00.240> either<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.659> mean<00:02:00.899> 770

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
it's not the worst either I mean 770

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.319 
it's not the worst either I mean 770
superclocked<00:02:01.649> isn't<00:02:02.310> exactly<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.149> bad

really<00:02:05.280> well<00:02:05.430> which<00:02:05.790> means<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.119> don't<00:02:06.360> need<00:02:06.420> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
really well which means you don't need a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.440 
really well which means you don't need a
crazy<00:02:06.869> game<00:02:07.049> pc<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.590> run<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.860> or<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.420> be

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
crazy game pc to run it or it can be

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.440 
crazy game pc to run it or it can be
just<00:02:10.069> they<00:02:11.069> haven't<00:02:11.430> changed<00:02:11.819> graphics<00:02:12.300> at

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
just they haven't changed graphics at

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
just they haven't changed graphics at
all<00:02:12.750> really

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
all really

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.590 
all really
which<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.980> kind<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.550> bit<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.760> worry<00:02:15.000> because

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
which is kind of a bit of worry because

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.380 
which is kind of a bit of worry because
obviously<00:02:15.780> next<00:02:16.410> gens<00:02:16.680> come<00:02:16.890> out<00:02:17.390> companies

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
obviously next gens come out companies

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.090 
obviously next gens come out companies
are<00:02:18.420> kind<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.870> concentrating<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.530> bit<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.800> next

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
are kind of concentrating a bit on next

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.400 
are kind of concentrating a bit on next
gen<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.490> feel<00:02:20.910> because<00:02:21.690> they<00:02:21.870> want<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.110> try<00:02:22.290> and

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
gen I feel because they want to try and

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.750 
gen I feel because they want to try and
see<00:02:22.530> what<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> games<00:02:22.950> are<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.460> see<00:02:23.610> how

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
see what the games are like to see how

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.610 
see what the games are like to see how
many<00:02:23.910> people<00:02:24.120> buy<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.330> games<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.870> next

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
many people buy the games and the next

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.350 
many people buy the games and the next
year<00:02:25.800> they'll<00:02:25.950> consider<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.060> was<00:02:27.180> going

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
year they'll consider so I was going

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.000 
year they'll consider so I was going
back<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.660> looking<00:02:27.960> at<00:02:28.110> PC<00:02:28.350> ports<00:02:28.680> putting<00:02:28.920> more

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
back to looking at PC ports putting more

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.890 
back to looking at PC ports putting more
time<00:02:29.070> into<00:02:29.250> them<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:30.360> I'm<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.720> sort<00:02:30.870> of

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
time into them but I'm just sort of

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.720 
time into them but I'm just sort of
worried<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.400> Rockstar<00:02:32.400> might<00:02:32.550> not

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
worried that Rockstar might not

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.210 
worried that Rockstar might not
concentrate<00:02:33.210> on<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.420> pc<00:02:33.750> port<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:34.200> they<00:02:34.650> will

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
concentrate on the pc port and they will

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.440 
concentrate on the pc port and they will
have<00:02:35.310> just<00:02:35.490> concentrated<00:02:36.000> on<00:02:36.030> next-gen

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
have just concentrated on next-gen

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.630 
have just concentrated on next-gen
although<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.900> can't<00:02:37.260> really<00:02:37.470> see<00:02:37.710> why<00:02:37.920> how

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
although I can't really see why how

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.400 
although I can't really see why how
they've<00:02:38.820> done<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.150> because<00:02:39.450> next-gen<00:02:40.020> isn't

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
they've done that because next-gen isn't

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.990 
they've done that because next-gen isn't
that<00:02:40.560> much<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:41.130> mean<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.580> graphics<00:02:41.880> are

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
that much I mean the graphics are

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.670 
that much I mean the graphics are
improved<00:02:42.390> but<00:02:42.900> it's<00:02:42.960> not<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.350> much<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.560> a

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
improved but it's not that much of a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.100 
improved but it's not that much of a
different<00:02:43.980> games<00:02:44.190> are<00:02:44.370> hopefully<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.780> pc

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
different games are hopefully the pc

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.110 
different games are hopefully the pc
port<00:02:46.260> will<00:02:46.470> be<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> good<00:02:47.010> one<00:02:47.280> because<00:02:47.400> gt8<00:02:47.940> year

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
port will be a good one because gt8 year

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.420 
port will be a good one because gt8 year
for<00:02:48.510> really<00:02:49.170> wasn't<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.770> good<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.220> mean<00:02:50.340> it

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
for really wasn't that good I mean it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.680 
for really wasn't that good I mean it
wasn't<00:02:50.550> really<00:02:50.880> bad<00:02:51.060> but<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:51.360> wasn't<00:02:51.510> good

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
wasn't really bad but it wasn't good

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.270 
wasn't really bad but it wasn't good
either<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.290> don't<00:02:52.530> know<00:02:52.590> whether<00:02:52.800> any<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.100> that

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
either I don't know whether any of that

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.980 
either I don't know whether any of that
made<00:02:53.490> sense<00:02:53.520> but<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.090> just<00:02:54.390> saw<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.630> system

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
made sense but I just saw the system

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.420 
made sense but I just saw the system
requirements<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.680> kind<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.920> confused<00:02:56.310> me

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
requirements and it kind of confused me

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.670 
requirements and it kind of confused me
a<00:02:56.459> bit<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.810> also<00:02:57.990> wanted<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.320> just<00:02:58.470> tell<00:02:58.650> you

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
a bit and I also wanted to just tell you

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.860 
a bit and I also wanted to just tell you
that<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.040> release<00:02:59.550> date<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.730> GTA<00:03:00.090> 5<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.300> pc<00:03:00.690> is

to<00:03:09.360> be<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> brilliant<00:03:10.050> game<00:03:10.200> on<00:03:10.470> raleigh<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.800> a

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
to be a brilliant game on raleigh is a

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.830 
to be a brilliant game on raleigh is a
brilliant<00:03:11.040> game<00:03:11.340> let's<00:03:12.150> just<00:03:12.330> hope<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.600> port

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
brilliant game let's just hope the port

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.840 
brilliant game let's just hope the port
is<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.050> decent<00:03:13.470> one<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.550> will<00:03:14.610> run

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
is a decent one and that it will run

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.060 
is a decent one and that it will run
