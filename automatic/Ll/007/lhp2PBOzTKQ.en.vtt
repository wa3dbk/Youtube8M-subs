show so you guys can see is beam sabers

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.159 
show so you guys can see is beam sabers
as<00:00:24.609> you<00:00:24.789> can<00:00:24.910> see<00:00:25.119> is<00:00:25.269> not<00:00:25.419> showing<00:00:25.779> anywhere

it on pretty cool and it has a very nice
clear<00:00:57.579> blue<00:00:58.000> beam<00:00:58.899> which<00:00:59.739> goes<00:01:00.039> on<00:01:00.539> really

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
clear blue beam which goes on really

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.109 
clear blue beam which goes on really
good<00:01:01.809> and<00:01:01.989> it<00:01:02.260> also<00:01:02.350> has<00:01:02.500> a<00:01:03.089> shorter<00:01:04.089> version

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
good and it also has a shorter version

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.499 
good and it also has a shorter version
of<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.660> beam<00:01:04.839> that<00:01:05.080> goes<00:01:05.289> on<00:01:05.679> the<00:01:05.830> bottom<00:01:06.509> so

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
of the beam that goes on the bottom so

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.290 
of the beam that goes on the bottom so
you<00:01:07.539> can<00:01:07.720> have<00:01:07.899> it<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.970> Darth<00:01:10.210> Maul<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:11.560> a

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
you can have it like Darth Maul but a

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.840 
you can have it like Darth Maul but a
really<00:01:13.300> long<00:01:14.200> one<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:14.649> then<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.890> shore<00:01:15.130> 14<00:01:15.640> I

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
really long one and then the shore 14 I

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.450 
really long one and then the shore 14 I
guess<00:01:16.149> stabbing<00:01:16.600> backwards<00:01:17.190> all<00:01:18.190> right<00:01:18.340> now

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
guess stabbing backwards all right now

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.940 
guess stabbing backwards all right now
for<00:01:18.610> another<00:01:18.759> beam<00:01:19.000> saber<00:01:19.240> it<00:01:19.840> it's<00:01:20.740> writing

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
for another beam saber it it's writing

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.249 
for another beam saber it it's writing
on<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.159> form<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:22.239> what<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:22.509> do<00:01:22.599> is<00:01:22.630> just<00:01:22.899> lift

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
on the form and what you do is just lift

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.389 
on the form and what you do is just lift
it<00:01:23.349> up<00:01:23.590> I<00:01:25.200> want<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.259> break<00:01:26.470> it<00:01:26.500> you<00:01:27.009> lift<00:01:27.190> it<00:01:27.250> up

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
it up I want to break it you lift it up

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.520 
it up I want to break it you lift it up
and<00:01:27.640> then<00:01:28.420> you<00:01:28.509> let<00:01:28.630> this<00:01:28.750> little<00:01:28.989> flap<00:01:29.259> up

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
and then you let this little flap up

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.589 
and then you let this little flap up
right<00:01:29.739> here<00:01:30.039> and<00:01:30.220> there<00:01:30.940> comes<00:01:31.060> another<00:01:31.239> beam

00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:31.599 
right here and there comes another beam

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:34.710 
right here and there comes another beam
saber<00:01:31.840> where<00:01:32.590> you<00:01:32.770> just<00:01:32.950> put<00:01:33.160> the<00:01:33.479> same<00:01:34.479> long

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
saber where you just put the same long

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.880 
saber where you just put the same long
one<00:01:34.959> in<00:01:35.080> there<00:01:35.789> so<00:01:36.789> and<00:01:37.479> it<00:01:38.319> comes<00:01:38.500> with<00:01:38.590> four

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
one in there so and it comes with four

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.010 
one in there so and it comes with four
beams<00:01:39.039> too<00:01:39.399> small<00:01:39.729> or<00:01:39.759> too<00:01:39.970> low<00:01:40.390> for<00:01:40.420> one<00:01:40.869> with

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
beams too small or too low for one with

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.940 
beams too small or too low for one with
this<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.560> just<00:01:42.369> in<00:01:42.520> case<00:01:42.640> I<00:01:43.229> didn't<00:01:44.229> care<00:01:44.770> if<00:01:44.830> i

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
side and then you just close it down

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.970 
side and then you just close it down
make<00:02:36.330> sure<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.660> lined<00:02:37.230> up<00:02:37.410> right<00:02:37.740> with<00:02:37.920> the

stays up pretty good close the camera so

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.860 
stays up pretty good close the camera so
you<00:04:19.739> can<00:04:19.830> have<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.160> a<00:04:20.250> flying<00:04:20.760> out<00:04:20.940> from<00:04:21.600> there

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
you can have it a flying out from there

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.020 
you can have it a flying out from there
from<00:04:22.530> behind<00:04:22.800> them<00:04:22.979> and<00:04:23.160> you<00:04:23.340> can<00:04:23.460> also<00:04:23.610> I

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
from behind them and you can also I

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.960 
from behind them and you can also I
guess

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
guess

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.650 
guess
did<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.720> pose<00:04:26.250> get<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.400> post<00:04:27.640> where<00:04:28.360> he<00:04:28.390> has

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
did the pose get the post where he has

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.780 
did the pose get the post where he has
the<00:04:29.700> let's<00:04:30.700> record<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:32.470> triangle<00:04:32.980> the
