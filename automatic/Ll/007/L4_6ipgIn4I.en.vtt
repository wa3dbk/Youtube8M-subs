where<00:00:18.390> you're<00:00:18.750> gonna<00:00:18.869> have<00:00:19.109> bending<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
where you're gonna have bending and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.070 
where you're gonna have bending and
creasing<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.939> speaker<00:00:21.330> driver<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:22.020> is

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
creasing of the speaker driver this is

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.259 
creasing of the speaker driver this is
the<00:00:22.410> amplifier<00:00:22.949> module<00:00:23.550> as<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.090> see

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
the amplifier module as you can see

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.910 
the amplifier module as you can see
there's<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.570> row<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.930> headers<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.410> connect

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
there's a row of headers that connect

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.529 
there's a row of headers that connect
for<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> input<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.789> then<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> Jack

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
for the input and then we have a Jack

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.839 
for the input and then we have a Jack
over<00:00:27.750> here<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.320> connects<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.310> speaker

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
over here that connects to the speaker

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.930 
over here that connects to the speaker
driver<00:00:30.330> itself<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> 2<00:00:31.949> watt<00:00:32.520> amplifier

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
driver itself this is a 2 watt amplifier

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.420 
driver itself this is a 2 watt amplifier
module<00:00:33.570> which<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.170> plenty<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.710> drive<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.190> to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
module which is plenty to drive this to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.110 
module which is plenty to drive this to
its<00:00:35.579> full<00:00:36.110> SPL<00:00:37.110> which<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.500> about<00:00:37.680> 85<00:00:38.430> decibels

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
its full SPL which is about 85 decibels

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.970 
its full SPL which is about 85 decibels
when<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.899> driven<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.230> white<00:00:40.559> noise<00:00:40.739> or

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
when is driven with white noise or

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.400 
when is driven with white noise or
something<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:42.270> driver<00:00:42.809> itself

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
something like that the driver itself

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.920 
something like that the driver itself
has<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> frequency<00:00:44.760> range<00:00:45.030> spect

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
has a frequency range spect

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.920 
has a frequency range spect
at<00:00:46.050> about<00:00:46.469> 500<00:00:47.160> Hertz<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.879> 10<00:00:48.360> kilohertz

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
at about 500 Hertz up to 10 kilohertz

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.690 
at about 500 Hertz up to 10 kilohertz
with<00:00:49.320> pretty<00:00:49.620> heavy<00:00:49.860> drop-offs<00:00:50.430> at<00:00:50.610> either

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
with pretty heavy drop-offs at either

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.779 
with pretty heavy drop-offs at either
side<00:00:51.090> however<00:00:52.020> we're<00:00:52.350> finding<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.309> 1

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
side however we're finding that and 1

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.970 
side however we're finding that and 1
kilohertz<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.539> probably<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> better<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
kilohertz is probably the better of the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.799 
kilohertz is probably the better of the
lower<00:00:56.190> range<00:00:56.550> that's<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.030> most<00:00:57.180> usable<00:00:57.570> on

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
lower range that's the most usable on

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.540 
lower range that's the most usable on
the<00:00:57.930> lower<00:00:58.079> range<00:00:58.350> we've<00:00:58.739> got<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.100> hooked<00:00:59.399> up

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the lower range we've got this hooked up

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.180 
the lower range we've got this hooked up
with<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.870> battery<00:01:00.870> pack<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.469> nan<00:01:01.620> off<00:01:01.859> switch

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
with a battery pack with nan off switch

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.759 
with a battery pack with nan off switch
hooked<00:01:02.550> directly<00:01:02.670> into<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:04.260> into

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
hooked directly into it and then into

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.170 
hooked directly into it and then into
the<00:01:04.890> amp<00:01:05.040> module<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.549> there's<00:01:05.700> really<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:06.119> a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
the amp module so there's really not a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.460 
the amp module so there's really not a
whole<00:01:06.270> lot<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.080> we've<00:01:07.439> just

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
whole lot going on here we've just

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.140 
whole lot going on here we've just
spliced<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.250> three<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.580> half<00:01:08.700> millimeter

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
spliced in a three and a half millimeter

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.390 
spliced in a three and a half millimeter
audio<00:01:09.270> jack<00:01:09.689> directly<00:01:10.200> into<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.710> module<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
audio jack directly into the module the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.330 
audio jack directly into the module the
module<00:01:11.520> runs<00:01:11.970> off<00:01:12.180> 3.3<00:01:13.080> volts<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:13.560> 5<00:01:13.590> volts<00:01:13.920> so

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
module runs off 3.3 volts or 5 volts so

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.800 
module runs off 3.3 volts or 5 volts so
it's<00:01:14.460> easily<00:01:14.610> embeddable<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> battery

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
it's easily embeddable with a battery

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.560 
it's easily embeddable with a battery
we're<00:01:16.229> gonna<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> very<00:01:17.189> scientific<00:01:18.090> test<00:01:18.390> by

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
we're gonna do a very scientific test by

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.719 
we're gonna do a very scientific test by
playing<00:01:18.869> audio<00:01:19.350> from<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.070> YouTube<00:01:20.490> video

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
playing audio from a YouTube video

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.300 
playing audio from a YouTube video
through<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> computer<00:01:22.200> sound<00:01:22.470> card<00:01:22.799> into

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
through the computer sound card into

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.160 
through the computer sound card into
this<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.790> keep<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.270> mind<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.780> isn't<00:01:24.990> exactly

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
this so keep in mind this isn't exactly

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.230 
this so keep in mind this isn't exactly
the<00:01:25.650> most<00:01:25.799> scientific<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> gives<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
the most scientific but it gives you

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.880 
the most scientific but it gives you
kind<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.659> general<00:01:28.020> idea<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.770> expect

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
kind of a general idea of what to expect

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.520 
kind of a general idea of what to expect
from<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.579> combination<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:30.990> see<00:01:31.350> about

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
from this combination we can see about

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.859 
from this combination we can see about
40<00:01:32.100> decibels<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:33.060> about<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> background

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
40 decibels is about the background

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.719 
40 decibels is about the background

very basic SPL meter on my phone pretty

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.920 
very basic SPL meter on my phone pretty
much<00:01:38.670> matches<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.390> frequency<00:01:39.810> response

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
much matches the frequency response

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.480

product page we start hearing it
probably<00:01:43.860> around<00:01:43.950> 300<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.610> 500<00:01:45.180> Hertz<00:01:45.360> but

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
probably around 300 to 500 Hertz but

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.770 
probably around 300 to 500 Hertz but
it's<00:01:45.780> really<00:01:46.140> low<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.920> around<00:01:47.579> 500<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.450> 1

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it's really low and around 500 to 1

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.690 
it's really low and around 500 to 1
kilohertz<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.649> actually<00:01:49.799> start<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.220> hear

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
kilohertz you can actually start to hear

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.240 
kilohertz you can actually start to hear
it<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.780> really<00:01:52.020> strong<00:01:52.409> from<00:01:52.770> about<00:01:52.920> 1

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
it and it's really strong from about 1

it and it's really strong from about 1
kilohertz<00:01:53.549> all<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> way<00:01:54.210> up<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.450> about<00:01:54.600> 5

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.810 
kilohertz all the way up to about 5
kilohertz<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.649> where<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> loudest<00:01:56.280> so

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
kilohertz is where it's the loudest so

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.760 
kilohertz is where it's the loudest so
if<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.270> look<00:01:57.390> at<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> SPL<00:01:58.020> chart<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
if you look at the SPL chart on the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.590 
if you look at the SPL chart on the
website<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.340> actually<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.299> it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
website you can actually see that and it

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.149 
website you can actually see that and it
matches<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:01.079> whole<00:02:01.290> demonstration<00:02:01.590> pretty

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159

well so here we're going to play a video
to<00:02:05.070> give<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.490> an<00:02:05.610> idea<00:02:05.759> what<00:02:06.090> speech<00:02:06.540> sounds

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
to give you an idea what speech sounds

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.529 
to give you an idea what speech sounds
like<00:02:07.380> through<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.979> panel<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.700> also<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.390> give

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539

like through the panel and also to give
you<00:02:09.629> an<00:02:09.750> idea<00:02:09.840> what<00:02:10.140> kind<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.410> SPL<00:02:11.190> we<00:02:11.340> can

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
you an idea what kind of SPL we can

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:28.240 
you an idea what kind of SPL we can
expect

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.370

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
nastain get out of this is about 85

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.720

somewhere around 80 85 decibels here in

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.229 
somewhere around 80 85 decibels here in
the<00:02:44.130> room<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.670> know<00:02:44.700> if<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.940> listen<00:02:45.090> to

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
the room and you know if you listen to

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.970 
the room and you know if you listen to
the<00:02:45.450> comfortable<00:02:45.810> level<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.290> headphones<00:02:46.739> it's

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
the comfortable level on headphones it's

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.190 
the comfortable level on headphones it's
gonna<00:02:47.070> be<00:02:47.250> about<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.580> too<00:02:47.820> so<00:02:48.300> don't<00:02:49.110> expect

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
gonna be about that too so don't expect

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.840 
gonna be about that too so don't expect
it<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.650> compete<00:02:50.070> with<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.280> normal<00:02:50.610> talking

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
it to compete with a normal talking

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.460 
it to compete with a normal talking
voice<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.540> because<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.080> limited

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
voice and because of the limited

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.320 
voice and because of the limited
frequency<00:02:52.709> range<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.610> might<00:02:53.820> not<00:02:53.970> be<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.209> best

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
frequency range it might not be the best

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.910 
frequency range it might not be the best
for<00:02:54.600> music<00:02:54.989> but<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.410> could<00:02:55.560> use<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.890> for

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
for music but you could use it for

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.800 
for music but you could use it for
different<00:02:56.340> kinds<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.610> notification<00:02:57.360> systems
