00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
to the little fish tail flag which this

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.790 
to the little fish tail flag which this
time<00:03:52.880> I'd<00:03:53.090> used<00:03:53.420> my<00:03:53.630> paper<00:03:53.930> trimmer<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.560> trim

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
time I'd used my paper trimmer to trim

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.530 
time I'd used my paper trimmer to trim
down<00:03:54.830> this<00:03:55.070> one<00:03:55.280> because<00:03:55.550> it's<00:03:56.150> getting<00:03:56.420> in

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
down this one because it's getting in

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.910 
down this one because it's getting in
here<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:56.959> inside<00:03:57.290> of<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.440> card<00:03:57.680> so<00:03:57.890> I

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
here to the inside of the card so I

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.440 
here to the inside of the card so I
don't<00:03:58.130> have<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.310> space<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.940> just<00:03:59.120> trim<00:03:59.390> it

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
don't have that space to just trim it

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.199 
don't have that space to just trim it
off<00:03:59.570> with<00:03:59.780> my<00:03:59.900> scissors<00:04:00.310> so<00:04:01.310> get<00:04:01.910> that<00:04:01.940> all

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
off with my scissors so get that all

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.820 
off with my scissors so get that all
done<00:04:02.239> and<00:04:02.630> I'm<00:04:02.720> going<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:02.930> adhere<00:04:03.020> to<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.530> card

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
done and I'm going to adhere to the card

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.570 
done and I'm going to adhere to the card
and<00:04:04.130> making<00:04:05.030> sure<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.480> here<00:04:05.989> just<00:04:06.530> below<00:04:06.860> the

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
and making sure to here just below the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.610 
and making sure to here just below the
score<00:04:08.030> line<00:04:08.209> of<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.510> fold<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.110> that<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.350> card

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
score line of the fold so that the card

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.710 
score line of the fold so that the card
shuts<00:04:10.160> cleanly<00:04:10.850> you<00:04:11.030> know<00:04:11.120> it<00:04:11.270> doesn't<00:04:11.510> catch

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
shuts cleanly you know it doesn't catch

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.750 
shuts cleanly you know it doesn't catch
on<00:04:11.930> that<00:04:11.989> so<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.040> always<00:04:13.250> want<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.550> kind<00:04:13.730> of

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
on that so you always want to kind of

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.590 
on that so you always want to kind of
watch<00:04:13.910> that<00:04:14.209> when<00:04:14.360> you're<00:04:14.480> adhering

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
watch that when you're adhering

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.570 
watch that when you're adhering
cardstock<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.680> inside<00:04:15.980> of<00:04:16.010> your<00:04:16.100> cards<00:04:16.430> that

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
cardstock the inside of your cards that

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.970 
cardstock the inside of your cards that
you<00:04:16.669> don't<00:04:16.940> adhere<00:04:17.810> to<00:04:18.200> close<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.739> fold

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
you don't adhere to close to the fold

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.070 
you don't adhere to close to the fold
otherwise<00:04:19.489> your<00:04:19.760> car<00:04:19.970> just<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.450> doesn't<00:04:20.660> fold

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
otherwise your car just it doesn't fold

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.840 
otherwise your car just it doesn't fold
properly<00:04:21.350> and<00:04:21.830> it<00:04:21.919> just<00:04:22.100> feels<00:04:22.430> weird<00:04:22.520> when

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
properly and it just feels weird when

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.810 
properly and it just feels weird when
you<00:04:22.970> go<00:04:23.120> to<00:04:23.180> close<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.840> card<00:04:24.050> so<00:04:24.890> I<00:04:25.160> decide

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
you go to close the card so I decide

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.280 
you go to close the card so I decide
the<00:04:25.970> front<00:04:26.210> needed<00:04:26.540> just<00:04:26.720> a<00:04:26.900> little<00:04:27.140> bit

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
the front needed just a little bit

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.170 
the front needed just a little bit
something<00:04:27.560> more<00:04:27.980> so<00:04:28.430> I'm<00:04:28.520> going<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.700> just<00:04:28.790> trim

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
something more so I'm going to just trim

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.710 
something more so I'm going to just trim
down<00:04:29.480> an<00:04:29.780> eighth<00:04:30.020> of<00:04:30.230> an<00:04:30.380> inch<00:04:30.560> on<00:04:31.660> each<00:04:32.660> side

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
down an eighth of an inch on each side

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.520 
down an eighth of an inch on each side
here<00:04:33.590> of<00:04:33.770> this<00:04:34.670> cardstock<00:04:35.150> panel<00:04:35.840> let's<00:04:36.410> get

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
here of this cardstock panel let's get

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.810 
here of this cardstock panel let's get
out<00:04:36.620> trim<00:04:36.860> down<00:04:36.980> just<00:04:37.220> a<00:04:37.280> little<00:04:37.430> bit<00:04:37.520> so<00:04:37.760> that

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
out trim down just a little bit so that

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.790 
out trim down just a little bit so that
I<00:04:37.970> can<00:04:38.030> map<00:04:38.390> that<00:04:38.630> on<00:04:38.810> a<00:04:38.840> piece<00:04:39.170> of<00:04:39.200> chocolate

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
I can map that on a piece of chocolate

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.460 
I can map that on a piece of chocolate
brown<00:04:40.100> cardstock<00:04:40.840> just<00:04:41.840> that<00:04:41.960> little<00:04:42.080> frame

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
brown cardstock just that little frame

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.960 
brown cardstock just that little frame
just<00:04:42.800> kind<00:04:42.980> of<00:04:43.010> finishes<00:04:43.310> it<00:04:43.490> off<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:43.820> gives

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
just kind of finishes it off and gives

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.910 
just kind of finishes it off and gives
it<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.180> little<00:04:44.270> extra<00:04:44.390> something<00:04:44.990> when<00:04:45.830> I'm

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
it a little extra something when I'm

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.610 
it a little extra something when I'm
doing<00:04:46.160> more<00:04:46.460> simple<00:04:46.970> cards<00:04:47.420> I<00:04:47.600> find<00:04:48.350> a<00:04:48.470> lot<00:04:48.560> of

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
doing more simple cards I find a lot of

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.650 
doing more simple cards I find a lot of
times<00:04:48.860> just<00:04:49.010> layering<00:04:49.430> cardstock<00:04:50.180> really

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
times just layering cardstock really

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.660 
times just layering cardstock really
helps<00:04:50.960> to<00:04:51.050> kind<00:04:51.140> of<00:04:51.260> finish<00:04:51.410> it<00:04:51.620> off<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:52.040> then

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
helps to kind of finish it off and then

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.100 
helps to kind of finish it off and then
I<00:04:52.730> made<00:04:52.910> sure<00:04:52.940> to<00:04:53.120> flip<00:04:53.300> it<00:04:53.360> around<00:04:53.480> and<00:04:53.750> not<00:04:53.960> be

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
I made sure to flip it around and not be

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.410 
I made sure to flip it around and not be
here<00:04:54.440> upside<00:04:54.830> down<00:04:55.070> because<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.820> tend<00:04:56.090> to<00:04:56.240> do

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
here upside down because I tend to do

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.680 
here upside down because I tend to do
that<00:04:56.570> and<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:58.310> was<00:04:58.550> going<00:04:58.850> to<00:04:58.910> be<00:04:59.030> done<00:04:59.210> here<00:04:59.240> but

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
that and I was going to be done here but

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.600 
that and I was going to be done here but
I<00:04:59.750> felt<00:05:00.050> like<00:05:00.110> it's<00:05:00.350> still<00:05:00.650> needed<00:05:00.980> a<00:05:01.130> little

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
I felt like it's still needed a little

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.970 
I felt like it's still needed a little
bit<00:05:01.760> extra<00:05:01.910> something<00:05:02.510> so<00:05:03.200> I<00:05:03.230> just<00:05:03.650> grabbed

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
bit extra something so I just grabbed

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.370
