 hello everyone welcome to my channel once 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.090
 more today I am going to bring you one 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.099
 favorite makeups is a smoked 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.929
 brown but it has a very 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.820
 special with a pigment that we will add 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.470
 at the end of the makeup so if 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.270
 you want to see how I do it and what are 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.359
 the steps that I follow to create my 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.010
 beloved favorite do not go and you'll see 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.170
 What facilitated is to do and how well 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.150
 we are going to start preparing the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.429
 eyelids if you were greasy apply 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.380
 a first one I am going to choose a time 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.440
 topic that in the ocher tone and I'm going to apply 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.000
 with my fingers all over the mobile eyelid 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.399
 and as the base color I'm going to start 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.350
 Apply an orange matte shadow 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.140
 on foot and will apply it for all 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.270
 eyelid mobile equally we start with 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.550
 the intensity of color with a shadow 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.110
 also mate in this case brown we are going to 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.789
 start to apply it all over the eyelid 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.370
 mobile concentrating the intensity to the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.160
 external part and apply it only until the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.050
 limit of the banana blurs the cut and 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.910
 keep applying until you get the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.430
 intensity you want 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.920
 and I advise you to apply it at times to 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.229
 which controls the intensity and more 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.390
 product we delineate the unit 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.700
 lower tabs with the same product 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.210
 to create harmony and we give a touch of 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.210
 blurring 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.050
 to start creating the gradient now 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.610
 and with a brown tone but more clearly 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.670
 also more let's start 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.140
 apply it in the area of ​​the banana and a 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.170
 little the lower one for eyelashes to 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.480
 start creating this subtlety and with the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.280
 Same tone as applied 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.310
 previously the first one we are going to give the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.870
 final touch of blur to give a 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.610
 little bit of intensity this you can 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.550
 jump if you want with a black shadow 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.930
 mate in the outermost area of ​​the eye and what 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.670
 I'm going to blur well so it's not going to 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.460
 be very intense but it will give 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.619
 a small touch of intensity 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.150
 the next step is to apply a 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.340
 champagne shadow in this case yes it is 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.290
 Iridescent and applies in the area of 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.729
 tear and also in the area of ​​the arch 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.390
 of the eyebrow to give contrast and 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.390
 brightness 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.149
 to give intensity to the look I'm going to 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.880
 Apply a black pencil on the lines of 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.950
 upper and lower water 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.509
 this does not make the eye smaller because 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.670
 we have shadow all over the mobile eyelid 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.010
 and now it's just a little bit more 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.440
 intensity we fixed the tabs and 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.760
 we apply your favorite mask for 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.840
 superior people and also in the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.209
 lower lashes 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.410
 If you want, apply several layers or if 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.660
 dare to apply 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.489
 false eyelashes and now let's move on 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.739
 the special touch with the pigment is a 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.660
 golden copper pigment very beautiful and what 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.790
 let's apply on the outside of the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.440
 eyelid and we will blur it until the 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.730
 half of the mobile eyelid but the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.650
 intensity will stay in the part 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.049
 external you see that touch so beautiful is 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.090
 you can only jump if you want a smoked 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.760
 lighter but I think it will give a touch 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.390
 very special let's move to areas the 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.560
 eyebrows 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.849
 you can make them with the product that 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.750
 as always ye that ye us 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.700
 accustom and like it 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.770
 and let's move on to the face I'm going to 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.680
 start applying a prebase is 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.680
 Pretty good at summer time 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.430
 and directly the base I'm going to apply 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.880
 with a flat brush 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.400
 is the mineral base of mch 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.069
 do not forget the neck line the 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.109
 hair growth and so on 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.749
 as a proofreader I will apply a 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.430
 corrector with high coverage of the ix and what 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.989
 I'm going to use it to cover the dark circles and 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.049
 also to clean the external part 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.690
 of makeup to give it more polish and 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.420
 to cover some imperfection 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.370
 once we are perfect, it's our turn 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.260
 seal it up let's seal the face with 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.090
 a few translucent light powders 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.950
 and we return the heat the color to the face 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.400
 outlining for that I'm going to use our 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.280
 be in matte tone and I'm going to use them below 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.890
 of the cheekbones in the jaw and also 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.780
 in the temple 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.300
 Sometimes you are happy with this outline 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.340
 we started to color the cheekbones with 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.830
 a blush this time is intermingled 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.990
 between pink and orange very soft 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.240
 if we go back to the brush 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.950
 powder to blur and give your touch of 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.050
 lighting in this case I'm going to use a few 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.480
 lighting powders on top of 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.790
 cheekbones of the nose and lips 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.459
