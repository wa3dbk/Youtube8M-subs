00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.410
 the people come to bring you reviewed 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.179
 today a very good headset that my 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.910
 neighbor has a reservation for you guys 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.289
 bought these days microsoft x 3 mil 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.420
 How do we not have the box? 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.789
 A box is fine, I'll analyze it for you. 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.050
 and I will show the quality of the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.320
 his microphone 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.349
 well it is rubbery the top part 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.689
 so there's no way you were the one 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.730
 person that just a lot maybe will not 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.660
 To be very good to you, but I think 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.140
 will not disturb 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.090
 it covers your entire ear but if 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.160
 you play is too big I do not recommend 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.829
 which may be a bit uncomfortable 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.629
 but it is quite spacious on the inside despite 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.670
 not appear too much on the camera or 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.070
 Microphone is retractable 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.000
 same as the headset that I showed 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.800
 in another video then from you 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.440
 position as best as possible but 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.559
 here he is not one that bends a lot 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.870
 which means you have no chance of 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.119
 that brown matter you want and 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.850
 he comes in one way and comes with the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.860
 spain to avoid that 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.090
 cost if you talk too close know more 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.060
 for you who records 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.790
 or you want to record it is 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.150
 portrayed above as well as the others. 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.170
 most sites are but never show in 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.380
 Above him is eraser and eraser. 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.509
 Well resistant plastic so it's difficult 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.880
 you can relax and 77 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.100
 its audio is common stereo but you 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.450
 can a little card to emulate the 7.1 that 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.970
 It will be good too. 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.869
 his son is very sturdy does not break 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.450
 face 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.829
 one of his personal differentials is the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.740
 volume control 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.500
 here you can turn the volume you can 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.899
 increase or decrease and the light indicates 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.470
 when your headset is fined or not 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.020
 another difference of 77 is also that it 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.820
 it's usb quite resistant until here 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.829
 it seems that the business of the pilot's father 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.869
 and two that had this one is fine 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.090
 resistant too so if you have 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.090
 problem with the club in front or not 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.530
 will not be any problem for you or if 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.940
 you already have all the inputs 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.500
 common 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.350
 You may be using the usb. 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.280
 so then now we show a 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.050
 headset will test the microphone 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.840
 Good people, we're testing the 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.210
 microphone audio his microphone looks 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.700
 first impressions here that I have is 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.500
 excellent microphone does not have any 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.770
 I squealed in the background but I'm not realizing 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.200
 his audio is very clean and as for the 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.120
 loud speakers of a very strong bass and a 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.890
 and stereo speaker does not even have 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.030
 very sharp and only person who likes very much 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.250
 serious 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.130
 I recommend it is nothing that will leave 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.320
 to be deaf but it's not serious shot 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.630
 There are very sharp you listen so sharp 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.700
 as in other sets like my network 7 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.860
 for example from the past river but 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.420
 His microphone is very good, he wanted to have 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.430
 a very good sensitivity is not 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.920
 exaggerated or too small to be 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.590
 sensitivity as the voice gets clear 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.120
 I really liked his quality and it's 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.170
 This is what I came to bring to you. 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.450
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.580
 review was fast was not boxing like me 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.620
 I said because I did not have a box but that's it. 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.640
 there spoke any doubt the guys 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.200
 comments 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.140

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.140
