00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
deadlines and things like that but then

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.910 
deadlines and things like that but then
after<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.840> say<00:02:07.049> okay<00:02:07.380> well<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.890> next

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
after that you say okay well the next

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.219 
after that you say okay well the next
step<00:02:08.429> say<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.569> want<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.810> make<00:02:09.959> sure<00:02:09.989> that

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
step say and I want to make sure that

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.449 
step say and I want to make sure that
I'm<00:02:10.319> correlating<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:10.950> back<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.370> forth

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
I'm correlating this back and forth

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.040 
I'm correlating this back and forth
between<00:02:11.819> athletics<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.660> business

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
between athletics and business

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.960 
between athletics and business
is<00:02:13.110> because<00:02:13.440> it's<00:02:13.620> important<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.130> see<00:02:14.310> that

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
is because it's important to see that

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.970 
is because it's important to see that
the<00:02:15.480> peak<00:02:15.810> performers<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.620> people<00:02:16.860> that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
the peak performers and the people that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.890 
the peak performers and the people that
are<00:02:17.100> successful<00:02:17.250> are<00:02:17.850> just<00:02:18.330> going<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:18.780> the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
are successful are just going in the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.220 
are successful are just going in the
same<00:02:19.170> idea<00:02:19.770> so<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:21.210> get<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> point<00:02:21.540> right

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
same idea so you get to a point right

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.470 
same idea so you get to a point right
you<00:02:22.380> have<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.740> make<00:02:22.920> sure<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.250> measure<00:02:23.580> what's

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
you have to make sure you measure what's

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.940 
you have to make sure you measure what's
going<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:24.960> you<00:02:25.170> want<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.380> make<00:02:25.500> sure<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.680> what

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
going on you want to make sure that what

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.890 
going on you want to make sure that what

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
you're doing is giving you the right

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.540 
you're doing is giving you the right
results<00:02:28.350> along<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.740> way<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.920> meet<00:02:29.160> your<00:02:29.340> goals

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
and then I know I blame myself to a lot

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.550 
and then I know I blame myself to a lot
of<00:02:33.330> time<00:02:33.510> because<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.840> don't<00:02:34.020> do<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.320> enough

of time because I don't do that enough

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.500 
of time because I don't do that enough

these different things and sometimes you

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.920 
these different things and sometimes you
forget<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.340> say<00:02:38.550> hey<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.300> this<00:02:39.510> really

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
really understand is a variety because a

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.990

you get into doing something that gets a
little<00:03:20.100> boring<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.700> then<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:20.910> start<00:03:21.180> to

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
little boring and then you start to

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.620

because the more consistent you are with
doing<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.970> specific<00:03:45.720> task<00:03:45.900> your<00:03:46.560> results<00:03:46.980> are

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
doing a specific task your results are

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
doing a specific task your results are
going<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.250> be<00:03:47.340> indicative<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:48.060> that

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
going to be indicative of that

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.270 
going to be indicative of that
consistency<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.350> make<00:03:49.860> sure<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.160> you're

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
consistency so make sure that you're

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.610 
consistency so make sure that you're
measuring<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:50.940> because<00:03:51.300> I<00:03:51.540> know<00:03:51.989> we<00:03:52.230> all<00:03:52.260> get

measuring that because I know we all get

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
entrepreneurs and before you know it

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.350 
entrepreneurs and before you know it
what<00:03:56.550> you<00:03:56.670> thought<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.850> were<00:03:57.030> doing<00:03:57.120> eighty

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
what you thought you were doing eighty

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.550 
what you thought you were doing eighty
percent<00:03:57.480> at<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.780> time<00:03:57.959> now<00:03:58.170> you're<00:03:58.320> doing

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
percent at a time now you're doing

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.199 
percent at a time now you're doing
twenty<00:03:58.830> percent<00:03:59.070> at<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.250> time<00:03:59.459> so<00:04:00.000> make<00:04:00.180> sure

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
twenty percent at a time so make sure

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.000 
twenty percent at a time so make sure
you<00:04:00.420> understand<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:01.350> you're<00:04:01.470> putting<00:04:01.739> the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
you understand that you're putting the

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.650 
you understand that you're putting the
right<00:04:02.190> amount<00:04:02.489> of<00:04:02.550> time<00:04:02.790> into<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.180> goal<00:04:03.510> so

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
right amount of time into that goal so

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.640 
right amount of time into that goal so
you're<00:04:03.810> not<00:04:03.930> getting<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.380> end<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.590> the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
you're not getting to the end of the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.740 
you're not getting to the end of the
goal<00:04:04.830> saying<00:04:05.100> well<00:04:05.280> this<00:04:06.030> didn't<00:04:06.360> happen<00:04:06.510> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
goal saying well this didn't happen the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.210 
goal saying well this didn't happen the
way<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:06.870> thought<00:04:07.110> it<00:04:07.170> would<00:04:07.320> but<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:08.010> didn't

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
way I thought it would but you didn't

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.650 
way I thought it would but you didn't
realize<00:04:08.580> that<00:04:08.610> you<00:04:08.940> actually<00:04:09.120> didn't<00:04:09.450> give<00:04:09.540> it

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
realize that you actually didn't give it

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.070 
realize that you actually didn't give it
enough<00:04:09.720> time<00:04:09.870> either<00:04:10.820> pushing<00:04:11.820> yourself<00:04:12.420> to

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
enough time either pushing yourself to

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.080 
enough time either pushing yourself to
me<00:04:13.260> is<00:04:13.440> critical<00:04:14.070> because<00:04:14.580> that's<00:04:14.940> the

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
me is critical because that's the

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.970 
me is critical because that's the
stretch<00:04:15.390> part<00:04:15.720> that's<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.260> part<00:04:16.500> that<00:04:16.560> is

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
stretch part that's the part that is

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.740 
stretch part that's the part that is
telling<00:04:17.669> you<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.850> go<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:17.970> little<00:04:18.239> bit<00:04:18.450> further

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
telling you to go a little bit further

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.630 
telling you to go a little bit further
be<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.290> little<00:04:19.530> bit<00:04:19.680> more<00:04:19.859> engaged<00:04:20.280> in<00:04:20.489> what

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
be a little bit more engaged in what

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.180 
be a little bit more engaged in what
you're<00:04:20.790> doing<00:04:21.150> because<00:04:21.860> you<00:04:22.860> know<00:04:22.979> if<00:04:23.100> you

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
you're doing because you know if you

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.159 
you're doing because you know if you
just<00:04:23.220> it's<00:04:23.640> almost<00:04:23.850> like<00:04:24.060> weight<00:04:24.240> lifting<00:04:24.270> you

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
just it's almost like weight lifting you

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.540 
just it's almost like weight lifting you
know<00:04:25.289> if<00:04:25.500> you<00:04:25.620> just<00:04:25.650> sit<00:04:25.979> there<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.220> wait

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
know if you just sit there and wait

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.670 
know if you just sit there and wait
lift<00:04:26.819> the<00:04:26.909> same<00:04:27.150> weights<00:04:27.840> every<00:04:28.020> time<00:04:28.319> you

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
lift the same weights every time you

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.080 
lift the same weights every time you
don't<00:04:28.830> get<00:04:29.069> bigger<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.550> don't<00:04:29.699> get<00:04:29.909> more

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
don't get bigger you don't get more

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.550 
don't get bigger you don't get more
muscle<00:04:30.539> you<00:04:30.720> know<00:04:31.139> you're<00:04:31.319> pretty<00:04:31.440> much

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
muscle you know you're pretty much

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.320 
muscle you know you're pretty much
plateau<00:04:32.009> so<00:04:32.669> you<00:04:32.729> always<00:04:32.879> want<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.180> make<00:04:33.270> sure

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
plateau so you always want to make sure

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.909 
plateau so you always want to make sure
you're<00:04:33.599> pushing<00:04:33.930> yourself<00:04:34.020> in<00:04:34.379> all<00:04:34.530> areas<00:04:34.889> of

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
you're pushing yourself in all areas of

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.499 
you're pushing yourself in all areas of
business<00:04:35.129> especially<00:04:35.759> the<00:04:36.090> ones<00:04:36.240> that<00:04:36.389> you've

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
business especially the ones that you've

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.210 
business especially the ones that you've
really<00:04:36.810> focused<00:04:37.319> a<00:04:37.409> real<00:04:37.590> strategy<00:04:37.889> around

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
really focused a real strategy around

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.240 
really focused a real strategy around
and<00:04:38.669> then<00:04:39.150> self-evaluation<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.860> know<00:04:41.009> that's

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
and then self-evaluation you know that's

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.339 
and then self-evaluation you know that's
that's<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.639> critical<00:04:41.849> part<00:04:42.330> because<00:04:42.720> that's

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
that's the critical part because that's

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:44.960 
that's the critical part because that's
allowing<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:43.949> to<00:04:44.039> look<00:04:44.220> back<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.669> see

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
goal is a little bit unrealistic at the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.300 
goal is a little bit unrealistic at the
beginning<00:05:03.569> you<00:05:04.199> know<00:05:04.319> it<00:05:04.740> allows<00:05:04.979> you<00:05:05.099> to<00:05:05.190> kind
