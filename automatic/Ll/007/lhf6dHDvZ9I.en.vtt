company<00:02:17.599> is<00:02:17.750> there's<00:02:17.989> always<00:02:18.260> going<00:02:18.409> to<00:02:18.470> be

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
company is there's always going to be

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.440 
company is there's always going to be
some<00:02:19.010> brushes<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.579> might<00:02:19.760> not<00:02:19.909> quite<00:02:20.150> be<00:02:20.209> as

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
some brushes that might not quite be as

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.850 
some brushes that might not quite be as
perfect<00:02:20.629> as<00:02:20.989> others<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:21.439> you<00:02:21.500> want<00:02:21.769> to

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
perfect as others so you want to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.250 
perfect as others so you want to
literally<00:02:22.489> choose<00:02:23.060> your<00:02:23.329> own<00:02:23.360> brushes<00:02:23.900> so

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
literally choose your own brushes so

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.399 
literally choose your own brushes so
that<00:02:24.549> eliminates<00:02:25.549> mail<00:02:26.269> order<00:02:26.629> that's<00:02:27.200> my

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
that eliminates mail order that's my

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.560 
that eliminates mail order that's my
recommendation
