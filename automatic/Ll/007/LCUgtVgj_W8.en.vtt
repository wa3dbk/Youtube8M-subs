00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:15.540

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.029
 Long-awaited package from China to the seller 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.619
 of and appreciated her at 6 dollars although she 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.890
 was worth 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:28.560
 about a dollar 3 let's go right away 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.099
 I will discover that they are in non 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.350
 I want lenses lenses for 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:40.280
 tablet phones well for digital 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:43.670
 cameras and phones and tablets like this 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.480
 mean that here is the first one 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.170
 large lens 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.910
 the one I asked the most with 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.399
 so with such a lid metal 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.539
 rinzo 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.480
 let's see how it looks like 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:07.020
 fish again for all written on 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.119
 it is not visible 180 degrees foot and lens 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.380
 so it is written 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:18.530
 let's put a habit in here 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:23.700
 packed in a separate bag next 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.680
 this is all this with us too sheet only 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.380
 smaller with the same cap in 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.240
 a separate bag 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:37.170
 let's look at it here is direct lens 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.530
 it is smaller it is called macro close-up 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.530
 lens 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:50.649
 macro we shoot what is written here is this 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:57.719
 wide probably how wide she is 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:02:04.360
 The lens is probably so in this bag yet 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:06.039
 there are such metal rings 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.760
 they are mounted in front of the camera phone 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:16.200
 so that this higher lens could 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:21.610
 will stop the phone also here is 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.319
 small trinkets to most likely 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.010
 so that the lens can attach to them and 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.819
 can for example 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:34.810
 I wore to attach this fish-eye 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:40.799
 lens to watch you are not to watch your 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:44.470
 the keys are held up so well 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:49.510
 magnet on this one on this tape is very 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:53.430
 good let's see how to hold 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.430
 this is also very good 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.890
 the next 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:09.159
 so look to the end this bag on 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:12.319
 here is one little ring is now raise 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:15.040
 such a ring here and attach on paper 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.349
 prominent need to tear off and there is 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.230
 a small layer of glue and this glue can 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:26.180
 attach this ring 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:28.790
 the phone is also given a little 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:35.299
 instruction here 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:37.310
 hit hieroglyphs in chinese and instruction 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:42.379
 how to use this food lizuna in 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:46.430
 principle is very difficult to guess 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:51.340
 how do i use and last 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.340
 sachet talk about 4 sachets 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:04:02.799
 next sachets we still have 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.840
 so three little ring 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:09.230
 another lens holder and here 2 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.139
 lens two holder and how much we have 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.669
 four ringlets 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:16.789
 that while the packaging can say 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:19.340
 packed well enough in separate 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:25.699
 Sachets brought of course not very 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:27.410
 principle the only thing that can 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:31.430
 happen to these lenses if at 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:34.010
 carriage cracked this glass pull 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.979
 I think she seems pretty strong yet 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.970
 if you shake that lens the anger inside 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.970
 something staggers 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.470
 bow here is a bag with 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:50.560
 barcode can even be ordered 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.190
 Basically, here are these lenses for sale 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:58.560
 they cost about three dollars in 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:01.810
 Basically buying quite profitable and 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:10.300
 resale can sweat pretty well 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:13.270
 the price of these lenses now I will disconnect 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.550
 camera and check like these lenses 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.110
 work on the camera phone specially 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.410
 to show how it works 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.500
 this shake lens i got out on the balcony and 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:26.920
 I will try to show the phone 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:30.040
 so it will show a picture on 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:37.870
 his screen without a cache and a lens like this 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:43.120
 it does like this and now we try 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:46.320
 put the fish-eye lens here immediately visible 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.690
 that we better see the right window and 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:54.940
 viewing angles have also increased now 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:06:01.480
 the picture is slightly distorted rises 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:07.050
 the circle how will be how it has to taking pictures 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:11.580
 video principle 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.580
 It turns out quite an interesting look and 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:22.930
 the picture gets bigger though 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.590
 as she also does not lose and now I 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.270
 I will look 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.270
 smaller lens 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.290
 this is how the picture will look like 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.830
 more small screw principle too 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:44.230
 most just the corners are now just a little bit 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:50.280
 less and if you remove this lens is obtained 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:50.280
 like that yes firewood windows are not at all visible 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:58.080
 my verdict to these lenses is 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:07:02.340
 they do their minimum work 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.750
 for removing any specials 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.990
 photos with special effects they 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.940
 will fit 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:12.750
 buy only good thing all in all 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.750
 good bye
