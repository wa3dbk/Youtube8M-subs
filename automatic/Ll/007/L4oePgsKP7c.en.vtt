00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.049
 I think it's a good day today. It's a 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.699
 cake I learned with my voice we are 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.199

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.029
 traditionally with the condominiums in 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.359
 Jewish festivals will mainly find 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.460
 which recalls one year sweet gift Beni 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.910

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.040

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.040

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.510
 of yeast a teaspoon of 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.550
 baking soda half a cup 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.399
 you spend three eggs 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.800
 first I'll show you the baking soda and the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.590
 Yeast in flour is to help 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.989
 in the cake mix, right? 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.030
 very simple well book book do 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.580
 develop how to do everything on hand only 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.040
 basically mix the dry ones with a 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.210
 very easy and fast look is a 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.400
 delicious 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.850
 here I already have the games I'll start 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.840
 we mixed sugar that has brown sugar 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:21.020
 the common sugar and I 'll add the honey 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.020
 also 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.789
 until now already mixed the first part 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.329
 but the surprises will now add the 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.329
 oil 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.369
 and there it is already mixed 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.009
 It's very easy now, I'm just going to mix it up. 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:48.119
 the flours to cococal 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:51.090
 first a little flour and absolute 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.680
 also some tea black tea 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.110
 if you do not have black tea you can 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.220
 also use coffee use own water 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.590
 same 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.930
 if you want to make a cake in lavinia 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.090
 In this case, this one does not carry milk or 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.819
 none of this can add lens as well 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.539
 green black tea but I think black tea 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.539
 gives a special taste 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.489
 add some more flour 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.860
 I do not mix everything at once, but 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.440
 it may be that in the lot batch in little flour 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.290
 It's easier for you to mix 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.959
 a little he studied himself about food 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.610
 kosher you make food comes easy so 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.530
 I already studied is an area that interests me 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.319
 long before because it is part of our 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.769
 origin is as Jewish and as our whole 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.700
 culture has a lot of fun and I do 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:41.130
 I even attended wonderful kasher 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.410
 I'll add spaces last if 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.109
 you want it can also be nuts or 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:52.230
 any kind of almond that they have 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:54.180

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.620
 already preheated the oven to 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.799
 180 degrees 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.799
 just pour the batter into the shape 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:10.909
 this goes to the oven for about 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.609
 one hour 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:17.650
