 gonzalo rodriguez he trades with 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.330
 roncaglia romolo manages to earn a 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.220
 word between the remittances therefore a 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.660
 favor of naples from the pinewood that 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.610
 is beaten at this time with the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.130
 long pitch in the penalty area by tone 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.490
 be careful de de santis error and do 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.070
 net sensational duck of de santis that 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.369
 comes out on the ball 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.140
 it is completely in the midst of more tones 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.740
 size of Naples and the goalkeeper 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.140
 of host training succeeds in 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.029
 some way to disturb them de santis ma 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.829
 it is completely empty over a long time 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.660
 launch from the purple defense if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.800
 of roncaglia even no we follow the 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.460
 developments of this free kick 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.860
 talking cavani cavani penny pile 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.570
 goal in series for the matador who 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.269
 equalized the scores on the free kick 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.480
 of hamsik header that bends the 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.430
 hands in neto explode the francs other than 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.890
 5,000 are many more fans than 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.050
 naples 1 to 1 the score here in francs 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.250
 Cavani realizes his seventeenth 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.190
 league goal the penny in the series 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.020
 a cavani draws the accounts pure one among 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.840
 fairs of naples tones in the penalty area 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.180
 panic and then de santis in some 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.700
 so it goes from fooling away 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.680
 behrami on cuadrado and attention why 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.679
 here could be the second yellow card 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.840
 let's see what decides and arrives 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:23.730
 probably the second yellow we see 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.340
 a little since bergonzi put himself 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.800
 his hand in his pocket but now he is saying 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.720
 something to romolo then obviously 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.270
 has decided not to admonish behrami 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.000
 very questionable decision because if 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.080
 we follow what we saw in the first half 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.060
 first-half race conduct 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.100
 that too would have been a tag 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.390
 yellow and then second yellow and the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.090
 red for behrami that own 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.100
 intervened from behind to stop cuadrado 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.320
 it was absolutely yellow looks 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.690
 just don't discuss mazara else 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.190
 do it absolutely naive because you are 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.890
 already admonished and then will make a foul of the 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.810
 genre from behind this was red from the 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.030
 Naples remains in 11 but here is the error 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.530
 of bergonzoni on the left for the sign e 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.560
 cavani goes already take place in the area of 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.110
 rigor insignia the penalty area 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.700
 conclusion of the neto parade should 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.130
 save your door on this 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.140
 hiller's right was not powerful but 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.820
 placed with the right plate the ha 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.920
 looked for the farthest corner in black 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.050
 he dived to reject this 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.060
 conclusion to the 28th minute of 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.310
 second killer time for hamsik the 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.260
 hamsik tunnel then attacks borja valero 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.970
 serves again ball for hiller 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.890
 widen the game to the left for zuniga 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.050
 short side of the penalty area the feint 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.910
 of zuniga dancing and cross in the pile 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.740
 stands the ball away from the head 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.690
 you will know cephalone regained however by 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.510
 britos enters hybrid penalty area if 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.030
 widens it goes to the cross inside the parade 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.519
 miraculous by the neto that it takes away 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.890
 a goal made by Pandev that he had in his head 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.330
 crushed the ball that seemed 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.459
 now destined for the bottom of the bag 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.709
 they also had the result of things of the 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.380
 Naples was convinced of the goal but there was 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.180
 the neto opposition he managed to 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.160
 tussle the ball that has passed 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.320
 over the head of cavani that for 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.209
 very little does not know failed to 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.250
 then back on the net to score 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.920
 napoli borja valero right for 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.230
 cuadrado can go to cross attention 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.760
 liike with the right ball inside e 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.590
 touches the winning goal la 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.470
 Florentine with this ball that 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.660
 it seemed harmless jovetic and hit him 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.060
 ball inside the penalty area no one there 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.010
 no one has swept it away from 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.660
 fact that he danced the ball in front 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.940
 to the goal line before finishing 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.560
 outside touching the pole with de santis 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.900
 at the last moment he looked at it like a 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.730
 to say I didn't expect it so dangerous 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.709
 this ball is here it went well 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.470
 yes they had not said de santis 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.030
 only five seconds at the end of the 4 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.410
 millions will take care of us 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.180
 the last attention exchange exchange 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.209
 inside for L'Aquila the conclusion 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.709
 and wastes an incredible goal ball there 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.469
 Florentine right at the ninety-fourth 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.000
 with Aquila who remains on the ground 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:55.670
 all in the heart of the penalty area 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.709
 desperate for this wasted chance 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.200
 right at the very last second of 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.299
 recovery ball goal for the Florentine with 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.439
 aquilani was not very sensational in the 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.180
 sense that he was not alone in front of 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.310
 but goalkeeper for a player from 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.659
 features like Aquila was one 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.939
 gold ball on the edge of the area of 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.829
 rigor after the excellent work of cuadrado 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.629
 Aquila went to the conclusion but 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.139
 raised the ball too much by sending it 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.139
 over the crossbar
