00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Then I'll start my business here. 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.060
 first youtube channel video with 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.529
 background birds but that's ok 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.349
 the first will explain how 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.179
 the mechanics of the mechanical drive works 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.139
 Axes many people here me 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.820
 question 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.020
 first I'll explain in theory later 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.270
 a practice 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.820
 basically the interval between the attack 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.640
 Dodo and come out to get at least or 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.420
 hero in the team is beating - environment 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.170
 It's time for you to click the mouse 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.870
 example 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.910
 I'm going to hit the clip on the clip 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.899
 ax get in the clip I created for 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.300
 low 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.969
 I sent told me to go up money 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.020
 to the right way to the left 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.629
 direction you want 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.969
 Ederson was down and I'm going to attack the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.190
 clip and send right 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.480
 ax was on the right the score the clip 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.960
 turn left 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.840
 ax that 's left up to 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.960
 under the mechanics is purely that is well 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.520
 a very simple mechanic you catch obvious 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.409
 that you will not be able to at first 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.580
 second drive to dominate her 100 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.840
 but in practice it is 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.270
 very quiet 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.979
 another thing the guys are pretty simple 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.130
 but the crew does not know the new passive 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.470
 good drive or basically every time 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.409
 that you take an ax or kill a 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.890
 clip you get a stack next to 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.909
 there I have 69 every highlight is worth3 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.240
 of gold you kill an enemy one 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.060
 chip an enemy details of these tex you 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.329
 will win in neuro that has 100 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.990
 esthetics 50 and tex you'll get 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.329
 You're a good nut, you 're a nerd. 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.350
 nef in it but not continuous ceases to be 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.009
 bad 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.100
 every time you activate your w 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.649
 and take an ax the wow of the reserve w 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.250
 so basically the compadre comes and 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.189
 I get ax to pray active w I get ax 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.189
 active w caught ax is the maximum that is 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.099
 can have to stay ax 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.899
 spinning in your hand two sound just not 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.280
 ran hit no crime or no 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.760
 enemy of the axes will fall from your hand 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.160
 basically the mechanics of noah and if not 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.959
 There's no mystery, it's the question. 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.170
 In fact, you used to practice 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.510
 practicing at the beginning will have difficulty 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.540
 for example to be able to maintain the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.580
 two axes during one had a fait 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.670
 but it's not even quiet 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.890
 it's just a matter of good practice 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.800
 there was some doubt as to how 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.600
 to use an ax that is very simple is only 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.700
 like I said it's just you send it to 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.310
 direction you want it will fall 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.709
 something I did not explain and if you have 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.890
 stopped walking leaves showing others 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.959
 here you have stopped and attack 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.690
 he has a chance to fall on top of 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.690
 Are you the ax as it is falling now or 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.709
 fall away as it fell 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:06.950
 it's a half chance half to half 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.720
 but the ideal of driving the same law n 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.380
 Are you talking there, always stay? 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.940
 moving by letting your mash 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.840
 think if you get the ax more 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.930
 need 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.299
 You stand there, bumping ax axes 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.030
 to the side is risky 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.370
 basically that's what they've been 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.410
 some doubt and how the 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.030
 understand the right only put in the 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.530
 comments there that I will explain 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.530
 new good thanks, guys
