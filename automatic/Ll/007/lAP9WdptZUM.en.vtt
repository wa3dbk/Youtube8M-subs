with this I open my bottle about 20-30

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.000 
with this I open my bottle about 20-30
minutes<00:02:37.810> prior<00:02:38.049> so<00:02:38.379> that<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.620> wouldn't<00:02:38.769> pull

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
minutes prior so that it wouldn't pull

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.319 
minutes prior so that it wouldn't pull
them<00:02:39.099> up<00:02:39.189> quite<00:02:39.430> as<00:02:39.579> much<00:02:39.730> but<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.180> still

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329
