00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.110
 Hello guys 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.450
 today a review on the jackson machine and the 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.340
 youtube fast at the sky 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.590
 I'll even leave his channel link. 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.539
 here if you would like to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.059
 my work from him 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.330
 He consulted with me to 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.030
 buy a gamer machine that his does not 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.460
 was very good only with the budget that 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.120
 he was available it was not so good 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.559
 like this 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 I asked him to pass me the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.719
 machine information he had there 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.260
 me analyze what led to 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.500
 enjoy and surprise my aunt 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.640
 a lot of good things in his machine that gave 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.149
 to enjoy 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.489
 with that we made the budget of less than 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.550
 two thousand and five hundred reais and we 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.850
 a very good gamer machine taking advantage of 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.320
 the right pieces of it gave an improvement in 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.470
 some things 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.649
 I made one until I changed some pieces with it 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.950
 to help him set up the machine better 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.740
 right I'll show the machine for you 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.439
 but add and also some photos 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.270
 during assembly of the machine 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.520
 At the end of the video, let's go to the details 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.860
 initially this case has the buttons 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.100
 it and usb ports 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.710
 on the left side of here I got 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.710
 inverted side because that's where the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.979
 Cabinet is going to stay, it's better for him to be 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.329
 This right side I managed to change it here. 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.479
 on top of the cabinet it has the filter that 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.990
 can be removable where I put two 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.840
 Cullers up here right 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.270
 the machine is well differentiated this 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.409
 The cabinet has a way of 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.750
 design 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.519
 quite different from a little work 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.370
 to work out how to cool it 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.370
 better but the result that I got 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.579
 It was very interesting of course that 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.489
 varies from machine to machine right 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:26.579
 his cap is very strong 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.200
 you to involve in the channel the review is 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.879
 that I made this cabinet 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.760
 a kind of boxing sure you notice that 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:39.000
 this cabinet it has support for hds 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.610
 deep in it but I changed I took it 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.910
 How are you going to see the picture that's there? 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.150
 I took it to put hd on the bottom and 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:52.130
 I put a 200mm cooler in the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.959
 bottom but 2 spoons here on the ceiling where 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:59.400
 140 here in the background that was initially 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:03.450
 I had 120 and I set up the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.569
 very organized way you can see 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.349
 which cabling is equal to HD tac 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:13.530
 support for one more hd and another 2 to 3 s 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.260
 that the next big will be 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.049
 used cables as usual 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:24.150
 fully organized as you can. 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:27.120
 see right all posted very good is good 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.000
 organized the way I do with nothing 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.450
 loose or swinging is a little 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.269
 complicated to see that because 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.100
 hds is in the front is a 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.190
 differential of this cabinet 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.590
 I really liked him with that aspect and 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.340
 here the machine is not mounted 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.920
 I know if you can see his source there. 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.549
 is mounted here in front of the cabinet 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.190
 but it has a system that passes here is 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.799
 how can you see the connection 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.680
 deep cabinet 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.709
 sure it 's as system as lid 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.959
 that comes from underneath it 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.560
 case of him as we are with courses of 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.470
 200 it will not be necessary to use 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.859
 sure but the most interesting is that 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.400
 machine that turned out great is to show 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:24.349
 for you take the filter up here 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.349
 for you to see how cool it was 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:33.960
 up here 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:37.440
 sure the filter is here well done 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:41.350
 and it only comes with it it is simple to be 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.240
 removed is that you think this key here 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.030
 so it was a project that gave a 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.280
 little work to do with sight 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.550
 difference as you can see the 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.560
 motherboard is upside down from the 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.650
 video card is up instead of 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.260
 stay down but I was surprised 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.320
 with the result that I got from 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.070
 this machine as much as possible. 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.440
 good 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:11.980
 Even the machine does not heat up and such 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:14.250
 here until you put this shaq there he 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.930
 You have the support here in this lock 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.330
 learn the caps she does not stay 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.880
 screwed it is caught by the bracket 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.330
 here is very well done the mind that 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.240
 the guide pins here very well elaborated 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.460
 I really liked this case and it's a 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.840
 equipment that does not take up so much space 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.810
 on the table 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.020
 He is very handsome well this lusa that he 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.200
 follow this mac pro pro model 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.560
 apple is the old mac pro that is well 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.230
 differentiated that is rubbery that has 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.900
 plastic finish is very beautiful and 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.700
 is well differentiated even this 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.060
 right cabinet 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.280
 the most interesting thing about this project 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.880
 we have taken advantage of both parts 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.340
 His hand was gone several pieces that gave 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.650
 to take advantage of to assemble the machine 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:10.480
 now you are excellent ready to shoot 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:12.490
 gta5 so it is anyone who has interest until 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.100
 upgrade this way 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.940
 we practically changed the whole machine 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:21.160
 or buy the new machine or improve the 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.230
 via honest software is just to get into 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.770
 contact and media here in the 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:29.020
 video what I am here for but bh 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.720
 provided the whole of Brazil as a case of 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.960
 jackson who is from santa catarina 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.590
 Okay then a big hug and until the 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.590
 next video 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.180
 Hmm 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:12.770
 Thank you for persisting in having to like 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:12.770
 There was a cup and there was
