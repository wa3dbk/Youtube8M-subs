00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
androids and this is my audio test of

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.519 
androids and this is my audio test of
the<00:00:13.139> rode<00:00:13.519> ntg-2<00:00:14.839> condenser<00:00:15.839> microphone<00:00:16.350> and

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
the rode ntg-2 condenser microphone and

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.529 
the rode ntg-2 condenser microphone and
this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> broadcast<00:00:17.430> quality<00:00:17.699> microphone

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
this is a broadcast quality microphone

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.510 
this is a broadcast quality microphone
that<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.109> unboxed<00:00:19.680> on<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> channel<00:00:20.250> about<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
that I unboxed on the channel about a

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.370 
that I unboxed on the channel about a
week<00:00:20.789> or<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.029> ago<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.050> what<00:00:22.260> the

the audio you're hearing is actually

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.319 
the audio you're hearing is actually
from<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.320> ntg-2<00:00:46.320> now<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.280> connects<00:00:47.610> via<00:00:47.789> XLR

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
from the ntg-2 now it connects via XLR

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.090 
from the ntg-2 now it connects via XLR
we've<00:00:48.570> got<00:00:48.690> an<00:00:48.750> XLR<00:00:49.140> connection<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
we've got an XLR connection there and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.189 
we've got an XLR connection there and
I've<00:00:50.460> got<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.760> connected<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.539> Canon<00:00:51.870> XF

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
I've got it connected to the Canon XF

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.569 
I've got it connected to the Canon XF
100<00:00:52.920> by<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.340> 1<00:00:53.670> meter<00:00:53.940> long<00:00:54.829> high-quality<00:00:55.829> XLR

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.150 
100 by a 1 meter long high-quality XLR
cable<00:00:57.030> I'm<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.050> switch<00:00:58.320> over<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
cable I'm going to switch over to the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.310 
cable I'm going to switch over to the
internal<00:00:59.850> microphones<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.930> Callanetics

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
internal microphones on the Callanetics

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.969 
internal microphones on the Callanetics
f100<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.250> now<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.409> what<00:01:04.409> you're<00:01:04.559> hearing<00:01:04.830> now

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
f100 and now and what you're hearing now

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.910 
f100 and now and what you're hearing now
is<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:06.119> audio<00:01:06.510> quality<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.170> built-in

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
is the audio quality of the built-in

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.370 
is the audio quality of the built-in
microphones<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.479> hopefully<00:01:10.020> you'll<00:01:10.229> hear

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
microphones so hopefully you'll hear

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.320 
microphones so hopefully you'll hear
quite<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> lot<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.040> difference<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.820> built-in

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
quite a lot of difference the built-in

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.000 
quite a lot of difference the built-in
microphones<00:01:12.869> are<00:01:13.020> still<00:01:13.229> very<00:01:13.409> good<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
microphones are still very good on the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.429 
microphones are still very good on the
Canon<00:01:14.340> XF<00:01:14.700> 100<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.810> they<00:01:15.900> don't<00:01:16.080> offer<00:01:16.229> up

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
Canon XF 100 but they don't offer up

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.950 
Canon XF 100 but they don't offer up
anywhere<00:01:16.979> near<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.729> amount<00:01:17.970> or<00:01:18.240> frequency

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
anywhere near the amount or frequency

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.469 
anywhere near the amount or frequency
response<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.280> tonal<00:01:20.759> qualities<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
response and the tonal qualities that

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.280 
response and the tonal qualities that
the<00:01:21.770> ntg-2<00:01:22.770> offers<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.330> now<00:01:24.600> I'll<00:01:24.780> switch<00:01:24.930> back

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
the ntg-2 offers so now I'll switch back

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.609 
the ntg-2 offers so now I'll switch back
to<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:26.240> ntg-2<00:01:27.270> I'm<00:01:27.540> sure<00:01:28.049> you'll<00:01:28.229> agree<00:01:28.380> it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
to the ntg-2 I'm sure you'll agree it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.980 
to the ntg-2 I'm sure you'll agree it
makes<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.070> big<00:01:29.610> difference<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.689> audio

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
makes a big difference to the audio

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.130 
makes a big difference to the audio
quality<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.740> don't<00:01:32.159> forget<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> Canon<00:01:33.150> XF<00:01:33.479> 100

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
quality I don't forget the Canon XF 100

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.499 
quality I don't forget the Canon XF 100
is<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> very<00:01:34.740> expensive<00:01:35.070> unit<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
is a very expensive unit so the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.710 
is a very expensive unit so the
microphones<00:01:37.170> inside<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:38.040> XF<00:01:38.400> 100<00:01:39.030> are<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.630> a

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
microphones inside the XF 100 are of a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.780 
microphones inside the XF 100 are of a
higher<00:01:39.960> quality<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.770> normally<00:01:41.369> get<00:01:41.549> and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
higher quality that you normally get and

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.380 
higher quality that you normally get and
a<00:01:42.090> consumer<00:01:42.570> level<00:01:42.899> camera<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:44.399> being<00:01:45.180> an

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
a consumer level camera but being an

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.899 
a consumer level camera but being an
external<00:01:45.899> microphone<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.590> rode<00:01:46.770> ntg-2<00:01:47.520> is

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
external microphone the rode ntg-2 is

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.630 
external microphone the rode ntg-2 is
very<00:01:48.360> versatile<00:01:49.049> now<00:01:49.380> I've<00:01:49.829> got<00:01:50.100> two<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.520> my

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
very versatile now I've got two in my

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.179 
very versatile now I've got two in my
setup<00:01:50.909> ones<00:01:51.689> mounted<00:01:52.229> as<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> shotgun<00:01:52.950> type

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
setup ones mounted as a shotgun type

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.310 
setup ones mounted as a shotgun type
microphone<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:53.939> top<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> camera<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.930> then

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
microphone on top of the camera and then

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200 
microphone on top of the camera and then
this<00:01:55.560> one<00:01:55.799> I'm<00:01:56.219> going<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.490> using<00:01:56.670> handheld

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
this one I'm going to be using handheld

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.480 
this one I'm going to be using handheld
on<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.630> longer<00:01:57.990> cable<00:01:58.170> or<00:01:58.710> possibly<00:01:59.250> even

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
on a longer cable or possibly even

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.690 
on a longer cable or possibly even
adding<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.360> wireless<00:02:01.049> connection<00:02:02.009> kit<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.579> this

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
adding a wireless connection kit to this

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.149 
adding a wireless connection kit to this
so<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:02.969> can<00:02:03.119> actually<00:02:03.270> use<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.810> wirelessly<00:02:04.350> so

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159
