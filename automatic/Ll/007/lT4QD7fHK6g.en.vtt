00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
fish right so the first thing I have is

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.160 
fish right so the first thing I have is
a<00:00:07.890> gallon<00:00:08.519> jug<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.849> water<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.870> just<00:00:10.019> bought

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
a gallon jug of water that I just bought

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.020 
a gallon jug of water that I just bought
distilled<00:00:10.590> water<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:11.040> but<00:00:11.309> now<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.429> fill<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:11.880> up

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
distilled water in but now I fill it up

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.839 
distilled water in but now I fill it up
with<00:00:12.840> tap<00:00:13.230> water<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.620> gallon<00:00:14.040> at<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> time<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.670> I

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
with tap water a gallon at a time and I

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.090 
with tap water a gallon at a time and I
distill<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.719> then<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.470> just<00:00:16.500> leave<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:16.920> out

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
distill it and then I just leave it out

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.250 
distill it and then I just leave it out
so<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.550> can<00:00:17.730> come<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.240> room<00:00:18.390> temperature<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:19.199> I

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
so it can come to room temperature so I

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.840 
so it can come to room temperature so I
can<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:19.500> add<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.859> teeny<00:00:20.070> bit<00:00:20.220> at<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> time<00:00:20.430> as

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
can just add it a teeny bit at a time as

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.750 
can just add it a teeny bit at a time as
needed<00:00:21.500> that<00:00:22.500> brings<00:00:22.710> me<00:00:22.920> on<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.100> my<00:00:23.490> water

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
needed that brings me on to my water

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.089 
needed that brings me on to my water
conditioner<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.600> use<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> basic<00:00:25.740> water

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
conditioner I use a basic water

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.060 
conditioner I use a basic water
conditioner<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.720> gives<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
conditioner and it gives you the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.220 
conditioner and it gives you the
directions<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.910> distill<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.599> again<00:00:30.779> at<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> time

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
directions to distill it again at a time

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.920 
directions to distill it again at a time
hence<00:00:31.740> why<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:31.980> actually<00:00:32.669> just<00:00:33.450> do<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.809> way

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
hence why I actually just do it that way

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.619 
hence why I actually just do it that way
so<00:00:34.910> then<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.210> go<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.739> food<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.360> tank

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
so then I go on to food so in the tank

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.920 
so then I go on to food so in the tank
