00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:02.880
 HF 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.250
 for attention wrestling with the bavarian-bossen 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.940
 again from where it has developed concretely that's it 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.280
 remarkably a fatal mistake lonely decision has been made but 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.369
 disputed Claus a goalkeeper change 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.839
 when he made Thomas Kraft number 1 and this boy 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.380
 inexperienced goalkeepers 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.119
 there then makes the mistake 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.269
 the reward of Kral 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:26.369
 ultimately the job 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.979
 costs in Nuremberg this bad dropouts and then 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:34.719
 of course also sensational goal of Eigler result Bayern only fourth 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.899
 Season goal Qualification for the Champions League is in acute danger 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.740
 Luckily, last year, I happened 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.250
 Live from the Kempinski Airport percent b with a better start ever said 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.780
 but one or the other is gone 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.470
 that's why it's time for a fanfare until late 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.170
 at the FC Bayern Munich have been released in Cochem current pictures 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.340
 get the World Cup now again did not want to show itself 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.480
 Andries Jonker has been the Kotrainer so far 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.360
 Farfan r is supposed to have the last five games as boss 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.660
 Teachers and Hermann Gerland the tiger will go assist and 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.900
 Dr 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.650
 the last of the four years and now it's often 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.479
 or it was too often relief at level 5 1 at a press conference 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.790
 I see a huge problem in it 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.550
 that we have been since Christmas 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.810
 in the previously no excuse 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.140
 there was no reaffirmation of WM preparation more than the reason is all the players were 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.000
 fit 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.700
 Since in clothes percent Tomato to take the hat out of the gate went the shit 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.540
 go on the tour 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.760
 the board, as I know, has pointed to this problem 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.190
 and he did it anyway 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.300
 and yesterday's day 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.320
 was the end of a chain 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.770
 that's why the board had to 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.010
 react 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.139
 you can not look at this anymore 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.129
 and that's why it's a 100% right decision 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.909
 been 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.579
 It was not just a problem making it a mistake to do that 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.629
 There is also a restlessness in the whole affair 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.879
 and especially that Tempelhof 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.879
 Manuel would never have rocked this new 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.159
 we would never have had a problem in the south curve so we got it 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.249
 Problems made the Cheerful Phonetics Gay was the whole club 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.489
 totally confused 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.860
 that should be five ill one thinks because he is right on this 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:39.819
 problem 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.619
 from the entire board and from Christian Nerlinger I know that he is going 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:46.619
 In Qatar, it has pointed this out very closely 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.790
 Having learned from this, he has really intensified our advice on this topic 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.419
 note not accepted 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:57.799
 the day before yesterday 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.799
 was the barrel that ran so there is an objection 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.339
 the group goes to the well until it breaks 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:05.999
 Viersen to break 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:10.459
 One thing is to say success is something but fun is the other and the one 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.809
 Fun has been missing in this club for a long time 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.299
 not only with us but also with the players 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.209
 and that the players stood behind him that's a fairytale 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.269
 so far is a dazzling personality 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.260
 But this turned it into knowing that there was never a show for the 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.589
 Correctness of the problem is 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:29.349
 but it is too inaccurate 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.439
 and that although Werder Bremen and Bayern are very similar to Felix 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.779
 Magath where we say now we have very well 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:38.809
 Did you know that we need to get that topic back into the team 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:42.249
 in Persona Non grata open Holland who know exactly what they are here 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:44.119
 said out of place 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:48.109
 we finally asked BASF you get then from fanfare 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.109
 the stairwell witnessed the milk country 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:52.619
