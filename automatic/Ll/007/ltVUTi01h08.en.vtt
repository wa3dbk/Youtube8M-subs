I<00:00:00.500> was<00:00:01.500> maximum<00:00:01.800> galaxy<00:00:02.220> s4<00:00:02.580> root<00:00:02.760> com<00:00:03.240> let<00:00:04.230> me

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
I was maximum galaxy s4 root com let me

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.019 
I was maximum galaxy s4 root com let me
show<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.770> some<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.250> cases<00:00:05.520> I've<00:00:05.910> been

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
show you some of the cases I've been

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.550 
show you some of the cases I've been
using<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.629> lot<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:07.020> people<00:00:07.319> have<00:00:07.410> been<00:00:07.470> asking

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
using a lot of people have been asking

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.980 
using a lot of people have been asking
me<00:00:08.130> um<00:00:08.820> so<00:00:08.929> this<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.830> galaxy<00:00:11.490> s4<00:00:11.940> TPU<00:00:12.690> case

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
me um so this is the galaxy s4 TPU case

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.700 
me um so this is the galaxy s4 TPU case
from<00:00:13.290> cruzerlite<00:00:14.900> they<00:00:15.900> have<00:00:16.199> several

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
from cruzerlite they have several

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.599 
from cruzerlite they have several
different<00:00:18.470> different<00:00:19.470> designs<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.279> think

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
different different designs and I think

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.500 
different different designs and I think
this<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.060> called<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.600> buck<00:00:22.020> circuit<00:00:22.910> and<00:00:23.910> let

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
this is called the buck circuit and let

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.970 
this is called the buck circuit and let
me<00:00:24.570> go<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.810> show<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.380> think<00:00:25.710> that's<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
me go and show you I think that's the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.919 
me go and show you I think that's the
Android<00:00:26.460> army<00:00:27.050> I<00:00:28.050> did<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.859> video<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.929> doing

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
Android army I did have a video on doing

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.160 
Android army I did have a video on doing
a<00:00:30.990> drop<00:00:31.230> test<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.040> case<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:33.050> you<00:00:34.050> know

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
a drop test with the case and you know

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.959 
a drop test with the case and you know
what<00:00:34.320> these<00:00:34.469> cases<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:35.070> awesome<00:00:35.760> because

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
what these cases are awesome because

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.540 
what these cases are awesome because
they<00:00:36.360> protect<00:00:36.750> your<00:00:36.899> home<00:00:37.050> phone<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.649> stays<00:00:38.309> on

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
they protect your home phone I stays on

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.639 
they protect your home phone I stays on
when<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.820> drop<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.360> there's<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.899> very<00:00:40.350> very

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
when you drop it there's a very very

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.430 
when you drop it there's a very very
nice<00:00:40.950> lip<00:00:41.370> as<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.730> can<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:42.090> here<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:43.020> got<00:00:43.230> all

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
nice lip as you can see here you got all

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.250 
nice lip as you can see here you got all
the<00:00:43.739> cut<00:00:43.980> holes<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:44.579> perfectly<00:00:45.360> if<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.960> put<00:00:46.140> it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the cut holes up perfectly if you put it

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.470 
the cut holes up perfectly if you put it
on<00:00:46.350> correctly<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.100> when<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.910> first<00:00:48.210> receive

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
on correctly and when you first receive

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.959 
on correctly and when you first receive
these<00:00:48.930> cases<00:00:49.440> they<00:00:49.649> might<00:00:49.860> actually<00:00:50.039> not<00:00:50.430> fit

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
these cases they might actually not fit

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.080 
these cases they might actually not fit
all<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.170> way<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.070> use<00:00:53.309> use<00:00:53.670> them<00:00:53.850> um

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
all the way but as use use them um

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.560 
all the way but as use use them um
they'll<00:00:54.690> actually<00:00:54.989> conform<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:57.360> lip

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
they'll actually conform and the lip

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.369 
they'll actually conform and the lip
will<00:00:57.930> start<00:00:58.699> pushing<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.850> little<00:00:59.879> bit<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:01.140> is

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
will start pushing in a little bit so is

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.049 
will start pushing in a little bit so is
it<00:01:01.530> definitely<00:01:01.649> nice<00:01:02.010> case<00:01:02.250> think<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.940> is

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
it definitely nice case think of is

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.579 
it definitely nice case think of is
getting<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> glove<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.170> know<00:01:04.260> at<00:01:04.379> first

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
getting like a glove you know at first

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.800 
getting like a glove you know at first
it's<00:01:04.860> not<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> fit<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.580> well<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
it's not going to fit that well but the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.929 
it's not going to fit that well but the
more<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.110> use<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.830> know<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.220> gonna<00:01:08.430> fit

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
more you use it you know it's gonna fit

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.210 
more you use it you know it's gonna fit
really<00:01:09.240> well<00:01:09.350> but<00:01:10.350> you've<00:01:10.500> got<00:01:10.680> all<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> holes

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
really well but you've got all the holes

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.929 
really well but you've got all the holes
for<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.990> this<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:14.130> case<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.610> really

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
for it and this is the case I really

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.240 
for it and this is the case I really
like<00:01:15.119> because<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:16.020> put<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.530> first<00:01:16.890> thing<00:01:17.130> is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
like because it put the first thing is

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.280 
like because it put the first thing is
it<00:01:17.400> has<00:01:17.549> big<00:01:17.970> enough<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.330> lip<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> it'll

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
it has big enough a lip and it'll

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.940 
it has big enough a lip and it'll
protect<00:01:19.560> your<00:01:20.450> screen<00:01:21.450> even<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:22.500> 10<00:01:22.740> foot

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
protect your screen even with 10 foot

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.980 
protect your screen even with 10 foot

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the bumper case it's not going to

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.310 
the bumper case it's not going to
protect<00:01:42.840> your<00:01:42.990> phone<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.560> well<00:01:44.070> these<00:01:44.610> um
