curriculum 2.0 is aimed at really
preparing<00:00:03.360> students<00:00:03.899> for<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.170> future<00:00:04.350> of

preparing students for the future of
healthcare<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.130> biomedical<00:00:05.520> science<00:00:06.029> which

healthcare and biomedical science which

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.089 
healthcare and biomedical science which
is<00:00:06.450> dramatically<00:00:07.259> different<00:00:07.379> than<00:00:07.799> what

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
is dramatically different than what

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.330 
is dramatically different than what
we've<00:00:08.309> experienced<00:00:09.059> in<00:00:09.210> our<00:00:09.840> lifetimes

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
we've experienced in our lifetimes

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.539 
we've experienced in our lifetimes
people<00:00:11.340> ask<00:00:11.580> us<00:00:11.880> if<00:00:12.469> it's<00:00:13.469> perfect<00:00:13.950> why<00:00:14.250> change

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
people ask us if it's perfect why change

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.040 
people ask us if it's perfect why change
it<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:16.160> the<00:00:17.160> truth<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.660> first<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.810> all<00:00:18.869> it's

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
it and the truth is first of all it's

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.990 
it and the truth is first of all it's
not<00:00:19.170> perfect<00:00:19.680> we<00:00:19.980> know<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> lot<00:00:20.460> more<00:00:20.609> about<00:00:20.670> how

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
not perfect we know a lot more about how

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.910 
not perfect we know a lot more about how
people<00:00:21.359> learn<00:00:21.390> than<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.050> did<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.410> hundred<00:00:22.740> years

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
people learn than we did a hundred years

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.189 
people learn than we did a hundred years
ago<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:24.060> know<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.630> when<00:00:24.779> people

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
ago and what we know is that when people

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.210 
ago and what we know is that when people
learn<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.769> context<00:00:26.519> when<00:00:26.939> they<00:00:27.090> learn<00:00:27.359> about

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
learn in context when they learn about

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.250 
learn in context when they learn about
the<00:00:29.220> anatomy<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.000> brain<00:00:30.150> while<00:00:31.050> they're

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
time and they remember it permanently as

we've<00:00:45.270> developed<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.809> curriculum<00:00:46.140> 2.0<00:00:46.890> is

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
we've developed for curriculum 2.0 is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.130 
we've developed for curriculum 2.0 is
that<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:47.520> not<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.300> sequence<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.870> courses

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
that it's not just a sequence of courses

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.010 
that it's not just a sequence of courses
it's<00:00:49.680> actually<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> system<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.120> learning<00:00:51.329> so

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
it's actually a system of learning so

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.560 
it's actually a system of learning so
instead<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.800> just<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.309> linear<00:00:53.670> again<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> linear

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
instead of just a linear again a linear

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.720 
instead of just a linear again a linear
course<00:00:55.050> where<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.530> take<00:00:55.739> one<00:00:56.070> course<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
course where you take one course the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.970 
course where you take one course the
next<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> next<00:00:57.480> next<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.739> all

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
next the next next and it's all

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.150 
next the next next and it's all
prescribed<00:00:59.460> throughout<00:01:00.059> four<00:01:00.570> years<00:01:01.160> it's

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
prescribed throughout four years it's

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.060 
prescribed throughout four years it's
really<00:01:02.420> how<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.809> done<00:01:04.049> what<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.650> want

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
really how have you done what you want

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.300 
really how have you done what you want
to<00:01:05.189> do<00:01:05.450> where<00:01:06.450> do<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.990> need<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.350> go<00:01:07.500> next<00:01:07.799> based

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
to do where do you need to go next based

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.710 
to do where do you need to go next based
on<00:01:08.640> how<00:01:09.000> you're<00:01:09.659> developing<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:11.390> took<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> blue

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
on how you're developing I took the blue

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.929 
on how you're developing I took the blue
pill<00:01:12.990> pretty<00:01:13.320> early<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.369> said<00:01:14.549> wow<00:01:14.700> this

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
pill pretty early and I said wow this

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.390 
pill pretty early and I said wow this
this<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.689> exactly<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:16.680> all<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.130> learning

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
this is exactly what all of the learning

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.910 
this is exactly what all of the learning
Sciences<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:18.000> taught<00:01:18.210> us<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.229> exactly

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
Sciences have taught us this is exactly

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.370 
Sciences have taught us this is exactly
what<00:01:20.159> all<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.880> other<00:01:20.990> education<00:01:21.990> experts

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
what all of the other education experts

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.749 
what all of the other education experts
and<00:01:22.530> all<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> other<00:01:22.860> disciplines<00:01:23.189> would<00:01:23.549> say

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
and all the other disciplines would say

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.090 
and all the other disciplines would say
is<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> way<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> go<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.080> once<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.350> took

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
is the way to go and I think once I took

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.219 
is the way to go and I think once I took
that<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.460> heart<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.909> realized<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.600> things

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
that to heart and realized how things

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.499 
that to heart and realized how things
meshed<00:01:28.590> together<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.640> very<00:01:29.670> easy<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.450> me

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
meshed together it was very easy for me

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.590 
meshed together it was very easy for me
to<00:01:30.630> buy<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> new<00:01:31.259> system<00:01:31.670> two<00:01:32.670> big<00:01:32.939> things<00:01:33.270> come

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
to buy a new system two big things come

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.240 
to buy a new system two big things come
to<00:01:33.720> mind<00:01:33.900> when<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:34.439> about<00:01:34.829> what<00:01:35.009> are<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
to mind when I think about what are the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.100 
to mind when I think about what are the
changes<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.670> are<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> happen<00:01:36.270> first

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
changes that are going to happen first

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.100 
changes that are going to happen first
is<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.799> students<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.909> multiple<00:01:39.329> ways<00:01:39.810> will

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
is that students in multiple ways will

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.350 
is that students in multiple ways will
have<00:01:40.229> more<00:01:40.530> clinical<00:01:41.009> exposure<00:01:41.369> earlier<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
have more clinical exposure earlier and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.660 
have more clinical exposure earlier and
the<00:01:42.840> second<00:01:43.170> change<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:44.189> idea<00:01:44.610> that

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the second change is this idea that

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.010 
the second change is this idea that
students<00:01:45.479> are<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.720> be<00:01:45.840> more

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
students are going to be more

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.910 
students are going to be more
responsible<00:01:46.740> for<00:01:46.979> what<00:01:47.670> they<00:01:47.909> need<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.240> know

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
responsible for what they need to know

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.520 
responsible for what they need to know
so<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.549> part<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.000> hybrid<00:01:51.420> curriculum<00:01:51.899> now

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
so I'm part of the hybrid curriculum now

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.319 
so I'm part of the hybrid curriculum now
they<00:01:52.649> didn't<00:01:52.860> want<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.430> take<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.119> new

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
they didn't want to just take this new

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.420

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
kind of just sitting there looking at a

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.639 
kind of just sitting there looking at a
textbook<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.780> read<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> lot<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.320> things<00:02:07.530> you

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
textbook you read a lot of things you

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.320 
textbook you read a lot of things you
see<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> lot<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.039> things<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.520> book<00:02:08.759> but

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
see a lot of things in the book but

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.639 
see a lot of things in the book but
until<00:02:09.599> you're<00:02:09.690> actually<00:02:09.810> there<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.560> you

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
until you're actually there and you

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.290 
until you're actually there and you
actually<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.069> deal<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.610> what<00:02:12.120> like

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
actually have to deal with what like

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.550 
actually have to deal with what like
real

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
real

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.190 
real
fishes<00:02:13.980> are<00:02:14.190> with<00:02:14.819> actual<00:02:15.180> people<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:16.080> don't

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
fishes are with actual people you don't

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.530 
fishes are with actual people you don't
get<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.380> full<00:02:16.590> grasp<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.130> used<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.510> I

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
get a full grasp of it used up and so I

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.610 
get a full grasp of it used up and so I
think<00:02:18.750> that's<00:02:18.959> what<00:02:19.140> they're<00:02:19.230> trying<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.470> have

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
think that's what they're trying to have

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.750 
think that's what they're trying to have
us<00:02:19.739> do<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.010> try<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.370> us<00:02:20.459> become<00:02:20.610> more

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
us do to try to have us become more

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:29.070 
us do to try to have us become more
proficient<00:02:21.270> clinical<00:02:22.110> doctors

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.220 

I<00:02:29.520> think<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.610> really<00:02:30.940> major<00:02:31.510> difference<00:02:32.020> is

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
I think the really major difference is

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.170 
I think the really major difference is
that<00:02:32.260> we're<00:02:32.560> focusing<00:02:33.040> more<00:02:33.100> on<00:02:33.340> how<00:02:33.850> they

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
that we're focusing more on how they

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.440 
that we're focusing more on how they
learn<00:02:34.450> as<00:02:34.770> much<00:02:35.770> as<00:02:35.980> what<00:02:36.130> they<00:02:36.280> learn<00:02:36.460> and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
learn as much as what they learn and

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.850 
learn as much as what they learn and
that's<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.900> skill<00:02:38.140> set<00:02:38.350> that<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.530> need

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
that's the skill set that you need

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.350 
that's the skill set that you need
continuing<00:02:39.490> throughout<00:02:39.730> your<00:02:39.880> career<00:02:40.210> as<00:02:40.330> a

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
continuing throughout your career as a

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.360 
continuing throughout your career as a
physician<00:02:40.680> when<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:41.740> think<00:02:41.920> about<00:02:42.130> much<00:02:42.340> of

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
physician when you think about much of

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.820 
physician when you think about much of
structured<00:02:42.910> education<00:02:43.570> is<00:02:43.990> fairly<00:02:44.470> passive

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
structured education is fairly passive

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.400 
structured education is fairly passive
you're<00:02:45.490> told<00:02:45.820> what<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.300> should<00:02:46.480> learn<00:02:46.660> you

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
you're told what you should learn you

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.590 
you're told what you should learn you
gorget<00:02:47.800> ate<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.070> for<00:02:48.100> tests<00:02:48.730> when<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:49.450> move

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
gorget ate it for tests when you move

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.300 
gorget ate it for tests when you move
into<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.960> workplace<00:02:50.260> in<00:02:50.530> any<00:02:50.740> career<00:02:51.040> but

into the workplace in any career but

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.440 
into the workplace in any career but
particularly<00:02:51.640> in<00:02:51.880> medicine<00:02:52.300> which<00:02:52.420> is

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
particularly in medicine which is

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.810 
particularly in medicine which is
rapidly<00:02:53.110> evolving<00:02:53.350> you<00:02:54.310> really<00:02:54.580> need<00:02:54.730> to

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
rapidly evolving you really need to

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.320 
rapidly evolving you really need to
identify<00:02:54.970> for<00:02:55.450> yourself<00:02:55.840> what<00:02:56.260> do<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.740> not<00:02:57.010> know

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
identify for yourself what do I not know

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.910 
identify for yourself what do I not know
where<00:02:58.330> do<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.540> find<00:02:58.750> an<00:02:58.990> information<00:02:59.530> how<00:02:59.770> do<00:02:59.830> I

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
where do I find an information how do I

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.770 
where do I find an information how do I
know<00:03:00.010> if<00:03:00.160> it's<00:03:00.190> good<00:03:00.460> information<00:03:00.760> how<00:03:01.600> do<00:03:01.660> I

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
know if it's good information how do I

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.600 
know if it's good information how do I
apply<00:03:01.990> that<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.440> patient<00:03:02.620> for<00:03:03.070> me<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:06.580> I

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
apply that to the patient for me so I

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.870 
apply that to the patient for me so I
think<00:03:06.700> some<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.270> students<00:03:07.810> have<00:03:08.320> an

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
think some of the students have an

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.400 
think some of the students have an
excited<00:03:09.880> apprehension<00:03:10.540> about<00:03:10.990> curriculum

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
excited apprehension about curriculum

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.520 
excited apprehension about curriculum
2.0<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:12.310> think<00:03:12.610> they're<00:03:12.820> excited<00:03:13.270> because

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
2.0 I think they're excited because

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.650 
2.0 I think they're excited because
there's<00:03:14.530> going<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.800> be<00:03:14.860> a<00:03:14.950> lot<00:03:15.190> more

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
there's going to be a lot more

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.400 
there's going to be a lot more
individualization<00:03:16.660> there's<00:03:17.140> going<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.290> be<00:03:17.350> a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
individualization there's going to be a

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.810 
individualization there's going to be a
lot<00:03:17.560> more<00:03:17.590> opportunity<00:03:18.250> for<00:03:18.370> students<00:03:18.790> to

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
lot more opportunity for students to

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.760 
lot more opportunity for students to
pursue<00:03:19.390> those<00:03:19.690> avenues<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.590> they're

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
pursue those avenues that they're

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.170 
pursue those avenues that they're
interested<00:03:21.100> in<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.700> they're<00:03:21.970> passionate

interested in and they're passionate

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.870 
interested in and they're passionate
about<00:03:22.530> but<00:03:23.530> there's<00:03:23.920> also<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.370> little

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
about but there's also a little

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.810 
about but there's also a little
apprehension<00:03:25.600> about<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:27.010> idea<00:03:27.430> that<00:03:27.520> they're

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
apprehension about the idea that they're

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.160 
apprehension about the idea that they're
going<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.030> be<00:03:28.120> more<00:03:28.300> responsible<00:03:28.900> for

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
going to be more responsible for

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.699 
going to be more responsible for
everything<00:03:30.360> we<00:03:31.360> have<00:03:31.390> never<00:03:31.870> been<00:03:32.170> in<00:03:32.350> a<00:03:32.440> time

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
everything we have never been in a time

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.830 
everything we have never been in a time
where<00:03:33.010> health<00:03:33.280> care<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:33.910> what<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.660> really

where health care and what it really

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.180 
where health care and what it really
means<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.800> to<00:03:36.459> perform<00:03:37.120> healthcare<00:03:37.780> has

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
the change that they're going to

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.090 
the change that they're going to

they leave so so the tool set they need
to<00:03:58.630> be<00:03:58.780> great<00:03:59.080> physicians<00:03:59.860> is<00:04:00.130> vastly

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
to be great physicians is vastly

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.610 
to be great physicians is vastly
