 air diffuser here the air conditioner is 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.419
 very easy to change and sometimes the person 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.090
 is afraid to move because people 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.790

 his face is black and his normal color is gray 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.130
 Like this other one here is that this one from here 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.060
 It was changed because it was broken. 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:49.660
 the core of this middle core to ikea that 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.900
 moves and directs the air but the owner does not 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.300
 Did you buy a black one? 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.820
 now he bought another gray and the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.660
 People are going to change and will show you 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.360
 the agent 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.190
 we have here two plastic spatulas 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.100
 every time you touch a panel 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.810
 in the door liner is good that you use 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.439
 this kind of tool that we will leave 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.090
 the panel may even try to 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.310
 screwdriver but risks the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.929
 leave marked then we go these 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.119
 indeed here to release the power here 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:26.799
 diffuser ii we put it right here 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:30.009
 in the junction is not that it is not here in the 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:33.270
 the diffuser with the panel and torch 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.270
 put in several points 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.100
 the proton diffuser 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:47.610
 will be leaving and ready 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:53.610
 was diffuser was changed because this 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.780
 ball here broke understood why 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.250
 that he was changed 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.399
 another tip I want to give 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.729
 You, as I said before, here was 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.770
 changed because you broke this part here 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:08.580
 in case it was not the one I was changed 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.769
 new service broke what happens to 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.810
 people took this new one without problem 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.940
 No, but when you go change it. 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.860
 that 's what's broken 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.390
 You have to be very careful because 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.150
 the pieces of this ball here they can 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.630
 fall in here if they fall here 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.500
 inside you may have a problem because 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.390
 this control is here that you direct 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.140
 the airflow 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:41.160
 the glass diffuser here or for the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.350
 feet is a mechanism that God has 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.660
 some cables and there are some 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.590
 open and close directing the flow 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.230
 air 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.549
 according to which you choose here and 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.650
 if a piece 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.650
 I discovered a piece of this ball I fell 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.980
 inside it can catch that 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.780
 mechanism here what will happen 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.590
 you will have to take is the panel 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.480
 to get a little bit of the 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.450
 ball that fell in here then 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.160
 You change because it's broken that it's 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.180
 be careful not to drop anything 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.209
 here inside 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.799
 So we have people here until this 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.100
 new original was purchased at 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:24.530
 concessionaire will open the withdrawal of 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.220
 box in gray color 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.900
 will probably stay a little 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.049
 different from the other because this one is 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.209
 new and one is used will not look good 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:37.280
 better than this one here that is 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:40.609
 black is seeing the difference between the two 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:46.859
 So we'll put it here. 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:51.419
 here the invoice cost 54 reais 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.590
 not cheap but not original should 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.200
 last for a long time 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.360
 so we're going to put a 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.269
 The thing that I want to show you is 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.050
 that he has on the one side 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:07.620
 This little groove here is coming out. 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.840
 Alone because this here revolves around this 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.450
 gray part so you can direct the 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.889
 to that little groove here what she has 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:19.370
 here over the groove it will be 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:24.090
 You see, there's only one rule on one side. 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.729
 there is a lock here another lock here 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.419
 Here another slot here this latch 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.590
 slot here it will fit here in 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.750
 top 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.960
 if you go see your circumference here 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:41.310
 She has a place here to fit in the 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:47.570
 slot then you just pick it up 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:49.530
 now up to fit him here 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:57.889
 push with the hand 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:05:00.660
 ready the air diffuser is replaced 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.940
 of Celtic 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.150
