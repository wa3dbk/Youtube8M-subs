00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.820
 Hello everyone, today I would like a little bit 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:11.640
 talk about sharpening a knife on sharpeners 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.190
 appexchange about me but this is not a clone 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.670
 brace about clone or original 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.020
 o talk about sharpeners 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.930
 plan that is, if we sharpen the legs right 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.180
 hand in hand we have no problems 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.690
 it comes in perfectly accurate about us 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.009
 ok but as soon as we get 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.890
 need to pay off 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.719
 With many people, the left hand immediately appears 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.780
 problems I tried 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.389
 retrained on the left hand on my juice 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.489
 nothing happens if you are relative 

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:46.350
 exactly it is still normal if the blade is like 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.479
 anti bent this starts right away 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.609
 dancing with a tambourine that is, it is extremely 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:54.389
 uncomfortable i alone is right handed me this is not 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:56.639
 maybe many too, it seems, if I donâ€™t 

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:58.739
 I am mistaken sometime about a year ago 

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:00.569
 I watched approximately when only 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.959
 bought this plate a lot of reviews a lot 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:05.360
 video on youtube gained experience and if 

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:08.580
 I am not mistaken of course I can be mistaken 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.040
 seems to be Sasha winnie well, showing that 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.860
 you can use this sharpener like this 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.250
 that is, we hold the knife on top here 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.260
 take it like this 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.680
 working with my left hand I don't care 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.110
 it turned out uncomfortable I tried all the same 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.640
 work with your left hand learn how to work 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.190
 my left hand didn't get it all and 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.160
 somehow I literally just recently 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.960
 I recently had this sharpener 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.570
 work so let's say in cramped 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.820
 conditions cramped conditions were the fact that 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.100
 on the table just kept a lot of things and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.280
 it was not possible all this 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.780
 rake and the knife had to drag 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.990
 then it was just sharpener 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.940
 in this way and I had to 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.590
 like here under my arm i mean here you are 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.300
 see here i sit well i think my 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.430
 blood gets into the frame here we try 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.040
 like that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.590
 I already have a tripod just not bend 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.960
 that is, you look like I would armpit 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:15.590
 I take it here so I hold the legs here 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:24.050
 or how comfortable it is and work 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:26.720
 in the same way everything is fixed that is me 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.960
 I think you understand that I work forward 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.830
 so here and so I need to be under 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.140
 left side 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.720
 i take just a sharpener turning over from 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.240
 myself and working here now here 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.920
 This pin goes under the arm that is here 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.700
 hands pore under the arm he goes like this 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.510
 the way to use is very convenient 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.770
 by chance 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.720
 It turned out this way literally just 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.860
 because it was necessary several times 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.720
 hold along the cutting edge and here this 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.110
 look poverty under the left side so 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.060
 cool and comfortable here is such a way 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.570
 It turned out actually all all 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.570
 Thanks for attention
