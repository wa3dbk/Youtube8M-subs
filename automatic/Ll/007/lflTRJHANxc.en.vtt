00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
were quite impressed with the projector

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.969 
were quite impressed with the projector
mode<00:04:17.239> so<00:04:17.419> I'm<00:04:17.480> just<00:04:17.660> going<00:04:17.810> to<00:04:17.840> turn<00:04:18.109> from<00:04:18.380> the

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
mode so I'm just going to turn from the

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:25.450 
mode so I'm just going to turn from the
normal<00:04:19.250> mode<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.609> projector<00:04:20.030> mode<00:04:24.460> okay

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
normal mode to the projector mode okay

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.860 
normal mode to the projector mode okay
so<00:04:25.520> this<00:04:25.760> is<00:04:25.910> what<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.270> projection<00:04:26.750> mode

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
so this is what the projection mode

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.690 
so this is what the projection mode
looks<00:04:27.110> like<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.889> method<00:04:28.160> of<00:04:28.280> navigation

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
looks like the method of navigation

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.070 
looks like the method of navigation
remains<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.210> same<00:04:29.389> there<00:04:29.570> is<00:04:29.600> no<00:04:29.690> remote

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
remains the same there is no remote

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.570 
remains the same there is no remote
control<00:04:30.470> so<00:04:30.650> we<00:04:30.860> will<00:04:30.950> essentially<00:04:31.280> have<00:04:31.460> to

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
control so we will essentially have to

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.550 
control so we will essentially have to
hold<00:04:31.760> the<00:04:31.850> device<00:04:32.000> in<00:04:32.150> our<00:04:32.360> hands<00:04:32.630> so<00:04:33.050> part<00:04:33.440> in

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
hold the device in our hands so part in

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.980 
hold the device in our hands so part in
the<00:04:33.680> shakiness<00:04:34.210> you<00:04:35.210> can<00:04:35.360> essentially<00:04:35.690> then

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
the shakiness you can essentially then

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.770 
the shakiness you can essentially then
browse<00:04:36.440> through<00:04:36.710> your<00:04:36.800> menus<00:04:37.580> and<00:04:37.850> you<00:04:38.540> don't

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
browse through your menus and you don't

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.030 
browse through your menus and you don't
see<00:04:38.960> anything<00:04:39.320> on<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.560> screen<00:04:39.650> of<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:39.979> device

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
see anything on the screen of the device

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.550 
see anything on the screen of the device
so<00:04:40.580> this<00:04:41.419> is<00:04:41.570> what<00:04:41.720> you<00:04:41.840> will<00:04:41.930> see<00:04:41.990> on<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:42.410> wall

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
so this is what you will see on the wall

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.590 
so this is what you will see on the wall
this<00:04:42.950> is<00:04:43.070> quite<00:04:43.310> a<00:04:43.340> impressive<00:04:44.030> image<00:04:44.270> if<00:04:44.570> you

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
this is quite a impressive image if you

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.409 
this is quite a impressive image if you
ask<00:04:44.990> us<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:46.039> have<00:04:46.220> a<00:04:46.250> projection<00:04:46.669> projector

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
ask us to have a projection projector

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.480 
ask us to have a projection projector
like<00:04:47.600> this<00:04:47.810> in<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.590> palm<00:04:48.770> of<00:04:48.800> your<00:04:48.919> hand<00:04:49.340> for

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
like this in the palm of your hand for

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.310 
like this in the palm of your hand for
6000<00:04:49.970> degrees<00:04:50.240> is<00:04:50.479> quite<00:04:50.660> impressive<00:04:51.140> you<00:04:51.169> can

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
6000 degrees is quite impressive you can

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.460 
6000 degrees is quite impressive you can
take<00:04:52.010> this<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.370> have<00:04:52.669> like<00:04:52.880> a<00:04:52.910> nice<00:04:53.690> for<00:04:53.990> 40<00:04:54.350> 50

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
take this and have like a nice for 40 50

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.540 
take this and have like a nice for 40 50
inch<00:04:54.770> screen<00:04:54.919> and<00:04:55.510> do<00:04:56.510> a<00:04:56.539> quick<00:04:56.990> presentation

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
inch screen and do a quick presentation

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.440 
inch screen and do a quick presentation
let's<00:04:58.550> go<00:04:58.610> keep<00:04:58.789> going<00:04:58.820> to<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.090> media<00:04:59.240> and

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
let's go keep going to the media and

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.380 
let's go keep going to the media and
show<00:04:59.630> you<00:04:59.690> that<00:05:00.820> videos<00:05:01.820> play<00:05:02.000> essentially

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
show you that videos play essentially

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.560 
show you that videos play essentially
very<00:05:02.570> nicely<00:05:02.810> while<00:05:03.669> in<00:05:04.669> the<00:05:04.880> projection<00:05:05.240> mode

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
very nicely while in the projection mode

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:30.470 
very nicely while in the projection mode
and<00:05:05.840> I'm<00:05:06.169> going<00:05:06.320> to<00:05:06.350> go<00:05:06.470> into<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.740> video<00:05:06.890> plane

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.940 

so<00:05:31.480> essentially<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:32.170> closer<00:05:32.410> you<00:05:32.620> get<00:05:32.770> to<00:05:32.830> the

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
so essentially the closer you get to the

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.050 
so essentially the closer you get to the
screen<00:05:33.100> the<00:05:33.820> smaller<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.480> image<00:05:34.600> gets<00:05:34.930> and

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
screen the smaller the image gets and

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.520 
screen the smaller the image gets and
the<00:05:37.060> further<00:05:37.330> that<00:05:37.510> you<00:05:37.690> get<00:05:37.870> from<00:05:38.080> the<00:05:38.260> screen

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
the further that you get from the screen

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.490 
the further that you get from the screen
the<00:05:39.370> larger<00:05:39.730> the<00:05:39.850> image<00:05:39.880> gets<00:05:40.240> you<00:05:40.900> do<00:05:41.290> have<00:05:41.470> a

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
the larger the image gets you do have a

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.140 
the larger the image gets you do have a
focus<00:05:41.740> ring<00:05:42.070> on<00:05:42.220> the<00:05:42.310> top<00:05:42.490> of<00:05:42.610> the<00:05:42.700> projector

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
focus ring on the top of the projector

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.300 
focus ring on the top of the projector
lens<00:05:43.330> over<00:05:43.540> here<00:05:43.780> so<00:05:44.050> you<00:05:44.080> can<00:05:44.170> focus<00:05:44.710> if<00:05:44.920> the

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
lens over here so you can focus if the

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.300 
lens over here so you can focus if the
screen<00:05:46.270> goes<00:05:46.480> out<00:05:46.630> of<00:05:46.780> focus<00:05:47.040> let's<00:05:48.040> come<00:05:48.280> back

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
screen goes out of focus let's come back

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.070 
screen goes out of focus let's come back
into<00:05:48.580> normal<00:05:48.910> mode<00:05:51.450> so<00:05:52.450> as<00:05:52.570> you<00:05:52.660> can<00:05:52.810> see<00:05:52.930> we're

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
into normal mode so as you can see we're

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.270 
into normal mode so as you can see we're
still<00:05:53.110> in<00:05:53.320> projector<00:05:53.740> mode<00:05:53.920> and<00:05:54.070> you're<00:05:54.160> going

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
still in projector mode and you're going

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.220 
still in projector mode and you're going
to<00:05:54.310> try<00:05:54.490> and<00:05:54.670> come<00:05:54.850> back<00:05:55.030> into<00:05:55.300> regular<00:05:55.840> mode

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
to try and come back into regular mode

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.840 
to try and come back into regular mode
so<00:05:56.710> that<00:05:56.740> we<00:05:57.010> can<00:05:57.100> talk<00:05:57.220> a<00:05:57.280> little<00:05:57.490> bit<00:05:57.670> more

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
so that we can talk a little bit more

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.480 
so that we can talk a little bit more
about<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.210> device<00:05:58.710> back<00:05:59.710> in<00:05:59.920> normal<00:06:00.190> mode<00:06:00.340> you

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
about the device back in normal mode you

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.070 
about the device back in normal mode you
will<00:06:00.580> see<00:06:00.820> that<00:06:00.970> this<00:06:01.150> device<00:06:01.330> is<00:06:01.630> very<00:06:01.690> nicely

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080
