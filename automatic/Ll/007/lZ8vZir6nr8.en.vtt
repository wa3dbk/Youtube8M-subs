I<00:01:49.290> might<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.950> attending<00:01:50.250> my<00:01:50.340> house<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.729> fuel

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
I might be attending my house just fuel

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.780 
I might be attending my house just fuel
body<00:01:51.840> booked<00:01:52.079> up<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.380> my<00:01:52.500> appointments<00:01:53.070> my

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
body booked up on my appointments my

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.280 
body booked up on my appointments my
house<00:01:54.000> might<00:01:54.329> burn<00:01:54.540> down<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.020> might<00:01:55.200> have

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
house might burn down and I might have

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.440 
house might burn down and I might have
to<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.500> at<00:01:55.619> home<00:01:55.799> instead<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.460> here<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
to be at home instead of here the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.450 
to be at home instead of here the
downside<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.590> can<00:01:58.799> find<00:01:59.100> yourself

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
downside is that you can find yourself

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.670 
downside is that you can find yourself
occasionally<00:02:00.149> being<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.630> bit<00:02:00.810> like<00:02:01.079> oh<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.500> know

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.810 
occasionally being a bit like oh I know

I'll just cross over the teachers don't
know<00:02:02.909> parents<00:02:03.240> see<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.630> I'll<00:02:03.840> see<00:02:04.079> what<00:02:04.140> I've

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
know parents see and I'll see what I've
