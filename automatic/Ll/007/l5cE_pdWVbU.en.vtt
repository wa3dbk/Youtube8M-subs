00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.020
 Traditional Mexican cuisine deserves a 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.020
 tablecloth tree 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.719
 We are talking 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.080
 there are people in a victorious army already 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.080
 then his emperor falls 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.740
 and resents this wonderfully 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.110
 as an emblematic dish a dish 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.690
 known by all that is already managed 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.470
 all levels that is the time is a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.120
 belief dish 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.340
 you can not be an author because 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.270
 really the exact data directing 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.020
 invention 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.330
 there really is not a 29 for your moment 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.560
 was a dish created for transition 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.560
 a table with long tablecloths 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.980
 an amazing product on a plate 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.230
 rich are all elegant 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.620
 and now we work it as something 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.030
 mus officer 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.250
 also forward 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.650
 all these emblematic dishes in 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.930
 our national gastronomy of color in 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.150
 its game moment with van gogh dishes 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.820
 today playing the theme of chile in 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.920
 nogada that finally you are one of the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.810
 maximum exponents in mexico talking a 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.630
 little of your chile en nogada la 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.490
 chile tradition history 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.490
 what is your perspective of the Chilean 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.840
 precisely that it is a regional dish 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.270
 regional 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.659
 even though without the product of origin 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.710
 you do not subsist or you do not subsist 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.409
 way with the same dignity 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.229
 the first point is to replace the nut 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.040
 fresco castilla is only from 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.730
 season is not possible 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.350
 make a sauce by wes dry imprison 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.350
 for a simply cost issue 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.460
 likewise the apple the bitch of sexual 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.780
 honduras I do not believe 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.030
 chile comes from chile poblano 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.700
 authentic not the hybrid this that by 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.040
 issues of production volumes do not 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.720
 you are more easily found 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.290
 the authentic one has poblano that is only 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.120
 the season 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.120
 and flash 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:33.610
 then it is better not to do it 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.610
 my personal sense I would not 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.400
 having less ignorance of the subject 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.160
 knowing that the product of origin that 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.190
 really what canada the special value a 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.980
 added value of this dish when 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:56.360
 we ate then the dilemma weathered not 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:59.150
 weathered that probably for me the 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.000
 original recipe has been capel without 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.010
 However, the palates are also looking for 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.040
 they are modified because it is a response 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.370
 culturally at the moment if there is a 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.540
 great concern there is an interest 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.700
 precisely for enjoying the flavors 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.430
 more cigars from fillings in Chile 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.680
 of the nogada and many people but wants 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.510
 do it without weathering that I did not 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.400
 does any invention some 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.920
 that on the outside did not apply 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.019
 simply someone said that for his 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.569
 of course it was better 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.209
 eliminate the capping because if they modify 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.000
 the bone in a knowledge of techniques 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.849
 that sometimes we do not value as Mexicans 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.450
 we value a well-managed temporary 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:46.370
 but we do not value the traditional cape 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:54.120
 we value it 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:57.140
 spanish espaÃ±a we use it a lot of the 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.440
 quality of gambas in gabardine 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.230
 and in Mexico we did not win is not our 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.569
 Chilean each race 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.959
 that we think is something that lowers him 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.709
 the quality because it also changes 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.780
 change the taste of meats to the texture 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.459
 in which I do it was well done in 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.269
 the gambling den is never a place of 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.269
 fat stop 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.130
 supports health better 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.840
 they serve a different flavor contribution 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:30.630
 finished dish 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:35.180
 but it has a different feature 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:38.689
 this is better or worse and safe 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.569
 how many years have you made the Chilean earn 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:44.809
 I think I 'm doing more than 20 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:48.649
 twenty years old when my mother 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:53.360
 learned to do it from friends 19 relative 

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:56.629
 from the area then they taught him to do 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.289
 the season that everyone has a 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:02.149
 symptomatic constant were dishes that were 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.329
 they served in these houses in these three 

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:08.440
 families of poblano origin because 

00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:11.470
 coincided with the wedding anniversary 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:15.100
 of the couple years of the lord of the house 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.020
 then during August they were three 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.020
 invitations to eat some chiles in 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.180
 nogada with three different houses like 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.810
 gillian with three different dates of 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.810
 celebration 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.110
 and I think that's where is a plate of 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.030
 parties a celebration time is a 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.360
 dish that can only be in this 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.360
 season
