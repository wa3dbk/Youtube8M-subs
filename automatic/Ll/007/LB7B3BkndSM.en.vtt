00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.660
 and is cutting an eye to the middle 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.660
 recalling that in one of them 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:15.409
 we will cut to the next 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.409
 I started to play Juliana 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.720
 when removing 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.269
 the condo in panamera support 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.269
 can cut the julienne very thin 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.110
 now room 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.720
 in half 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.720
 then explained 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.290
 chef renato 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.650
 it strips the ends 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.470
 I'll cut it later 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.290
 pick up the circular and felt dollars 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.290
 then in lightweight geap cubes 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.460
 The time I gave you Juliana. 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.460
 cut 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.810
 the wheel by chance 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.810
 macapÃ¡ - and it will get easier 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 in thin strips 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.279
 but not so 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.269
 charsadda 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.269
 only the court before 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.749
 leaving crew 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.749
 I said practiced pounds 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:06.849
 cut into strips 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.129
 want more 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.199
 then cut 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.199
 finally 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.449
 zucchini and cut at both ends of zucchini 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.449
 every thousand 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:48.219
 took some of the bark 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:50.119
 so I want to use 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:53.119
 I get along very well with him. 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.719
 and I'll cut it slower 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.719
 little wider but a choice of gori 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:18.719
 the material 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:20.449
 Why the Portuguese? 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:21.739

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.150
 part of it 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.150
 to shake 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.900
 besides the candy to make 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:55.180
 with the left to say how can one sin 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.970
