how<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.450> website<00:01:48.899> actually<00:01:49.110> works<00:01:49.470> this

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
how this website actually works this

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.560 
how this website actually works this
website<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.399> built<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.180> top<00:01:51.360> 5

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
website is not built just for the top 5

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.109 
website is not built just for the top 5
this<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.990> map<00:01:52.229> sharing<00:01:52.619> website<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.340> you

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
this is a map sharing website and you

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.670 
this is a map sharing website and you
can<00:01:54.149> basically<00:01:54.420> share<00:01:54.810> any<00:01:55.049> map<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.649> you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
can basically share any map that you

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.109 
can basically share any map that you
want<00:01:56.009> there's<00:01:56.189> already<00:01:56.310> tons<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.759> maps<00:01:56.909> on

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
want there's already tons of maps on

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.760 
want there's already tons of maps on
here<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> reason<00:01:57.990> I'm<00:01:58.259> doing<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.619> for

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
here but the reason I'm doing this for

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.469 
here but the reason I'm doing this for
the<00:01:59.009> top<00:01:59.189> five<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.640> because<00:01:59.790> now<00:01:59.820> people<00:02:00.210> will

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the top five is because now people will

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.959 
the top five is because now people will
be<00:02:00.630> able<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.960> actually<00:02:01.369> great<00:02:02.369> your<00:02:02.579> actual

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
be able to actually great your actual

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.450 
be able to actually great your actual
maps<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.509> helps<00:02:03.840> me<00:02:03.899> decide<00:02:04.170> which<00:02:05.100> map

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
maps and that helps me decide which map

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.700 
maps and that helps me decide which map
should<00:02:05.729> actually<00:02:05.939> put<00:02:06.570> into<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> top<00:02:07.409> five

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
should actually put into the top five

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.969 
should actually put into the top five
and<00:02:07.979> also<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.670> helps<00:02:08.849> me<00:02:09.119> fill<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.599> map

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
and also it helps me fill the map

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.440 
and also it helps me fill the map
lot<00:02:10.099> quicker<00:02:10.369> because<00:02:10.610> then<00:02:10.909> I<00:02:10.970> could<00:02:11.030> just<00:02:11.300> go

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
lot quicker because then I could just go

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.420 
lot quicker because then I could just go
ahead<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.810> click<00:02:12.290> on<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.560> download<00:02:12.800> link<00:02:13.280> and

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
ahead and click on the download link and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.850 
ahead and click on the download link and
very<00:02:13.819> quickly<00:02:14.239> play<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:14.810> map<00:02:15.019> so<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.680> makes

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
very quickly play the map so this makes

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.680 
very quickly play the map so this makes
it<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.069> lot<00:02:16.310> easier<00:02:16.610> for<00:02:17.000> me<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.120> film<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.540> is

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690
