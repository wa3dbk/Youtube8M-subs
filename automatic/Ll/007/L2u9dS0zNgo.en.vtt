before<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.270> project<00:00:21.990> lifting<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:23.070> why<00:00:23.850> not<00:00:24.000> you

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
before in project lifting so why not you

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.939 
before in project lifting so why not you
know<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.689> form<00:00:25.320> engine<00:00:25.560> rear-wheel<00:00:25.769> drive

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
know it's a form engine rear-wheel drive

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.820 
know it's a form engine rear-wheel drive
car<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:27.599> know<00:00:27.720> how's<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.320> potential<00:00:28.740> to

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
car so you know how's the potential to

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.009 
car so you know how's the potential to
be<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> drift<00:00:29.250> care<00:00:29.630> let's<00:00:30.630> see<00:00:30.810> if<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:30.990> actually

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
be a drift care let's see if it actually

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.010 
be a drift care let's see if it actually
does<00:00:31.529> become<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.340> let's<00:00:33.210> buy<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.360> I'm<00:00:33.750> telling

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
does become one let's buy it I'm telling

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
and see exactly what it can do on the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.869 
and see exactly what it can do on the
track<00:00:54.050> I<00:00:55.160> don't<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.219> how<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.760> to

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
track I don't know how this is going to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.430 
track I don't know how this is going to
turn<00:00:57.000> out<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.870> I'm<00:00:58.079> going<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
completely blind than this I have no

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.880 
completely blind than this I have no
idea<00:00:59.879> what's<00:01:00.329> going<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.750> happen<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.680> going

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
idea what's going to happen it is going

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.380 
idea what's going to happen it is going
to<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> complete<00:01:02.399> fail<00:01:02.609> or<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.270> going

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to be a complete fail or if it's going

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.100 
to be a complete fail or if it's going
to<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.830> something<00:01:04.830> decent<00:01:05.479> well<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.510> guess<00:01:06.840> I

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
to be something decent well I guess I

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.510 
to be something decent well I guess I
wouldn't<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.470> uploaded<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.890> video<00:01:08.040> since

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
wouldn't have uploaded this video since

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.550 
wouldn't have uploaded this video since
it<00:01:08.790> was<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.390> know<00:01:09.450> if<00:01:09.780> since<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.470> to

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
it was you know if since it was going to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.380 
it was you know if since it was going to
be<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.070> complete<00:01:11.490> fail<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.909> not<00:01:12.000> drift<00:01:12.270> at

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
be like a complete fail and not drift at

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.399 
be like a complete fail and not drift at
all<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:13.350> um<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.400> know<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.729> guess<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:16.170> worth

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
all but um you know I guess it's worth

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.240 
all but um you know I guess it's worth
to<00:01:16.530> try<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:17.000> anyway<00:01:18.409> let's<00:01:19.409> go<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> our<00:01:19.740> usual

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
to try it anyway let's go to our usual

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.060 
to try it anyway let's go to our usual
thing<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.650> GT<00:01:22.650> auto<00:01:22.770> shop

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
thing you know with the GT auto shop

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.850 
thing you know with the GT auto shop
change<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> oil<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.540> all<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.229> stuff<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.560> we

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
change the oil and all that stuff so we

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.080 
change the oil and all that stuff so we
can<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> little<00:01:26.250> bit<00:01:26.520> more<00:01:26.640> power<00:01:26.820> into

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
can have a little bit more power into

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.690 
can have a little bit more power into
the<00:01:27.210> scare<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.869> then<00:01:28.710> actually<00:01:29.310> change<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the scare and then actually change the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.030 
the scare and then actually change the
color<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.119> well<00:01:30.150> because<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.479> don't<00:01:30.689> like<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
color as well because I don't like the

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.899 
color as well because I don't like the
bronze<00:01:32.040> looking<00:01:32.430> thing<00:01:32.750> anyway<00:01:34.729> we'll<00:01:35.729> see

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
bronze looking thing anyway we'll see

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.580 
bronze looking thing anyway we'll see
what<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.270> do<00:01:37.670> alright<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:39.229> one<00:01:40.229> point<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
what we can do alright if one point the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.100 
what we can do alright if one point the
same<00:01:40.770> was<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> tank<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:41.759> does<00:01:41.880> I

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
same was like a tank it really does I

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
it so let's take it on the track see how

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.300 
it so let's take it on the track see how
big<00:05:23.900> of<00:05:23.930> a<00:05:24.110> difference<00:05:24.259> this<00:05:24.530> is<00:05:24.590> if<00:05:24.979> it<00:05:25.130> is<00:05:25.280> a

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
big of a difference this is if it is a

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.390 
big of a difference this is if it is a
difference<00:05:25.880> will<00:05:26.810> it<00:05:26.840> drive<00:05:27.139> well<00:05:27.440> what<00:05:28.310> else

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
difference will it drive well what else

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.029 
difference will it drive well what else
do<00:05:28.520> i<00:05:28.550> need<00:05:28.580> to<00:05:28.789> change<00:05:29.139> all<00:05:30.139> of<00:05:30.199> that<00:05:30.409> stuff<00:05:30.800> so

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
do i need to change all of that stuff so

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.399 
do i need to change all of that stuff so
let's<00:05:31.360> check<00:05:32.360> all<00:05:32.509> of<00:05:32.539> that<00:05:32.810> 12<00:05:33.110> round<00:05:33.320> the

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
let's check all of that 12 round the

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.409 
let's check all of that 12 round the
track<00:05:33.590> now<00:05:33.800> see<00:05:34.159> if<00:05:34.220> it's<00:05:34.580> any<00:05:35.000> better<00:05:35.750> now

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
track now see if it's any better now

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.129 
track now see if it's any better now
