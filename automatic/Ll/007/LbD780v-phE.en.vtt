00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.489
 plastering station allows you to apply 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.489
 plaster solution for a large 

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:17.919
 surface in a short time 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.470
 speed of work increases 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.460
 about four times 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.660
 save significantly on 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.099
 There is no overspending 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.369
 do without this putty and 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.179
 surface preparation came to 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.060
 the battle 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.930
 will consider 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.610
 technology work with mechanized 7 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.740
 thousand 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.400
 starting work is a necessity 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.080
 preparation grounds 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.520
 the base must be dry and firm 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.390
 thoroughly cleaned mother substances 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.640
 able to weaken the plaster line 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.060
 layer from the base 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.330
 before applying the surface solution 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.400
 the basis of the necessary 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.130
 moisturize or process 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.130
 primer composition 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.000
 with the mechanized method of applying 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.830
 is necessary 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.700
 prepare the work unit 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
 according to the instruction manual 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.360
 need to pick up water flow 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.330
 depending on the requirements in the capital 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
 Russia 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.410
 putting plaster 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.540
 mortar on vertical 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.049
 surface base 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.579
 produced towards the top 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.889
 down and it from left to right is a strip about 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:40.880
 seventy centimeters 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.210
 overlap each previous lane 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.320
 subsequent 100 opening at 5 10 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.070
 centimeters of snow from the roof 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.320
 gun solution must be kept 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.230
 think for kuryans processed 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.060
 surface or at a distance of 25 30 meters 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.240
 from ep 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.470
 thickness of the applied layer is adjustable 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.740
 moving speeds 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.740
 the lower the speed the thicker the applied layer 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.420
 leveled the freelance solution 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.420
 produced by an extreme 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:18.980
 readiness which remained from 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.760
 original court view 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.040
 need to remember with the help split in 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.040
 camp 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.279
 simple online 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:47.349
 this tower is another must be in 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.219
 more than 30 suspense 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:50.079
 minutes 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.549
 after the plaster 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.369
 begins to lose its mobility 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:55.229
 the surface needs to be leveled with 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:57.109
 traditions and democracy 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.239
 holding his tactics lyanok bases 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.749
 cutting off the excess and filling the recess 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:03.860
 it's important not to miss the moment you prune and 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.629
 otherwise every ten years 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.379
 when approaching must be removed 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.260
 only small surface trainer 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.810
 areas 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.720
 in no case should not be covered 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.720
 mix starts 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:20.039
 when preparing the surface under 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:22.599
 painting or wallpapering the surface 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.479
 need to moisten with water 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.119
 further wetted surfaces 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:28.269
 the actor developers supposedly 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.349
 given a wide spatula debt affectionately 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.569
 state 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:32.569
 Attention 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.719
 in the process of draining after wetting 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.719
 surface water is emitted plaster 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:37.809
 milk 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:39.819
 further allocated gypsum milk 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.709
 using as a putty leveling 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.999
 remaining minor irregularities 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:46.229
 for glossy 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:47.559
 surface need for 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:48.489
 days 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.090
 not earlier than six hours after 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.400
 tragedy surface blends 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.730
 plaster 1 and it means that the amount of work 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.110
 to choose and buy 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.399
 or a wide trowel that is glossy 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:01.470
 in a circular motion we hold the surface 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.900
 for top quality
