00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.770
 Apple is doing an update of his 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.980
 smallest macbook pros with intels 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.809
 current fourth processor generation 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.719
 due to the lower power consumption 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.859
 the term is extended enormously 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.590
 Externally, the macbook differs 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.279
 13 inches from his retina 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.199
 predecessor 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.510
 nevertheless, it is a little easier and easier 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.310
 has become smaller still sets 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.779
 apple on the unibody housing out 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.689
 anodized aluminum 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.009
 It combines stability and noble look and feel 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.530
 serves as a huge one at the same time 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.300
 heat sink due to the lower 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.610
 power consumption of the new intel 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.350
 platform manages the macbook pro retina 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.780
 Huge runtimes 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.329
 when playing video under mac os iks 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.850
 Around eleven hours are possible in the office 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.430
 Runtime test under windows 8 reach 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.379
 We almost reached the 14 hour limit 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.629
 It runs so much longer than 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.629
 the predecessor at almost the same size 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.449
 Battery the reflective 13 3 inch display 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.520
 solves very high on the single pixel 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.619
 they hardly recognize it anymore 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.290
 Apple calls this a retina 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.330
 resolution in the test laboratory we measure one 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.610
 extremely high brightness and a very high 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.740
 high checkerboard contrast from the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.180
 equipment has particularly the wireless after 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.560
 the new 802.11 ac standard out with 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.080
 a theoretical maximum 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.450
 transfer rate of 1,300 megabits per 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.600
 It is four times faster than that 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.280
 like conventional n wlan 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.189
 otherwise the macbook pro 13 offers 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.159
 3-inch the usual interfaces 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:38.460
 bluetooth 4.0 ever two usb 3.0 and 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.159
 thunderbolt ports hdmi and a sdxc 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.320
 card reader gigabit lan and firewire 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.380
 There is only against surcharge on sander 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.030
 bona dr apple uses a special one 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.579
 power-saving processor from intels 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.009
 fourth core generation code name 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:58.320
 heading to the graphics takes care of the 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:01.799
 integrated graphics 5100 the 256 gb ssd 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.049
 offers more thanks to pci express connection 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.079
 speed than a conventional ssd with sata 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.970
 3 interface in the tests shows up 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.890
 however that the new macbook pro 13 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.780
 3-inch only on some benchmarks 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.080
 faster than its predecessor 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.630
 main reason in the old macbook pro 13 3 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.490
 Although only one intel core i5 works 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.950
 the third generation 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.959
 but for that is a fully fledged mobile 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.020
 processor of the m class with general 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.450
 higher taktraten apple fans can with 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.010
 the new macbook pro retina 13 inches 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.319
 spend much more time 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.390
 Intel's new Hessel platform does it 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.430
 possible with the performance and display 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.380
 Quality was compared to the predecessor 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.270
 however, no big progress 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.569
 And also the price remains apple typical 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.569
 high
