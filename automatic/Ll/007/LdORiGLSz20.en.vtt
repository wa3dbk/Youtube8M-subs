or<00:00:36.150> the<00:00:36.870> taxanes<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:38.840> wish<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:41.129> would<00:00:41.310> have

or the taxanes I wish that we would have

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.389 
or the taxanes I wish that we would have
drugs<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.180> didn't<00:00:42.480> cause<00:00:42.690> hair<00:00:43.020> loss<00:00:43.399> but

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
drugs that didn't cause hair loss but

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.819 
drugs that didn't cause hair loss but
obviously<00:00:44.940> one<00:00:45.510> will<00:00:45.810> put<00:00:46.079> up<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.410> hair<00:00:46.590> loss

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
obviously one will put up with hair loss

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.110 
obviously one will put up with hair loss
to<00:00:47.190> improve<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.790> cure<00:00:48.000> rate<00:00:49.070> in<00:00:50.070> general<00:00:50.460> the
