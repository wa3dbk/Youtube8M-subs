put<00:00:10.260> those<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.650> with<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.889> other<00:00:11.010> solids<00:00:12.019> and

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
put those in with the other solids and

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.720 
put those in with the other solids and
the<00:00:13.139> same<00:00:13.440> with<00:00:13.650> our<00:00:13.799> other<00:00:13.950> pot<00:00:19.130> or<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.160> clear

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the same with our other pot or the clear

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.890 
the same with our other pot or the clear
ghee<00:00:21.000> out<00:00:21.710> and<00:00:23.000> leave<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.210> solids<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
ghee out and leave the solids in the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:38.440 
ghee out and leave the solids in the
bottom<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.380> pan

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.780 

now<00:00:39.450> what<00:00:39.720> we've<00:00:39.899> got<00:00:40.140> here<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:41.190> clear

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
now what we've got here is a clear

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.200 
now what we've got here is a clear
golden<00:00:42.329> liquid<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:44.040> still<00:00:44.340> has<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.970> few

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
golden liquid and it still has a few

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.260 
golden liquid and it still has a few
little<00:00:45.420> particles<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.699> solids<00:00:47.699> left<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.120> it

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
little particles of solids left in it

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.060 
little particles of solids left in it
but<00:00:48.480> that's<00:00:48.690> all<00:00:48.900> right<00:00:48.930> what's<00:00:49.800> going<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
but that's all right what's going to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.540 
but that's all right what's going to
happen<00:00:50.400> is<00:00:50.629> we're<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.980> cook<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.280> until

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
happen is we're going to cook this until

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.840 
happen is we're going to cook this until
all<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.930> water<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.410> completely<00:00:55.949> cooked<00:00:56.220> out

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.090 

now<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.089> is<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.420> trickiest<00:01:00.809> part<00:01:01.260> because

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
now this is the trickiest part because

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.359 
now this is the trickiest part because
we<00:01:02.790> have<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.150> cook<00:01:03.360> it<00:01:03.540> on<00:01:03.660> high<00:01:04.100> bring<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
we have to cook it on high bring it to a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.800 
we have to cook it on high bring it to a
boil<00:01:05.840> to<00:01:06.840> cook<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.159> moisture<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
boil to cook the moisture out but at the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.639 
boil to cook the moisture out but at the
same<00:01:10.110> time<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.160> going<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.910> be

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
same time there is going to be

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.170 
same time there is going to be
impurities<00:01:13.649> that<00:01:13.950> are<00:01:14.220> suspended<00:01:14.789> in<00:01:15.149> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
impurities that are suspended in the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.180 
impurities that are suspended in the
ghee<00:01:15.509> they're<00:01:16.110> going<00:01:16.289> to<00:01:16.350> settle<00:01:16.740> out<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
ghee they're going to settle out to the

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.460 
ghee they're going to settle out to the
bottom<00:01:17.550> and<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.690> careful<00:01:18.869> not<00:01:19.259> to

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
bottom and we have to be careful not to

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.010 
bottom and we have to be careful not to
let<00:01:19.619> them<00:01:19.830> burn<00:01:20.119> if<00:01:21.119> they<00:01:21.360> burn<00:01:21.600> they're<00:01:21.840> going

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
let them burn if they burn they're going

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.350 
let them burn if they burn they're going
to<00:01:22.080> ruin<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.410> flavor<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> ghee<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:24.240> at

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
to ruin the flavor of the ghee but at

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.820 
to ruin the flavor of the ghee but at
the<00:01:24.479> same<00:01:24.690> time<00:01:24.899> we<00:01:25.110> want<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.500> all<00:01:25.649> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the same time we want to get all the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.779 
the same time we want to get all the
water<00:01:25.979> out<00:01:26.390> number<00:01:27.390> one<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.440> that<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.550> will

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
water out number one so that it will

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.139 
water out number one so that it will
stay<00:01:30.090> good<00:01:30.350> for<00:01:31.350> many<00:01:31.679> months<00:01:31.970> without<00:01:32.970> any

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
stay good for many months without any

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.080 
stay good for many months without any
preservation<00:01:33.630> or<00:01:34.200> refrigeration<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
preservation or refrigeration and the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.529 
preservation or refrigeration and the
other<00:01:36.330> thing<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:37.220> that<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:39.030> we<00:01:39.179> use<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.509> for

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
other thing is that when we use it for

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:46.480 
other thing is that when we use it for
frying<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.619> won't<00:01:40.950> have<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> lot<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:43.369> steam<00:01:44.369> or

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
frying it won't have a lot of steam or

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.219 
frying it won't have a lot of steam or
moisture<00:01:47.490> still<00:01:47.849> left<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.630> don't<00:01:49.170> know

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
moisture still left in it I don't know

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.870 
moisture still left in it I don't know
if<00:01:49.319> you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.560> see<00:01:49.800> this<00:01:49.979> here<00:01:50.310> I'm<00:01:50.520> going<00:01:50.789> to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
if you can see this here I'm going to

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.300 
if you can see this here I'm going to
zoom<00:01:50.910> in<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> little<00:01:51.810> bit<00:01:55.069> but<00:01:56.069> there's

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
zoom in on a little bit but there's

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.609 
zoom in on a little bit but there's
already<00:01:56.580> water<00:01:57.119> bubbles<00:01:57.599> or<00:01:57.810> steam<00:01:58.170> bubbles

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
already water bubbles or steam bubbles

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.990 
already water bubbles or steam bubbles
coming<00:01:59.039> up<00:01:59.450> here<00:02:00.450> from<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.929> bottom<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:05.000> as

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
coming up here from the bottom and as

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.430 
coming up here from the bottom and as
the<00:02:06.209> ghee<00:02:06.390> heats<00:02:06.690> up<00:02:06.929> we're<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.319> get

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
the ghee heats up we're going to get

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.479 
the ghee heats up we're going to get
more<00:02:07.679> and<00:02:07.800> more<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.130> those<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.890> can<00:02:11.069> see<00:02:11.280> those

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
more and more of those you can see those

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.870 
more and more of those you can see those
little<00:02:12.410> flecks<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.800> stuff<00:02:14.250> floating<00:02:14.550> around

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
little flecks of stuff floating around

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.510 
little flecks of stuff floating around
those<00:02:15.840> are<00:02:16.050> just<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.440> few<00:02:16.890> impurities<00:02:17.489> that

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
those are just the few impurities that

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.760 
those are just the few impurities that
are<00:02:17.730> left<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.330> as<00:02:18.900> they<00:02:19.080> cook<00:02:19.319> off<00:02:19.530> their

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
are left and as they cook off their

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.190 
are left and as they cook off their
water<00:02:19.980> they<00:02:20.760> are<00:02:20.940> going<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.450> sink<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.989> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
water they are going to sink to the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.820 
water they are going to sink to the
bottom<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.680> pan<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.930> as<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.379> geek<00:02:25.590> gets

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
bottom of the pan so as the geek gets

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.760 
bottom of the pan so as the geek gets
hotter<00:02:26.330> you're<00:02:27.330> going<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:29.690> reduce

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
hotter you're going to have to reduce

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.690 
hotter you're going to have to reduce
the<00:02:31.770> heat<00:02:32.580> in<00:02:33.060> order<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.200> keep<00:02:34.379> those<00:02:34.700> pieces

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
the heat in order to keep those pieces

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.390 
the heat in order to keep those pieces
of<00:02:35.910> impurities<00:02:36.900> on<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.410> bottom<00:02:37.770> from<00:02:38.040> burning

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
of impurities on the bottom from burning

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.970 
of impurities on the bottom from burning
and<00:02:39.200> ruining<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.290> flavor<00:02:40.819> but<00:02:41.819> now<00:02:42.090> these

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
and ruining the flavor but now these

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.099 
and ruining the flavor but now these
pieces<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.310> impurities<00:02:44.940> are<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.360> sticking

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
pieces of impurities are like sticking

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.720 
pieces of impurities are like sticking
to<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.349> bottom

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:03:01.170 

see<00:02:49.269> down<00:02:49.540> here<00:02:49.930> oh<00:02:50.670> my<00:02:51.670> wet<00:02:51.849> spoon<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:01.030> is

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
see down here oh my wet spoon this is

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.070 
see down here oh my wet spoon this is
pretty<00:03:01.420> clean<00:03:01.780> G<00:03:03.390> usually<00:03:04.390> there's<00:03:04.629> quite<00:03:05.049> a

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
pretty clean G usually there's quite a

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.759 
pretty clean G usually there's quite a
bit<00:03:05.200> more<00:03:05.379> of<00:03:05.620> stuff<00:03:06.069> in<00:03:06.250> suspension<00:03:07.769> that

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
bit more of stuff in suspension that

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.430 
bit more of stuff in suspension that
cooks<00:03:09.099> out<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.610> sticks<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.180> bottom<00:03:10.440> but

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
cooks out and sticks to the bottom but

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.130 
cooks out and sticks to the bottom but
even<00:03:11.709> so<00:03:11.980> we'll<00:03:12.730> still<00:03:13.060> need<00:03:13.269> to<00:03:13.480> let<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.810> cool

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
even so we'll still need to let it cool

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.729 
even so we'll still need to let it cool
and<00:03:15.299> all<00:03:16.299> those<00:03:16.510> little<00:03:16.690> pieces<00:03:16.989> fall<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.650> the

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
and all those little pieces fall to the

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.199 
and all those little pieces fall to the
bottom<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.190> then<00:03:18.310> we'll<00:03:18.489> pour<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.849> off<00:03:18.970> one

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
bottom and then we'll pour it off one

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.220 
bottom and then we'll pour it off one
more<00:03:19.360> time<00:03:19.420> at<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.959> end<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:22.810> know<00:03:22.959> when<00:03:23.110> the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
more time at the end you know when the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.970 
more time at the end you know when the
ghee<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.530> done<00:03:23.739> when<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.099> turns<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.519> slightly

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
ghee is done when it turns a slightly

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.069 
ghee is done when it turns a slightly
more<00:03:26.980> golden<00:03:27.519> dark<00:03:27.940> color<00:03:28.329> and<00:03:28.629> you<00:03:28.720> see<00:03:28.930> the

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
more golden dark color and you see the

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.580 
more golden dark color and you see the
spoon<00:03:29.379> making<00:03:29.920> bubbles<00:03:31.140> that's<00:03:32.140> from<00:03:32.470> the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
spoon making bubbles that's from the

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.619 
spoon making bubbles that's from the
moisture<00:03:33.069> in<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.310> spoon<00:03:33.609> so<00:03:34.269> you<00:03:34.359> know<00:03:34.599> that

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
moisture in the spoon so you know that

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.330 
moisture in the spoon so you know that
the<00:03:34.930> temperature<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.620> key<00:03:35.769> is<00:03:35.829> above<00:03:36.040> the

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
the temperature of the key is above the

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.330 
the temperature of the key is above the
boiling<00:03:36.489> point<00:03:36.879> of<00:03:37.030> water<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:38.799> that<00:03:39.040> means

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
boiling point of water and that means

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.520 
boiling point of water and that means
that<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:40.209> moisture<00:03:40.660> is<00:03:40.780> pretty<00:03:41.049> much<00:03:41.230> cooked

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
that the moisture is pretty much cooked

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.650 
that the moisture is pretty much cooked
out<00:03:41.709> so<00:03:42.280> we<00:03:42.430> turn<00:03:42.670> off<00:03:42.879> the<00:03:43.060> flame<00:03:43.299> at<00:03:43.480> this

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
out so we turn off the flame at this

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.839 
out so we turn off the flame at this
point<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.200> let<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:44.620> cool<00:03:44.950> get<00:03:45.340> ready<00:03:45.549> for<00:03:45.790> the

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
point and let it cool get ready for the

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.580 
point and let it cool get ready for the
final<00:03:46.239> pour<00:03:46.480> off

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.759 

okay<00:03:52.430> so<00:03:52.489> now<00:03:52.819> we're<00:03:53.030> going<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.360> merge<00:03:53.769> the

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
okay so now we're going to merge the

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.380 
okay so now we're going to merge the
ghee<00:03:54.980> we<00:03:55.160> just<00:03:55.430> made<00:03:55.930> with<00:03:56.930> our<00:03:57.459> supply<00:03:58.459> of

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390

this d that we get from it and the
solids<00:04:08.390> last<00:04:08.690> us<00:04:08.959> about<00:04:09.230> a<00:04:09.290> month<00:04:09.819> it<00:04:10.819> was<00:04:11.260> 500

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
solids last us about a month it was 500

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.039 
solids last us about a month it was 500
Brahma<00:04:12.500> cherries<00:04:13.930> so<00:04:15.040> that's<00:04:16.040> it<00:04:16.840> that's<00:04:17.840> the

Brahma cherries so that's it that's the

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.670 
Brahma cherries so that's it that's the
process<00:04:18.620> of<00:04:18.889> how<00:04:19.040> G<00:04:19.340> is<00:04:19.519> made<00:04:19.790> and<00:04:20.109> then<00:04:21.109> in<00:04:21.530> the

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
process of how G is made and then in the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.980
