00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
the bearish camp of course we have the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.950 
the bearish camp of course we have the
FOMC<00:00:56.070> meeting<00:00:56.250> next<00:00:56.640> week<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.270> word<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.750> what

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
seems like forever taper is always being

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.020 
seems like forever taper is always being
mentioned<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> expect<00:01:02.579> coming

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
mentioned what what do you expect coming

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.939 
mentioned what what do you expect coming
out<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> meetings<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.960> what<00:01:04.229> if<00:01:04.589> they<00:01:04.890> do

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
out of the meetings and what if they do

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.770 
out of the meetings and what if they do
taper<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:05.670> could<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> price<00:01:06.570> of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
taper what could this do to the price of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.399 
taper what could this do to the price of
gold<00:01:06.930> Alex<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.680> think<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.630> much<00:01:09.630> talked<00:01:10.020> about

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
gold Alex I think the much talked about

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.490 
gold Alex I think the much talked about
for<00:01:10.860> many<00:01:11.040> weeks<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.880> even<00:01:11.909> months<00:01:12.500> tapering

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
for many weeks or even months tapering

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.140 
for many weeks or even months tapering
is<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:16.850> significant<00:01:17.850> impact

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
is is going to have a significant impact

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.100 
is is going to have a significant impact
on<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.729> many<00:01:21.030> markets<00:01:21.509> including<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
on the on many markets including the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.490 
on the on many markets including the
precious<00:01:22.500> metals<00:01:22.939> going<00:01:23.939> forward<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.170> fact

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
precious metals going forward the fact

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.649 
precious metals going forward the fact
is<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:26.930> factored<00:01:29.240> tapering<00:01:30.240> whether<00:01:30.479> it

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
is we have factored tapering whether it

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.569 
is we have factored tapering whether it
occurs<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:31.110> December<00:01:31.619> or<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.920> first<00:01:32.159> quarter

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
occurs in December or the first quarter

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.539 
occurs in December or the first quarter
of<00:01:32.610> 25<00:01:33.210> 2014<00:01:33.750> that's<00:01:34.470> that's<00:01:34.890> been<00:01:35.100> factored

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
of 25 2014 that's that's been factored

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.480 
of 25 2014 that's that's been factored
into<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> marketplace<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:37.280> going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.460> a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
into the marketplace and going to have a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.060 
into the marketplace and going to have a
minimal<00:01:38.880> impact<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.540> rice<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.710> course<00:01:40.740> we

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
minimal impact on rice and of course we

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.039 
minimal impact on rice and of course we
also<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.790> potential<00:01:42.210> budget<00:01:42.509> deal<00:01:42.810> that

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
also have the potential budget deal that

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.560 
also have the potential budget deal that
could<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.409> struck<00:01:43.740> by<00:01:44.100> US<00:01:44.670> government<00:01:45.149> before

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
could be struck by US government before

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.139 
could be struck by US government before
the<00:01:45.810> year<00:01:45.930> closes<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.560> should<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:47.549> reach<00:01:47.850> an

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the year closes out should they reach an

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.700 
the year closes out should they reach an
accord<00:01:48.479> for<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:48.930> deal<00:01:49.229> what<00:01:49.530> could<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
accord for this deal what could that

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.069 
accord for this deal what could that
mean<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.250> gold<00:01:50.430> prices<00:01:50.700> moving<00:01:51.180> forward<00:01:51.570> well

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
mean for gold prices moving forward well

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.910 
mean for gold prices moving forward well
Alex<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.920> think<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.240> hardly<00:01:54.810> be<00:01:55.020> attributed

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
Alex I think it can hardly be attributed

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.249 
Alex I think it can hardly be attributed
to the<00:01:56.369> weakness<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.939> gold<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.689> Thursday

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
to the weakness in gold we see Thursday

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.679 
to the weakness in gold we see Thursday
ah<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:59.520> budget<00:02:00.479> agreement<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:02.030> takes<00:02:03.030> away<00:02:03.210> an

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
ah the budget agreement of takes away an

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.810 
ah the budget agreement of takes away an

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.290 
we've seen a very quiet geopolitical
front<00:05:27.229> the<00:05:27.379> past<00:05:27.650> few<00:05:28.280> months<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.759> I<00:05:28.819> suspect

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
front the past few months and I suspect

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.120 
front the past few months and I suspect
that's<00:05:29.449> going<00:05:29.719> to<00:05:29.780> change<00:05:30.020> in<00:05:30.259> 2014<00:05:30.919> just

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
that's going to change in 2014 just

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.749 
that's going to change in 2014 just
because<00:05:31.460> history<00:05:31.880> shows<00:05:32.630> it<00:05:32.870> will<00:05:33.050> uh<00:05:33.729> so<00:05:34.729> I

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 
because history shows it will uh so I

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.249 
because history shows it will uh so I
suspect<00:05:35.389> that<00:05:35.479> if<00:05:35.630> we<00:05:35.750> do<00:05:35.900> have<00:05:36.080> some

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:36.259 
suspect that if we do have some

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.020 
suspect that if we do have some
