00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.819
 Off-road four-wheeler with loading area 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:14.769
 the US asked us for picture z 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.249
 Two tickets from the Far East should be the end 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.839
 Double cabin comfortable interior 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.220
 and start the are worth seeing 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.699
 Family fitness and 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.699
 even some water 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.120
 The Nissan Navarra and the Mitsubishi L200 are Germany's best of its kind 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.120
 under the off-road trucks 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.180
 the Mitsubishi l200 is modern and comfortable in the third generation 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.360
 threatening the SP is available to the bassist circle a pickup with his 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.360
 Equipment is very cheap 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.130
 The Nissan offers significantly more power and larger retail space 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.130
 but also for a higher price 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.710
 the Nissan consumes a bit more fuel than its counterpart but thanks 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.180
 larger tank at the same range 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.829
 Acceleration and draft are much better thanks to GPS 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.790
 80% of the pickups are mainly used privately 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.820
 besides practical will also be on this 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.420
 with its edges and five meters 22 in length, the Nissan Navarra is one 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.970
 powerful appearance 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.710
 the double cabin can accommodate five but it goes to the rear 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.110
 Places very close to 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.710
 more than short-haul then hardly goes 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.610
 on the other hand we have to give the occupants a lot of space even in the wide 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.610
 the cockpit looks excited then says 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.390
 the four-wheel drive is electrically switchable the air conditioning costs 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.390
 additional charge 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.510
 the footboard is not really necessary for entry and sets the terrain 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.510
 first off 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:25.339
 the large cargo area of ​​the Navarra measures in the diagonal a proud 2 meters 10 and 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.339
 can accommodate a full seven bales of straw 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:39.399
 the Mitsubishi's diagonal is 26 centimeters shorter than just five straw bales 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.399
 can be accommodated here 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.609
 the new l200 is very modern design for a pickup 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.129
 the lines were agreed by Mitsubishi 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.629
 Again, the footboard is more chic than practical 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:06.449
 Almost relaxed can travel from the passengers for there's front 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.539
 less space 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:12.599
 the interior is a looker in the shape of blue fittings 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.209
 no trucks but with cars had 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.709
 Climate costs also with Mitsubishi surcharge 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.279
 permanently a rate central differential is see in this case 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.170
 a nice gimmick 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.170
 the electrically retractable rear window 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.349
 the modern time of the monkey 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.019
 and suffers from one clearly 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.019
 at least he meets the euro with particle filter 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.859
 top without and also without filter 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:03.029
 the clubs have to prove themselves in the field 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:07.619
 the Nissan is longer than a s-class wheelbase gigantic that sets 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:10.619
 especially with footboard borders on and on Coptic 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.600
 that spares and raced angles are better on the shorter Mitsubishi L200 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.509
 But that does not mean that he is the nose in the terrain properties 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:25.509
 has in front 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.370
 short hedgehog from the German all-wheel-drive association finds out for us which look on 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.229
 the better off-roader is 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.050
 the Nissan Navarra immediately convinces him with his more extreme reduction 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.509
 the eve here 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.349
 the reduction 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:47.449
 mead 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.340
 Soto come 67 absolutely 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.499
 Perfect 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.979
 steep uphill places are possible here 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.789
 without them ever having to operate 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.520
 the mother the athlete completely alone 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.319
 that's terribly fun the car is always steers order 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.629
 and gives a lot of security 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:11.399
 in terms of terrain reduction, the l200 can not compete with others 

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:12.830
 qualities 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.479
 up here in the off road terrain 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.479
 with a return in the ratio 1 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.059
 Pommer 9 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:24.099
 it's a little less it could be a little better 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.960
 Mor Fiedler in relation to Nissan Navarra the shorter one 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.009
 the entanglement is quite neat, but the handling is very 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.800
 to drive comfortably on the premises 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.270
 we need a bit of a brake 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.180
 which basically leads to something more rek / afp the front axle leads 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.639
 Walldorf the slope angle is reduced slightly not necessarily positive 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:51.969
 but overall, even heavy terrain replacement drug may I 

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:58.909
 the Nissan Navarra beats despite a huge wheelbase and that much 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:02.179
 too soon putting on footboards in the terrain surprisingly good 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.990
 the handling is quite similar to Daimler Mitsubishi 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:12.729
 in which 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.039
 the NADA becomes a Petersburg Tiger 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:19.789
 and not and so comfortably Lenz goes into the terrain and also on the road 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:24.610
 Graner did not keep up with the previous Mitsubishi L200 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.980
 4 it is one during the approx 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.139
 the Mitsubishi L200 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:34.819
 50 millimeters more far 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:36.349
 Kievans can exhibit 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:40.059
 and also at the front a slightly better angle of repose Matter is like 

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:42.740
 expected with St 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.409
 Nevertheless 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:46.999
 determine wesseling-urfeld 

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:50.090
 that the Nissan makes a slightly more compact impression here 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:53.719
 Woman with the off road rating 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:56.719
 decides for itself 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:02.749
 Overall, the Mitsubishi has l200 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:06.849
 Equipment safety and environment ahead 

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:11.110
 many of his partners at his expense 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.789
 both offer plenty of Picard own driving pleasure
