00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:07.430 
get the explosiveness out of our lower

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.850 
get the explosiveness out of our lower
half<00:00:07.930> there<00:00:08.930> are<00:00:09.049> some<00:00:09.230> things<00:00:09.440> that<00:00:09.590> we<00:00:09.709> can

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
half there are some things that we can

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.950 
half there are some things that we can
do<00:00:09.950> to<00:00:10.070> work<00:00:10.190> on<00:00:10.429> it<00:00:10.610> so<00:00:10.820> the<00:00:11.269> common<00:00:11.599> problem

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
do to work on it so the common problem

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.890 
do to work on it so the common problem
is<00:00:12.080> guys<00:00:12.400> get<00:00:13.400> around<00:00:13.639> the<00:00:13.790> ball<00:00:13.969> squashing

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
is guys get around the ball squashing

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.710 
is guys get around the ball squashing
the<00:00:14.990> bug<00:00:15.230> or<00:00:16.040> just<00:00:16.250> simply<00:00:16.550> standing<00:00:17.150> up<00:00:17.300> they

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
the bug or just simply standing up they

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.139 
the bug or just simply standing up they
go<00:00:17.869> to<00:00:17.930> swing<00:00:18.320> and<00:00:18.649> they<00:00:18.710> get<00:00:18.890> tall<00:00:19.130> and<00:00:19.520> so

00:00:20.139 --> 00:00:20.149 
go to swing and they get tall and so

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:22.210 
go to swing and they get tall and so
that's<00:00:20.329> truly<00:00:21.020> common<00:00:21.500> thing<00:00:21.680> but<00:00:21.890> when<00:00:22.070> that

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
that's truly common thing but when that

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.249 
that's truly common thing but when that
happens<00:00:22.610> you're<00:00:23.090> not<00:00:23.119> utilizing<00:00:23.720> your<00:00:24.020> back

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
happens you're not utilizing your back

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:25.690 
happens you're not utilizing your back
leg<00:00:24.529> you're<00:00:24.739> not<00:00:24.890> getting<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:25.250> power<00:00:25.489> your

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
leg you're not getting the power your

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.720 
leg you're not getting the power your
back<00:00:25.880> side<00:00:26.169> thereby<00:00:27.169> losing<00:00:27.590> a<00:00:28.070> ton<00:00:28.399> of<00:00:28.460> back

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
back side thereby losing a ton of back

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.670 
back side thereby losing a ton of back
speed<00:00:29.059> that<00:00:29.210> we<00:00:29.360> could<00:00:29.570> potentially<00:00:29.869> have<00:00:30.349> and

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
speed that we could potentially have and

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.310 
speed that we could potentially have and
so<00:00:31.419> what<00:00:32.419> I<00:00:32.450> like<00:00:32.689> to<00:00:32.870> do<00:00:32.989> in<00:00:33.110> that<00:00:33.260> case

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
so what I like to do in that case

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.189 
so what I like to do in that case
instead<00:00:33.829> of<00:00:34.070> saying<00:00:34.359> Bakula<00:00:35.359> Scott<00:00:35.660> I<00:00:35.839> feel<00:00:36.170> Oh

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
instead of saying Bakula Scott I feel Oh

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.579 
instead of saying Bakula Scott I feel Oh
Scott<00:00:36.789> stay<00:00:37.789> down<00:00:38.030> stay<00:00:38.269> down<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:38.899> verbal

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:39.589 
Scott stay down stay down and verbal

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:41.439 
Scott stay down stay down and verbal
cues<00:00:39.829> a<00:00:39.980> lot<00:00:40.160> of<00:00:40.280> times<00:00:40.489> kids<00:00:40.820> don't<00:00:40.940> respond

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
cues a lot of times kids don't respond

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:42.099 
cues a lot of times kids don't respond
to<00:00:41.570> that

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
to that

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.049 
to that
there's<00:00:42.530> no<00:00:42.710> respond<00:00:43.100> to<00:00:43.190> that<00:00:43.339> because<00:00:43.850> it's

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
there's no respond to that because it's

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.479 
there's no respond to that because it's
hard<00:00:44.239> for<00:00:44.329> them<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:44.539> see<00:00:44.839> and<00:00:45.170> but<00:00:45.800> if<00:00:46.100> you<00:00:46.339> can

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
hard for them to see and but if you can

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
this drill and this really exaggeration

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.439 
this drill and this really exaggeration
really<00:01:00.229> works<00:01:00.469> on<00:01:00.940> driving<00:01:01.940> that<00:01:02.059> back<00:01:02.269> knee

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
really works on driving that back knee
