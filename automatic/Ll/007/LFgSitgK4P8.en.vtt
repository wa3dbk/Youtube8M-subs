 a rich bouquet of spices while not 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:04.300
 allowing you to dominate none of them 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.450

 Christmas trees and aftertaste such 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:31.780
 such a slight aftertaste needles 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:34.780
 when q7 is an apple 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.720
 I certainly read something still for 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.700
 drink this gin which is used in 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.370
 its pure form of course few 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:47.530
 rarely consumed drink this gin in 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.410
 it is mainly used for making 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:55.390
 cocktails with something somewhere its 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:59.650
 this drink is added a good thing a 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:04.750
 this is the way the watermelon that grew in our 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.310
 Yaroslavl in the country very likely probably 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.480

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:21.190
 harmful substances most likely here on 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.819
 one hundred percent is not and I'll pour 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.670
 a little bit 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.670
 of this aristocratic drink 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.340
 before use 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.950
 its certainly recommended to cool it 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.120
 didn't really cool much because 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.400
 when drink 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:51.680
 cools less than 10 to 10 degrees 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.680
 then the taste does not reveal these drinks 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.080
 very specific drink 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.080
 delicious tasty drink 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:22.539
 Now at the same time and taste the watermelon to 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.539
 a hat 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:32.250
 whether knife stupid whether leather jacket 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.250
 this watermelon so 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.990
 That looks like a pale look of course 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.900
 garbuz 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.660
 but of course the money is not there not in the warm 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.890
 countries did not grow up dreaming of warm countries 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:05.860
 warm lands in the Yaroslavl region 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.860

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:30.460
 honestly creepy crap that year 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.460
 watermelons were much tastier 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:45.330
 which by the way were also grown here 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:50.100
 there is no sweetness at the cottage 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:56.340
 that melons are such steaming here they are 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:59.820
