00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.750
 ideal mayonnaise sauce with citrus 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.209
 we are going to use oil that we will use 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.730
 half olive oil half 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.150
 of sunflower oil ideal evaporated milk 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.239
 some avocados some parsley one 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.779
 apple the citrus in this case a 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:30.609
 orange and lemon some prawns and a 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.859
 little bit of paprika will start 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.469
 preparing the mayonnaise that I eat 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.960
 he commented is in equal proportion of 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.929
 olive oil and sunflower oil 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.240
 evaporated milk let's add the 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:46.750
 milk 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.400
 to 100 milliliters a pinch of salt 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:54.340
 and we are going to beat the 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.340
 we leave in my work and we understand 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.550
 we have a ready mayonnaise and now we're going 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.550
 to add citrus 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.750
 and we will put a splash of lemon 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.430
 We reserve the rest of the lemon for the 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.120
 avocado and for the apple so that it 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.420
 Oxidize is an antioxidant 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.430
 and we will add 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.260
 a splash of orange juice 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.050
 you can add a little bit of grated 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.730
 orange and some aromatic herbs in 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.070
 this case we will put parsley but you 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.510
 combines the chive very well or 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.170
 any herbs that you have at home 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.620
 that fresh grass we add the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.620
 parsley 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.880
 we mix everything well 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.880
 and I'm going to take it to the fridge while 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.680
 I finish preparing the whole dish 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.939
 We continue sautÃ©ing the prawns in a 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.520
 little oil a pan well 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.679
 you can use the prawns 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.679
 fresh frozen what you have better 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.270
 the poplars lightly 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.820
 and we take them out because the bed needs a 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.220
 minute minutes per side enough them 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.080
 add a pinch of paprika 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.910
 and retired to avoid burning 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.590
 you can use sweet paprika or 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.580
 peppers 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.569
 spicy and we are going to chop the 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.569
 we will reserve 4 for decoration 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.890
 let's see and let them cool 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.300
 we will continue with the apple 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.100
 let's paste it and the rai we will 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.400
 we will use the big part of 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.400
 radiator 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.940
 well once we have the grated apple 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.360
 and we sprinkle it with the lemon juice for 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.360
 that does not rust 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.330
 a few drops and we mix well let's 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.330
 continue opening the avocados 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.800
 and we are going to remove the bone for it 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.800
 we are going to give a blow like that 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.680
 and we remove it with the help of a spoon 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.950
 we made them and we are going to cut them in 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.950
 dice 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:29.750
 we will reserve it for the presentation 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.260
 Now we will cut the avocado into cubes 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.260
 ah 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.270
 the avocado you have to try to make it 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.920
 mature but do not fall apart because if 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.500
 the salad would not be well assembled 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.720
 I already have the chopped avocado and we're going 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.540
 to add a little lemon so that 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.170
 it rusts like the apple 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.170
 we will incorporate the prawns 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.030
 I'm going to mix carefully 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.580
 in delicate avocados and there would not be a 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.140
 pasta would look more like a guacamole 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.140
 let's add the ideal mayonnaise 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.700
 a little pepper 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.579
 and we mix 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.420
 with this preparation we are going to fill 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.420
 the avocados 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.510
 this fresh salad you can add 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.070
 crab or you could add bulls already 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.900
 we ready our first dish 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.200
 Christmas, we are going to spend 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.700
 first we will put the prawns you can 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.220
 decorate when with any ingredient 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.090
 that they have installed we are going to serve it 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.090
 with the orange slices 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.700
 we have it ready we place it decorate 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.030
 with the orange slices 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.550
 and now to accompany me I'm going to show you my 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.290
 corner I have here these little plants that 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.090
 are and aromatic herbs you can 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.890
 use to cook to cook or 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.590
 even to decorate we take a 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.420
 parsley tool 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.380
 and we accompany the dish
