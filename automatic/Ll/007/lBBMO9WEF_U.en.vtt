00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:08.320
 good this video tutorials so that 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.430
 can play a class without any error 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.890
 so that they forget about the errors of 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:17.789
 others then let's start 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.529
 suppose what 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.449
 we're just going to install the game 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.980
 then we have it here in the unit 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.220
 others but this has to mount what 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.270
 hides a lot why 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.330
 also in images 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.150
 here are then this unit of living 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.090
 this window neither the cac and everything then 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.860
 they give him setup 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.000
 and it gives you next following next me 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.700
 I do not install it because I already have it 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.610
 installed when everything is already installed 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 he creates a shortcut that says other 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.300
 which is in this case this one that is here or 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.050
 after this access 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.530
 although then when the access is already 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.579
 we are going to give it 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.640
 Right click to access properties open 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.070
 Location and location of the true 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.780
 is going to be here this is the location of 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.600
 true outlast launcher 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.950
 then good when to other launcher 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.900
 there are so many going to go as a 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.900
 reading direct and install it 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.020
 direct that they read install it and if 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.300
 then he will visit the world that will be 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.370
 because they no longer have 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.460
 so then they install it and then they are 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.130
 average this and the operating system that 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.610
 you have to have is 64 have 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.280
 because because that is to say so the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.590
 real ecosystem of the game then the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.520
 game in 64 works perfectly in 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.280
 32 which in this case is being 186 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.710
 it works horrible and causes so terrible 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.870
 mistakes almost that many then improved 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.159
 the regulatory operating system 64 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.170
 I recommend it 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.540
 and this is already next to the 64 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.150
 then we go 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.320
 to crack the game then it would come 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.180
 being this 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:15.540
 linares and 64 because we have the 64 us 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.270
 says to 203 and this has so much then 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.130
 this this see is not just with a dental 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.380
 against 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.490
 Right click to copy will go to the 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.780
 other game folder and says binary 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.470
 then it says very well 64 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.560
 and here comes and then lens where 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.690
 paste 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.340
 then they sell him to hit when he 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.819
 They are going to stay here where it says 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.700
 ali 213 this al and they are going to have to 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.650
 modify it he will be english then 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.400
 they put it in Spain so that the game 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.220
 place in Spanish 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.090
 then he places it in Spain and they give him 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.010
 save that file is saved save it 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.480
 in the downloads folder because this 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.980
 here it is not automatically saved like this 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.069
 that the download folder is saved 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.200
 and then they pass it in the folder 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.239
 of downloads cut it from there and then what 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.400
 stick again here as long as you have 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.159
 to be in spanish 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.870
 when it is in Spain and already the only thing 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.260
 touches is the game launcher but what 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.629
 happens this launcher here is this 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.519
 Lunch does not serve us as our 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.189
 64's systems that we go here where 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.260
 Ali and we stick to me olga says 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:32.799
 that you then to this one we create 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.540
 a shortcut and we paste it there and 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.430
 this is going to be our new launcher that 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.560
 in this case, this is what 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.860
 they signed 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.470
 I'm here in this place 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.550
 ready then it will be in Spanish and without 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.240
 no mistake 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.900
 so then they see what 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.670
 we will send a launcher 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.440
 a moment just to see 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.550
 that the language is in Spanish 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.550
 and without errors 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.810
 likewise because the game already already 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:13.569
 I passed it then so that they go 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.569
 so they know there are no mistakes 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:23.660
 realistic says look they want to continue 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:27.540
 new heading and load in options 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.600
 you can modify the graph of the 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.150
 graphic is modified 80 800 x 80 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.810
 600 because the graphics card have me 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.120
 accelerated now 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.450
 It's not the last desert coca cola 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.009
 so good until I get there is 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.589
 continue and come 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.639
 and this was the video tutorial I hope 

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:47.639
 what they like 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.760
 and until next time
