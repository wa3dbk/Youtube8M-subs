there<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.570> get<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:21.960> gate<00:00:22.230> are

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
there you get you to the gate are

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.990 
there you get you to the gate are

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
like said estonian r XR income which

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.300 
like said estonian r XR income which
which<00:00:27.539> has<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:28.019> similar<00:00:28.260> sensor<00:00:28.800> similar<00:00:29.130> sized

which has a similar sensor similar sized

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.919 
which has a similar sensor similar sized
sensor<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.820> what<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:29.970> does<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.810> allows

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.340 
gallery is actually pretty interesting
but<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.570> guess<00:01:51.690> I'll<00:01:51.810> show<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.080> up<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.260> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
but I guess I'll show you that up to the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.080 
but I guess I'll show you that up to the
camera<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.160> click<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.370> on<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.550> camera<00:01:53.700> will

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
camera so click it on the camera will

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.810 
camera so click it on the camera will
open<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.540> designing<00:01:55.110> engineering<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.610> you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
open up designing engineering and you

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.670 
open up designing engineering and you
can<00:01:56.970> see<00:01:57.120> it<00:01:57.240> protrudes<00:01:57.630> slightly<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.470> it

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
can see it protrudes slightly so it

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.710 
can see it protrudes slightly so it
doesn't<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.550> a<00:02:00.020> cool<00:02:01.580> optical<00:02:02.580> zoom<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.570> it's

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
doesn't have a cool optical zoom so it's

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.410 
doesn't have a cool optical zoom so it's
all<00:02:03.870> going<00:02:04.080> to<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.170> digital<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:06.180> photo

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
all going to be digital but the photo

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.850 
all going to be digital but the photo
folders<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:06.990> awesome<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.470> just<00:02:07.590> means<00:02:07.710> you

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
folders can be awesome it just means you

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.070 
folders can be awesome it just means you
have<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.040> walk<00:02:08.790> up<00:02:08.820> closer<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.450> your<00:02:09.570> subject<00:02:09.720> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
have to walk up closer to your subject I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.680 
have to walk up closer to your subject I
guess<00:02:10.260> to<00:02:10.350> get<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.500> clean<00:02:10.740> shot<00:02:11.480> hard<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.600> do

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
guess to get a clean shot hard to do

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.320 
guess to get a clean shot hard to do
this<00:02:12.780> with<00:02:12.930> one<00:02:13.020> hand<00:02:13.080> but<00:02:13.940> quick<00:02:14.940> money<00:02:15.150> you

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
this with one hand but quick money you

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.760 
this with one hand but quick money you
can<00:02:15.480> see<00:02:15.630> there's<00:02:15.810> different<00:02:16.380> settings

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
can see there's different settings

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.130 
can see there's different settings
obviously<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:18.000> whole<00:02:18.209> lot<00:02:18.360> more<00:02:18.570> than<00:02:18.900> you

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
obviously a whole lot more than you

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.810 
obviously a whole lot more than you
would<00:02:19.290> have<00:02:19.350> on<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> typical<00:02:20.130> Android<00:02:20.610> device

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
would have on a typical Android device

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.660 
would have on a typical Android device
but<00:02:21.530> pretty<00:02:22.530> much<00:02:22.590> anyone<00:02:23.160> who's<00:02:23.280> from<00:02:23.430> at<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
but pretty much anyone who's from at the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.940 
but pretty much anyone who's from at the
point<00:02:23.880> shoot<00:02:24.090> camera<00:02:24.120> will<00:02:24.570> have<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.590> basic

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
point shoot camera will have the basic

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.720 
point shoot camera will have the basic
features<00:02:26.310> here<00:02:27.150> with<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.450> lumix<00:02:27.810> gm1<00:02:28.730> my

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
features here with the lumix gm1 my

shutter<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.360> really<00:02:30.690> quick<00:02:30.900> as<00:02:31.050> well<00:02:31.230> so

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
shutter is really quick as well so

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.760 
shutter is really quick as well so
you're<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.250> meeting<00:02:32.520> up<00:02:32.730> some<00:02:33.000> photos

all right and I think it's processing

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.140 
all right and I think it's processing
because<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.800> put<00:02:39.250> some<00:02:39.460> weird<00:02:39.670> study<00:02:39.940> now<00:02:40.120> I

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
because I put some weird study now I

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.660 
because I put some weird study now I
have<00:02:40.360> HDR<00:02:40.840> something<00:02:41.470> doing<00:02:41.680> me<00:02:41.890> weird

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
have HDR something doing me weird

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.070 
have HDR something doing me weird

beautiful<00:02:59.190> right<00:03:00.190> now<00:03:00.220> they're<00:03:01.320> they're

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
planning they're hoping she released

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.000 
planning they're hoping she released
this<00:03:04.150> in<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.450> US<00:03:04.720> by<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.080> end<00:03:05.440> of<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.770> year

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
this in the US by the end of the year

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.980 
this in the US by the end of the year
although<00:03:06.760> you<00:03:07.060> know<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.270> carrier<00:03:07.600> approval

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
although you know the carrier approval

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.240 
although you know the carrier approval
process<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.500> all<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:08.650> stuff<00:03:08.740> makes<00:03:08.980> things

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
process and all that stuff makes things

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.070 
process and all that stuff makes things
a<00:03:09.310> little<00:03:09.490> bit<00:03:09.640> more<00:03:09.790> difficult<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.270> there's<00:03:11.020> a

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
a little bit more difficult so there's a

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.360 
a little bit more difficult so there's a
lot<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.230> red<00:03:11.500> tape<00:03:11.530> as<00:03:11.920> far<00:03:12.100> as<00:03:12.220> that's

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
lot of red tape as far as that's

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.450 
lot of red tape as far as that's
concerned<00:03:14.010> hopefully<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.100> conditional

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
concerned hopefully the conditional

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.560 
concerned hopefully the conditional
isn't<00:03:15.670> unlocked<00:03:15.880> version<00:03:16.150> or<00:03:16.240> something<00:03:16.510> you

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
isn't unlocked version or something you

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.880 
isn't unlocked version or something you
can<00:03:16.720> probably<00:03:16.870> get<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.170> like<00:03:17.320> without<00:03:17.470> leave

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
can probably get it like without leave

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.090 
can probably get it like without leave
everything<00:03:18.100> on<00:03:18.280> 80<00:03:18.580> mph<00:03:19.060> but<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:20.320> is<00:03:20.530> just<00:03:20.680> a
