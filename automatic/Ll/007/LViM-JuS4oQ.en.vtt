00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 In 1983, Nintendo launched its console 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.230
 begins the third generation 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.540
 video games with your 8-bit console 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.790
 or little nintendinho and with this new age of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.799
 charts have appeared other consoles to 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.010
 compete with a blind with your master 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.810
 system and the attack with the atari 7800 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.090
 but as everyone is already tired of 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.070
 to know nintendo was a leader in sales and 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.119
 even the dominating nintendo at that time 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.609
 the world of games 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.500
 they did not stop to innovate and together with the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.679
 nerso girÃ£o famous known franchises 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.570
 until today and also the famous accessories 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.480
 that many already know that not all of them 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.760
 they were so successful on the channel I already spoke 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.129
 of the power glove failure in that video 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.660
 I quickly feel other accessories and 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.730
 one of them that caught the attention of 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.800
 you were a hobby the little robot 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.850
 nintendo and in today's video let's know 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.029
 more about it 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.029
 [Music] 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.990
 the obvious the best robotic and operational 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.760
 bari was released in 1985 in Japan and 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.199
 also in North America and if the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.270
 The goal was for him to be a 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.040
 player or in our language the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.790
 robot to play with a child forever 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 alone 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.990
 he stole my big one in 24 centimeters 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.150
 height and functioned by means of 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.100
 flashes of light emitted by the game by 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.140
 television that hits the eyes of the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.330
 the flashes were read by the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.290
 photosensors and converted into commands 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.050
 for the hobby 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.729
 Do you remember that power did not avenge 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.580
 one reason was the lack of games 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.410
 so Rob was not much different from 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.979
 same way that the power glove had two 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.080
 games 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.890
 the man also had only two games and 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.720
 It's them that I'm going to talk to now, I'll start 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.670
 talking about almaty is a game of 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.619
 platform where you use the hobby and 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.210
 this game there is a kind of barrier 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.460
 preventing you from crossing to the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.380
 other side and the hobby function here was 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.090
 to lower these barriers or pillars 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.460
 I do not know how we can call it that 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.350
 game the obvious some pawns he should 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.570
 put on a certain button 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.520
 who will make that squeeze or a or b 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.350
 control, thus enabling the pillar to be 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.690
 but because the hobby is so slow 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.640
 It's getting easier to download yourself 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.290
 the pillars with another control and without 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.269
 to tell that the game had time then 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.760
 depending on the hobby could make 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.760
 something more challenging or it would suck 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.390
 the second game released was the steak esse 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.950
 game day with five trays for 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.910
 fit in the lobby and five blocks 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.560
 colorful 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.330
 the game was like a puzzle where 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.100
 You gave commands to love taking the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.440
 blocks to other places as 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.480
 requested at each stage you commanded the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.000
 Professor Hector and the tv flashes 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.549
 to trigger a robot and how can you perceive 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.890
 well it does not seem like a fun game and 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.660
 because of that the hobby was an accessory 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.269
 that did not work and it was a failure 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.430
 also worth remembering that it was 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.680
 something that made a lot of noise and needed 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.950
 from batteries to operate 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.120
 [Music] 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.160
 maybe during this video you have 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.230
 recognized this theft even if you do not 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.730
 having knowledge about the accessory 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.319
 this is because the lobby has already appeared in 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.100
 various nintendo games like 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.860
 ex-referee lens 3d star fox 64 f0 e 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.720
 found as a treasure in Beijing 2008 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.820
 where the man makes appearances in great 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.250
 nintendo games like mario kart ds and 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.040
 super smash bros brawl as the character 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.870
 Playable secret good and if you know more 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.610
