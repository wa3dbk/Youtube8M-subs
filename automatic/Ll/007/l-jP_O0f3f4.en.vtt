00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.490 
I think about eight kills and around six
or<00:01:20.130> seven<00:01:20.400> seconds<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.030> definitely<00:01:21.869> an<00:01:22.020> insane

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
or seven seconds so definitely an insane

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.460 
or seven seconds so definitely an insane
