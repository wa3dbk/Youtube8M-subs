time they did that last year was against

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.770 
time they did that last year was against
Houston<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.210> encouraging<00:00:39.690> i

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
Houston so that was encouraging i

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.240 
Houston so that was encouraging i
thought<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> offensive<00:00:40.410> line<00:00:40.530> play<00:00:40.890> was<00:00:41.070> very

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
thought the offensive line play was very

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250 
thought the offensive line play was very
good<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.700> michael<00:00:42.480> Burton's<00:00:42.750> blocking<00:00:43.140> was

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
good and michael Burton's blocking was

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260 
good and michael Burton's blocking was
just<00:00:43.440> off<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.620> charts<00:00:43.890> when<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.910> watched<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
just off the charts when I watched the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.910 
just off the charts when I watched the
replay<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.629> counted<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:46.260> least<00:00:46.320> four<00:00:46.620> or<00:00:46.739> five

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
replay I counted at least four or five

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.760 
replay I counted at least four or five
great<00:00:47.430> springing<00:00:47.940> blocks<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.420> he<00:00:48.840> had<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.260> I

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
great springing blocks that he had and I

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.439 
great springing blocks that he had and I
think<00:00:49.980> listen<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> defense<00:00:50.850> did<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.420> had

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
think listen the defense did what it had

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.150 
think listen the defense did what it had
to<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> passing<00:00:52.469> numbers<00:00:52.590> are<00:00:52.800> not<00:00:52.920> pretty

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
to do the passing numbers are not pretty

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.340 
to do the passing numbers are not pretty
but<00:00:53.250> they<00:00:54.059> made<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> stops<00:00:54.899> when<00:00:55.050> they<00:00:55.140> had<00:00:55.260> to

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
but they made the stops when they had to

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.779 
but they made the stops when they had to
make<00:00:55.500> them<00:00:55.620> they<00:00:55.739> had<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> key<00:00:56.129> pass<00:00:56.399> breakup

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
make them they had the key pass breakup

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.830 
make them they had the key pass breakup
and<00:00:56.910> they<00:00:56.969> had<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.180> make<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
and they had to make it and then the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.979 
and they had to make it and then the
great<00:00:58.020> special<00:00:58.410> teams<00:00:58.440> play<00:00:59.000> so<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.899> know

defense of Rutgers defense is that

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.320 
defense of Rutgers defense is that
Howard<00:01:17.040> only<00:01:17.220> passed<00:01:17.400> for<00:01:17.549> 68<00:01:17.850> yards<00:01:18.060> last
