00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
open freedom that minecraft has to offer

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.990 
open freedom that minecraft has to offer
obviously<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> mean<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.469> don't<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.160> go

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
obviously I mean you don't have to go

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.099 
obviously I mean you don't have to go
through<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> story<00:01:00.510> mode<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.840> guys<00:01:00.930> don't

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
through the story mode if you guys don't

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.500 
through the story mode if you guys don't
want<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.890> course<00:01:01.920> button<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:03.300> feel

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
want to of course button I just feel

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.170 
want to of course button I just feel
that<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.290> story<00:01:04.589> mode<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.189> takes<00:01:05.790> away<00:01:06.119> from

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that the story mode just takes away from

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.539 
that the story mode just takes away from
what<00:01:06.720> minecraft<00:01:07.409> has<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.830> offer<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.340> feel

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
what minecraft has to offer and I feel

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.280 
what minecraft has to offer and I feel
like<00:01:08.640> if<00:01:08.880> new<00:01:09.210> players<00:01:09.510> would<00:01:09.750> coming<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
like if new players would coming to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.260 
like if new players would coming to
Minecraft<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.189> they<00:01:11.670> don't<00:01:11.729> see<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> story

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
Minecraft and they don't see the story

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
story mode and when I first play

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.090 
story mode and when I first play
minecraft<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.960> know<00:01:19.049> there's<00:01:19.350> no<00:01:19.439> story<00:01:19.830> mode

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
minecraft you know there's no story mode

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.410 
minecraft you know there's no story mode
I<00:01:20.310> mean<00:01:20.490> obviously<00:01:20.790> when<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.240> guys<00:01:21.330> are

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
I mean obviously when you guys are

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.940 
I mean obviously when you guys are
watching<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.840> like<00:01:22.049> there's<00:01:22.470> no<00:01:22.560> story<00:01:22.799> mode

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
watching this like there's no story mode

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.859 
watching this like there's no story mode
right<00:01:23.100> now<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.939> think<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.540> really

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
right now and I think that that really

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.219 
right now and I think that that really
just<00:01:25.200> takes<00:01:25.590> away<00:01:25.920> from<00:01:26.700> what<00:01:27.119> minecraft<00:01:28.080> is

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
just takes away from what minecraft is

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.410 
just takes away from what minecraft is
all<00:01:28.380> about<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.950> open<00:01:29.430> freedom<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.150> that's

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
all about the open freedom but that's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.480 
all about the open freedom but that's
just<00:01:30.630> my<00:01:30.960> opinion<00:01:30.990> I'm<00:01:31.890> interested<00:01:32.400> in

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
