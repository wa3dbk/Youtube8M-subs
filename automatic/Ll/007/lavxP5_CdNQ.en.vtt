00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.300 

single<00:01:17.970> exhaust<00:01:18.540> point<00:01:18.960> I'm<00:01:19.950> thinking<00:01:20.009> about

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
single exhaust point I'm thinking about

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.780 
single exhaust point I'm thinking about
taking<00:01:20.670> high<00:01:21.000> temp<00:01:21.360> exhaust<00:01:21.750> meat<00:01:22.610> just<00:01:23.610> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
taking high temp exhaust meat just to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.510 
taking high temp exhaust meat just to
kind<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.060> stop<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.540> rust<00:01:25.250> here's<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
kind of stop this rust here's the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.410 
kind of stop this rust here's the
carburetors<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.930> intake<00:01:28.530> boots<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.420> think

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
carburetors the intake boots I think

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.569 
carburetors the intake boots I think
this<00:01:30.570> might<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.049> thermostat<00:01:31.439> I'm<00:01:32.400> sure

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
this might be the thermostat I'm sure

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.520 
this might be the thermostat I'm sure
this<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.869> coolant<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.189> waterfall<00:01:35.759> oil

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
this is the coolant the waterfall oil

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:45.590 
this is the coolant the waterfall oil
filter<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:39.320> me<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.530> USA<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:44.600> some
