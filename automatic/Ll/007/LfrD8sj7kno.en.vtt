00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.930
 works 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.280
 there appears to be much trouble 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.220
 usually 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.710
 did not speak Brussels in the fall 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.659
 according to luc of the shameful gems the price of a product that too 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.360

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.900

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.880
 who that is not with the computer in the texts in case that thought 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.899
 if you still have a foreign staff with the approaching Christmas panic 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.929
