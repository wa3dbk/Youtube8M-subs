00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.600
 do not 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.190
 hello very good of all welcome to 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.140
 this video in which I will teach an egg 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.060
 of Easter in which we will find a 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.260
 new in his video on a boat at what's 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.580
 dogs 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.110
 first of all I will teach where 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.330
 this Easter egg goes by like 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.920
 you see this would be the headquarters of Feather 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.140
 we are a little further south 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.119
 good you can take as a reference this 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.950
 jetty and shortly after 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.780
 right we will find as I said 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.780
 a gnome in a boat 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.260
 how are you seeing on screen 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.970
 it's just a new upload in a 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.230
 boat that has been in this stranded area 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.590
 and well personally I do not think I have 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.440
 no relevance to another saga of 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.030
 ubisoft and good in any case having a 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.650
 little of let's say of others' knowledge 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.380
 games and others in any case the game of 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.240
 valve specifically in light 2 and the 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.520
 reader 2 yes there are some achievements or 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.200
 trophies corresponding to some gnomes 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.850
 it's worth in the first of them for example 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.530
 the highlight 2 must carry the spine 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.700
 up to a certain point the game costs 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.100
 you have to carry it with a weapon 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.570
 until you take it to a space rocket that 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.850
 go on that rocket and get that 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.440
 logo and so on then then the de force 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.970
 of 2 the same thing happens here and now a gnome 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.310
 to a certain extent of the game to 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.960
 get another trophy achievement and good ya 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.490
 leaving us a little of what will be the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.950
 valve game is also true that in 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.420
 big car 5 for example it's already 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.430
 known to all that there are certain 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.869
 gnomes because they have some postures 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.910
 obscene to the best is making a 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.790
 sleeve cut or even some it seems 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.979
 who are practicing or having 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.680
 sexual relations then good then 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.440
 would be there like this little one maybe a 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.390
 nod to those 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.740
 to those other gnome appearances in 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.980
 other games but I really do not think that 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.020
 be a direct reference to another game 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.540
 from ubisoft so nothing else there is the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.910
 Easter insurance of the loin raised in a 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.380
 boat in white sox do not miss the 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.090
 rest of videos on the channel I hope you 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.090
 have liked a greeting and see you
