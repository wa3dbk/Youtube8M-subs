00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
temp digital heater that I purchased

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.689 
temp digital heater that I purchased
from<00:00:12.809> bulk<00:00:13.170> reef<00:00:13.440> supply<00:00:15.049> about<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> week<00:00:16.320> ago

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.679 

there's<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.970> control<00:00:21.510> panel<00:00:23.269> really<00:00:24.269> easy<00:00:24.539> to

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
there's the control panel really easy to

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:35.450 
there's the control panel really easy to
set<00:00:24.930> up<00:00:29.090> here<00:00:30.090> we<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:34.770> actual<00:00:35.100> heater

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
set up here we have the actual heater

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.319 
set up here we have the actual heater
itself<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:38.480> would<00:00:39.480> say<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.020> about<00:00:41.030> 17<00:00:42.030> inches

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
itself I would say it's about 17 inches

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.590 
itself I would say it's about 17 inches
long<00:00:42.440> it's<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.620> titanium<00:00:44.129> heater<00:00:44.640> encased<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
long it's a titanium heater encased in a

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.220 
long it's a titanium heater encased in a
plastic<00:00:45.750> cover<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:48.450> don't<00:00:48.600> get<00:00:48.690> burned<00:00:48.930> or

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
plastic cover so you don't get burned or

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.709 
plastic cover so you don't get burned or
anything<00:00:49.500> else<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.489> doesn't<00:00:50.820> hit<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.300> all

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
anything else it doesn't hit it and all

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.459 
anything else it doesn't hit it and all
any<00:00:51.989> wires<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:54.030> has<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> couple<00:00:54.980> magnetic

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
any wires it has a couple magnetic

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.020 
any wires it has a couple magnetic
brackets<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.739> no<00:00:59.039> suction<00:00:59.399> cups<00:00:59.760> which<00:01:00.000> is

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
brackets on it no suction cups which is

brackets on it no suction cups which is
really<00:01:00.420> nice

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.250 

and<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.980> does<00:01:05.190> up<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.520> a<00:01:05.670> thousand<00:01:06.270> watts<00:01:06.480> so

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and it does up to a thousand watts so

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.400 
and it does up to a thousand watts so
depending<00:01:07.860> how<00:01:08.040> big<00:01:08.310> your<00:01:08.490> tank<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.410> this

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
depending how big your tank is this

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.460 
depending how big your tank is this
system<00:01:10.830> will<00:01:11.820> go<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.120> to<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> thousand<00:01:12.840> watts<00:01:13.020> so

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.660 

if<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> smaller<00:01:17.220> tank<00:01:17.550> like<00:01:17.910> 125<00:01:18.720> say

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
if you have a smaller tank like 125 say

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.010 
if you have a smaller tank like 125 say
I'm<00:01:20.670> going<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.940> need<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.420> least<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.810> full

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
I'm going to need it at least a full

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.530 
I'm going to need it at least a full
hundred<00:01:22.200> watt<00:01:22.500> heater<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.300> want<00:01:24.450> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
hundred watt heater and if you want to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.870 
hundred watt heater and if you want to
bump<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.440> you<00:01:25.560> get<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> 300<00:01:26.070> gallon<00:01:26.460> tank

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
bump up and you get a 300 gallon tank

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.360 
bump up and you get a 300 gallon tank
you<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.900> still<00:01:28.170> use<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.560> same<00:01:28.590> heater<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
you can still use the same heater and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
right here is the temperature probe you

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.430 
right here is the temperature probe you
set<00:01:56.400> your<00:01:56.520> temperature<00:01:57.080> I'll<00:01:58.080> put<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
set your temperature I'll put the

set your temperature I'll put the
control<00:01:59.070> panel<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:01.140> maintains<00:02:01.680> your

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
control panel and that maintains your

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.240 
control panel and that maintains your
temperature<00:02:03.290> tells<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.530> big<00:02:04.740> guy<00:02:04.950> what<00:02:05.220> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
temperature tells this big guy what the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.169 
temperature tells this big guy what the
what<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.090> do

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
what to do

turn it on turn it off simple system it
works<00:02:14.010> well<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:16.650> holds<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:17.040> nice<00:02:17.250> constant

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
works well it holds a nice constant

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:28.130 
works well it holds a nice constant
temperature<00:02:18.150> also

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.060
