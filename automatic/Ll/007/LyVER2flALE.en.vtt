00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.900
 the American continent dates at least 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.210
 since the 9th century with a dog that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.610
 Toltecs called touch and the touch and 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.030
 who were courageous loyal companions 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.580

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.270
 hot water 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.560
 they did not cross the water with washington 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.770
