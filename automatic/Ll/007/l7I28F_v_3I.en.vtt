00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
of advice I give an issue before they

of advice I give an issue before they
make<00:01:55.680> university<00:01:56.220> application<00:01:56.790> would<00:01:57.390> be<00:01:57.570> to

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
make university application would be to

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.450 
make university application would be to
go<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.990> visit<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.500> universities<00:01:58.980> you're

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
go and visit the universities you're

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.370 
go and visit the universities you're
thinking<00:01:59.760> of<00:01:59.820> applying<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.020> think<00:02:01.230> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
thinking of applying to and I think the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.780 
thinking of applying to and I think the
important<00:02:01.800> thing<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.100> not<00:02:02.220> just<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.550> look<00:02:02.640> at

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
important thing is not just to look at

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.760 
important thing is not just to look at
the<00:02:02.850> degree<00:02:03.000> title<00:02:03.720> but<00:02:04.080> simply<00:02:04.380> thinking

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the degree title but simply thinking

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.380 
the degree title but simply thinking
about<00:02:05.010> what<00:02:05.250> am<00:02:05.400> I<00:02:05.490> actually<00:02:05.580> going<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.150> be<00:02:06.270> on

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
about what am I actually going to be on

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.960 
about what am I actually going to be on
doing<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.110> day<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.410> day<00:02:07.590> basis<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.430> looking

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
doing on a day to day basis and looking

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.370 
doing on a day to day basis and looking

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
in particular why they went to

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.350 
in particular why they went to
university<00:02:11.190> what<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.490> is<00:02:11.640> they're<00:02:11.850> posting

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
university what it is they're posting

university what it is they're posting
about<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.930> not<00:02:13.080> just<00:02:13.380> something<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.250> do<00:02:14.400> to

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
about it's not just something to do to

about it's not just something to do to
fill<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.880> time<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.330> think<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.630> critical<00:02:16.080> thing

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
fill the time I think the critical thing

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.500 
fill the time I think the critical thing
is<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.830> student<00:02:17.190> has<00:02:17.370> evidenced<00:02:18.000> any
