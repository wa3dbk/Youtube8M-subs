00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.609
 hi from michelangelo monte and analyze water 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:19.849
 the hero of the day and piero della francesca author of the christening of christ 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.429
 of the national gallery 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.629
 the picture that represents the episode of the gospel in which Christ died before starting 

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:30.889
 his preaching is baptized by St. John the Baptist in the Jordanian river 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.760
 what you lived was the central part of a triptych a painting on wood 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.640
 composed of three compartments 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.030
 this one for example 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.800
 piero della francesca I realize only this table of the triptych that yes 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.060
 he was in the Camaldolese madness 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.130
 pixar sepulcher the birthplace of sight 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.900
 the work is based on the very precise geometric structure that the network is 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.550
 regular and balanced 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.320
 if I show some sites 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.550
 the table is composed of a square surmounted by a circle in one 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.560
 circle circumference passes through the navel of christ that the center 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.680
 exact of the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.720
 in the center of the circle there is the dove that represents the holy spirit that 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.840
 descends from the sky 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.820
 diagonals of liars wake up indeed of the square cross at the height 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.210
 of the navel of Christ once again 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.000
 the bass scene can be divided into three perfectly equal rectangles that 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.980
 enclose 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.580
 the angels christ the group in the background 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.880
 while the tree in the foreground and St. John the Baptist constitute the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.130
 stars break the dividing lines 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.230
 this is a little more difficult 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.340
 it is said that the two equal triangles starting from the sides of the square 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.440
 you will notice that their crosses close the figure of Christ, forming a 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.210
 little' 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.740
 and this makes me think 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.630
 and medieval representations of Christ and divinity 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.740
 that were enclosed in the so-called mantova 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.880
 aiming a kind of demarcation too much space of men is that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.990
 but not only the points where two triangles are pronounced create a segment that is 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.839
 punctual arrette of the cinema 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:17.809
 here I find the geometry lesson even though I could continue with 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.039
 other details matches 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.919
 all this to tell you that the artist designed his works with a studio 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.009
 very precise 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.789
 and creating a whole series of proportional mathematical relationships 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:33.569
 his figures were also based on geometric figures 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.499
 the most banal example is that of the trunk of the tree which is a cylinder but there is one 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:39.139
 they are also others 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:43.489
 not by chance piero della francesca also wrote several treatises on mathematics and 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.119
 perspective geometry 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.929
 where it is explained some theories that you can put into practice in his paintings 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.430
 the result is a regular and balanced orderly composition manor 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.179
 TGCOM 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:57.439
 this thanks to the colors they have announcements 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.789
 the colors are wisely alternated between hot and cold and light 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:05.279
 it comes from above as if the sun were in Bolzano 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:09.979
 not by chance there are not but many legends of lights and colors soften 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:12.269
 the various forms 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.719
 panda geometric construction 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:19.079
 on the scene we see the Baptist in the foreground, the Baptist verse 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.099
 the water in head of alessia in the holy spirit came down from the sky 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.129
 among other things, the head for the hand and the dove are picasso. the same 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.719
 immediately behind a little apart there are the three angels who attend 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.479
 the rightmost one looks at the outside of the picture in the direction of the 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:38.719
 viewer 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:42.689
 it is a technique widely used by artists to recall 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.209
 the attention of the beholder d draws the inside of the picture 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.319
 in the background on the other side right if the man who undresses. alice gate voip 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.299
 baptism 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.930
 and this image gives a completely painted sense of naturalness that 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:58.899
 represents 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:01.699
 an extremely sunny moment 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.699
 the other men in the background have a lot of street clothes 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.889
 church representatives were probably inspired by the head 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:10.929
 of the East 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:13.439
 which is in Florence at that time 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.229
 in 1400 39 eng 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.389
 a time was held in Florence for the purpose of reunifying the Catholic Church 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.469
 with the Orthodox one 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:27.959
 undoubtedly the list of military priests of the empire of the east italypet 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.520
 stimulates little the imagination of the artists, including the temple 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.770
 of the Francesca key 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.770
 luca finds others 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.050
 the city against the backdrop of the end of Borgo San Sepulcher, the birthplace of the painter 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.520
 some man arrested in Palermo 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.650
 in the men of the time, seeing one's own city one's own country too much 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.460
 sounds cool 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.580
 the purpose of science 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.099
 thanks enzo doubtful reason for pride 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.439
 moreover he helped them to identify themselves with the scene, to feel certain rites with 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:59.980
 candles in the 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.370
 in time and space closer to them
