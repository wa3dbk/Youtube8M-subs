with you know with a with a whole new
approach<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.610> my<00:01:35.729> glass<00:01:35.970> making<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:37.289> really

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
approach to my glass making that really

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.810 
approach to my glass making that really
inspired<00:01:38.789> me<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:39.300> about<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:41.430> potential

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
inspired me to think about the potential

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.389 
inspired me to think about the potential
of<00:01:42.119> producing<00:01:42.210> quite<00:01:43.700> challenging<00:01:45.320> artworks

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
of producing quite challenging artworks

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.980 
of producing quite challenging artworks
and<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> Jer<00:01:48.030> would<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.570> jury<00:01:48.840> would

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
and so the Jer would the jury would

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.219 
and so the Jer would the jury would
award<00:01:49.289> when<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.649> was<00:01:49.920> when<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> was<00:01:50.520> awarded<00:01:51.229> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
award when I was when I was awarded the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.260 
award when I was when I was awarded the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
well my work is clearly inspired by

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.350 
well my work is clearly inspired by
geometric<00:03:18.030> shapes<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:20.099> the<00:03:21.239> started<00:03:22.239> with

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
geometric shapes and the started with

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.240 
geometric shapes and the started with
the<00:03:22.450> theme<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.720> variation<00:03:23.410> series<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.129> it's

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
the theme and variation series and it's

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.160 
the theme and variation series and it's
like<00:03:24.400> puzzle<00:03:24.819> type<00:03:25.030> pieces<00:03:25.660> puzzle<00:03:25.870> type

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
like puzzle type pieces puzzle type

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.890 
like puzzle type pieces puzzle type
elements<00:03:26.739> which<00:03:26.920> sort<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.250> stack<00:03:27.900> in

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
elements which sort of stack in

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.570 
elements which sort of stack in
different<00:03:29.319> ways<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:30.010> developed<00:03:30.280> them

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
different ways and I developed them

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.190 
different ways and I developed them
initially<00:03:31.000> as<00:03:31.090> color<00:03:31.360> tests<00:03:31.780> at<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.989> Royal

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
initially as color tests at the Royal

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.530 
initially as color tests at the Royal
College<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.650> Art<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:33.220> then<00:03:33.819> they<00:03:34.000> became<00:03:34.330> this

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
College of Art and then they became this

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.170 
College of Art and then they became this
body<00:03:34.930> of<00:03:35.110> work<00:03:35.349> which<00:03:35.709> I've<00:03:35.920> been<00:03:36.160> making<00:03:37.000> for

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
body of work which I've been making for

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.150 
body of work which I've been making for
a<00:03:37.269> while<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:38.019> I<00:03:38.200> never<00:03:38.380> really<00:03:38.709> got<00:03:38.830> bored

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
a while and I never really got bored

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.620 
a while and I never really got bored
with<00:03:39.340> it<00:03:39.550> because<00:03:39.730> I've<00:03:39.880> got<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.209> try<00:03:40.450> out<00:03:40.599> new

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
with it because I've got to try out new

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.890 
with it because I've got to try out new
colors<00:03:44.549> that's<00:03:45.549> actually<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:45.940> really<00:03:46.120> good<00:03:46.239> one

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
colors that's actually a really good one

00:03:46.900 --> 00:04:06.580 
colors that's actually a really good one
they<00:03:47.799> don't<00:03:48.010> always<00:03:48.190> come<00:03:48.489> out<00:03:48.640> this<00:03:48.790> good

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.850 

and<00:04:07.580> of<00:04:07.730> course<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.090> second<00:04:08.480> aspect<00:04:08.780> is<00:04:09.230> color

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
and of course the second aspect is color

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.880 
and of course the second aspect is color
I'm<00:04:10.280> I'm<00:04:10.819> very<00:04:11.450> interested<00:04:11.750> in<00:04:12.080> color<00:04:12.349> which

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
I'm I'm very interested in color which

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.670 
I'm I'm very interested in color which
have<00:04:13.730> developed<00:04:13.940> slowly<00:04:14.599> as<00:04:14.840> I<00:04:14.870> was<00:04:15.170> casting

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
have developed slowly as I was casting

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.009 
have developed slowly as I was casting
larger<00:04:16.100> shapes<00:04:16.400> but<00:04:16.880> we<00:04:17.090> interested<00:04:17.690> in<00:04:17.780> what

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
larger shapes but we interested in what

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.710 
larger shapes but we interested in what
the<00:04:18.200> color<00:04:18.440> does<00:04:18.859> skin<00:04:19.310> enough<00:04:19.609> form<00:04:19.940> and<00:04:20.239> how

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
the color does skin enough form and how

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.420 
the color does skin enough form and how
they<00:04:20.870> kind<00:04:20.989> of<00:04:21.109> changes<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.650> form<00:04:21.950> and<00:04:22.280> also

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
they kind of changes to form and also

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:29.950 
they kind of changes to form and also
how<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:22.730> form<00:04:23.030> changes<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.660> color<00:04:28.540> and<00:04:29.540> then

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
how the form changes the color and then

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.100 
how the form changes the color and then
I<00:04:30.080> discovered<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:31.450> polychromatic<00:04:32.450> colors

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
I discovered and polychromatic colors

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.490 
I discovered and polychromatic colors
with<00:04:34.360> which<00:04:35.360> change<00:04:35.720> in<00:04:35.900> different<00:04:36.080> lights

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
with which change in different lights

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.280 
with which change in different lights
but<00:04:36.800> they<00:04:36.919> also<00:04:37.070> change<00:04:37.430> from<00:04:37.580> thick<00:04:37.820> to<00:04:37.850> thin

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
but they also change from thick to thin

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:46.909 
but they also change from thick to thin
in<00:04:39.290> a<00:04:39.410> shape

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.059 

and<00:04:47.370> then<00:04:47.610> from<00:04:47.819> the<00:04:47.939> side<00:04:48.210> of<00:04:48.419> course<00:04:48.689> you<00:04:48.840> get

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
and then from the side of course you get

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.550 
and then from the side of course you get
you<00:04:50.069> get<00:04:50.249> the<00:04:50.310> three<00:04:50.669> different<00:04:50.849> colors

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
you get the three different colors

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.309 
you get the three different colors
meaning<00:04:52.560> that<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.949> would<00:04:53.129> make<00:04:53.280> us<00:04:53.460> open<00:04:53.879> in

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 
meaning that you would make us open in

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.589 
meaning that you would make us open in
2011<00:04:55.319> was<00:04:56.249> really<00:04:56.550> brilliant<00:04:56.819> for<00:04:57.240> me<00:04:57.360> because

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
2011 was really brilliant for me because

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:01.219 
2011 was really brilliant for me because
I<00:04:57.749> just<00:04:57.960> finished<00:04:58.499> my<00:04:58.800> PhD<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.779> I<00:05:00.779> kind<00:05:01.169> of

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
I just finished my PhD and I kind of

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.989 
I just finished my PhD and I kind of
been<00:05:01.439> working<00:05:01.590> with<00:05:01.889> the<00:05:02.009> same<00:05:02.249> shapes<00:05:02.639> for

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:02.999 
been working with the same shapes for

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:05.839 
been working with the same shapes for
quite<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.240> long<00:05:03.479> time<00:05:03.539> and<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:05.340> two<00:05:05.520> would<00:05:05.669> make

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
quite a long time and the two would make

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.429 
quite a long time and the two would make
us<00:05:06.029> open<00:05:06.360> gave<00:05:06.539> me<00:05:06.659> the<00:05:06.779> opportunity<00:05:07.409> to

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:07.439 
us open gave me the opportunity to

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:10.369 
us open gave me the opportunity to
actually<00:05:07.650> go<00:05:08.610> outside<00:05:09.090> my<00:05:09.300> comfort<00:05:09.509> zone

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:10.379 
actually go outside my comfort zone

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.920 
actually go outside my comfort zone
and<00:05:10.860> not<00:05:11.249> have<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.580> worry<00:05:11.789> about<00:05:11.879> finances<00:05:12.539> and

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
and not have to worry about finances and

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.869 
and not have to worry about finances and
be<00:05:13.050> able<00:05:13.199> to<00:05:13.469> develop<00:05:13.889> a<00:05:13.979> completely<00:05:14.430> new<00:05:14.610> body

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:14.879 
be able to develop a completely new body

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:32.879 
be able to develop a completely new body
of<00:05:14.999> work<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:16.580> go<00:05:17.580> larger<00:05:18.240> as<00:05:18.419> well

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.770 

there<00:05:33.460> are<00:05:34.050> underlying<00:05:35.050> themes<00:05:35.800> that<00:05:36.689> that<00:05:37.689> I

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
there are underlying themes that that I

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.989 
there are underlying themes that that I
have<00:05:37.990> in<00:05:38.139> all<00:05:38.289> of<00:05:38.560> all<00:05:38.919> of<00:05:39.159> my<00:05:39.310> work<00:05:39.520> you<00:05:39.849> know

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:39.999 
have in all of all of my work you know

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.659 
have in all of all of my work you know
I'm<00:05:40.090> interested<00:05:40.629> in<00:05:40.810> groups<00:05:41.529> of<00:05:41.740> objects<00:05:42.279> the

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
I'm interested in groups of objects the

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.429 
I'm interested in groups of objects the
sense<00:05:43.090> of<00:05:43.300> archive<00:05:43.990> and<00:05:44.469> collections<00:05:45.159> those

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:46.439 
sense of archive and collections those

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.219 
sense of archive and collections those
those<00:05:47.439> references<00:05:48.249> are<00:05:48.520> very<00:05:49.270> strong<00:05:49.719> in<00:05:49.990> in

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
those references are very strong in in

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.679 
those references are very strong in in
everything<00:05:50.650> that<00:05:50.830> I<00:05:51.009> do<00:05:51.389> so<00:05:52.389> it<00:05:52.509> would<00:05:52.569> be

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:52.689 
everything that I do so it would be

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:54.149 
everything that I do so it would be
really<00:05:52.900> great<00:05:53.169> to<00:05:53.469> sort<00:05:53.620> of<00:05:53.710> see<00:05:53.770> this

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
really great to sort of see this

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:55.950 
really great to sort of see this
exhibition<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:54.939> actually<00:05:55.270> to<00:05:55.419> see<00:05:55.689> however

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
exhibition and actually to see however

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.640 
exhibition and actually to see however
how<00:05:56.469> I've<00:05:57.389> approached<00:05:58.389> those<00:05:58.629> references<00:05:59.349> in

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
how I've approached those references in

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.860 
how I've approached those references in
in<00:05:59.949> very<00:06:00.219> different<00:06:00.520> ways<00:06:00.849> in<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.300> term<00:06:01.569> in

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
in very different ways in the term in

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.600 
in very different ways in the term in

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.040 
shop like I don't know a few years ago
and<00:06:23.379> I<00:06:23.439> always<00:06:23.620> wanted<00:06:24.069> to<00:06:24.219> make<00:06:24.400> something

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
and I always wanted to make something

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.260 
and I always wanted to make something
with<00:06:26.050> that<00:06:26.379> concept<00:06:26.979> and<00:06:27.520> the<00:06:27.819> two<00:06:28.029> went

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
with that concept and the two went

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.999 
with that concept and the two went
through<00:06:28.360> the<00:06:28.689> job<00:06:28.930> of<00:06:29.139> making<00:06:29.349> that<00:06:29.620> I<00:06:29.740> learned

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
through the job of making that I learned

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.700 
through the job of making that I learned
a<00:06:30.370> lot<00:06:30.550> about<00:06:30.699> balance<00:06:31.270> so<00:06:31.539> now<00:06:31.930> I<00:06:31.960> can<00:06:32.349> pretty

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
a lot about balance so now I can pretty

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.980 
a lot about balance so now I can pretty
much<00:06:32.830> intuitively<00:06:33.639> make<00:06:33.969> shapes<00:06:34.330> that<00:06:34.659> that

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
much intuitively make shapes that that

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.980 
much intuitively make shapes that that
balance<00:06:35.439> and<00:06:36.300> the<00:06:37.300> work<00:06:37.509> I'm<00:06:37.659> going<00:06:37.810> to<00:06:37.870> be

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
balance and the work I'm going to be

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.559 
balance and the work I'm going to be
showing<00:06:38.439> at<00:06:38.710> London<00:06:39.400> glassblowing<00:06:39.909> is<00:06:40.270> a
