means that you can leave them on at
while<00:03:09.670> you're<00:03:09.790> riding<00:03:10.239> at<00:03:10.360> night<00:03:10.390> without

they're aimed properly and that's what

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.460 
they're aimed properly and that's what
we<00:03:15.820> consider<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.269> big<00:03:16.750> advantage<00:03:17.019> over<00:03:17.440> a

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
we consider a big advantage over a

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.440 
we consider a big advantage over a
really<00:03:17.769> more<00:03:18.340> powerful<00:03:18.820> driving<00:03:19.120> light

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
really more powerful driving light

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.680 
really more powerful driving light
because<00:03:19.950> all<00:03:20.950> too<00:03:21.160> often<00:03:21.340> you're<00:03:22.150> in<00:03:22.390> traffic

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
because all too often you're in traffic

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.890 
because all too often you're in traffic
and<00:03:23.610> there<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:24.820> if<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.180> have<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.360> very<00:03:25.690> bright

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
also have the cyclops light which is

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.490 
also have the cyclops light which is
really<00:04:40.090> cool<00:04:40.330> it<00:04:40.540> turns<00:04:40.810> with<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.260> front

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
really cool it turns with the front

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.790 
really cool it turns with the front
wheel<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:42.630> this<00:04:43.630> light<00:04:43.930> is<00:04:44.910> attached<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.800> this

wheel and this light is attached to this
part<00:04:48.160> which<00:04:48.340> we<00:04:48.460> call<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:48.790> brake<00:04:49.000> line

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
part which we call the brake line

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.300 
part which we call the brake line
protector<00:04:49.810> which<00:04:50.110> in<00:04:50.290> itself<00:04:50.590> is<00:04:50.770> a<00:04:50.830> good<00:04:51.040> part

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
protector which in itself is a good part

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.270 
protector which in itself is a good part
because<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.730> helps<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.480> deflect<00:04:53.380> anything

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
because it helps to deflect anything
