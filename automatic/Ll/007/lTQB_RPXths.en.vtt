00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
nothing was working and I gave this

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.490 
nothing was working and I gave this
stuff<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.490> shot<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.909> its<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.990> been<00:01:22.200> keeping

stuff a shot and its really been keeping
it<00:01:22.590> under<00:01:22.680> control<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.420> have<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
it under control so if you have that

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.810 
it under control so if you have that
what<00:01:24.869> they<00:01:24.960> call<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.380> rosacea<00:01:25.770> or<00:01:26.159> what<00:01:26.790> I

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
what they call it is rosacea or what I

what they call it is rosacea or what I
think<00:01:27.119> i<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.720> i<00:01:27.900> think<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.500> reactive

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
think i have is i think it's reactive

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.679 
think i have is i think it's reactive
redness<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.820> how<00:01:29.970> they<00:01:30.119> say<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
redness is how they say it on the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.719 
redness is how they say it on the
packaging<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.979> if<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.369> something<00:01:32.430> like

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
packaging so if you have something like

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.030 
packaging so if you have something like
that<00:01:33.060> um<00:01:33.390> maybe<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.380> should<00:01:34.530> give<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.860> try

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that um maybe you should give this a try

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.690 
that um maybe you should give this a try
I<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:36.299> kind<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.750> got<00:01:36.869> suckered<00:01:37.229> into<00:01:37.290> this

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
I I kind of got suckered into this

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.380 
I I kind of got suckered into this
because<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.180> says<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:41.310> thief<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:42.030> active

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
because it says the thief the active

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.010 
because it says the thief the active
ingredient<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.790> hydrocortisone<00:01:45.020> so

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
ingredient is just hydrocortisone so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.569 
ingredient is just hydrocortisone so
