 an opening of these 21 of niscemi is 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:30.069
 one of the pokemon just 1 random so 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:34.990
 then let's start from this then here it is 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:38.530
 here it is small and bad to the cute and we say 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:42.580
 but the veil although obviously not 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:47.830
 they should after having it but in the cute e 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:58.360
 green and yellow this is the tattoo with 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:01:01.060
 which arrives and this is his card e 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:09.390
 behind a piece of a puzzle that forms 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:14.009
 the image of a t rex expect here it is 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:23.850
 the other characters and other dinosaurs 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:23.850
 these are these 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.350
 this too would have been very cool but 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.880
 he is my favorite 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.780
 so I'm in contact to get it back 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:45.250
 therefore found mine but he would then say 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:47.289
 to go with nia and oh well this these 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.789

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:58.000
 the pro this is the check list 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:01.119
 if you want to see them believe and the pro top e 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.429
 this is what we found it is 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:10.260
 very nice is the leader of the unicorns 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:16.030
 of the cardboard to a tac and plate 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:21.700
 glitter and this rose is very similar 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:29.709
 in the drawings to the art of klimt to which 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:37.510
 the cardboard is inspired here it is here 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:41.680
 is this here if you want to see more neo 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.280
 perti different on my channel and you 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.280

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.709
 and these are the ones you can find 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:09.050
 then now we see this are gods 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.320

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:16.220

 there is also the cord to make a 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.760
 bracelet a necklace and I believe that 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.040
 this is a blue in the dark because 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:43.760
 then this is the dinosaur to which 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:47.990
 it belongs here and not between six and 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.230
 the dark however among these if you see 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.050
 the only one here is this here therefore 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.380
 here it is in the dark probably then 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.980
