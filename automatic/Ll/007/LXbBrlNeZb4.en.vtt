time finding other parodies and dead
stock<00:00:50.039> condition<00:00:50.250> online<00:00:51.469> so<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.860> came

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
stock condition online so this so I came

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.200 
stock condition online so this so I came
up<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.610> went<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> Nike<00:00:54.360> ID<00:00:54.629> website<00:00:56.210> so

can<00:00:58.859> see<00:01:00.859> you<00:01:01.859> know<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.160> different<00:01:02.760> colors

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
can see you know it's different colors

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.210 
can see you know it's different colors
silhouette<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:05.990> I'm<00:01:06.990> basically<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.530> wanted<00:01:08.070> it

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
silhouette but I'm basically I wanted it

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.240 
silhouette but I'm basically I wanted it
to<00:01:08.729> come<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.240> nice<00:01:09.510> suede<00:01:10.250> suede

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
to come with a really nice suede suede

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.550 
to come with a really nice suede suede
material<00:01:11.689> there's<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.750> lot<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.020> options<00:01:13.170> now

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
material there's a lot of options now

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.800 
material there's a lot of options now
and<00:01:14.100> actually<00:01:14.250> can't<00:01:14.640> even<00:01:14.700> design<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and actually can't even design the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.600 
and actually can't even design the
physics<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.619> anymore<00:01:16.890> because<00:01:17.220> they

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
physics like this anymore because they

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.160 
physics like this anymore because they
took<00:01:17.759> away<00:01:18.030> some<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> options<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:19.140> you

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
took away some of the options like you

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.719 
took away some of the options like you
can't<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> elephant<00:01:20.100> print<00:01:20.310> down<00:01:20.490> here

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
can't get the elephant print down here

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.100 
can't get the elephant print down here
anymore<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.240> only<00:01:21.360> get<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> full

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
anymore you can only get it on the full

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.200 
anymore you can only get it on the full
upper<00:01:22.439> now<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.890> don't<00:01:23.520> know<00:01:23.580> why<00:01:23.700> they<00:01:23.880> did<00:01:24.030> on

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
upper now I don't know why they did on

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.730 
upper now I don't know why they did on
the<00:01:24.330> website<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.380> go<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.530> there

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the website you if you go on there

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.780 
the website you if you go on there
you'll<00:01:25.890> see<00:01:25.979> what<00:01:26.070> I'm<00:01:26.130> talking<00:01:26.400> about

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
you'll see what I'm talking about

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.749 
you'll see what I'm talking about
anyway<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.840> put<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.640> made<00:01:29.640> this

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
anyway so I put the made this

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.550 
anyway so I put the made this
combination<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.900> thing<00:01:31.049> you'll<00:01:31.140> notice<00:01:31.320> it's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
combination one thing you'll notice it's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.810 
combination one thing you'll notice it's
different<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.310> throws<00:01:32.549> off<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
different that really throws off the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.270 
different that really throws off the
shoe<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.900> think<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.439> get<00:01:34.979> it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
shoe but I think I get it

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.999 
shoe but I think I get it
for<00:01:35.520> purpose<00:01:36.110> because<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.200> start<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.650> having<00:01:37.920> my

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
for purpose because I start of having my

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.030 
for purpose because I start of having my
clear<00:01:38.250> sole<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.729> yellow<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> decide<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.950> go

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
clear sole to yellow so I decide to go

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.300 
clear sole to yellow so I decide to go
with<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.490> light<00:01:41.700> retro<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.920> expecting

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
with the light retro and I was expecting

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.819 
with the light retro and I was expecting
this<00:01:44.369> code<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> lighter<00:01:45.060> color<00:01:45.649> came<00:01:46.649> out

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
this code to be a lighter color came out

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.380 
this code to be a lighter color came out
a<00:01:46.860> little<00:01:47.100> darker<00:01:47.520> than<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.759> thought<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
a little darker than I thought in the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.889 
a little darker than I thought in the
pictures<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:48.810> I'm<00:01:49.409> still<00:01:49.710> happy<00:01:49.920> with<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.369> I

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
pictures but I'm still happy with it I

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.910 
pictures but I'm still happy with it I
think<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.049> little<00:01:52.229> different<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.740> it's

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
think it's a little different and it's

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.550 
think it's a little different and it's
like<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:54.000> know<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.689> get<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.960> clear<00:01:55.170> ones<00:01:55.350> but

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
like you know you get the clear ones but

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.130 
like you know you get the clear ones but
what<00:01:55.890> they<00:01:56.040> end<00:01:56.159> up<00:01:56.189> looking<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:57.140> after

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
what they end up looking like this after

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.140 
what they end up looking like this after
just<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.979> lot<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.430> month<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.729> wearing<00:01:59.969> them

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.120 

so<00:02:03.150> we'll<00:02:03.360> call<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> light<00:02:04.440> retro<00:02:04.860> which<00:02:05.010> is

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
so we'll call a light retro which is

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.109 
so we'll call a light retro which is
like<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> blue<00:02:05.610> turquoise<00:02:05.940> color<00:02:07.729> also<00:02:08.729> went

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
like a blue turquoise color also went

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.330 
like a blue turquoise color also went
with<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> patent<00:02:09.780> leather<00:02:10.009> going<00:02:11.009> around<00:02:11.220> the
