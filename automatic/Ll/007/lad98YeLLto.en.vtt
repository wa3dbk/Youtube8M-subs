what I think you got to be careful about
what<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:31.920> run<00:02:32.250> over<00:02:32.280> with<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:34.590> know<00:02:34.709> you

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
what you run over with it you know you

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.710 
what you run over with it you know you
don't<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.580> really<00:02:35.760> like<00:02:36.120> out<00:02:36.300> here<00:02:36.330> in

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
don't have to really like out here in

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.960 
don't have to really like out here in
grass<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.319> don't<00:02:37.470> really<00:02:37.590> have<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.830> worry<00:02:38.160> too

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
grass you don't really have to worry too

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.430 
grass you don't really have to worry too
much<00:02:39.150> about<00:02:39.390> oil<00:02:39.930> spots<00:02:40.410> or<00:02:42.200> no<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.260> don't

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
much about oil spots or no you don't

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.080 
much about oil spots or no you don't
really<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:43.769> any<00:02:43.920> traction<00:02:44.190> problems<00:02:44.519> I<00:02:44.970> mean

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
really have any traction problems I mean

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.640 
really have any traction problems I mean
look<00:02:45.209> at<00:02:45.299> these<00:02:45.420> tires<00:02:45.750> now<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.170> don't<00:02:46.560> know

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
look at these tires now I don't know

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.539 
look at these tires now I don't know
these<00:02:47.489> don't<00:02:47.700> look<00:02:47.819> like<00:02:47.940> race<00:02:48.330> rubber<00:02:48.660> I

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
these don't look like race rubber I

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.270 
these don't look like race rubber I
think<00:02:50.549> these<00:02:50.670> are<00:02:50.730> all<00:02:51.000> season<00:02:51.540> tires<00:02:52.280> so

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
think these are all season tires so

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.130 
think these are all season tires so
they're<00:02:53.640> not<00:02:53.730> going<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.030> have<00:02:54.209> quite<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.599> same

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
they're not going to have quite the same

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.140 
they're not going to have quite the same
amount<00:02:55.349> of<00:02:55.650> grip<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.069> might<00:02:56.250> find<00:02:56.549> maybe<00:02:56.880> with

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
amount of grip you might find maybe with

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.539 
amount of grip you might find maybe with
some<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.620> some<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.739> race<00:02:59.010> slicks<00:02:59.370> you

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
some of the some of the race slicks you

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.160 
some of the some of the race slicks you
might<00:02:59.730> see<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.000> mean<00:03:00.180> look<00:03:00.540> at<00:03:00.599> that<00:03:00.780> turning

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
might see I mean look at that turning

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.330 
might see I mean look at that turning
radius<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.620> mean<00:03:01.799> just<00:03:02.040> on<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> dime<00:03:02.730> no<00:03:03.120> sweat<00:03:04.340> so

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
radius I mean just on a dime no sweat so

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.949
