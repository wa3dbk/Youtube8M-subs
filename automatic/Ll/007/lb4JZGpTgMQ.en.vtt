00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.879
 and welcome to one 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.960
 Further the respect from this time 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:22.990
 Broken 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:24.490
 the ags 701 so i still have my bmx 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.579
 Hall will prove that I will now 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:36.520
 even though compare so to say what 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:39.550
 fight the day before 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.680
 He plastic packaging because that is 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:55.510
 ever a small advantage there 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:57.190
 So none of them had so many 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.559
 maybe surfaces will become practical 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.390
 why two headphones in the area where 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.390
 I bought hardware now 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.650
 long it thereby a fence area to 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:15.310
 say hey and you can not quite get there 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.409
 just buy headphones then these 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.930
 have very different qualities 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.430
 also different places of the music direction 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.189
 As for 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.570
 and since I'm not really direct 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:30.479
 with only 61 musik listen to it 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.770
 mainly electronic music, however 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:38.439
 i also hear linkin park or too 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.619
 always digest and then still 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:45.909
 to be in the evening as in a 50 cent 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.469
 or material really and also 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.350
 also to have to classic 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.789
 Music has been repeated for film and music 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.759
 play by it 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.689
 and that 's why I was told to 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.750
 Railway has become in Poland 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:02.250
 the two are the only ones of the 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.740
 pinna bounced form 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.900
 many with the up and looked home 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.340
 is if they would suit me 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.730
 what exactly the problem to my dad 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.300
 says these have an oval earcup 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.780
 shape and my ears changed show here 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.610
 On the pages print this also lost 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.480
 and thereby the wearing a while 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.480
 very uncomfortable 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.930
 to see the ceiling 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.160
 yes and it fly 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.370
 that's why I have two headphones 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.360
 try week or so shows which 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.000
 I like the two of them better 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.900
 after I had my hat and then 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.340
 I will just do the two 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.650
 Back there as this at the webshop 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.210
 Manager ordered this supplies all 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.410
 possible audio products from them to 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.960
 to the microphone guitar 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.630
 I think even drums so better 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.760
 I am a lot and this kind 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.830
 peculiarity even a month 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.590
 after what got that testifies 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.750
 to send back and retail to 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.780
 send 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:23.060
 now expect and discover expect and 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.950
 experience 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.530
 yes they are 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.560
 they have a nice stand 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.240
 with which the heads can put themselves 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.400
 pretty cool and white 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.900
 I just think so , that's it 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.760
 the only color you can ask 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.120
 Now I do not understand quite how it is 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:51.170
 here is just a piece of cardboard so easy 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.170
 seems to be nothing or 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:09.210
 but so informationshÃ¤ppchen the usual 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.790
 here again guarantee card features 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.550
 etc that's what i'm going through because 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:26.490
 I connect you, so to speak, to the pc in 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:28.440
 new hardware back and so more 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.300
 Now, a hand made that is done 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.930
 the cables will most likely be 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.930
 determined to be the end 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.610
 this should be compared to the aka 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:58.419
 the 71st 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:05:02.389
 but compared to the a little bit 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:13.449
 be better but a stand 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:16.580
 Generally no tricks cable as well as the 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.860
 but it is so bad because I am only on pc 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:25.599
 in the trunk of the meller should that 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.599
 take out to make not too much 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.139
 now 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.520
 I have to say I like the look 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:20.820
 me the kgs ag a bit more 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.540
 It looks a bit cool 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.670
 if I were so up here in the 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.770
 question part biken general unity 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:32.630
 for that of the design that is also at 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:35.610
 514 here the case 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.820
 These say that the cables are above 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:42.750
 leads and as the head touches loose 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:45.650
 and adjustable and in addition I would 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.650
 just once say 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.680
 very nice as far as I know these are 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:03.010
 closed should not remain open 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.460
 Sound level from the outside reasonably 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.930
 getting closed 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:11.180
 they will be back I will see how 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:14.210
 they are if I like them then 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.560
 what about me this time I have it for you 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.790
 We liked it the next time 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.790
 if i get new hardware again
