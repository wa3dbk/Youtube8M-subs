00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 I see how my vegan and welcome 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.799
 in a new video on this channel 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.299
 This video I am going to have short and fast 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.090
 because it 's just a small one 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.670
 update that little update you are about 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.950
 minecraft piping basket that sophia them 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.710
 also wi-fi say my mpg server 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.350
 server and by the way when it opened 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.820
 washed again go like 100 people 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.519
 online was really super cool 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.960
 but you see it is empty and the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.260
 service just online it will be a few 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.330
 days empty and that is because the server 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.250
 first offline and weekend for a while 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.260
 that's because the server for that is whole 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.850
 often out of fire from scratch I have 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.500
 also asked and hosting what is it 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.480
 problem how can this happen 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.239
 they investigated and they went 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.890
 just see how that was possible and 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.750
 yes she thought it came through plugins 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.059
 it can sometimes be because of it sometimes 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.559
 crashing shirt blinked plug-in but they we 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.270
 Have found out it's because of something 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.940
 has come because they all say so 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.320
 briefly explain 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.510
 hosting service say it and I was 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.399
 one for one with all other 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.859
 people only those people who are also there 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.449
 were in that server that I was in 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.299
 just say hosting with my server 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.630
 thing that have a surfer to eyes 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.520
 upgrade and that made me very often 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.810
 paid out so the track was to say 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.360
 forms became my service 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.560
 automatically turns itself off like 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.450
 you understand it you don't understand 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.159
 then you do not understand where every case 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.460
 it's about the service from lyme and then 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.350
 with a new EP and port and now a lot is possible 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.259
 easier to put in john or new in ovp 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.460
 enter erases the old ipn enters next 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.229
 in npg server point tk is the new ep 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.509
 and start surfing point i am at gate 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.890
 just standard 132 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.780
 so it's also much easier to 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.400
 joinen typically just much easy 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.049
 write about it and it also dewey port 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.700
 it is overwriting the port 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.990
 we look at my list here then see 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.820
 I think you are that far away from us 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.619
 that is true there 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.509
 and she only five for blitz 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.759
 so tell magic again what I update 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.250
 you're late for that matter a 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.689
 like behind because you like you 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.430
 playing in the server, for example 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.939
 if you like the video I know 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.009
 much what and yes so far for glitch yet 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.869
 a little bit i can't help it 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.459
 we just can't do anything about it now 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.080
 the point but what then do smallpox 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.510
 but is still in the picture and that is anyway 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.180
 very forfeited and then yes we can 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.340
 also that the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.810
 you don't fix and then yes then have to 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.670
 just wait for the updates to come from 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.319
 pocket 'after which you simply update the server 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.780
 and then everything will be much better 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.060
 in the meantime two versions 3 fresh 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.219
 genetically improved a lot and 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.750
 yes that so it eventually becomes the 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.609
 acid front super good as a pocket but 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.469
 the better I go the server 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.930
 I will also do a live 10 in the server 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:37.180
 that it really does not open rifle tired 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.400
 that everything just works perfectly then 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.939
 I am going to have a live stream and so when say 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.250
 but 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.420
 server is just finished because it is still 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.669
 not finished 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.980
 And yes you can now also chat now 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:50.500
 do you do a good do your ground slash 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.280
 chat but it is me or you 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.500
 does slash 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.120
 whether and now look lesson court also enter 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.370
 it didn't go well he understood chaton one 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.799
 chat or and also the chat turns on from one 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.030
 annoying is that when people join you 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.099
 state the van bla bla bla 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.019
 is give the game jjoined rusty love then 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.939
 the blue would remain loved 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.439
 that is the only idea that unfortunately is still possible 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.389
 not to be mentioned i hope there 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.230
 plug-in occurs soon but it is 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:15.189
 unfortunately not yet 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.540
 and yes that is the only thing for him 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.500
 now by the way if you have a child for example 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.419
 eg are 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.829

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.419

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.639

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.650
 also with an image and then help slash 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.019
 just come here 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.979
 and that is also possible if you are a child 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.049
 pvb film 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:34.090
 the child comes pvp there you are and you want 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.829

 spawn stand of chicken again 3 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.129
 slash tension and that can just be one there 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.250
 happens when you join them 5 next 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.900

 just a banner of slash if you like that 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.090

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:54.579

 For many people do not understand me 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:06.430
