I know that he can't really touch me so

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.440 
I know that he can't really touch me so
at<00:01:25.590> worst<00:01:25.890> he's<00:01:26.280> gonna<00:01:26.460> switch<00:01:27.000> I'm<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.390> to

at worst he's gonna switch I'm going to

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.569 
at worst he's gonna switch I'm going to
get<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> free<00:01:27.840> sub<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.829> he<00:01:29.070> actually<00:01:29.250> does<00:01:29.549> go

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
get a free sub so he actually does go

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.130 
get a free sub so he actually does go
for<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.939> explosion<00:01:30.329> which<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.780> really

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.030 
version of my team I'm always testing it
trying<00:01:54.479> new<00:01:54.630> versions<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.259> know<00:01:55.590> he<00:01:55.799> has<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
trying new versions I know he has the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.370 
trying new versions I know he has the
thick<00:01:56.189> fat<00:01:56.340> ability<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.810> don't<00:01:58.049> want<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.259> let

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
thick fat ability so I don't want to let

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.959 
thick fat ability so I don't want to let
him<00:01:58.469> set<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:58.680> calm<00:01:58.950> minds<00:01:59.280> before<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.759> try<00:01:59.939> to

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
him set up calm minds before I try to

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.600 
him set up calm minds before I try to
break<00:02:00.240> his<00:02:00.390> sub<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:01.380> he<00:02:01.890> does<00:02:02.070> resist<00:02:02.490> my

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
break his sub because he does resist my

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.190 
break his sub because he does resist my
fire<00:02:02.820> attacks<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> want<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> break<00:02:03.960> us<00:02:04.079> up

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
fire attacks so I want to break us up

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.170 
fire attacks so I want to break us up
immediately<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:05.369> I'm<00:02:05.520> thinking<00:02:05.670> he's<00:02:06.000> going

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
immediately now I'm thinking he's going

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.580 
immediately now I'm thinking he's going
to<00:02:06.240> sub<00:02:06.420> again<00:02:06.750> now<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:06.960> he's<00:02:07.200> at<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.380> plus

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
to sub again now that he's at the plus

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.990 
to sub again now that he's at the plus
one<00:02:07.710> because<00:02:08.069> with<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> thick<00:02:08.459> fat<00:02:08.700> he<00:02:08.819> might

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
one because with the thick fat he might

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.380 
one because with the thick fat he might
be<00:02:09.149> able<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.860> take<00:02:10.860> one<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.610> my<00:02:11.730> plan<00:02:11.970> was<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.180> go

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
be able to take one so my plan was to go

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.290 
be able to take one so my plan was to go
to<00:02:12.420> be<00:02:12.629> drill

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
to be drill

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.390 
to be drill
and<00:02:13.390> then<00:02:13.780> go<00:02:13.990> for<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.170> u-turn<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.100> break<00:02:15.250> his

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
and then go for the u-turn to break his

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.400 
and then go for the u-turn to break his
sub<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.940> going<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.300> Sharpedo<00:02:16.780> predicting<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
sub and going to Sharpedo predicting the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.840 
sub and going to Sharpedo predicting the
psychic<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.310> thought<00:02:18.460> that<00:02:18.550> was<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.730> pretty

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
psychic and I thought that was a pretty

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.640 
psychic and I thought that was a pretty
good<00:02:18.970> thought<00:02:19.240> process<00:02:19.720> but<00:02:20.080> he's<00:02:20.440> going<00:02:20.560> to

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
good thought process but he's going to

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.140 
good thought process but he's going to
go<00:02:20.740> straight<00:02:20.980> for<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.280> psychic<00:02:21.700> not<00:02:21.910> sure<00:02:22.030> if

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
go straight for the psychic not sure if

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.670 
go straight for the psychic not sure if
he<00:02:22.210> predicted<00:02:22.630> that<00:02:22.690> or<00:02:23.050> if<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.260> just<00:02:23.290> didn't

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
he predicted that or if you just didn't

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.520 
he predicted that or if you just didn't
think<00:02:23.710> that<00:02:23.950> he'd<00:02:24.370> be<00:02:24.520> able<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.700> take<00:02:24.940> a

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
think that he'd be able to take a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.560 
think that he'd be able to take a
fireblast<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.980> have<00:02:27.370> his<00:02:27.520> sub<00:02:27.700> up<00:02:27.850> which

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
fireblast and have his sub up which

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.850 
fireblast and have his sub up which
maybe<00:02:28.840> he<00:02:29.050> wouldn't<00:02:29.290> have<00:02:29.350> but<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:29.800> case

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
maybe he wouldn't have but in that case

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.740 
maybe he wouldn't have but in that case
he<00:02:30.250> arguably<00:02:30.970> could<00:02:31.090> have<00:02:31.270> gone<00:02:31.360> for<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.570> calm

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
he arguably could have gone for the calm

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.660 
he arguably could have gone for the calm
mind<00:02:32.020> but<00:02:32.740> either<00:02:32.950> way<00:02:33.250> I'm<00:02:33.370> just<00:02:33.400> going<00:02:33.610> to

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
mind but either way I'm just going to

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.900 
mind but either way I'm just going to
bring<00:02:33.760> in<00:02:33.880> my<00:02:34.000> Sharpedo<00:02:35.550> fizzy<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.580> pretty

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
bring in my Sharpedo fizzy a pretty

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.700 
bring in my Sharpedo fizzy a pretty
offensive<00:02:37.240> player<00:02:37.630> doesn't<00:02:38.080> do<00:02:38.410> much<00:02:38.530> with

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
offensive player doesn't do much with

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.290 
offensive player doesn't do much with
defensive<00:02:39.130> cores<00:02:39.400> or<00:02:39.580> at<00:02:39.700> least<00:02:39.910> from<00:02:40.060> the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
defensive cores or at least from the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.010 
defensive cores or at least from the
little<00:02:40.540> bit<00:02:40.660> of<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:42.120> new<00:02:43.120> experience<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:43.930> I

with an agility but Meganium is a bulky
guy<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.960> threatens<00:02:56.290> him<00:02:56.380> off<00:02:56.500> with<00:02:56.680> the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800

guy that threatens him off with the
energy<00:02:56.920> ball<00:02:57.280> but<00:02:57.880> I'm<00:02:57.970> actually<00:02:58.060> going<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.360> go

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
energy ball but I'm actually going to go

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.790 
energy ball but I'm actually going to go
straight<00:02:58.630> for<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.900> lead<00:02:59.080> see<00:02:59.290> thinking<00:02:59.710> that

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
straight for the lead see thinking that

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.850 
straight for the lead see thinking that
I<00:02:59.830> could<00:02:59.920> take<00:03:00.310> an<00:03:00.460> X<00:03:00.610> is<00:03:00.820> ur<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.860> doesn't

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
I could take an X is ur that doesn't

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.230 
I could take an X is ur that doesn't
have<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.070> sword<00:03:03.280> dance<00:03:03.520> up<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:04.000> could

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
have the sword dance up and I could

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.180 
have the sword dance up and I could
synthesis<00:03:04.690> up<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.110> all<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.920> kind<00:03:06.070> of<00:03:06.130> stuff

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
synthesis up and all that kind of stuff

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.740 
synthesis up and all that kind of stuff
so<00:03:06.850> I'm<00:03:06.940> going<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.210> go<00:03:07.270> into<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.510> nth<00:03:07.630> a

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
mind and then combine the second time

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.979 
mind and then combine the second time
after<00:03:27.160> he<00:03:27.790> breaks<00:03:27.940> my<00:03:28.150> sub<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.480> then<00:03:28.780> kill<00:03:28.959> him

after he breaks my sub and then kill him
off<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:30.220> maybe<00:03:30.670> get<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:30.940> little<00:03:30.970> bit<00:03:31.239> of<00:03:31.270> a

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
off and maybe get a little bit of a

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.270 
off and maybe get a little bit of a
sweep<00:03:31.600> going<00:03:31.810> but<00:03:32.590> he's<00:03:32.830> gonna<00:03:32.920> go<00:03:33.130> straight

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
sweep going but he's gonna go straight

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.970 
sweep going but he's gonna go straight
for<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.489> Encore<00:03:34.090> which<00:03:34.270> is<00:03:34.420> a<00:03:34.570> really<00:03:34.980> really

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
for the Encore which is a really really

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.470 
for the Encore which is a really really
nice<00:03:36.250> play<00:03:36.520> on<00:03:36.550> his<00:03:36.850> part<00:03:36.880> it<00:03:37.270> really

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
nice play on his part it really

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.570 
nice play on his part it really
countered<00:03:37.840> my<00:03:38.410> strategy<00:03:38.890> there<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.070> got<00:03:39.280> greedy

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
countered my strategy there I got greedy

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.800 
countered my strategy there I got greedy
and<00:03:39.760> that's<00:03:39.970> definitely<00:03:40.270> going<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.480> cost<00:03:40.660> me

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
and that's definitely going to cost me

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.930 
and that's definitely going to cost me
so<00:03:41.440> go<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.739> my<00:03:41.920> is<00:03:41.980> easy<00:03:42.220> master<00:03:42.489> don't<00:03:42.820> want

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
so go to my is easy master don't want

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.910 
so go to my is easy master don't want
him<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.090> get<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.239> free<00:03:43.480> switch<00:03:43.830> since<00:03:44.830> he

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
him to get a free switch since he

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.840 
him to get a free switch since he
obviously<00:03:45.190> was<00:03:45.400> going<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.580> switch<00:03:45.700> at<00:03:45.820> the

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
obviously was going to switch at the

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.010 
obviously was going to switch at the
wrong<00:03:46.030> core<00:03:46.270> you<00:03:46.390> mean<00:03:46.510> going<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.780> go<00:03:46.840> for<00:03:46.989> the

seismic toss which is going to work
nicely<00:04:18.580> for<00:04:18.910> me<00:04:18.940> he<00:04:19.480> went<00:04:19.660> straight<00:04:19.780> for<00:04:19.989> the

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
nicely for me he went straight for the

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.080 
nicely for me he went straight for the
nasty<00:04:20.440> plot<00:04:20.590> which<00:04:20.799> was<00:04:20.919> a<00:04:20.950> good<00:04:21.130> play<00:04:21.370> because

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
nasty plot which was a good play because

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.070 
nasty plot which was a good play because
i<00:04:22.240> could<00:04:22.390> have<00:04:22.479> gone<00:04:22.630> straight<00:04:22.750> for<00:04:22.930> the

protective scout and get toxic damage

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.250 
protective scout and get toxic damage
and<00:04:25.030> then<00:04:25.120> he'd<00:04:25.270> be<00:04:25.419> at<00:04:25.539> plus<00:04:25.750> two<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:26.140> then

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
and then he'd be at plus two and then

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.760 
and then he'd be at plus two and then
I'd<00:04:26.350> be<00:04:26.530> in<00:04:26.590> a

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
I'd be in a

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.110 
I'd be in a
predicament<00:04:27.400> but<00:04:28.000> now<00:04:28.180> after<00:04:29.699> i'm<00:04:30.699> going<00:04:30.940> for

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
predicament but now after i'm going for

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.059 
predicament but now after i'm going for
protect<00:04:31.479> did<00:04:31.660> not<00:04:31.780> see<00:04:31.990> any<00:04:32.199> item<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.830> knowing

that<00:04:33.190> he's<00:04:33.310> obviously<00:04:33.550> not<00:04:33.759> choice<00:04:34.030> i<00:04:34.330> can

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
that he's obviously not choice i can

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.480 
that he's obviously not choice i can
infer<00:04:35.169> that<00:04:35.349> he's<00:04:35.530> life<00:04:35.770> orb<00:04:36.069> especially

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.740 
infer that he's life orb especially
since<00:04:36.639> he<00:04:36.759> wasn't<00:04:37.060> a<00:04:37.120> lead<00:04:37.330> so<00:04:37.509> he<00:04:37.569> probably

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
since he wasn't a lead so he probably

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.600 
since he wasn't a lead so he probably
isn't<00:04:37.930> that<00:04:38.080> focus<00:04:38.379> ash<00:04:38.590> so<00:04:39.069> with<00:04:39.250> life<00:04:39.430> or

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
isn't that focus ash so with life or

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.879 
isn't that focus ash so with life or
berk<00:04:39.729> oil<00:04:39.940> and<00:04:40.150> toxic<00:04:40.720> he<00:04:41.259> is<00:04:41.470> going<00:04:41.650> to<00:04:41.770> wear

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
berk oil and toxic he is going to wear

berk oil and toxic he is going to wear
himself<00:04:42.069> out<00:04:42.400> now<00:04:42.669> I've<00:04:42.789> got<00:04:42.940> the<00:04:43.000> wish

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
whatever he brings in I thought he would

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
go for the agility predicting my protect

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.059 
go for the agility predicting my protect
but<00:04:49.000> he's<00:04:49.120> going<00:04:49.449> to<00:04:49.599> go<00:04:50.199> straight<00:04:50.590> for<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.860> X

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:51.069 
but he's going to go straight for the X

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:52.379 
but he's going to go straight for the X
is<00:04:51.280> er<00:04:51.310> which<00:04:51.520> was<00:04:51.639> a<00:04:51.699> good<00:04:51.849> play<00:04:52.060> on<00:04:52.090> his<00:04:52.360> part

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
is er which was a good play on his part

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.899 
is er which was a good play on his part
i'm<00:04:52.750> sure<00:04:52.900> he<00:04:53.050> predicted<00:04:53.440> that<00:04:53.500> so<00:04:54.129> nice<00:04:54.550> going

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:54.909 
i'm sure he predicted that so nice going

figured<00:04:57.009> he<00:04:57.099> was<00:04:57.190> going<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:57.340> get<00:04:57.460> kind<00:04:57.729> of

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
figured he was going to get kind of

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:58.860 
figured he was going to get kind of
greedy<00:04:58.120> and<00:04:58.360> go<00:04:58.449> straight<00:04:58.629> for<00:04:58.810> the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
greedy and go straight for the

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.180 
greedy and go straight for the
crabhammer<00:04:59.289> which<00:04:59.620> I<00:04:59.710> don't<00:04:59.860> think<00:05:00.009> what<00:05:00.159> a

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
crabhammer which I don't think what a

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.890 
crabhammer which I don't think what a
one-hit<00:05:00.520> ko<00:05:00.699> so<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:01.360> just<00:05:01.539> went<00:05:01.659> for<00:05:01.750> the

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
one-hit ko so I just went for the

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.089 
one-hit ko so I just went for the
earthquake<00:05:02.259> to<00:05:02.380> fire<00:05:02.560> off<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:02.860> get<00:05:02.949> some

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
earthquake to fire off to get some

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:04.710 
earthquake to fire off to get some
damage<00:05:03.490> to<00:05:03.520> sharp<00:05:03.849> you<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.060> get<00:05:04.210> revenge<00:05:04.330> kill

damage to sharp you to get revenge kill

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.779 
damage to sharp you to get revenge kill
but<00:05:05.229> he<00:05:05.319> would<00:05:05.440> straight<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.740> motham<00:05:06.069> so<00:05:06.699> I'm

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
but he would straight to motham so I'm

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.219 
but he would straight to motham so I'm
going<00:05:06.940> to<00:05:07.000> stay<00:05:07.180> in<00:05:07.330> here<00:05:07.539> and<00:05:07.780> go<00:05:07.990> straight

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
going to stay in here and go straight

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.990 
going to stay in here and go straight
for<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.500> South<00:05:09.069> rocks<00:05:09.340> because<00:05:09.759> I'm<00:05:09.849> sure

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
for the South rocks because I'm sure

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.670 
for the South rocks because I'm sure
Sharpedo<00:05:10.389> can<00:05:10.599> revenge<00:05:10.810> kill<00:05:11.110> this<00:05:11.229> thing<00:05:11.289> and

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
Sharpedo can revenge kill this thing and

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.409 
Sharpedo can revenge kill this thing and
he<00:05:12.009> doesn't<00:05:12.250> have<00:05:12.340> anything<00:05:12.550> that<00:05:12.759> can<00:05:12.789> switch

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
he doesn't have anything that can switch

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.180 
he doesn't have anything that can switch
into<00:05:13.659> sharp<00:05:13.870> eatos<00:05:14.110> attack<00:05:14.139> safely<00:05:14.860> so<00:05:15.039> he'll

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
into sharp eatos attack safely so he'll

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.399 
into sharp eatos attack safely so he'll
probably<00:05:15.430> fodder<00:05:15.789> it<00:05:16.000> so<00:05:16.780> I<00:05:16.810> wasn't<00:05:17.259> too

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
probably fodder it so I wasn't too

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.350 
probably fodder it so I wasn't too
worried<00:05:17.710> about<00:05:17.770> losing<00:05:18.009> my<00:05:18.219> sand<00:05:18.490> /<00:05:18.669> but<00:05:19.270> he's

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
worried about losing my sand / but he's

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.670 
worried about losing my sand / but he's
actually<00:05:19.599> going<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.050> get<00:05:20.139> a<00:05:20.169> flinch<00:05:20.500> which

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
actually going to get a flinch which

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.680 
actually going to get a flinch which
means<00:05:20.949> no<00:05:21.219> rocks<00:05:21.490> for<00:05:21.759> me<00:05:21.909> which<00:05:22.419> we're<00:05:22.569> going

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
means no rocks for me which we're going

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.059 
means no rocks for me which we're going
to<00:05:22.750> see<00:05:22.930> how<00:05:23.139> that<00:05:23.349> affects<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:23.710> rest<00:05:23.919> of<00:05:24.009> the

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.640 
to see how that affects the rest of the
bottle<00:05:24.370> so<00:05:24.490> that<00:05:24.520> thirty<00:05:24.789> percent<00:05:25.210> is<00:05:25.479> uh

definitely<00:05:26.650> not<00:05:26.860> favoring<00:05:27.490> me<00:05:27.610> right<00:05:27.789> now<00:05:27.909> so

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
definitely not favoring me right now so

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.059 
definitely not favoring me right now so
I'm<00:05:28.569> going<00:05:28.690> to<00:05:28.719> go<00:05:28.840> into<00:05:28.960> Sharpedo<00:05:29.500> and<00:05:29.770> as<00:05:29.919> I

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
I'm going to go into Sharpedo and as I

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:31.589 
I'm going to go into Sharpedo and as I
figured<00:05:30.400> well<00:05:30.789> actually<00:05:30.909> not<00:05:31.150> as<00:05:31.270> I<00:05:31.360> figured

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
figured well actually not as I figured

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:32.550 
figured well actually not as I figured
he's<00:05:31.719> going<00:05:31.870> to<00:05:31.930> actually<00:05:32.169> switch<00:05:32.319> out<00:05:32.469> the

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
he's going to actually switch out the

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.719 
he's going to actually switch out the
hitmonchan<00:05:32.889> which<00:05:33.190> is<00:05:33.310> normally<00:05:33.639> a<00:05:33.669> good

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
hitmonchan which is normally a good

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.059 
hitmonchan which is normally a good
Sharpedo<00:05:34.180> counter<00:05:34.710> normally<00:05:35.710> I<00:05:35.740> do<00:05:35.860> actually

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
Sharpedo counter normally I do actually

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.800 
Sharpedo counter normally I do actually
kit<00:05:36.400> or<00:05:36.520> not<00:05:36.669> normally<00:05:37.030> but<00:05:37.120> now<00:05:37.270> I<00:05:37.300> carries<00:05:37.690> n

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
kit or not normally but now I carries n

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.450 
kit or not normally but now I carries n
head<00:05:38.020> but<00:05:38.139> on<00:05:38.259> my<00:05:38.349> Sharpedo<00:05:38.770> but<00:05:39.009> back<00:05:39.159> then<00:05:39.190> I

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
head but on my Sharpedo but back then I

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.649 
head but on my Sharpedo but back then I
didn't<00:05:39.729> I<00:05:39.880> went<00:05:40.120> for<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.300> hydro<00:05:40.539> pump

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
didn't I went for the hydro pump

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.860 
didn't I went for the hydro pump
predicting<00:05:41.050> the<00:05:41.139> switch<00:05:41.380> and<00:05:42.690> that<00:05:43.690> really

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
predicting the switch and that really

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.180 
predicting the switch and that really
sucks<00:05:44.080> for<00:05:44.229> me<00:05:44.319> because<00:05:44.409> now<00:05:44.620> is<00:05:44.770> hitmonchan

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
sucks for me because now is hitmonchan

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.010 
sucks for me because now is hitmonchan
is<00:05:45.430> not<00:05:45.610> going<00:05:45.729> to<00:05:45.819> take<00:05:45.969> a<00:05:46.150> good<00:05:46.479> at<00:05:46.719> least

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
is not going to take a good at least

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.430 
is not going to take a good at least
thirty<00:05:47.259> percent<00:05:47.650> of<00:05:48.479> HP<00:05:49.479> with<00:05:49.779> a<00:05:49.810> hydro<00:05:50.289> pump

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
thirty percent of HP with a hydro pump

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.370 
thirty percent of HP with a hydro pump
and<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:50.830> fact<00:05:51.039> that<00:05:51.099> he's<00:05:51.279> life<00:05:51.520> word<00:05:52.380> means

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
and the fact that he's life word means

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.959 
and the fact that he's life word means
he<00:05:53.500> is<00:05:53.590> going<00:05:53.710> to<00:05:53.800> be<00:05:53.889> able<00:05:53.979> to<00:05:54.250> get<00:05:54.400> KO<00:05:54.610> my

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:54.969 
he is going to be able to get KO my

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:57.269 
he is going to be able to get KO my
Meganium<00:05:55.360> I<00:05:55.750> figured<00:05:56.409> if<00:05:56.529> he<00:05:56.560> was<00:05:56.800> in<00:05:56.919> life<00:05:57.039> or

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:57.279 
Meganium I figured if he was in life or

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:59.339 
Meganium I figured if he was in life or
by<00:05:57.370> could<00:05:57.520> take<00:05:57.669> two<00:05:57.880> hits<00:05:58.150> synthesis<00:05:58.930> up<00:05:59.139> or

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
by could take two hits synthesis up or

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:01.469 
by could take two hits synthesis up or
even<00:05:59.409> go<00:05:59.830> straight<00:06:00.099> for<00:06:00.219> a<00:06:00.279> seed<00:06:00.550> bomb<00:06:00.729> and<00:06:00.940> at-

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
even go straight for a seed bomb and at-

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.390 
even go straight for a seed bomb and at-
to<00:06:01.900> that<00:06:02.529> put<00:06:02.740> him<00:06:02.860> at<00:06:02.919> a<00:06:02.949> very<00:06:03.219> vulnerable

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
to that put him at a very vulnerable

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.959 
to that put him at a very vulnerable
range<00:06:03.909> so<00:06:04.150> an<00:06:04.240> aqua<00:06:04.509> jet<00:06:04.539> could<00:06:04.810> easily<00:06:05.139> KO<00:06:05.349> and

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:05.969 
range so an aqua jet could easily KO and

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.519 
range so an aqua jet could easily KO and
now<00:06:06.969> that<00:06:07.150> he<00:06:07.270> has<00:06:07.330> the<00:06:07.479> minus<00:06:07.750> two<00:06:07.900> defenses

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:08.529 
now that he has the minus two defenses

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:10.649 
now that he has the minus two defenses
I'm<00:06:08.740> hoping<00:06:09.009> an<00:06:09.130> aqua<00:06:09.370> jet<00:06:09.400> can<00:06:09.729> kill<00:06:09.969> and<00:06:10.539> it

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
I'm hoping an aqua jet can kill and it

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:12.839 
I'm hoping an aqua jet can kill and it
goes<00:06:10.810> down<00:06:11.050> down<00:06:11.110> down<00:06:11.650> but<00:06:11.919> not<00:06:12.159> down<00:06:12.460> enough

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
goes down down down but not down enough

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:15.149 
goes down down down but not down enough
so<00:06:13.389> I'm<00:06:13.630> thinking<00:06:14.169> that<00:06:14.259> that<00:06:14.409> was<00:06:14.590> not<00:06:14.650> max

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
so I'm thinking that that was not max

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.279 
so I'm thinking that that was not max
damage<00:06:15.460> I<00:06:15.880> didn't<00:06:16.539> actually<00:06:16.599> run<00:06:16.870> a<00:06:16.930> calc<00:06:17.199> all

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
damage I didn't actually run a calc all

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:18.600 
damage I didn't actually run a calc all
because<00:06:17.560> I<00:06:17.590> didn't<00:06:17.830> bother<00:06:17.979> asking<00:06:18.460> him<00:06:18.580> for

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
because I didn't bother asking him for

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.279 
because I didn't bother asking him for
his<00:06:18.789> set<00:06:19.060> but<00:06:19.599> if<00:06:19.690> he's<00:06:19.840> a<00:06:19.900> standard

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
his set but if he's a standard

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:23.339 
his set but if he's a standard
hitmonchan<00:06:20.650> set<00:06:21.069> I<00:06:22.060> think<00:06:22.900> that<00:06:22.990> that<00:06:23.110> was<00:06:23.289> not

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:23.349 
hitmonchan set I think that that was not

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:25.830 
hitmonchan set I think that that was not
max<00:06:23.740> damage<00:06:23.949> so<00:06:24.370> random<00:06:25.150> number<00:06:25.389> generators

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
max damage so random number generators

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.779 
max damage so random number generators
and<00:06:26.020> flinches<00:06:26.380> are<00:06:26.529> not<00:06:26.680> being<00:06:27.340> too<00:06:27.490> good<00:06:27.639> for

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
and flinches are not being too good for

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:29.519 
and flinches are not being too good for
me<00:06:27.880> and<00:06:28.090> the<00:06:28.719> fact<00:06:28.870> that<00:06:28.930> I<00:06:29.050> got<00:06:29.169> greedy<00:06:29.409> with

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:29.529 
me and the fact that I got greedy with

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:31.589 
me and the fact that I got greedy with
that<00:06:29.710> entei<00:06:30.039> is<00:06:30.099> really<00:06:30.370> costing<00:06:30.789> me<00:06:30.940> so<00:06:31.150> here

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 
that entei is really costing me so here

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.300 
that entei is really costing me so here
is<00:06:31.719> pretty<00:06:31.960> much<00:06:32.050> my<00:06:32.110> last<00:06:32.409> hope<00:06:32.620> I<00:06:32.889> have<00:06:33.219> to

is pretty much my last hope I have to

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.620 
is pretty much my last hope I have to

us<00:06:40.100> would<00:06:40.340> be<00:06:40.370> able<00:06:40.520> to<00:06:40.640> ohko<00:06:41.000> although<00:06:41.570> it

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
actually got really close because this

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.610 
actually got really close because this
is<00:06:43.460> my<00:06:43.580> version<00:06:44.060> with<00:06:44.480> a<00:06:44.510> more<00:06:45.050> special<00:06:45.380> attack

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
is my version with a more special attack

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.740 
is my version with a more special attack
investment<00:06:46.130> than<00:06:46.220> HP<00:06:46.370> but<00:06:47.180> that's<00:06:47.330> not<00:06:47.570> going

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
investment than HP but that's not going

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.060 
investment than HP but that's not going
to<00:06:47.840> be<00:06:47.870> the<00:06:47.990> case<00:06:48.170> and<00:06:48.410> that<00:06:48.500> is<00:06:48.680> going<00:06:48.890> to<00:06:48.980> be

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.070 
to be the case and that is going to be

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.310 
to be the case and that is going to be
the<00:06:49.160> game<00:06:49.340> so<00:06:49.700> great<00:06:50.450> game<00:06:50.660> fizzy<00:06:51.050> that<00:06:51.230> was

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320 
the game so great game fizzy that was
