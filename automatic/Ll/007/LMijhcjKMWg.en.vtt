00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.859
 fourth episode even kids today are 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.660
 all alone because I wanted to see a 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.000
 little to try to win one 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.470
 match alone is where there is still a 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.059
 minute or so before it starts 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.650
 I remember how to always leave it 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.540
 lech below if you want me to continue 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.460
 this series is a comment if you have 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.870
 anything to suggest me now 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.420
 we wait for the hired killers that the lobby is 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.370
 after ok, sucksoli has loaded the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.019
 we are about twenty 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.150
 so it will be a pretty match 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.799
 difficult now let's go straight to 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.879
 take the baskets there are the middle and 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.710
 here we go looking 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.690
 obviously the one who blocks and will be there 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.519
 so I was on the map then this 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.510
 it must be a kind of Texan map 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.220
 the first time I do it then 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.080
 in which idea of ​​where i 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.119
 lakes blog that we take these pieces of 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.070
 armor here the sword that took care of the grip 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.630
 and alessi we will loosen c immediately 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.399
 below we are already set to be 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.070
 start pretty well where we have 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.659
 found the pants and the chain bust 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.270
 now that we have moved away we can 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.680
 put all the armor on it because if there 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.659
 they saw from the vent they begin to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.159
 chase only to us and we begin to 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.409
 open the first lucky bloc that has 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.479
 rollati block teleporter slope 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.770
 lucky lucky box indeed boys 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.450
 why not be seen the past 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.859
 episodes are not there so obviously 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.560
 Lucky lock lakes are also there 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.119
 those losers who opt in teleportation 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.280
 another place or inter sport 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:42.719
 enemies for a certain amount of time from you then 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:44.670
 share does when in all places 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.020
 how many times is he cheering me on and 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.149
 meanwhile I'm beating everyone 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.340
 those from which michele transports you are 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.590
 paid ok has stopped me and I give you 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.420
 moved up to down by 100 people myself 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.969
 but at some point purple with i 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.729
 korn and maybe it was lifeless is one that 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.960
 blocks pretty bad guys because 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.189
 all of a sudden you see yourself one that is 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.810
 part violates a couple of shots 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.670
 especially if you miss pro gravity is 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.499
 dead we found the sword with 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.819
 fire aspect I know it does less damage 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:10.470
 than that of peter 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.240
 just that south or a hit with these here 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.910
 he begins to attack again by peter 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.470
 things quite another bloc that lighty 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.340
 were lucky block teleporter goes 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.220
 well here what is there is nothing is fine 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.350
 then we are strangers boys because 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.960
 should do as if anything flex that a 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.970
 right there should be the thing I do 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.010
 call the points table instead not 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.720
 there was nothing here they should put it 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.150
 this right and tells you how many people there are 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.660
 so live wooden sword that always has 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.310
 4 of damage and it seems to me enough road 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.080
 that the wood school and take off how much 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.270
 a savona golden sword this enough 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.080
 ridiculous they should fix this 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.010
 what, however, down there is one who knows 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.290
 we have to go get it 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.600
 immediately then we sell the 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.460
 iron team of gold iron in 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.750
 hand that to the fajr aspect that the thing is 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.910
 enough phillies to that sword of 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.830
 iron that we must use in disposal 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.060
 opening a chest is burning 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.500
 try to beat him i ok he died 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.500
 perfect I see a name in the ground perhaps 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.360
 the corpse we take this thing here 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.220
 iron sword obviously remove a 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.830
 casino so we put it there 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.370
 let's eat lamela 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.620
 ok choose guys things to eat for 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.540
 strength here there was nothing we cross 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.520
 these species are always going here 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.200
 in this house it is a kind of flag 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.850
 this is the case of spain 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.710
 something like that 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.000
 let's see what's here in the middle of nothing 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:38.160
 are understanding useless hollow you are 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.560
 absolutely useless because if not here 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.690
 there is nothing I can get away with hands 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.640
 empty here is a chat that is 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.720
 quite useful only of course yes 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.520
 have experience but we don't have 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.000
 found in mind a little with we find 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.990
 this is the end but hut where the entrance 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.010
 cream where the entry is 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.530
 ok here is something there is nothing 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.920
 so the eagle is so then this 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:07.650
 dragons block a firework after 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.000
 then i have here is one maybe i am where 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.370
 they are chasing each other they are in a team 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.400
 no I'm not on TV so we can also 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.870
 regroup here the fight we kill it 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.820
 uncle giorgio panto is dead if not yes 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.010
 throws in the water is dead 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.600
 Why the hell all the things disappeared 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.370
 I don't believe things 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.140
 the lucky block nerd destiny should 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.060
 reappear were the inventory or 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.220
 I do not know now in the meantime you are 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.440
 regenerating the health of the sword of 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.850
 wood if I'm not mistaken though cabbage 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.490
 we can do nothing 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.960
 we have the fishing rod oh god 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.430
 little girl tell me somebody's pecking gods 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.560
 lakes block that reversed things 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.750
 that is, that he took the sword is 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.580
 another thing and instead I stayed with 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.900
 these two unlucky things have it there 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.690
 I can believe having a sword with fire 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.250
 aspect guys like you see with the lakes 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.410
 bloc you can reverse all things 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.090
 easily it is useless that we lose 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.440
 time to chase that we go there 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.570
 under the office the reebok what was there at 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.400
 lux highlight for this server and German 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.980
 because they don't make a private server 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.030
 to the extreme Italians, that is to say even though 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.380
 you know they wonder this and between the 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.600
 comments although I don't think there is 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.490
 however we continue from here we open 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.980
 this lakes block where there is karting 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.200
 table something useful only in certain 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.970
 situations says another lucky block 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.020
 let's go and get that full 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.820
 very little of maxima of 246 I'm langhe 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.800
 doc there was a gold lock that can 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.150
 serve to make the golden apple on 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.480
 shore explained the only apple we have 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.530
 found here unnecessarily site 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.780
 teleporter that has me 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.530
 teleported to the center maybe there is one 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.850
 apple where the potatoes are in the center 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.980
 was a rejection of the baskets seems to me 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:45.900
 strange there are all these things and me 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:50.580
 we are on the iron now I go of stone and 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:52.470
 just okay then we are 2468 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.700
 we go to that train where we don't 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.260
 commands from the beginning we see if there is 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.170
 someone if we can beat him 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.880
 above all as swords we are not put 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.620
 so good because that witch 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.760
 stole my iron team and the 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.550
 team confirms 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.230
 aspect we were well placed before 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.420
 maybe we had some hope of 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.270
 winning now can therefore not know 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.770
 including how much time there is a death match 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.540
 because the test didn't have it then 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.370
 or is when we get to four players 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.450
 yet something done at random yet not 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.590
 I know 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.970
 anyway let's go and get that lakes 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.530
 block they spoke I saw another 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.350
 we hope to find at least some weapons 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.210
 here around then we open this lakes 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.680
 block 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:33.630
 let 's take what a cow was 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.640
 in the inventory there is nothing okay 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.800
 let's open the wc here with the other 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.560
 there should be 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.510
 I ended up in the water let's eat a 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.010
 little bit of meat maps that make it big 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.930
 that there must be a shoulder 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.040
 here I see that there is one that perhaps has seen 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:53.930
 so my name is also coming 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:58.130
 towards me while he teleported me 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:00.120
 I don't believe he teleported me from 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.740
 speak I don't know who now I obviously 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.290
 i am very and i stayed like 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.479
 perfect spectator who left 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.860
 really lucky i hate these box sides 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:09.750
 next time when boys are 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.160
 put well they do not open it in long care 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.450
 guys that with this game we can 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.770
 to say is not that if gone so much is worth 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.900
 we were slightly unlucky as 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.729
 we can always finish this video here 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.410
 we remind you of an exemplary single mind sin 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:22.640
 Here you sign up and see you 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.640
 tomorrow when we video
