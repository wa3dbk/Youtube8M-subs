00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.039
 one more easy recipe coming me 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.410
 I'm going to get a small piece of salt for 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.869
 In the fire 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.470
 how difficult the stove oven call 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.090
 cool bridal were kind heaven and will 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.370
 put here in my family 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.180
 had all the ingredients so will 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.180
 a can of condensed milk 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:45.160
 I think my pan is too small for 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:49.060
 I'll never change, and everything will not fire. 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.990
 Down we went as a spoonful of 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.240
 unsalted butter soup will have 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.640
 joking that until the Easter of the year that 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.480
 Come on, it's okay, who wants to eat. 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.180
 Brigadier with house is invited 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.460
 I'm the type who loves chocolate. 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.369
 in case of stay eating know why 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.140
 now this different game because 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.570
 in place of powdered chocolate I go 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.130
 to put half-sour chocolate shavings 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.249
 is catching is that we here in this 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:26.740
 blog is too thin not doing any 

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:34.240
 thing so chocolate or tied I go 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:36.850
 give a little stir here I think today 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.189
 no tragedy is going to happen 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.189
 cheering for me, so that it does not happen 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.729
 I know you have fun with mine. 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.899
 tragedies, but it 's good to make a recipe 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.289
 right 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:54.959
 today there is no neighbor kan also the beauty 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.959
 Look, only people, beauty. 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.609
 here was 6 medium chocolate bar 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.649
 bitter're 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:05.740
 I'll post on the blog all the measurements 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:09.009
 Right for you, then it's now. 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.830
 I come the shot of this recipe is the part that 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.310
 will differentiate my husband from the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:21.470
 I'll put a tablespoon too much 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.610
 essence of rum 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.020
 Actually, I wanted to do this. 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.770
 Mint chocolate 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.870
 I do not think a mint essence is 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.070
 in the essence of the street 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.680
 for those who love to take the gogol out there 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.300
 In my case, the brigadeiro is not going to 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.970
 inside and now people this science and 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.850
 move until you get to a point that is 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:56.820
 peel off the bottom of the pan then stir 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:59.490
 stir well stir well 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.440
 a few minutes practically 15 minutes 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.200
 I think that this brigadier 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.020
 He'll get the point quickly then. 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.990
 before actually getting a point I 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.760
 I recommend you check to see if it is 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.410
 tastes bad if he's with a 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.810
 It tastes good if you have to add 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.400
 cuter you add then now 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.220
 that moment you shake hands 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.180
 left and provoked a right I go 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.890
 prove that you are almost at the point already me 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.470
 Here I come, I see the bottom of the pan 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:37.080
 Can you see that too? 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:41.490
 รณ is almost at the point will only ever leave 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:45.890
 a little more civil than easy more 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:48.800
 Easy too fast too. 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.390
 opel mexo here รณ I see the whole bottom of 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.890
 Panela, I'm going to hang up. 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.780
 I do not even give people 10 minutes now. 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.000
 I'll transfer if Brigadier ready 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.330
 container to cool to power 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.040
 to roll 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.500
 now I come and I transfer all the 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.830
 Brigadier Promoter Container Looks Like 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.100
 sling off then I'll show you not 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.720
 It is nothing nothing nothing nothing in the pot and 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.669
 unglued todinho and yields saw people 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.700
 imagine this for a goal stuffing 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.430
 It should be good too right 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.740
 Now let's hope to spy. 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.320
 Good now that the brigadeiro is already cold 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.120
 Are you missing here? 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.070
 little pieces I did not eat I was just 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.980
 testing to see if it was cold and 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.110
 He was in rolled point then went on to 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.020
 just a little margarine in my 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.780
 hand and to be able to roll up the 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.150
 I bought this granulate in 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.470
 missang but you can use your 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:56.680
 preference 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:56.680
 Brig is O Durinho 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.090
 and now it's just making balls 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:07.229
 everybody is doing right people 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:11.639
 very easy to wind up renting them in 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:13.350
 and put on the ant if you 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:17.570
 you have home you do not have you 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.570
 fit in some container 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.699
 My tip for you is to wait. 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.560
 He's very cold, if he is. 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.710
 hot you'll have a hard time 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.160
 coil then let cool this well 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.850
 brigadeiro will take a little bit longer 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.850
 it's part 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.880
 and this is the end result of our 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.620
 rum brigadeiro is seeing that 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.370
 beautiful 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:02.720
 I'm going to confess that I've tasted it because 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.789
 you can not waste enough 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.220
 Thai, can you make my mint? 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:10.020
 The initial idea was to make mint more 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.580
 There's no going for you, right? 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.200
 so this is what I hope you have 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.020
 I hope you are well 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.630
 dying for it 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.240
 now I'm going to have to eat hamburger because 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.849
 After all, all the time, then a kiss to
