00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.910
 then the maintenance and the recipe of a 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.220
 bisque that we will call fast 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.809
 plans to use the heads for 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.610
 revive a bisque in a more 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.469
 fast but that will be just as tasteful 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.900
 the cooking water used to cook 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.480
 lobster marc keller dropped the themes 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.340
 that's the most important thing 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.279
 so we will obviously add 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.699
 a nice little good aromatic garnish 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.699
 white wine 1 minced onion 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:41.230
 a nice scarf little bouquet garni 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.180
 composed of a few branches of laurel 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.470
 a little bit of rosemary 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.140
 and of course thyme 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:55.020
 we either been harvested in the scrubland 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:01:00.490
 around my nose and then we'll add 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.230
 two crushed garlic mousses one goes 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.190
 finish with 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.610
 some nice spoonful of concentrate 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.610
 tomato 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.790
 we have to cook about 46.8 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.380
 so we see that now the bisque 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:38.610
 is cooked then we remove the filling 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:40.979
 aromatic and we mixed it concretely 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.460
 now we will spend this juice in the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:52.140
 Chinese to his ends to express all 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:53.810
 the sugars the better he is there he is 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.450
 like my loan so it's not necessary 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.710
 really well recover everything but 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.570
 now the goal is to do it 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.520
 reduce to boiling 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.979
 for the water to evaporate and the mass 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.380
 concentrates to thicken it and to 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.209
 to concentrate the tastes that's gone so 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.479
 for a good fifteen miles 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.479
 boiling 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.480
 after 20 minutes of boiling 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.660
 to force reduction mission us 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.900
 got a little bisque 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.550
 thicker and very strong in 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.459
 so here to finish it now we 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.379
 arrives at the end we add a beautiful 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.510
 amount of fresh cream that corresponds 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.430
 half at about half the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.390
 amount of since you left 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.290
 take back an idea can there always 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.290
 important to taste 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.420
 it's not bad yourself a little bit 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.540
 sweet again we will rectify 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.670
 salt seasoning obviously have 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.460
 juice to advance some repairs 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.980
 who support who supports pretty well 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.550
 to be a little bit raised and 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.260
 now the final touch this 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.060
 will be these few saffron pistils 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.270
 that's what I like nobody at the ap 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.540
 hm is bringing a big nut 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:17.670
 butter at the end and mixed to bring 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.670
 the creaminess and see the farm or simple 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:29.360
 last step just pour it 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:32.330
 in a nice soup plates and 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.400
 serve well hot to and some 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.360
 drops of olive oil will come from the sky 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.700
