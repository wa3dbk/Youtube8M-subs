00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
half step ok so here we go we're gonna

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.350 
half step ok so here we go we're gonna
start<00:00:30.080> on<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.320> note<00:00:30.529> E<00:00:30.769> what's<00:00:31.730> a<00:00:31.849> whole<00:00:32.059> step

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
start on the note E what's a whole step

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.340 
start on the note E what's a whole step
up<00:00:32.570> from<00:00:32.900> the<00:00:32.930> note<00:00:33.199> e<00:00:34.269> if<00:00:35.269> you<00:00:35.330> said<00:00:35.690> f-sharp

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
up from the note e if you said f-sharp

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.229 
up from the note e if you said f-sharp
that's<00:00:36.589> correct<00:00:36.949> good<00:00:37.309> job<00:00:37.550> so<00:00:37.820> it<00:00:37.909> goes<00:00:38.089> from

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
that's correct good job so it goes from

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.500 
that's correct good job so it goes from
E<00:00:38.570> to<00:00:38.780> F<00:00:38.900> sharp<00:00:39.339> now<00:00:40.339> from<00:00:40.610> F<00:00:40.790> sharp<00:00:41.120> a<00:00:41.299> whole

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
E to F sharp now from F sharp a whole

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.369 
E to F sharp now from F sharp a whole
step<00:00:41.750> up<00:00:41.960> would<00:00:42.140> be<00:00:43.420> G<00:00:44.420> sharp<00:00:44.449> that's<00:00:45.049> correct

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
step up would be G sharp that's correct

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.079 
step up would be G sharp that's correct
and<00:00:45.650> now<00:00:45.920> we're<00:00:46.100> up<00:00:46.220> to<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.489> half<00:00:46.729> step<00:00:47.059> so

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
and now we're up to the half step so

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.070 
and now we're up to the half step so
what's<00:00:47.479> a<00:00:47.600> half<00:00:47.809> step<00:00:48.140> up<00:00:48.320> from<00:00:48.739> G<00:00:48.920> sharp<00:00:50.080> very

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
what's a half step up from G sharp very

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.890 
what's a half step up from G sharp very
good<00:00:51.379> a<00:00:51.909> now<00:00:52.909> we're<00:00:53.180> doing<00:00:53.299> another<00:00:53.659> whole

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
good a now we're doing another whole

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.090 
good a now we're doing another whole
step<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:54.440> a<00:00:54.470> whole<00:00:54.710> step<00:00:54.949> up<00:00:55.190> from<00:00:55.489> a<00:00:55.760> would<00:00:56.059> be

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
step so a whole step up from a would be

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.049 
step so a whole step up from a would be
B<00:00:58.100> that's<00:00:58.519> correct

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
B that's correct

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.729 
B that's correct
and<00:00:59.239> now<00:00:59.360> another<00:00:59.570> whole<00:00:59.839> step<00:01:00.110> up<00:01:00.350> from<00:01:00.559> B

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
and now another whole step up from B

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.359 
and now another whole step up from B
would<00:01:01.070> be<00:01:01.809> C<00:01:02.809> sharp<00:01:03.170> good<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:03.860> then<00:01:04.100> another

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
would be C sharp good and then another

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.959 
would be C sharp good and then another
whole<00:01:04.580> step<00:01:04.850> up<00:01:05.059> from<00:01:05.269> C<00:01:05.510> sharp<00:01:05.540> would<00:01:06.110> be<00:01:06.969> D

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
whole step up from C sharp would be D

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:09.849 
whole step up from C sharp would be D
sharp<00:01:08.329> good<00:01:08.719> and<00:01:09.049> then<00:01:09.170> we're<00:01:09.350> at<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:09.619> final

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
sharp good and then we're at the final

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:12.520 
sharp good and then we're at the final
half<00:01:10.219> step<00:01:10.579> a<00:01:10.729> half<00:01:10.909> step<00:01:11.180> up<00:01:11.359> from<00:01:11.570> d<00:01:11.840> sharp<00:01:12.200> is

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
half step a half step up from d sharp is

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.359 
half step a half step up from d sharp is
going<00:01:12.799> to<00:01:12.950> take<00:01:13.159> us<00:01:13.369> to<00:01:13.579> the<00:01:13.700> note<00:01:13.880> e<00:01:15.369> that

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
going to take us to the note e that

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.630 
going to take us to the note e that
takes<00:01:17.000> us<00:01:17.180> back<00:01:17.359> to<00:01:17.390> where<00:01:17.689> we<00:01:17.810> started<00:01:17.840> so

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
takes us back to where we started so

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.779 
takes us back to where we started so
that<00:01:19.640> is<00:01:19.850> our<00:01:20.030> E<00:01:20.240> major<00:01:20.810> scale<00:01:21.609> alright<00:01:22.609> so

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
that is our E major scale alright so

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.149 
that is our E major scale alright so
next<00:01:22.939> let's<00:01:23.299> build<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.780> major<00:01:24.170> scale<00:01:24.350> off<00:01:24.859> of

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
next let's build a major scale off of

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.789 
next let's build a major scale off of
the<00:01:25.340> note<00:01:25.520> a<00:01:25.700> flat<00:01:26.259> what<00:01:27.259> should<00:01:27.469> be<00:01:27.619> our<00:01:27.770> next

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
the note a flat what should be our next

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.349 
the note a flat what should be our next

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:08.080 
the note e flat and where do we go from
there<00:02:05.710> that's<00:02:06.710> right<00:02:07.009> another<00:02:07.369> whole<00:02:07.639> step<00:02:07.850> up

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
there that's right another whole step up

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.660 
there that's right another whole step up
to<00:02:08.270> F<00:02:08.420> good<00:02:08.899> job<00:02:09.170> then<00:02:10.100> we're

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.250 

we<00:02:14.670> have<00:02:14.790> another<00:02:15.000> haul<00:02:15.270> step<00:02:15.569> up<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.110> note

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
we have another haul step up to the note

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.360 
we have another haul step up to the note
G<00:02:16.650> good<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:18.019> what's<00:02:19.019> next<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.830> next<00:02:23.129> would<00:02:23.250> be

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
G good and what's next the next would be

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.309 
G good and what's next the next would be
a<00:02:23.400> half<00:02:23.670> step<00:02:23.700> up<00:02:24.120> from<00:02:24.300> G<00:02:24.540> which<00:02:24.780> would<00:02:24.959> be<00:02:25.140> a

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
a half step up from G which would be a

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.089 
a half step up from G which would be a
flat<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.849> flat<00:02:27.330> major<00:02:27.599> scale

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
flat that is the a flat major scale

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.900 
flat that is the a flat major scale
alright<00:02:29.099> we're<00:02:29.220> going<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.370> do<00:02:29.550> one<00:02:29.700> more<00:02:29.730> thing

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
alright we're going to do one more thing

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.660 
alright we're going to do one more thing
to<00:02:30.209> check<00:02:30.390> your<00:02:30.540> understanding<00:02:31.340> this<00:02:32.340> scale

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
to check your understanding this scale

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.729 
to check your understanding this scale
in<00:02:32.819> front<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.900> B<00:02:34.230> flat<00:02:34.530> major

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
in front of you is the B flat major

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.160 
in front of you is the B flat major
scale<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:35.610> one<00:02:35.849> note<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.330> incorrect

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
scale but one note is incorrect

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.259

this checking for whole steps and half
steps<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.790> see<00:02:42.000> if<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.180> can<00:02:42.360> identify<00:02:42.510> which

steps and see if you can identify which

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.860 
steps and see if you can identify which
note<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.650> wrong

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.890 

were<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:48.080> able<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.470> figure<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.770> out<00:02:49.900> let's

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
were you able to figure it out let's

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.449 
were you able to figure it out let's
build<00:02:51.140> up<00:02:51.290> from<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.590> bottom<00:02:51.920> until<00:02:52.069> we<00:02:52.280> get<00:02:52.400> to

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
build up from the bottom until we get to

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.000 
build up from the bottom until we get to
the<00:02:52.700> wrong<00:02:52.880> note<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:53.750> first<00:02:53.989> we<00:02:54.140> have<00:02:54.260> B<00:02:54.440> flat<00:02:54.470> a

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
the wrong note so first we have B flat a

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.880 
the wrong note so first we have B flat a
whole<00:02:55.370> step<00:02:55.580> up<00:02:55.790> from<00:02:56.000> B<00:02:56.150> flat<00:02:56.390> is<00:02:56.599> C<00:02:56.959> then<00:02:57.709> we

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
whole step up from B flat is C then we

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.520 
whole step up from B flat is C then we
have<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.550> whole<00:02:58.819> step<00:02:59.090> up<00:02:59.360> from<00:02:59.720> C<00:02:59.989> which<00:03:00.260> gives

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
have a whole step up from C which gives

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.620 
have a whole step up from C which gives
us<00:03:00.680> D<00:03:01.010> now<00:03:01.760> we're<00:03:01.940> at<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.120> point<00:03:02.150> where<00:03:02.510> we're

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
us D now we're at the point where we're

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.930 
us D now we're at the point where we're
gonna<00:03:02.690> go<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:02.959> half<00:03:03.260> step<00:03:03.590> but<00:03:03.890> notice<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.700> takes

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
gonna go a half step but notice it takes

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.660 
gonna go a half step but notice it takes
us<00:03:05.150> up<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.569> note<00:03:05.720> e<00:03:05.980> from<00:03:06.980> D<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.220> E<00:03:07.370> as<00:03:07.640> a

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
us up to the note e from D to E as a

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.460 
us up to the note e from D to E as a
whole<00:03:07.970> step<00:03:08.300> so<00:03:08.569> this<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:08.930> actually<00:03:09.319> the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
whole step so this is actually the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.520 
whole step so this is actually the
incorrect<00:03:09.890> note<00:03:10.160> it<00:03:10.400> should<00:03:10.700> be<00:03:10.880> an<00:03:11.090> E<00:03:11.390> flat<00:03:11.600> so

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
incorrect note it should be an E flat so

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.350 
incorrect note it should be an E flat so
let's<00:03:12.709> move<00:03:12.890> that<00:03:13.069> down<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.670> E<00:03:13.700> flat<00:03:14.060> and

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
let's move that down to E flat and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.360 
let's move that down to E flat and
continuing<00:03:14.959> from<00:03:15.110> here<00:03:15.380> now<00:03:15.590> if<00:03:15.739> we<00:03:15.860> go<00:03:15.980> from<00:03:16.130> E

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
continuing from here now if we go from E

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.309 
continuing from here now if we go from E
flat<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.849> whole<00:03:17.090> step<00:03:17.300> up<00:03:17.510> would<00:03:17.720> give<00:03:17.870> us<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.170> F

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
flat a whole step up would give us the F

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.340 
flat a whole step up would give us the F
another<00:03:19.190> whole<00:03:19.459> step<00:03:19.670> is<00:03:19.880> G<00:03:20.239> one<00:03:20.989> more<00:03:21.170> whole

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
another whole step is G one more whole

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.860 
another whole step is G one more whole
step<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.830> a<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.550> then<00:03:23.030> finally<00:03:23.480> we<00:03:23.630> have<00:03:23.750> the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
step is a and then finally we have the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.559 
step is a and then finally we have the
half<00:03:24.110> step<00:03:24.410> up<00:03:24.590> which<00:03:24.860> takes<00:03:25.190> us<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.430> B<00:03:25.819> so<00:03:26.420> this

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
half step up which takes us to B so this

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.390 
half step up which takes us to B so this
is<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.810> B<00:03:27.140> flat<00:03:27.350> major<00:03:27.709> scale

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
is a B flat major scale

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.309 
is a B flat major scale
