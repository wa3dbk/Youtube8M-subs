00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
I mean I've ridden a pair of these for a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.620 
I mean I've ridden a pair of these for a
couple<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.280> seasons<00:01:11.460> now<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.270> still

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
couple of seasons now and they still

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.820 
couple of seasons now and they still
won't<00:01:12.780> die<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.380> an<00:01:13.470> absolutely<00:01:13.740> fantastic

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
won't die it's an absolutely fantastic

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.570 
won't die it's an absolutely fantastic
ski<00:01:14.659> it's<00:01:15.659> got<00:01:15.750> 3d<00:01:16.170> butter<00:01:16.439> zone<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.070> what<00:01:17.280> line

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
ski it's got 3d butter zone so what line

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.630 
ski it's got 3d butter zone so what line
of<00:01:17.759> done<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.060> milled<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.659> core<00:01:19.640> right

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
of done is milled out the core right

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.219 
of done is milled out the core right
here<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> tip<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> tail<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:22.020> in

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
here in the tip and the tail just in

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.830 
here in the tip and the tail just in
front<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.560> behind<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.920> binding<00:01:23.340> that

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
front and behind the binding that

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.660 
front and behind the binding that
softens<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.560> nose<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.950> tail<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
softens it in the nose and the tail and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.819 
softens it in the nose and the tail and
makes<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.330> easy<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:28.049> butter<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.650> press

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
makes it really easy to butter and press

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.530 
makes it really easy to butter and press
so<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> lot<00:01:29.610> easier<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:30.090> butter<00:01:30.299> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
so this is a lot easier to butter and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.350 
so this is a lot easier to butter and
press<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.869> previous<00:01:31.229> versions<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.770> been<00:01:32.360> so

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
press in previous versions have been so

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.760 
press in previous versions have been so
I've<00:01:33.600> got<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> carbon<00:01:34.020> dolly<00:01:34.290> band<00:01:34.500> running

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
I've got a carbon dolly band running

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.800 
I've got a carbon dolly band running
from<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> tip<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> tail<00:01:35.790> which<00:01:36.090> increases

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
from the tip to the tail which increases

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.840 
from the tip to the tail which increases
energy<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.290> pop<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.799> if<00:01:38.040> you're<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.640> see<00:01:38.820> a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
energy and pop so if you're you see a

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.190 
energy and pop so if you're you see a
stair<00:01:39.119> set<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.630> want<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.869> hit<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.049> you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
stair set that you want to hit that you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.480 
stair set that you want to hit that you
don't<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.590> take<00:01:40.770> take<00:01:41.130> off<00:01:41.280> long

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
don't think the take take off long

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.609 
don't think the take take off long
enough<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:42.270> thing<00:01:42.540> will<00:01:42.659> really<00:01:42.899> pop<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.320> on

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
enough this thing will really pop you on

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.090 
enough this thing will really pop you on
to<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> more<00:01:45.119> advanced<00:01:45.450> Park<00:01:45.659> Ski<00:01:46.100> but

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
to it it is a more advanced Park Ski but

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.249 
to it it is a more advanced Park Ski but
like<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.430> said<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.820> easy<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.270> use<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.840> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
like I said it is easy to use it is a
