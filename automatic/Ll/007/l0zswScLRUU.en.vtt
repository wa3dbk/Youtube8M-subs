00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
it on my husband who obviously has a bit

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.550 
it on my husband who obviously has a bit
shorter<00:01:20.520> hair<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.909> he<00:01:21.119> really<00:01:21.689> liked<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.200> so

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
shorter hair and he really liked it so

shorter hair and he really liked it so
yeah<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.490> kind<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.880> an<00:01:23.939> alternative<00:01:24.570> way

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
yeah that is kind of an alternative way

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.080 
yeah that is kind of an alternative way
like<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.560> said<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:25.830> your<00:01:25.950> hair<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.310> dry<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
like I said if your hair is dry then you

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.770 
like I said if your hair is dry then you
could<00:01:27.680> kind<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.189> bit<00:01:29.400> faster<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
could kind of do it a bit faster but you

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.120 
could kind of do it a bit faster but you
don't<00:01:31.110> want<00:01:31.259> your<00:01:31.320> hair<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.619> tangle<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.070> I
