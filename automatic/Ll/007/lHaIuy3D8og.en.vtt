00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 the lounge the mother follows my line 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.839
 I'm here to share a topic 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.210
 very interesting for me and for many of 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.880
 you who have asked me about the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:19.080
 skin care and spots today 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:23.789
 I come with the skin without quite like 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.130
 a product then I have to take care 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.660
 a lot of the spots in summer is super 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.460
 complicated because the people who 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.289
 we have melasma as you are already 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.890
 connected the voltage is wrong makes a 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.410
 year 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.149
 I found a treatment which 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.739
 recommended my dermatologist who has 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.300
 delighted because a technology that is 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.500
 called nanotechnology and not pennetta 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.910
 only on Friday they gave it to me 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.860
 therapy but the hypodermis titania 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.660
 irradiates these products are Spanish and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.860
 they are from this derman I want to show you what 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.640
 what has worked for me gives me luminosity 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.930
 the skin 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.620
 help to lighten the spots a little 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.059
 blankets will never be clear 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.710
 totally because I'm from something 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.800
 nature me but have a skin with 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.840
 the spots a little more diminished more 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.809
 luminous ers I really like this 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.890
 product in summer because it is one of the 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.339
 depigmenting agents that can be used in 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.710
 summer 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.929
 generally the depigmenting agents are used 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.179
 in winter or in times where the sun does not 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:14.609
 be very strong because you can have a 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:16.500
 counterproductive effect that is to say they can 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:18.869
 cause the opposite effect 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.100
 this is the test team in tante is called 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.539
 towards the cross has azelaic acid what 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.030
 I use the night is the texture is a 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.590
 light texture comes in the little hotel and I 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.649
 applied to droplets all over the face in 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.810
 the night is what I use plus the retinol 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.119
 of them that is very good that is this 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.390
 rétiz axis he 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.979
 0.25 which is a regenerator retinol of 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.649
 collagen also that brings luminosity 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.420
 and help with the wrinkles attenuates them not 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.759
 it removes it completely but it attenuates and 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.780
 helps with skin health and in the 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.140
 tomorrow I apply the loan in 32 which is 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.049
 the last one being one of them that has come out 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.020
 and the cebit that is over and I have 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.299
 that order another one that is a serum with 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.289
 vitamin c that brings radiance already 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.759
 know that vitamin CIA is 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.220
 antioxidants super important for the 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.929
 skin and after that today is my 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.150
 protection only using these 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.739
 treatments I protect the sun type 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.989
 michael jackson's something like that with lime with 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.459
 with him with this with this protection that 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.750
 it's like a dog apparently but 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.310
 Because I do not care what I do 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.950
 matter is to protect from the spots and 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.410
 it comes like this 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.350
 it's like a band- aid that you can put on 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.720
 glasses 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.030
 you can remove it you can put 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.360
 any other pair of glasses then 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.040
 are these in case I go to the beach or 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.350
 this is that I also do not like this one 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.660
 a lot because this is like very closed 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.980
 this also to protect yourself if I go to 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.260
 gym usually use this but 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.030
 when I leave the gym I feel a lot 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.350
 heat with all this in your head that you 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.670
 I really like success as munich is your 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.350
 favorite but it is another option that 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.920
 has and is lemon cv something very 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.410
 important with the hats for the 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.810
 solar protection we have to fix 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.480
 that have a double layer of protection 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.970
 hats when we look at them they have to 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.020
 have double layer if we look at them against 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.750
 the sun we should not see any ray of 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.030
 sun that penetrates the are of these this 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.640
 has double layer has this layer and has 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.190
 this other layer and there if it protects 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.920
 totally because you can not see any 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.710
 ray of light that gets by no 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.600
 Huequito del sombrero that is super super 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.890
 important and if we go to the face then no 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.890
 we put the umbrella on the head 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.300
 or whatever but super super technique 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.280
 protected that and not only but also 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.530
 We are on the umbrella as well which 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.300
 which superprotection comes loose not all 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.040
 it must be a special raise that has 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.040
 the same as we have strong for that 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.230
 They also took out a new sunscreen 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.780
 which is called king repas 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.480
 not only does it protect from the sun but 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.030
 It also repairs the damages that the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.340
 sun is a photoprotector 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.160
 aging then is the last thing that 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.739
 there is in sun protection so far what 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.959
 I'm trying I've been testing it 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.340
 as a month I still can not give you a 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.660
 final verdict of what I think of re 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.120
 lampoon but for now what I 've seen 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.610
 I like and what I like is that no 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.620
 only protects but repairs the damage 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.720
 that has caused the sun on the skin 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.190
 then that is super important too 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.139
 with solar protections you know 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.070
 that I love sunscreen is super 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.720
 important that when you are using 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.940
 depigmenting or we are treating the 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.210
 spots we use sunscreen and I am 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.470
 super or to the extreme of protecting me the 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.240
 skin because with the sole heat of stain 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.070
 already with everything that protects me you have 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.440
 been stained imagine what it would be like if 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.000
 do not protect me these are you already 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.860
 they know the sunscreens that I use 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.690
 among them is this one I love 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.520
 because it has color text the bioderma 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.250
 that has already shown that in the days 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.740
 previous and recognized then covers and 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.110
 at the same time protects and so I would recommend it 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.690
 for dry skin because it leaves a 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.409
 very beautiful luminosity is that I 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.659
 love is a 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.819
 preferred bioderma other protector 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:16.580
 solar that fascinates me and I found in 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:20.750
 colombia is this 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.450
 that comes like this these are he 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.070
 I love you or that clear years ago 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.320
 lucid good under the protector 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.640
 solar I got stung by dust and it's also 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.440
 a kind of person and help me with the 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.730
 the skin does not shine anymore and I 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.350
 like very much much less that 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.760
 they study on a solar screen then 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.040
 is another as an assistant to 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:41.360
 protect them I love the joker that is 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.790
 an antioxidant pill that contains 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.340
 Sunscreen is internal does not mean 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.130
 that by taking this we do not protect ourselves from 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.650
 sun but is an assistant to protect us 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.900
 of the sun of that in the summer I also use 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.980
 masks that contain some liquor 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:00.270
 isro kójico acid or girls it and these 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.960
 they mix charming 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.240
 this one that has cucumber and has vitamin e 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.510
 and has al butti is one of the 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.150
 lightening components for the skin is 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.640
 very good and it is very soft to me I love it 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.410
 This one has aloe vera and they are but in 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.940
 also and this is one of my 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.940
 preferred that he has already shown 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.490
 previously of uri davis corn that 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.190
 are these is important when we have 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.950
 spots attack them by all means and 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.330
 protect us very much the sun is also 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:35.310
 very important in the summer not to use 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.680
 very strong acids that's why I like the 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.260
 because it can be used in summer in 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.750
 the night as long as you use a 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.700
 good sunscreen and good 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.470
 face protection many have 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.600
 asked about the acids that I get in 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.360
 the face and those he used in the summer 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.409
 it has to be acids 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:57.430
 very soft the softest for me and the one that 

00:06:54.409 --> 00:07:01.939
 it works for me is malic acid 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:04.219
 these acids are used once a 

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:06.650
 week and if you're not used to the 

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:09.979
 acids you also take arsenal of 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:12.110
 acids for the whole year but this one 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:14.120
 I like them a lot in the future I make them a 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.639
 acid video if they want to skin 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.039
 to regenerate the skin I like this 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:22.460
 a lot because it contains salicylic acid 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:25.370
 that salicylic acid also helps me 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.370
 with acne salicylic acid and acid 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.469
 man of the ico I apply it I leave it jean 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.490
 skin is resistant to acids then 

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:33.860
 I leave it for half an hour 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.870
 Usually only if you are 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.750
 starting with acids the acid man of 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:42.020
 ico is very good to start and it's good 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:44.509
 I like to use it in the summer 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.969
 because I take good care of myself with everything 

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:49.159
 from michael jackson with the hats that 

00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:52.039
 I showed them with umbrellas yet 

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:54.800
 that if they will not protect from the sun not 

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:55.969
 can use acids of this type in 

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.759
 summer 

00:07:55.969 --> 00:08:00.860
 because they are going to have an action 

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:03.789
 counterproductive this acid applied it to me 

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.789
 at night 

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.460
 I hope you are having a super summer 

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.590
 my loves and see you in the next 

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.260

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:17.900
 video was useful subscribe to the channel 

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.900
