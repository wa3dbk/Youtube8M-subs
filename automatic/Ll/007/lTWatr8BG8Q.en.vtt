00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
that's the van on biome over there so if

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.360 
that's the van on biome over there so if
you're<00:04:19.110> interested<00:04:19.380> in<00:04:19.739> Savannah<00:04:20.010> biomes

there's<00:04:20.640> two<00:04:20.790> right<00:04:20.940> there<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.330> have<00:04:21.450> planes

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
there's two right there you have planes

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.540 
there's two right there you have planes
right<00:04:21.930> here<00:04:22.170> and<00:04:22.290> you<00:04:22.380> got<00:04:22.500> desert<00:04:22.890> here<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.340> I

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
right here and you got desert here and I

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.360 
right here and you got desert here and I
think<00:04:23.790> over<00:04:24.060> there<00:04:24.650> other<00:04:25.650> than<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:25.830> it's

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
think over there other than that it's

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.130 
think over there other than that it's
pretty<00:04:26.400> much<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:26.940> if<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.150> like<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.510> seed<00:04:27.750> give
