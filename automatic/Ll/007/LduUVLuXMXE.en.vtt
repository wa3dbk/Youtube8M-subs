00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello how good people are I come with 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.860
 a new contribution is like in the previous 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.560
 depreciation x 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.290
 but this time it will be 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.130
 in this way that I have here that is visual 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.869
 boy advance many already have it but 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.000
 same and I bring them with good roms 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.090
 I'll see if I upload all or no more some 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.939
 because I thought 143 megabytes and between all 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.330
 they are about 11 only 11 are 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.620
 very heavy and good in the description you 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.740
 I'm going to leave the link so you can 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.620
 download this and this point so that you 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.790
 can run the emulator 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.640
 ok then already unloaded it decompresses 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.059
 I do not know if I'll compress is most 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.690
 probable 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.809
 good is compressed and we open the icon 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.620
 that has the gameboy that we have seen 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.520
 al boy advance point excel 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.520

 will open this window and you can 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.890
 enlarge this screen to your liking 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.250
 It has been like this or that, but I recommend it 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.610
 you go to video options and stop to 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.940
 who for two this is the proportion that 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.950
 It is in the original part is , if 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.920
 you're not going to pixelate even 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.159
 have a girl 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.000
 the objects and all that ok then for 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.399

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.440

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.160
