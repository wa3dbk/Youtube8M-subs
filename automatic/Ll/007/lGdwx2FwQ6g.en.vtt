00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
moving on make sure that when it's what

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.600 
moving on make sure that when it's what
it's<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.860> connector<00:02:08.399> part

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
it's like that that the connector part

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.330 
it's like that that the connector part
is<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> side<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:10.050> this

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
is on the side like this

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.030 
is on the side like this
