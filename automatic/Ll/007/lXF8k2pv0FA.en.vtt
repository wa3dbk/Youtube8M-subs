00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.820 
the finite set for these rooms i made
cuz<00:05:52.430> they<00:05:52.729> were<00:05:52.789> just<00:05:53.180> too<00:05:53.900> many<00:05:53.930> of<00:05:54.379> them<00:05:54.440> and

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
cuz they were just too many of them and

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.760 
cuz they were just too many of them and
i<00:05:55.039> couldn't<00:05:55.969> afford<00:05:56.270> to<00:05:56.599> make<00:05:56.870> so<00:05:57.199> many<00:05:57.469> of

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
i couldn't afford to make so many of

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.379 
i couldn't afford to make so many of
them<00:05:58.009> even<00:05:58.539> because<00:06:00.460> they<00:06:01.460> wouldn't<00:06:02.210> be

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
them even because they wouldn't be

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.980
