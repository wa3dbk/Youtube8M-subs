exactly like straight but I've tried to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.880

with minus we'll just say that now is a
black<00:01:27.990> light<00:01:28.320> machine<00:01:28.650> gun<00:01:28.829> which<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.460> in

desert<00:01:39.479> camo<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.890> would've<00:01:41.100> looked

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
desert camo but that would've looked

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.730

term come on lamp yeah you can see it

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.699 
term come on lamp yeah you can see it
right<00:02:24.700> there<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:25.390> put<00:02:25.540> gloss<00:02:25.810> on<00:02:26.079> there<00:02:26.290> but

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
right there you put gloss on there but

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.710 
right there you put gloss on there but
it's<00:02:26.829> kind<00:02:27.069> of<00:02:27.130> like<00:02:27.280> uneven<00:02:27.519> or<00:02:28.030> something<00:02:28.569> I

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
it's kind of like uneven or something I

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.720 
it's kind of like uneven or something I
don't<00:02:28.780> know<00:02:28.930> maybe<00:02:29.079> you<00:02:29.230> put<00:02:29.500> too<00:02:30.160> much<00:02:30.370> in<00:02:30.700> one

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
don't know maybe you put too much in one

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.360 
don't know maybe you put too much in one
space<00:02:31.180> i<00:02:31.480> think<00:02:32.380> i<00:02:32.470> could<00:02:32.530> say<00:02:32.799> uneven<00:02:33.220> for

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
space i think i could say uneven for

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.750 
space i think i could say uneven for
that<00:02:33.489> but<00:02:33.880> whatever<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:36.190> it's<00:02:36.370> kind<00:02:36.700> of

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
that but whatever and so it's kind of

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.589 
that but whatever and so it's kind of
got<00:02:36.940> this<00:02:37.120> like<00:02:37.440> Kevlar<00:02:38.519> texture<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.730> don't

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
got this like Kevlar texture to it don't

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.479 
got this like Kevlar texture to it don't
know<00:02:40.780> if<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:40.989> did<00:02:41.170> on<00:02:41.260> purpose<00:02:41.440> but<00:02:41.769> da<00:02:42.280> kuma

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
know if you did on purpose but da kuma

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.670 
know if you did on purpose but da kuma
if<00:02:42.730> you're<00:02:42.880> watching<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.299> keep<00:02:44.170> doing<00:02:44.530> that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
if you're watching this keep doing that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.520 
if you're watching this keep doing that
that<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.190> pretty<00:02:45.760> awesome<00:02:46.209> actually<00:02:46.530> feels

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
that is pretty awesome actually feels

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.130 
that is pretty awesome actually feels
like<00:02:47.739> Kevlar<00:02:48.329> which<00:02:49.329> is<00:02:49.450> what<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.810> rest<00:02:50.019> are

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
like Kevlar which is what the rest are

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.009 
like Kevlar which is what the rest are
made<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.530> think<00:02:50.889> I<00:02:51.130> know<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.389> seems<00:02:52.750> logical

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
made of I think I know it seems logical

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.199 
made of I think I know it seems logical
that<00:02:53.290> they'd<00:02:53.590> be<00:02:53.799> made<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.069> Kevlar<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.940> one

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
that they'd be made of Kevlar this one

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.870 
that they'd be made of Kevlar this one
isn't<00:02:55.450> exactly<00:02:55.900> like<00:02:56.109> applied<00:02:56.530> on<00:02:56.980> straight

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
isn't exactly like applied on straight

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.940 
isn't exactly like applied on straight
don't<00:02:58.660> know<00:02:58.750> if<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:58.959> like<00:02:59.319> cut<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.769> too<00:02:59.920> short

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
don't know if you like cut it too short

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.270 
don't know if you like cut it too short
or<00:03:00.310> something<00:03:01.350> but<00:03:02.350> it's<00:03:02.739> kind<00:03:02.980> of<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.190> the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
or something but it's kind of to the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.860 
or something but it's kind of to the
left<00:03:03.519> a<00:03:03.639> little<00:03:03.790> but<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.600> know<00:03:04.720> what

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
left a little but you know what

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.300 
left a little but you know what
nothing's<00:03:05.230> perfect<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:05.859> it<00:03:05.980> doesn't<00:03:06.250> really

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
nothing's perfect so it doesn't really

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.240 
nothing's perfect so it doesn't really
matter<00:03:06.549> um<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:08.410> arms<00:03:08.620> can<00:03:08.769> move<00:03:08.829> because<00:03:09.160> they

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
matter um the arms can move because they

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.920 
matter um the arms can move because they
don't<00:03:09.400> have<00:03:09.430> any<00:03:09.639> painting<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.180> them<00:03:10.329> so<00:03:10.840> let

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
don't have any painting on them so let

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.699 
don't have any painting on them so let
me<00:03:10.959> just<00:03:11.139> get<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.380> chest<00:03:11.620> off<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:13.560> then<00:03:14.560> the

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
me just get the chest off and then the

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.220 
me just get the chest off and then the
legs<00:03:15.000> there's<00:03:16.000> belt<00:03:17.069> painting<00:03:18.690> nice<00:03:19.690> camo

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
legs there's belt painting nice camo

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.629 
legs there's belt painting nice camo
pattern<00:03:20.620> there<00:03:20.829> I<00:03:21.690> don't<00:03:22.690> think<00:03:22.750> this<00:03:23.380> is<00:03:23.639> this

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
pattern there I don't think this is this

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.379 
pattern there I don't think this is this
looks<00:03:26.069> like<00:03:27.069> a<00:03:27.130> fairly<00:03:27.489> decent<00:03:27.609> paint<00:03:28.060> job<00:03:28.239> it

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
looks like a fairly decent paint job it

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.129 
looks like a fairly decent paint job it
looks<00:03:28.420> like<00:03:29.049> camo<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.709> it's<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:31.030> worth<00:03:31.599> this

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
looks like camo and it's it's worth this

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.550 
looks like camo and it's it's worth this
figure<00:03:32.470> in<00:03:32.590> total<00:03:32.919> is<00:03:33.010> worth<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.549> money<00:03:33.669> easy

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
figure in total is worth the money easy

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.699 
figure in total is worth the money easy
so<00:03:35.560> here<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:36.970> can<00:03:37.000> see<00:03:37.329> it's<00:03:37.870> not<00:03:38.109> poseable<00:03:38.620> I

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
so here you can see it's not poseable I

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.900 
so here you can see it's not poseable I
mean<00:03:38.859> I<00:03:38.950> can<00:03:39.099> pose<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.519> like<00:03:39.639> that<00:03:39.849> but<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:41.910> don't

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
mean I can pose it like that but I don't

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.960 
mean I can pose it like that but I don't
know<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.030> don't<00:03:43.180> want<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.599> like<00:03:43.780> smear<00:03:44.380> it

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
know I don't want to like smear it

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.630 
know I don't want to like smear it
so<00:03:46.970> but<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:47.900> just<00:03:48.170> shaved<00:03:48.769> down<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.310> inside<00:03:49.580> of

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
so but I just shaved down the inside of

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.770 
so but I just shaved down the inside of
this<00:03:50.319> hopefully<00:03:51.970> that<00:03:52.970> should<00:03:53.000> fix<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:53.569> but<00:03:53.720> I

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
this hopefully that should fix it but I

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.000 
this hopefully that should fix it but I
don't<00:03:53.870> want<00:03:54.110> to<00:03:54.170> ruin<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.440> camera<00:03:54.830> on<00:03:54.860> the
