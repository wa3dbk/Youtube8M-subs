00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.860 
they're pretty cool this does need three
double<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.459> batteries<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:33.090> are<00:03:33.120> not<00:03:33.419> included

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
double a batteries that are not included

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.470 
double a batteries that are not included
so<00:03:33.989> you<00:03:34.019> have<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.349> add<00:03:34.500> those<00:03:34.739> yourself<00:03:35.480> and

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
so you have to add those yourself and

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.809 
so you have to add those yourself and
this<00:03:36.720> runs<00:03:37.109> for<00:03:37.470> fifty<00:03:37.859> dollars<00:03:38.099> so<00:03:38.609> I<00:03:38.639> mean

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
this runs for fifty dollars so I mean

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.159 
this runs for fifty dollars so I mean
it's<00:03:38.970> one<00:03:39.269> of<00:03:39.359> those<00:03:39.419> things<00:03:39.480> where<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:39.989> don't

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
it's one of those things where you don't

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.839 
it's one of those things where you don't
really<00:03:40.380> need<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.829> but<00:03:40.859> they're<00:03:41.430> pretty<00:03:41.669> cool

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
really need it but they're pretty cool

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.720 
really need it but they're pretty cool
to<00:03:42.060> have<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.569> think<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.530> better<00:03:44.130> price<00:03:44.459> for<00:03:44.489> this

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
to have I think a better price for this

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.780 
to have I think a better price for this
would<00:03:44.790> be<00:03:45.030> thirty<00:03:45.269> dollars<00:03:45.720> or<00:03:45.930> less<00:03:46.430> hmm<00:03:47.430> but

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
would be thirty dollars or less hmm but

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.559 
would be thirty dollars or less hmm but
yeah<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:49.549> anyway<00:03:50.549> basically<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:51.209> use<00:03:51.239> this

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
yeah so anyway basically you use this

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.080 
yeah so anyway basically you use this
for<00:03:51.840> is<00:03:52.019> for<00:03:52.859> this<00:03:53.190> little<00:03:53.400> compartment<00:03:54.000> that

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
for is for this little compartment that

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.270 
for is for this little compartment that
we<00:03:54.180> have<00:03:54.329> right<00:03:54.510> here<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:55.709> then<00:03:55.829> we<00:03:55.889> just<00:03:56.069> put

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
we have right here and then we just put

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.720 
we have right here and then we just put
that<00:03:56.310> in<00:03:56.549> there<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.709> go<00:03:58.709> on<00:03:58.889> our<00:03:59.250> separate

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
that in there and go on our separate

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.460 
that in there and go on our separate
ways<00:04:00.169> anyway<00:04:01.169> is<00:04:02.359> like<00:04:03.359> I've<00:04:03.569> used<00:04:04.019> this<00:04:04.230> for<00:04:04.440> a

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
ways anyway is like I've used this for a

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.250 
ways anyway is like I've used this for a
couple<00:04:04.620> days<00:04:04.950> but<00:04:05.790> it's<00:04:06.540> one<00:04:07.019> of<00:04:07.049> those<00:04:07.200> things

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
couple days but it's one of those things

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.979 
couple days but it's one of those things
like<00:04:07.769> as<00:04:07.919> I<00:04:07.950> mentioned<00:04:08.609> you<00:04:09.269> don't<00:04:09.299> need<00:04:09.780> it

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
like as I mentioned you don't need it

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.280 
like as I mentioned you don't need it
but<00:04:10.410> after<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:11.190> have<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.639> he<00:04:12.030> realize<00:04:12.449> it's

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
but after you have it he realize it's

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.449 
but after you have it he realize it's
something<00:04:13.769> worth<00:04:14.760> having<00:04:15.000> but<00:04:16.010> basically<00:04:17.010> so

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
something worth having but basically so

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.279 
something worth having but basically so
yeah<00:04:17.639> this<00:04:17.849> basically<00:04:18.329> activates<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.049> weight

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
yeah this basically activates the weight

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.310 
yeah this basically activates the weight
down<00:04:19.470> here

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
down here

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.780 
down here
and<00:04:20.410> then<00:04:20.530> you<00:04:20.620> put<00:04:20.830> this<00:04:21.010> there<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:21.580> then<00:04:21.730> you

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
and then you put this there and then you

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.520 
and then you put this there and then you
can<00:04:21.940> put<00:04:22.090> little<00:04:22.270> tiny<00:04:22.720> things<00:04:23.050> I<00:04:23.260> don't<00:04:23.440> know

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
I know I she showed here like on the

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.500 
I know I she showed here like on the
note<00:05:46.960> side<00:05:47.230> but<00:05:47.820> one<00:05:48.820> thing<00:05:49.120> one<00:05:49.480> thing

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
note side but one thing one thing

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.360 
note side but one thing one thing
actually<00:05:49.960> one<00:05:50.470> thing<00:05:50.500> that<00:05:50.890> would<00:05:51.010> be<00:05:51.190> much

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
actually one thing that would be much

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.970 
actually one thing that would be much
better<00:05:51.430> is<00:05:51.940> if<00:05:52.600> they<00:05:52.750> had<00:05:53.020> different<00:05:53.440> sizes

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
better is if they had different sizes

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.770 
better is if they had different sizes
different<00:05:54.610> size<00:05:55.210> would<00:05:55.420> be<00:05:55.540> much<00:05:55.750> better

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
different size would be much better

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.290 
different size would be much better
because<00:05:56.200> then<00:05:56.500> if<00:05:57.280> they<00:05:57.520> had<00:05:57.670> a<00:05:57.700> size<00:05:58.000> maybe

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
because then if they had a size maybe

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.380 
because then if they had a size maybe
for<00:05:58.720> your<00:05:58.810> xbox<00:05:59.050> 360<00:05:59.620> remote<00:06:00.030> to<00:06:01.030> clean<00:06:01.270> all
