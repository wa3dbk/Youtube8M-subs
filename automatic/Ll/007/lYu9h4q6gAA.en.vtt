my skin really clean and get rid of my

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.080 
my skin really clean and get rid of my
acne<00:04:59.520> I<00:05:00.000> was<00:05:00.539> so<00:05:01.409> obsessed<00:05:01.740> with<00:05:02.490> being<00:05:02.669> clean

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
acne I was so obsessed with being clean

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.730 
acne I was so obsessed with being clean
and<00:05:03.120> I<00:05:03.479> think<00:05:03.750> I<00:05:03.840> probably<00:05:04.110> took<00:05:04.440> it<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.710> the

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
and I think I probably took it to the

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.939 
and I think I probably took it to the
extreme<00:05:05.030> like<00:05:06.030> for<00:05:06.300> example<00:05:06.330> I<00:05:07.080> wanted<00:05:07.889> to

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
extreme like for example I wanted to

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.830 
extreme like for example I wanted to
make<00:05:08.039> sure<00:05:08.099> that<00:05:08.280> my<00:05:08.550> pillowcases<00:05:09.449> and<00:05:09.630> my

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
make sure that my pillowcases and my

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.320 
make sure that my pillowcases and my
sheets<00:05:10.080> were<00:05:10.319> changed<00:05:11.039> at<00:05:11.220> least<00:05:11.669> once<00:05:12.000> a<00:05:12.150> week

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
sheets were changed at least once a week

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.529 
sheets were changed at least once a week
sometimes<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:13.169> was<00:05:13.319> changing<00:05:13.710> my<00:05:13.740> pillowcases

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
sometimes I was changing my pillowcases

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.969 
sometimes I was changing my pillowcases
twice<00:05:15.539> or<00:05:15.720> three<00:05:15.960> times<00:05:15.990> a<00:05:16.380> week<00:05:16.409> which<00:05:16.770> is

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
twice or three times a week which is

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.270 
twice or three times a week which is
probably<00:05:17.280> a<00:05:17.520> bit<00:05:17.759> overboard<00:05:18.270> and<00:05:18.569> I<00:05:19.099> kind<00:05:20.099> of

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
probably a bit overboard and I kind of

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.339 
probably a bit overboard and I kind of
refused<00:05:20.699> to<00:05:20.789> go<00:05:20.940> to<00:05:20.969> my<00:05:21.300> boyfriend's<00:05:21.840> house<00:05:22.020> if

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
refused to go to my boyfriend's house if

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.830 
refused to go to my boyfriend's house if
