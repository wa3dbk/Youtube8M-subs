00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.080 

hi<00:00:28.990> galaxy

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:41.740 

what<00:00:33.090> do<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.450> want<00:00:33.720> to<00:00:33.809> go<00:00:34.579> bramble<00:00:35.579> pie<00:00:35.850> Lane

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.500 

if<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.900> think<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.290> farm<00:00:43.590> being<00:00:44.239> closed<00:00:45.239> off

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
if you think of a farm being closed off

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.930 
if you think of a farm being closed off
unit<00:00:46.050> yes<00:00:46.650> you're<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.040> buying<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.519> food<00:00:47.790> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
unit yes you're not buying in food to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.450 
unit yes you're not buying in food to
feed<00:00:48.120> your<00:00:48.210> animals<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.980> everything<00:00:49.980> that's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
feed your animals and everything that's

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.860 
feed your animals and everything that's
like<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.699> waste<00:00:51.000> product<00:00:51.269> still<00:00:51.570> goes<00:00:51.720> back

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
like a waste product still goes back

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.360 
like a waste product still goes back
into<00:00:52.140> your<00:00:52.260> land<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.769> mean<00:00:52.920> that's<00:00:53.040> all<00:00:53.160> just

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
into your land I mean that's all just

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.250 
into your land I mean that's all just
very<00:00:53.430> traditional<00:00:53.970> way<00:00:54.089> of<00:00:54.120> farming<00:00:54.390> but

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
very traditional way of farming but

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.130 
very traditional way of farming but
that's<00:00:55.410> kind<00:00:55.769> of<00:00:55.830> the<00:00:56.570> idea<00:00:57.570> behind<00:00:57.750> bio

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that's kind of the idea behind bio

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.229 
that's kind of the idea behind bio
dynamics<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.650> you<00:00:58.769> keep<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.339> closed<00:00:59.730> unit

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
dynamics that you keep this closed unit

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.569 
dynamics that you keep this closed unit
and<00:01:00.540> a<00:01:01.320> waste<00:01:01.739> product<00:01:01.980> from<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.309> part

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
and a waste product from one part

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.090 
and a waste product from one part
becomes<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:02.970> food<00:01:03.150> for<00:01:03.360> another<00:01:03.949> instead<00:01:04.949> of

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
becomes the food for another instead of

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.700 
becomes the food for another instead of
just<00:01:05.420> taking<00:01:06.420> taking<00:01:06.630> taking<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.410> the<00:01:07.530> land

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
just taking taking taking from the land

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.990 
just taking taking taking from the land
but<00:01:07.950> you're<00:01:08.100> quite<00:01:08.220> often<00:01:08.430> happens<00:01:08.910> in

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
but you're quite often happens in

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.520 
but you're quite often happens in
agriculture<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:09.720> we're<00:01:09.990> giving<00:01:10.320> something

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
agriculture now we're giving something

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.940 
agriculture now we're giving something
back<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> way<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.940> we<00:01:12.149> view<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.710> farm

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
back with the way that we view the farm

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.100 
back with the way that we view the farm
and<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:14.220> we're<00:01:14.369> doing<00:01:14.720> that<00:01:15.720> we'd<00:01:15.840> solve

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
and what we're doing that we'd solve

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.639 
and what we're doing that we'd solve
more<00:01:16.560> nurturing<00:01:17.220> tenure<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.410> we<00:01:19.530> have

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
more nurturing tenure so like we have

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.590 
more nurturing tenure so like we have
the<00:01:19.770> chickens<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.119> they'll<00:01:21.270> come<00:01:21.479> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the chickens here and they'll come and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.779 
the chickens here and they'll come and
graze<00:01:21.869> eat<00:01:22.200> their<00:01:22.530> food<00:01:22.890> off<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.280> orchards

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
graze eat their food off the orchards

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.840 
graze eat their food off the orchards
laws<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.450> they<00:01:24.600> will<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.280> put<00:01:26.280> manure<00:01:26.520> back

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
laws and they will then put manure back

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.999 
laws and they will then put manure back
onto<00:01:27.149> our<00:01:27.330> soil<00:01:27.690> which<00:01:28.050> then<00:01:28.259> fertilizes<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
onto our soil which then fertilizes the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.969 
onto our soil which then fertilizes the
trees<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.550> keeps<00:01:29.700> everything<00:01:29.940> happy<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.630> and

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
trees and keeps everything happy and and

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:38.680 
trees and keeps everything happy and and
so<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.100> sort<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.369> creates<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.820> nice<00:01:32.940> cycle

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.469
