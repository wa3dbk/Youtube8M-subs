an interior designer Julie Fergus and in

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.509 
an interior designer Julie Fergus and in
a<00:00:06.839> previous<00:00:07.049> segment<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.710> talked<00:00:07.980> about<00:00:08.099> how<00:00:08.460> to

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
a previous segment I talked about how to

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.730 
a previous segment I talked about how to
create<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.940> color<00:00:09.269> palette<00:00:09.719> using<00:00:09.929> fabric<00:00:10.500> and

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
create a color palette using fabric and

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.709 
create a color palette using fabric and
what<00:00:11.400> I've<00:00:11.490> done<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:12.000> think<00:00:12.360> in<00:00:12.509> one<00:00:12.690> of

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
what I've done is I think in one of

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.780 
what I've done is I think in one of
those<00:00:12.929> fabrics<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.620> use<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.160> example<00:00:14.490> as

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
those fabrics to use in this example as

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.210 
those fabrics to use in this example as
we<00:00:15.269> expand<00:00:15.809> on<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.230> original<00:00:16.590> color<00:00:16.770> palette

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
we expand on the original color palette

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.820 
we expand on the original color palette
and<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> previous<00:00:18.600> example<00:00:19.199> these<00:00:19.619> were

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
and in the previous example these were

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.010 
and in the previous example these were
the<00:00:19.920> colors<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:20.670> chose<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.359> go<00:00:21.539> with<00:00:21.750> this

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
the colors that we chose to go with this

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.900 
the colors that we chose to go with this
fabric<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.619> coordinate<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.519> work<00:00:23.670> well

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
fabric that coordinate and work well

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.300 
fabric that coordinate and work well
together<00:00:24.119> now<00:00:25.080> from<00:00:25.289> there<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.890> might<00:00:26.099> want

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
together now from there you might want

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.790 
together now from there you might want
to<00:00:26.369> pick<00:00:26.550> additional<00:00:27.210> colors<00:00:27.570> new<00:00:27.840> colors<00:00:28.260> for

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
to pick additional colors new colors for

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.710 
to pick additional colors new colors for
other<00:00:28.949> rooms<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.789> house<00:00:29.939> or<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.420> bring<00:00:30.570> in

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
accent colors so if we use the original
