course<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.769> see<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.279> quadcopter<00:00:26.939> itself

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
course you see the quadcopter itself

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.790 
course you see the quadcopter itself
we'll<00:00:27.599> put<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.810> off<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.170> side<00:00:28.410> for<00:00:28.439> right

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
we'll put that off to the side for right

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.710 
we'll put that off to the side for right
now<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.519> once<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.970> get<00:00:30.119> into<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.300> package

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
very very similar to a bunch of other

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.210 
very very similar to a bunch of other
controllers<00:01:03.690> out<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.229> example<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.799> FY

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
controllers out there for example the FY

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.100 
controllers out there for example the FY
326<00:01:06.000> controller<00:01:06.390> I've<00:01:06.600> been<00:01:06.750> using<00:01:06.900> that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
326 controller I've been using that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.780 
326 controller I've been using that
device<00:01:07.290> for<00:01:07.680> quite<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> while<00:01:08.010> now<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.520> put

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
device for quite a while now and put

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.700 
device for quite a while now and put
them<00:01:08.880> side<00:01:09.060> by<00:01:09.090> side<00:01:09.270> they're<00:01:10.110> very<00:01:10.409> very

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
them side by side they're very very

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.440 
them side by side they're very very
similar<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.189> each<00:01:11.400> other<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:11.820> sort<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.360> hard

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
similar to each other it's sort of hard

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.850 
similar to each other it's sort of hard
to<00:01:12.540> tell<00:01:12.720> them<00:01:12.810> apart<00:01:12.900> aside<00:01:13.380> from<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
to tell them apart aside from just a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.380 
to tell them apart aside from just a
slight<00:01:14.159> size<00:01:14.430> difference<00:01:14.880> but<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
slight size difference but the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.789 
slight size difference but the
controller<00:01:15.780> does<00:01:16.020> take<00:01:16.229> four<00:01:16.470> double<00:01:16.740> A

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
controller does take four double A

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.289 
controller does take four double A
batteries<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.490> prepared<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:18.060> that

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
batteries so do be prepared for that

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.030 
batteries so do be prepared for that
anyway<00:01:19.049> let's<00:01:19.259> go<00:01:19.350> ahead<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.530> move<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
anyway let's go ahead and move on to the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.770 
anyway let's go ahead and move on to the
quadcopter<00:01:20.549> itself<00:01:20.939> as<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.540> see<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
quadcopter itself as you can see the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.179 
quadcopter itself as you can see the
version<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.049> I'm<00:01:22.200> looking<00:01:22.320> at<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.770> bright

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
version that I'm looking at is bright

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.070 
version that I'm looking at is bright
green<00:01:23.580> from<00:01:24.150> what<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> understand<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:25.049> are

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
green from what I understand there are

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.749 
green from what I understand there are
actually<00:01:25.439> two<00:01:25.619> versions<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.460> you've<00:01:26.729> got

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
actually two versions of this you've got

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.070 
actually two versions of this you've got

the original one that came out a little
while<00:01:28.290> back<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:29.310> which<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.520> the

while back and in this one which is the
newer<00:01:29.970> model<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> newer<00:01:30.990> model<00:01:31.290> they

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.080 
newer model with the newer model they
made<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> few<00:01:31.740> changes<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.430> still<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.909> same

sort of look and feel but it does add in
headless<00:01:35.850> mode<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.509> again<00:01:36.600> we'll<00:01:36.840> get<00:01:36.990> back

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
headless mode but again we'll get back

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.600 
headless mode but again we'll get back
to<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.530> second<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.340> looking<00:01:38.549> at

to that in a second so just looking at

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.580 
to that in a second so just looking at
the<00:01:38.700> body<00:01:38.880> itself<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.509> very<00:01:39.869> very<00:01:40.079> thin<00:01:40.350> it's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
to it if you took off this canopy you

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
to it if you took off this canopy you
would<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.130> next<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.549> nothing<00:01:44.700> left<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.630> prop

modes beginner intermediate and expert I

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.540 
modes beginner intermediate and expert I
of<00:02:37.290> course<00:02:37.440> immediately<00:02:37.590> run<00:02:38.160> off<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.460> the

expert mode because i want to see

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.750 
expert mode because i want to see
exactly<00:02:40.020> how<00:02:40.260> fast<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.680> thing<00:02:40.740> will<00:02:40.980> go<00:02:41.130> but

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
exactly how fast this thing will go but

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.400 
exactly how fast this thing will go but
with<00:02:42.060> those<00:02:42.209> three<00:02:42.390> modes<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.900> do<00:02:43.020> get<00:02:43.200> three

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
with those three modes you do get three

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.740 
with those three modes you do get three
different<00:02:43.530> ye<00:02:43.830> all<00:02:43.950> rates<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.880> top-end<00:02:45.330> y'all

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
different ye all rates the top-end y'all

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.720 
different ye all rates the top-end y'all
rate<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.110> not<00:02:46.410> really<00:02:46.770> all<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:46.950> fast<00:02:47.400> it's

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
rate is not really all that fast it's

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.250 
rate is not really all that fast it's
not<00:02:47.880> as<00:02:48.060> fast<00:02:48.330> as<00:02:48.570> some<00:02:48.660> other<00:02:48.810> things<00:02:49.080> I've

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
not as fast as some other things I've

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.050 
not as fast as some other things I've
seen<00:02:49.470> but<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.190> fast<00:02:50.490> enough<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.850> get<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
seen but it is fast enough to get the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.430 
seen but it is fast enough to get the
job<00:02:51.090> done<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.660> can<00:02:51.780> do<00:02:51.870> some<00:02:52.050> very<00:02:52.200> nice

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
job done you can do some very nice

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.170 
job done you can do some very nice
little<00:02:52.770> funnels<00:02:53.070> with<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.820> can<00:02:53.970> fly

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
little funnels with it and it can fly

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.880 
little funnels with it and it can fly
pretty<00:02:54.540> decently<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.170> wind<00:02:55.350> like<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.680> said

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
pretty decently in the wind like I said

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.680 
pretty decently in the wind like I said
before<00:02:55.980> its<00:02:56.280> supposedly<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.820> grade<00:02:57.209> three<00:02:57.510> or

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
before its supposedly a grade three or

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.800 
before its supposedly a grade three or
four<00:02:57.989> in<00:02:58.320> terms<00:02:58.560> of<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.800> wind<00:02:59.070> scale<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.480> I

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
four in terms of the wind scale and I

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.630 
four in terms of the wind scale and I
took<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:01.140> out<00:03:01.320> on<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.470> pretty<00:03:01.770> decently<00:03:02.310> windy

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
took it out on a pretty decently windy

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.430 
took it out on a pretty decently windy
day<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.120> was<00:03:03.390> able<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.720> survive<00:03:04.050> i'm<00:03:04.320> not

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
day and it was able to survive i'm not

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.840 
day and it was able to survive i'm not
going<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.590> say<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.010> did<00:03:05.130> amazingly<00:03:05.610> will

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
going to say that it did amazingly will

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.460 
going to say that it did amazingly will
but<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.540> kept<00:03:06.720> up<00:03:06.870> with<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.080> wind<00:03:07.260> pretty

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
but it kept up with the wind pretty

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.020 
but it kept up with the wind pretty
nicely<00:03:07.709> i<00:03:08.070> haven't<00:03:08.459> really<00:03:08.610> tested<00:03:08.760> out<00:03:08.970> the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
nicely i haven't really tested out the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.729 
nicely i haven't really tested out the
distance<00:03:09.420> with<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.750> because<00:03:09.870> my<00:03:10.410> depth

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
distance with it because my depth

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.610 
distance with it because my depth
perception<00:03:10.830> is<00:03:11.520> a<00:03:11.550> little<00:03:12.090> bit<00:03:12.209> weird<00:03:12.600> so<00:03:13.020> I've

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
perception is a little bit weird so I've

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.229 
perception is a little bit weird so I've
kept<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.010> relatively<00:03:14.400> close<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.940> me<00:03:15.060> for<00:03:15.180> the

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
kept it relatively close to me for the

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.390 
kept it relatively close to me for the
most<00:03:15.390> part<00:03:15.570> but<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.560> times<00:03:16.950> I've<00:03:17.100> taken<00:03:17.280> it

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
most part but the times I've taken it

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.370 
most part but the times I've taken it
farther<00:03:17.610> away<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:18.120> gets<00:03:18.299> pretty<00:03:18.690> decently<00:03:19.140> far

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
farther away it gets pretty decently far

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.020 
farther away it gets pretty decently far
away<00:03:19.590> I'm<00:03:19.739> talking<00:03:20.100> at<00:03:20.190> least<00:03:20.310> 30<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.790> 40

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
away I'm talking at least 30 to 40

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.090 
away I'm talking at least 30 to 40
meters<00:03:21.299> with<00:03:21.510> no<00:03:21.750> problems<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.920> does

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
meters with no problems and it does

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.130 
meters with no problems and it does
flips<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:23.700> course<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.180> does<00:03:24.299> very<00:03:24.540> nice<00:03:24.810> tight

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
flips of course it does very nice tight

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.530 
flips of course it does very nice tight
little<00:03:25.320> flips<00:03:25.709> no<00:03:26.130> problems<00:03:26.670> there<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:27.180> it

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
little flips no problems there and it

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.300 
little flips no problems there and it
can<00:03:27.690> just<00:03:27.810> zoom<00:03:28.260> around<00:03:28.530> back<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.040> forth

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
can just zoom around back and forth

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.370 
can just zoom around back and forth
absolutely<00:03:30.060> no<00:03:30.180> problems<00:03:30.570> especially<00:03:30.989> when

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
absolutely no problems especially when

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.590 
absolutely no problems especially when
you've<00:03:31.500> got<00:03:31.620> lower<00:03:32.070> wind<00:03:32.400> or<00:03:32.640> no<00:03:32.820> wind<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.299> just

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
you've got lower wind or no wind it just

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.060 
you've got lower wind or no wind it just
takes<00:03:33.959> off<00:03:34.200> when<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:34.650> point<00:03:34.890> in<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
takes off when you point in the

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.009 
takes off when you point in the
direction<00:03:35.190> it's<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:36.150> lightweight<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.660> it's

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
direction it's so lightweight and it's

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.199 
direction it's so lightweight and it's
so<00:03:37.230> powerful<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.980> just<00:03:38.160> goes<00:03:38.459> but<00:03:39.030> when

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
so powerful that it just goes but when

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.789 
so powerful that it just goes but when
you<00:03:39.269> don't<00:03:39.480> want<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.810> go<00:03:39.959> it'll<00:03:40.500> just<00:03:40.680> sit

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
you don't want it to go it'll just sit

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.380 
you don't want it to go it'll just sit
there<00:03:40.980> it'll<00:03:41.160> hover<00:03:41.340> it's<00:03:41.610> really<00:03:42.030> stable

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
there it'll hover it's really stable

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.270 
there it'll hover it's really stable
rock<00:03:42.660> solid<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.320> for<00:03:43.709> something<00:03:43.860> that's<00:03:44.100> that

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
rock solid and for something that's that

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.830 
rock solid and for something that's that
small<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:44.880> that<00:03:45.000> lightweight<00:03:45.209> it's<00:03:45.600> really

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
small and that lightweight it's really

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.240 
small and that lightweight it's really
surprising<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.410> see<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:46.890> doesn't<00:03:47.100> just

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
surprising to see that it doesn't just

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.890 
surprising to see that it doesn't just
immediately<00:03:47.790> get<00:03:48.000> shoved<00:03:48.239> out<00:03:48.390> of<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.600> way<00:03:48.690> by

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
immediately get shoved out of the way by

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.270 
immediately get shoved out of the way by
the<00:03:48.930> first<00:03:49.200> breeze<00:03:49.500> don't<00:03:49.860> get<00:03:49.980> me<00:03:50.070> wrong<00:03:50.100> the

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
the first breeze don't get me wrong the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.340 
the first breeze don't get me wrong the
breeze<00:03:50.700> can<00:03:51.030> grab<00:03:51.299> it<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.540> can<00:03:51.750> take<00:03:51.930> off<00:03:52.140> with

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
breeze can grab it and can take off with

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.600 
breeze can grab it and can take off with
it<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.590> just<00:03:52.680> have<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.950> be<00:03:53.010> very<00:03:53.160> very<00:03:53.280> careful

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
it you just have to be very very careful

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.250 
it you just have to be very very careful
about<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:54.180> but<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.630> other<00:03:54.810> really

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
about that but the other really

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.570 
about that but the other really
interesting<00:03:55.410> feature<00:03:55.950> about<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:56.340> thing

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
interesting feature about this thing

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.160 
interesting feature about this thing
that<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:56.790> actually<00:03:57.269> haven't<00:03:57.690> really<00:03:57.989> got<00:03:58.140> much

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
that I actually haven't really got much

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.660 
that I actually haven't really got much
experience<00:03:58.739> with<00:03:58.799> up<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.100> this<00:03:59.190> point<00:03:59.400> because

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
experience with up to this point because

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.490 
experience with up to this point because
other<00:04:00.209> quadcopters<00:04:00.870> I've<00:04:00.989> used<00:04:01.140> don't

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
other quadcopters I've used don't

night but push forward on the stick it's

night but push forward on the stick it's

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
going to go away from you push back it's

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.219 
going to go away from you push back it's
going<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:20.669> come<00:04:20.790> back<00:04:20.940> toward<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:21.599> it

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
going to come back toward you and it

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.779 
going to come back toward you and it
remembers<00:04:22.440> whatever<00:04:22.860> heading<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.250> was<00:04:23.430> set<00:04:23.640> at

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
remembers whatever heading it was set at

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:24.520 
remembers whatever heading it was set at
whenever<00:04:24.120> you

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
whenever you

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.050 
whenever you
turned<00:04:24.680> on<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.860> headless<00:04:25.190> mode<00:04:25.340> I<00:04:25.610> think<00:04:25.940> it's

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
turned on the headless mode I think it's

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.730 
turned on the headless mode I think it's
when<00:04:26.180> you<00:04:26.270> turn<00:04:26.389> on<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:26.540> headless<00:04:26.810> mode<00:04:26.930> and

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
when you turn on the headless mode and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.710 
when you turn on the headless mode and
and<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:28.310> it'll<00:04:28.610> keep<00:04:28.760> that<00:04:29.030> as<00:04:29.210> its<00:04:29.360> relative

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
and so it'll keep that as its relative

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.750 
and so it'll keep that as its relative
point<00:04:29.960> of<00:04:30.080> positioning<00:04:30.650> so<00:04:30.920> if<00:04:31.070> you<00:04:31.190> start<00:04:31.610> to

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
point of positioning so if you start to

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.159 
point of positioning so if you start to
get<00:04:31.880> pulled<00:04:32.180> away<00:04:32.270> or<00:04:32.510> something<00:04:32.810> you<00:04:32.930> can<00:04:33.050> hit

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
get pulled away or something you can hit

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.600 
get pulled away or something you can hit
the<00:04:33.260> headless<00:04:33.560> button<00:04:33.860> you<00:04:34.160> pull<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:34.490> back

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
the headless button you pull it back

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.310 
the headless button you pull it back
toward<00:04:34.910> yourself<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.330> it<00:04:35.690> immediately<00:04:35.840> comes

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
toward yourself and it immediately comes

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.470 
toward yourself and it immediately comes
back<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:36.830> very<00:04:37.310> handy<00:04:37.669> very<00:04:37.880> convenient

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
in addition the throttle trim down

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.830 
in addition the throttle trim down
button<00:04:40.310> it<00:04:40.490> again<00:04:40.940> does<00:04:41.210> not<00:04:41.360> do<00:04:41.510> throttle

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840

button it again does not do throttle
trim<00:04:41.990> down<00:04:42.169> it<00:04:42.620> does<00:04:42.800> sort<00:04:42.980> of<00:04:43.100> a<00:04:43.190> return<00:04:43.550> to

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
trim down it does sort of a return to

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.820 
trim down it does sort of a return to
home<00:04:43.880> feature<00:04:44.150> but<00:04:44.600> again<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:44.960> doesn't<00:04:45.139> work<00:04:45.620> a

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
home feature but again it doesn't work a

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.590 
home feature but again it doesn't work a
hundred<00:04:46.160> percent<00:04:46.460> right<00:04:46.520> instead<00:04:47.480> of<00:04:47.510> doing

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
hundred percent right instead of doing

hundred percent right instead of doing
return<00:04:47.990> to<00:04:48.139> home<00:04:48.320> it<00:04:48.590> does<00:04:49.340> straight<00:04:49.730> back<00:04:50.060> so

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
return to home it does straight back so

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.150 
return to home it does straight back so
technically<00:04:51.139> it<00:04:51.290> is<00:04:51.410> sort<00:04:51.620> of<00:04:51.680> returning<00:04:51.980> to

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
technically it is sort of returning to

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.980 
technically it is sort of returning to
home<00:04:52.310> but<00:04:52.520> it's<00:04:52.669> not<00:04:52.820> going<00:04:53.210> straight<00:04:53.780> back<00:04:53.930> to

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
where you are it's going straight back

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.280 
where you are it's going straight back
from<00:04:55.790> wherever<00:04:56.030> it<00:04:56.360> is<00:04:56.510> so<00:04:56.990> it's<00:04:57.110> not<00:04:57.230> a

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290

amount however the headless mode can be
a<00:05:00.680> lot<00:05:01.010> of<00:05:01.070> fun<00:05:01.400> for<00:05:01.430> flying<00:05:01.820> around<00:05:02.090> with<00:05:02.240> but

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
a lot of fun for flying around with but

been<00:05:19.850> out<00:05:20.060> in<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.300> Sun<00:05:20.600> so<00:05:20.870> it's<00:05:20.990> kind<00:05:21.200> of<00:05:21.260> hard

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
been out in the Sun so it's kind of hard

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.260 
been out in the Sun so it's kind of hard
to<00:05:21.500> see<00:05:21.710> that<00:05:21.890> the<00:05:22.130> lights<00:05:22.520> don't<00:05:22.820> shine<00:05:23.090> all

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
to see that the lights don't shine all

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.640 
to see that the lights don't shine all
that<00:05:23.419> brightly<00:05:23.690> when<00:05:23.930> you're<00:05:24.080> outdoors<00:05:24.200> in

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
that brightly when you're outdoors in

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.230 
that brightly when you're outdoors in
the<00:05:24.710> sun<00:05:25.010> at<00:05:25.370> least<00:05:25.550> but<00:05:25.820> i<00:05:25.850> think<00:05:26.090> it<00:05:26.150> has

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
the sun at least but i think it has

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.540 
the sun at least but i think it has
between<00:05:26.540> 30<00:05:26.780> and<00:05:26.840> 45<00:05:27.200> seconds<00:05:27.680> of<00:05:27.830> LVC<00:05:28.520> warning

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
between 30 and 45 seconds of LVC warning

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.280 
between 30 and 45 seconds of LVC warning
but<00:05:29.240> one<00:05:29.390> way<00:05:29.510> or<00:05:29.570> another<00:05:29.600> about<00:05:29.810> five<00:05:30.140> and<00:05:30.229> a

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
but one way or another about five and a

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.390 
but one way or another about five and a
half<00:05:30.320> minutes<00:05:30.530> of<00:05:30.740> flight<00:05:30.890> time<00:05:30.919> definitely

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
half minutes of flight time definitely

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.740 
half minutes of flight time definitely
not<00:05:31.760> bad<00:05:32.000> it's<00:05:32.210> for<00:05:32.360> something<00:05:32.600> like<00:05:32.690> this

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
not bad it's for something like this

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.900 
not bad it's for something like this
especially<00:05:33.410> considering<00:05:33.860> it<00:05:33.950> does<00:05:34.130> have<00:05:34.310> 150
