00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.530
 I bring good tutorial because of that 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.689
 graphic engine so known the one 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.380
 you always ask for tutorials and I do not do 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:24.140
 barely and unity3d by the way they have 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.400
 downloaded version 4.0 is worth so 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.410
 let's see how 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.000
 by the way the tutorial that is the most 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.039
 important and I forgot to say the how 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.539
 not a part that I have throat 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.340
 shattered is how to create a game in 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.710
 third person guys although already what 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.320
 you will have guessed by the title 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.030
 well first what to do is 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.250
 I'm going to eliminate everything I have up to 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.250
 now christ has merit 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.580
 the land 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.730
 the camera you when in the wake of a 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.970
 new project will only come out 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.220
 this here and this is already what you will have 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.850
 OK 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.500
 and what more do I do, let's start 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.890
 three types of characters that we can 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.630
 add one the one you have already configured 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.190
 totally and nothing will have to be modified 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.240
 2 the one that only has to be added 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.070
 some classes and 3 that we will have to 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.930
 create our own classes in this 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.260
 tutorial we're just going to give the first and 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.270
 the second 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.289
 that said we created a train 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.010
 7 rain or be resolution and we put 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:44.250
 100 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:47.100
 here not here if I want to be resolution 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.430
 and we have it here as we can see 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.220
 see if this clicks that I have the mouse 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.330
 a little humpback 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.350
 no no do not fail us now guys 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.350
 calm and now 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.640
 we add game of the other address to 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.869
 the law and this address to live as 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.909
 we always put our trick but 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:18.940
 let's put some of this kind to 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:21.430
 our train we select the land and 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.590
 we put a texture this simply 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.450
 to please the view 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:32.500
 aztecs tour reads rock river 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.050
 we give at and here we have it now if 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.269
 we will pull it off nothing will happen as we go 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:42.680
 to see nothing true now come into play 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:46.040
 characters 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.719
 that I was referring to what I meant with type 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.250
 of characters all good that all 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.959
 the characters or almost all of you who go 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.700
 to see here I downloaded them from 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:59.870
 windows here make store in 3d chapters 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.269
 of free category is worth so for 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.010
 example I have a monster that is the 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.239
 master that there are forms and you must have 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.739
 found back first because very 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.739
 good here they are 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.530
 caster 1 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.510
 and we take and let go here 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.990
 and this is already configured with what 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.990
 what if we give it 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.600
 ah is not worth this number as 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:34.350
 monster that is worth time fallen true 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:39.090
 fish with and not cancer cancer and here 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:42.520
 right button whenever you want here in the 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.350
 monster keys we will have to put this 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.600
 and now so if we start the game 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.860
 and we see 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.860
 here we have our 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.700
 our little doll 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.820
 some variables that we are going to be able 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.590
 configure from here we go to the part 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.480
 right 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.160
 and here in charter control is the script 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.200
 let's put more speed we're going to 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.959
 put 5 speed and monday peter 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.269
 while running 10 and the severity we're going 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.979
 to change to 25 is my configuration 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.690
 preferred now you will see what change 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.690
 Glue is not so slow 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.580
 and it 's more believable you understand good this 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:31.789
 is the first type the first type d 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.590
 of character now we have to go for 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.590
 another let's see if I can not find 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:44.480
 this house is 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:47.300
 to see and see and see is not this 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.420
 goal in here is our goal in this is 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.249
 ok if we start it this is what 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.139
 we would have nothing 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:58.199
 because because you have to configure what 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:02.040
 obviously we have to do 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:04.350
 write here the word dir 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.240
 and let's see what is different, there are several 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.230
 classes true then we drag the class 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.750
 to the golem here 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:16.960
 the first two classes minus the corn 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.960
 and personal and we give you what will happen 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.249
 today it falls clear because much to much 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.349
 people you happen to see that this is the 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:26.600
 true collage then upload the guys 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:29.800
 climb the coder 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.800
 and that will not happen anymore 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.150
 and here is our fake false good 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.280
 false let's increase its size a little 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.280
 so it looks like it does not look like a flea 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:50.230
 let's see how they would be 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:52.060
 false false false very false true clear 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.880
 because you have to configure some here 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.040
 things in you person controller the 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.470
 right section of the golem 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.460
 we have to catch the animations of 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.950
 animation 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:11.540
 we give it to him and we see that the first of idl 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:13.820
 and that and so with everyone in world world 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:18.520
 the first one always 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.520
 young forgiveness jump jam 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.919
 john owns fields 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.919
 and we tried 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.910
 it's much better now 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:40.249
 it's much better 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:42.949
 as we can see it's much better to look 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:45.750
 guys and now it's the third kind of 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:48.300
 character I'm going to eliminate this the golem 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.729
 it would be this yesterday's sun this bar is 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:55.129
 for example 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:58.870
 and let's do what we do guys 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:01.900
 although we put it as we see here dir 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:06.000
 even if we do not put everything here and what 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.000
 let's configure everything as we are going to see now 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:09.770
 walk 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.100
 and a post 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:24.110
 and we went up the coder and how are we going to see 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:28.100
 it's going to be very bad 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:30.470
 You do not see guys, it does not work out 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.930
 and this is the type that you have to configure 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.090
 the classes or the scripts better said 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.520
 Ok guys, well, here's where the 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.770
 tutorial I hope you liked the 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.690
