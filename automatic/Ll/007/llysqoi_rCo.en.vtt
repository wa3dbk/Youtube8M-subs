00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.310 
because it doesn't seem like a game that
would<00:05:02.640> be<00:05:02.760> good<00:05:02.970> with<00:05:03.390> multiplayer<00:05:03.690> but<00:05:04.110> I

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
would be good with multiplayer but I

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.160 
would be good with multiplayer but I
