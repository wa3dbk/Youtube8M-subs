00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 so servus people welcome to one 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.210
 new episode of challenge me and today 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.400
 Let's be something light, hopefully 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.380
 hopefully, and I will 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.509
 try on raid do not know if we can 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.519
 maybe already saw there 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.460
 a basketball hoop or something and then you can 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.529
 you shoot basket balls and me 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.260
 was challenged to head up 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.670
 but that you just believe me 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.410
 at least that's why I'm going on three 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.480
 even make so but that I also they 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.830
 which can also be done in theater mode 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.500
 yes and I have something else 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.170
 correct to black ops so know 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.600
 driven 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.989
 patrick all right so there I find 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.879
 my emblem is better or down to black 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.170
 I have a nasty statement 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.730
 but I made as I have on 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.739
 my facebook page 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.449
 It really is more fun 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.039
 the better you will be so I believe the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.230
 The learning curve is just harder 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.910
 must be more difficult than it is 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.609
 other cds i think is needed more 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.899
 skill and I like that but with 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.039
 I'm great I do that I have 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.860
 no idea now I think I have 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.420
 my sniper the pure and the campaign 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.450
 So I really fumbled 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.280
 summarizes cool made very fun or 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.780
 as well as those in black ops 1 above 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.549
 I also already had it very well 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.560
 The campaign is always good 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.360
 problem is once i hit the balls once 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:26.280
 shot then I have the map again 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:28.850
 start is happy because if I'm there 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850
 shoot down 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.210
 modern art of today a penis this 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.040
 On the other hand, I would put him on 5 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.900
 million animals but it is not 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.810
 bad 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.729
 72 degrees wind all die already 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.600
 Funny the American sockets 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:52.729
 see as well as faces from what that want 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.729
 you put in me and 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:17.010
 he manages to get the double shot fans ready 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:19.120
 Michael Globo was careful 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.010
 I do not believe the triple street 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.290
 triple we will check now 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.870
 time in the theater mode and I hope he 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.270
 does not taste short-lived again 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.280
 theater mode by cod cota how cool it is 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.870

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.170
 Let's see if they were all going on 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.170
 it's 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.670
 OK 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:58.220
 a person comes like a basketball 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.430
 buy game if you have cod black ops 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.530

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.500
 of which at least one must still there 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.860

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.260

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:27.190
