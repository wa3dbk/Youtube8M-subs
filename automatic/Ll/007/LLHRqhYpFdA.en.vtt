work to it in our last video we cut the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.990 
work to it in our last video we cut the
trunk<00:00:14.160> down<00:00:14.429> from<00:00:14.820> some<00:00:15.240> very<00:00:15.509> tall<00:00:15.900> leaders

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
trunk down from some very tall leaders

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.760 
trunk down from some very tall leaders

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
describe what we're going to do with it

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.740 
describe what we're going to do with it
for<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> rest<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.949> year<00:00:29.330> so<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.510> year's

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
for the rest of the year so this year's

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.810 
for the rest of the year so this year's
objective<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.830> grow<00:00:32.070> our<00:00:32.340> upright

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
objective is just to grow our upright

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.090 
objective is just to grow our upright
trunks<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.480> we've<00:00:33.930> got<00:00:34.730> one<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:37.230> we've

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
trunks and we've got one here and we've

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.840 
trunks and we've got one here and we've
got<00:00:38.719> one<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> back<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.610> one<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
got one at the back and one on the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.390 
got one at the back and one on the
inside<00:00:42.270> here<00:00:42.600> so

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.520 

so<00:00:46.760> basically<00:00:47.180> we've<00:00:47.510> got<00:00:47.540> three<00:00:48.170> upright

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
so basically we've got three upright

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.870 
so basically we've got three upright
trunks<00:00:48.980> that<00:00:49.040> we're<00:00:49.220> going<00:00:49.310> to<00:00:49.370> keep<00:00:49.670> and

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
trunks that we're going to keep and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.580 
trunks that we're going to keep and
everything<00:00:50.660> else<00:00:50.750> is<00:00:50.930> going<00:00:51.080> to<00:00:51.170> be<00:00:51.230> removed

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
everything else is going to be removed

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.740 
everything else is going to be removed
and<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:52.610> objective<00:00:53.030> for<00:00:53.180> this<00:00:53.300> year<00:00:53.600> is<00:00:53.720> just

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
and the objective for this year is just

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.710 
and the objective for this year is just
to<00:00:54.140> grow<00:00:54.350> these<00:00:54.560> upright<00:00:54.950> trunks<00:00:55.720> picking

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
to grow these upright trunks picking

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.110 
to grow these upright trunks picking
them<00:00:56.840> up<00:00:56.930> keep<00:00:57.770> our<00:00:57.980> trunk<00:00:58.280> clean<00:00:58.520> of<00:00:58.670> branches

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
them up keep our trunk clean of branches

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.910 
them up keep our trunk clean of branches
at<00:00:59.270> the<00:00:59.360> moment<00:00:59.720> so<00:01:00.290> what<00:01:00.470> we're<00:01:00.590> going<00:01:00.710> to<00:01:00.739> do

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
at the moment so what we're going to do

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.170 
at the moment so what we're going to do
is<00:01:01.100> we're<00:01:01.280> going<00:01:01.400> to<00:01:01.460> prune<00:01:01.700> off<00:01:01.910> these

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
is we're going to prune off these

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.990 
is we're going to prune off these
branches<00:01:02.690> we<00:01:02.840> don't<00:01:03.050> want<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:03.729> the<00:01:04.729> reason

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
branches we don't want and the reason

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.240 
branches we don't want and the reason
we're<00:01:05.150> going<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:05.300> do<00:01:05.479> that<00:01:05.630> is<00:01:05.930> if<00:01:06.170> we<00:01:06.890> let<00:01:07.070> them

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
we're going to do that is if we let them

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.710 
we're going to do that is if we let them
grow

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
grow

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.290 
grow
it<00:01:08.720> would<00:01:09.020> give<00:01:09.920> it<00:01:10.040> like<00:01:10.160> a<00:01:10.190> thick<00:01:10.520> knob<00:01:10.820> here

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
it would give it like a thick knob here

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.030 
it would give it like a thick knob here
where<00:01:11.750> all<00:01:11.840> these<00:01:11.990> branches<00:01:12.320> are<00:01:12.590> growing<00:01:12.920> out

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
where all these branches are growing out

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.130 
where all these branches are growing out
from<00:01:13.070> one<00:01:13.430> point<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.660> we're<00:01:14.750> going<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:14.900> prune

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
from one point so we're going to prune

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.760 
from one point so we're going to prune
off<00:01:15.290> these<00:01:15.530> branches<00:01:17.170> this<00:01:18.170> one

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.990 

and<00:01:23.770> we're<00:01:24.190> going<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.369> come<00:01:24.549> around<00:01:24.670> this<00:01:24.940> side

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
and we're going to come around this side

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.149 
and we're going to come around this side
and<00:01:26.820> print<00:01:27.820> off<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.150> others<00:01:28.710> which<00:01:29.710> is<00:01:29.920> this

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
and print off the others which is this

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.170 
and print off the others which is this
one

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:43.230 

and<00:01:35.770> this<00:01:36.770> back<00:01:37.010> one

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.240 

mmm<00:01:44.200> lemony<00:01:44.770> fresh<00:01:45.070> I<00:01:46.030> like<00:01:46.810> it<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:48.100> there

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
mmm lemony fresh I like it so there

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.010 
mmm lemony fresh I like it so there
we've<00:01:48.399> got<00:01:48.430> it<00:01:48.610> down<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:48.909> our<00:01:49.119> upright<00:01:49.720> branch

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
we've got it down to our upright branch

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.570 
we've got it down to our upright branch
structure<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.439> we're<00:01:54.040> just<00:01:54.159> going<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.430> let

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
structure and we're just going to let

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.880 
structure and we're just going to let
that<00:01:54.729> grow<00:01:54.970> for<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.360> season<00:01:55.860> when<00:01:56.860> I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
that grow for the season when I

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.490 
that grow for the season when I
initially<00:01:57.250> did<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.850> trunk<00:01:58.180> chop<00:01:58.450> from<00:01:59.229> last

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
initially did the trunk chop from last

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.580 
initially did the trunk chop from last
season<00:01:59.979> I<00:02:00.159> got<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.090> lot<00:02:01.539> of<00:02:01.570> suckers<00:02:02.229> growing

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
season I got a lot of suckers growing

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.940 
season I got a lot of suckers growing
out<00:02:02.740> of<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:02.979> main<00:02:03.159> trunk<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.560> can<00:02:05.740> see

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
out of the main trunk you can see

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.649 
out of the main trunk you can see
there's<00:02:06.189> still<00:02:06.369> some<00:02:06.789> growing<00:02:07.060> now<00:02:07.360> this

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
there's still some growing now this

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.410 
there's still some growing now this
little<00:02:07.929> green<00:02:08.200> sprouts<00:02:08.649> coming<00:02:08.890> out<00:02:09.269> so<00:02:10.269> I've

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
little green sprouts coming out so I've

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.750 
little green sprouts coming out so I've
been<00:02:10.599> picking<00:02:10.840> those<00:02:11.110> off<00:02:11.410> just<00:02:12.400> with<00:02:12.550> my

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
been picking those off just with my

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:23.059 
been picking those off just with my
finger<00:02:13.150> like<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:17.010> another<00:02:18.010> one

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.890 

because<00:02:23.700> at<00:02:23.849> this<00:02:23.969> point<00:02:24.269> we<00:02:24.420> just<00:02:24.450> want<00:02:24.840> a
