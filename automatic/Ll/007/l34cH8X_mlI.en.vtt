00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.299
 I prepare my modern version of chicken 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.950
 and peppers so affectionate beginning of the 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.659
 thin white onion and I do it 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.339
 stufara very low flame with a drop 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.080
 of oil in this non-stick pan 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.600
 the accompanying sauce will be made 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.310
 with red pepper to make it more 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.380
 the hair is easily digestible with a potato peeler 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.980
 cut in half without seeds and filaments 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.790
 inside and then cut into sticks 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.650
 add to the onion when it is 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.379
 rather transparent and continues to do 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.540
 always cook over low heat in 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.120
 Meanwhile, however, the stuffing is the pole 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.800
 becomes a filling of friggitelli 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.960
 then chicken breast deprived of parts 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.550
 ginosa and fat map will go into the mix 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.079
 together a bit of ricotta which will give a little 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.140
 of softness otherwise compacts 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.700
 too much to give us an idea of ​​that garlic 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.840
 it means a little bit of blue garlic from 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.640
 internal germ but will use it 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.470
 practically a quarter of schiphol and a 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.399
 pinch of salt and then we give a little 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.780
 perfume 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.970
 I add some weight and obviously and e 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.620
 fresh rosemary peeled from the twig 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.360
 central and the first 8 the knife 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.860
 otherwise the mixer with the pole does not exist 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.030
 did the atria add a thread 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.909
 from extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.530
 I close the whole thing on my mixer 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.880
 massa is ready in the meantime continues to 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.250
 wet with a little water or broth 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.510
 vegetable the sauce of peppers and onions 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.280
 so that it can get bored beautiful 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.810
 become creamy and homogeneous and in the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.850
 meanwhile clean friggitelli 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.560
 obviously cutting the first of the halves in half 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.869
 filaments of internal seeds that have a 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.310
 a little bit stronger and I leave them paired 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.900
 because now they will be stuffed and 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.880
 recompose as if they were little ones 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.979
 sandwiches the pole goes to the center in order to 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.530
 fill them well and then go over his 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.270
 tap baking pan with a wire 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.830
 from the extra virgin pinch of salt e 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.110
 here too some rosemary and sprigs 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.020
 so that it can take the perfume in 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.880
 oven at 200 degrees for about 17 20 minutes 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.470
 in the meantime I will go to whisk mine 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.240
 more for each onion than are overcooked 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.830
 they will be caramelized they will make very sweet 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.049
 the right taste and start 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.030
 Serve when the friggitelli are well 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.659
 colorful and beautiful roasted we go to 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.170

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.750
 pepperoni 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.700
 and a little oil just to complete it 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.989
