00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.350
 hello girls welcome to another channel 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.350
 where we can have fun without more 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:18.590
 and it seems to many people this this data 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.840
 it is not important or they are not 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.039
 informed about this topic later I'm going to 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.410
 take advantage to make a video if 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.599
 explain a bit about the subject of 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.429
 fans currently in my house 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.810
 I'm talking in this video I have two 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.810
 delayed to the bottom doing 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.500
 but well this is not important what 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.800
 important that are the fans 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.270
 I have here exposed a few of them 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.750
 the media will have different 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:54.510
 measurements we will have 12 centimeters of 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.510
 14 centimeters and there are up d 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:05.570
 at 20 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:07.550
 to 20 centimeters 20 centimeters then 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.470
 each one has its function for 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.390
 refrigerate for our house because it has 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.030
 better the flow and get the most 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.440
 possible heat within calm this 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.820
 although right now I do not have it is very 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.680
 important to show your 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.530
 computer yes that's pretty 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.200
 We recommend installing because we have 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.690
 mind that it would be what will get the heat 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.850
 from our box and do not accumulate so much 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.619
 heat the house of another then 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.750
 we would have to see the larger size of 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.090
 that would accept our house is to buy 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.100
 the fans according to the size that 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.830
 accept as a rule will not put us 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.210
 12 centimeters and 14 buildings and 20 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:47.580
 but it will put them in 120 millimeters 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.580
 140 mm 180 mm 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.580
 200 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:00.210
 or 200 millimeters then here the 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.490
 models that have several lights but 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.240
 we will also have no without lights 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.610
 we have this white red blue 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.850
 We have many sizes and brands 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.710
 and then we will also have controllers 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.570
 to handle the 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.820
 and the fans here as you can see 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.650
 we can raise and lower the revolutions 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.570
 although this is something that goes 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.640
 that is, we can connect without any type 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.470
 of problems the fans to the plate 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.850
 base 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.250
 and if we are not we do not want little lights 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.280
 because we have a little bit of that fact of 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.450
 three lights everywhere as is my 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.800
 case because I think they are a bit 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.020
 Annoying at bedtime been the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.820
 computer minister there are no lights is 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.550
 more there are fans for example like 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.600
 these here that come prepared 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.370
 as you can see it has some small 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.350
 notches in the fan that what does 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.300
 is that they are silent that they do less 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.610
 noise that generates a fan 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.160
 normal this does not come well at the time 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.020
 that's what they decide themselves with the computer that 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.600
 there is less noise that does not bother much 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.100
 less is better not dance so the 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.020
 normal fans and fans 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.959
 with lights that light and also 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.890
 no function does not ask anything else 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.890
 what to say 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.879
 then well then we would also have 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.099
 It is very important what you say in 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.870
 the boxes fail because it 's a box of 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.519
 high end but it has very good 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.220
 refrigeration as you can see has here 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.230
 two side fans one front 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.780
 and here we could install another 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.730
 fan on top 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.560
 we would have to put the fans 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.480
 but these fans do not come from 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.519
 series this we would have that is that there 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.629
 that later acquire for 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.879
 can you install them then if 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.040
 we will get better the fraud and 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.480
 cooling our house according to 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.069
 guys any questions or doubts 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.160
 you have about cooling by 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.209
 of inspiration from the computers below 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.140
 the comments house you can 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.670
 leave and also if you want you already know how to give 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.709
 thumb to the city to support the 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.150
 videos and especially to your comment 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.950
 because we are interested in your opinion 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.950
 so strauss 801
