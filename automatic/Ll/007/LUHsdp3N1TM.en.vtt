00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.080
 trekking grip today I want you the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.670
 cooking man cs 3000 gas cooking imagine 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.610
 that a gas cooker with 1 kommunika 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.420
 heating capacity and gas consumption of 150 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.750
 grams per hour 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:21.320
 he uses mental gas cartridges from 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:24.630
 type msf 1a let this up here once 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.720
 I'll come back soon and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.279
 First you have such an apple middle 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.769
 these are not bad summer itself 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.600
 Asian that means if you are the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.010
 Once she has started she can again 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.399
 take or outside the loan 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.340
 stock also comes this suitcase 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.230
 still with a suitcase of this 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.100
 transport just comes well but stopped 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.660
 I think it's enough 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.239
 and now for the price of the device is 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.390
 really the sensational and this one 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.489
 gas cooker costs twelve with 12 correctly 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.600
 from these catholic 26 euros and as 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.049
 I think that's a great prize 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.309
 performance ratio of the Catholic 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.450
 camera ware to buy if one 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.760
 Door is not enough or you look 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.530
 now at lying down there would cost 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.280
 Cartridge depending on the quantity you use it 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.119
 buys between 1 euro and 51 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.770
 that of course a clearer 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.049
 Price difference to this standard 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.430
 unscrews openly 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.430
 the cost is almost five euros the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.619
 Cartridge at about the same amount of gas 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:32.040
 gas amount is 227 grams which amounted 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:38.549
 So it's enough for about one and a half 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.740
 hours of operation of this chorus and to 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.390
 using the calculator a super car 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.229
 camp or festivals special festivals 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.700
 because the most in the summer 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.740
 take place and then it does not bother 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.479
 that it is good for cartridges because 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.000
 Bhutan has very little pressure when it is cold 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.560
 and can the catholic church full 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.040
 be emptied because the rest open air 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.390
 the gas cartridge is not enough for 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.110
 others are of course even more successful 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.939
 Suitable because of this gas stove relative 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.729
 simply constructed and spare parts 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.920
 I thought you had to have 16 earrings in it 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.500
 you keep it in case it gets brittle 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.580
 and the amount and the gas can invoke 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.640
 of course, bought a large quantity 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.090
 become a relatively small price so 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.280
 A great recommendation for stairs to 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.230
 operation of the cook will be here once 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.810
 a fair regulation for the gas cartridge 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.450
 come here succumbed 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.459
 You have to carroll this up 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:39.660
 I put underneath here is below 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:40.530
 this snapper then is the panic and 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.569
 then here can through the cartouche 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.010
 be attracted and will say one 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.860
 Stoke upwards you know 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.860
 it is virtually connected to the device 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:57.060
 Of course, I should head first 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.510
 turn over pad works that one 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.150
 yes connected now 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.500
 to shut up there 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.860
 benefits from the senate until the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.370
 back one turns him fits halt 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.370
 in the transport case a relative 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.760
 big pot pad big pots for 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.840
 zero or pea soup or something 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.570
 Watch out then you have the 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.850
 Camera settings is is out is 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.380
 minimum and below is maximum and carries 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.010
 the children 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.910
 The film is under the synonymous turns synonymous 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:41.790
 directly her if I show the cramps 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:44.030
 can easily if the here but I think 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.030
 this works out 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.500
 So the cooker's operation would be me now 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.110
 once a test run with 400 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.120
 milliliters of water so we are the same 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.959
 I have a lot of money for a finished time 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.500
 here in the ms astor wayport with eleven 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:08.330
 under military capacity 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.760
 you press relatively stopwatch and want 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.010
 let's see how long it takes to get that 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.390
 water boils 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.329
 I'll get right back then when 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.709
 then water boils the water boils it 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.739
 Not yet, but I still wanted to 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.169
 once the flames show the 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:29.000
 relatively even the top representative 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:32.600
 by earning and since I eat you well 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.979
 can set here is looking over 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.090
 also for more complex meals 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.220
 suitable and not to 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.810
 and not just for water 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.500
 to heat quickly or water to 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.330
 to bring to a boil 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.510
 I think that may be more complex 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.530
 meals like noodles or doodle sauce 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.960
 to do without them directly 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.320
 burn and I would like to 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.810
 right back the water is boiling like that 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:59.600
 water is boiling meanwhile and years 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.780
 we have something foggy about three 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.070
 Minutes rounded up slightly behind 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:10.760
 it would come to that 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:12.260
 probably make three minutes and 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.050
 I can say that I have a great 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.700
 Cooker holding for a gas stove 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.410
 really unbeatable in operation 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.570
 because the cartridges are in favor 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:24.440
 after the operation you can see the cat 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.030
 again do not solve this with the 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.880
 system connected and it can not be gas 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.139
 more escape the cook now 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.190
 no longer in operation again 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.530
 Packed away you should the cartridge 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.840
 remove 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.380
 and again these safety grilles 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.380
 sit on 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:47.070
 So if you more festival time or 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.040
 car needs a camping stove or half 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.440
 hit since 2001 cooker vorhÃ¤tten 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.970
 would like for power failure or whatever 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.260
 you always have something to eat 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:00.110
 do you want to definitely recommendation 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:02.370
 I can be found under the name searches 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.470
 several providers probably can buy the 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.840
 There are also different brand names 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.000
 Not only is cooking there are others as well 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.710
 I think they are actually identical 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.960
 and there you can already the cheapest 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.590
 then you should take up to 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.590
 next video
