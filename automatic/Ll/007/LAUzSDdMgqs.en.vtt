00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.530
 the nearly 250 author 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.620
 thanks in part to the rising stars tour mine 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.320

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.100
 can get in and the grandslams 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.100
 we can film most 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.920
 Paul has been a hard way to care for you 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.230
 work up to where I am now 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.430

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.979
 pleasure 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.100
 the hard work is thinner 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.479
 prize to the room where I am happy that 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.190
 I already have that 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.880
 who travel but when i see a lot of the 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.210
 world of course i don't have it 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.210
 nightlife 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.090
 we can be a student or something 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.649
 that's different, but it's not 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.649
 from there really need one 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.860
 my idols are not technically serious and or 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.320
 how to do list because he likes it 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.540
 field makes a lot of fun and 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.450
 actually a little bit opposite 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.880
 is mine so do not make fun gym 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.490
 but I have previously withdrawn to the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.150
 rather a shy person to me 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.950
 is very easy and already had with the 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.610
 people like that 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.400
 last season was my highlight here 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.979
 win and in Oostende for woman's own 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.479
 public own club where i am too 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.150
 can play 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.940
 the rising stars tournaments of bnp 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.729
 paribas fortis is a real one for me 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.180
 springboard for my ranking 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:19.310
 I'd been very important and yes and 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.310
 evolution as a guest in that player itself
