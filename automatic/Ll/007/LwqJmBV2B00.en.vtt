00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 intensely seriously I do not like that 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.890
 name could not occur another better 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.180
 good to me I would not run another 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.040
 I'm better a fool so I had it 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.660
 left as inside out but it would not be the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.030
 first time they do that yes but 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.830
 we had his 100 cars toy story not all 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.830
 it has to be translated so it's worth mothers 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.080
 it's quite encouraging to see the 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.699
 short film prior to the films of 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.800
 pixar and realize you're crying 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.689
 two minutes after it started and you say 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.460
 I hope the movie is at the level of 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.559
 short and this had more fregÃ³n when the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.300
 movie if it's at that level and exceeds 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.220
 your expectations because I say now 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.250
 we all know that pixar also commits 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.230
 mistakes 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.270
 but I'll say it right now they'll have 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.880
 rehearsed go to see intensely is more 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.360
 remove the video removes video and go or 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.360
 that if they left 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.879
 those who stayed behind after 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.469
 see the video believe me they are not going to 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.390
 to regret every pixar movie is a 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.920
 global event going to see it on screen 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.780
 big and you can enjoy with the family 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.519
 that if they had not in 3-d 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.469
 save the extra money buy your 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.539
 nachos with plastic cheese is easier 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.159
 the 3 of him is not worth intensely 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:08.140
 consider the history of dance and its 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.610
 emotions each represented by one 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.049
 of these little monkeys they take care of 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.880
 take care of the memories and the state of 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.590
 mood rail and practically handle 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.240
 about pretty representation of what 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.649
 a form occurs in our heads 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.240
 easy to understand why am I wrong with 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.830
 the head and of course the moment in 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.780
 the one that two emotions joy and sadness 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.250
 they end up outside the headquarters and 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.810
 they have to return to the barracks before 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.970
 that reilly is emotionally turned off 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.679
 It sounds simple but it is an odyssey of 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.360
 daunting considering what 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.860
 is at risk and the world that exists 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.209
 within each one of us that is 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.560
 something very cool that I liked that 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:37.690
 they did in the movie that was to give us 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.340
 these representations so creative and 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.780
 so original of what happens here 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.850
 inside as it exemplifies us in the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.920
 subconscious the dreams dejavu their 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.549
 abstract concepts dreams dejavu yes 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.500
 Of course 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.179
 leave your emotions now something that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.890
 thinking always gets a lot of times your 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.080
 characters and this is not the exception 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.880
 reilly is the pixar girl more 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.380
 which I have seen in my life clearly towards 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.000
 a great stop that your thoughts 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.410
 complexes were represented by 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.700
 these things but I'm going to understand 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.460
 because then he enters these two 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.080
 players joy and sadness joy that 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.570
 immediately is overflowing 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.340
 happiness and energy and then that 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.470
 joy that you expected then this 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.450
 sadness that is the opposite polar that 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.340
 making them honest in the first 15 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.470
 minutes of the movie I wanted to have the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.210
 little blue piece between my fingers like that 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.490
 by hanging it and removing it in the last 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.680
 the shots I wanted to see as the light of their 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.540
 eyes went extinct because it was good 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.250
 castrating to throw it into the void or 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.210
 hang the front to the barracks so that 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.710
 everyone saw their mistakes 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.300
 I think I exaggerated 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.100
 but the cool ones that show what 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.380
 valuable that is already like all the rest 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.000
 emotions and how important they are for 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.040
 our humanity also like the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.960
 sadness possesses that healing power that 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.700
 it can also provide joy planet 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.290
 this movie is going to be a tote stoppage for 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.880
 boys and girls and there are many adults 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.590
 I also put it like this, this is a 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.450
 friend movie I want to say with this 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.460
 is that movie that you can see for 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.260
 again give you strength to accept that 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.330
 it's okay to feel sad and to cry 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.800
 once in a while it's not bad 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.570
 I honestly believe that this movie 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.790
 has a huge potential to help 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.830
 hundreds of thousands of people in the world 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.420
 I know I would do it with me net I do not think that 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.710
 this movie was going to affect me like 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.180
 he made cold claw completely 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.920
 unprepared as a shock airports of 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.530
 mayweather from big bang 'the friend 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.120
 imaginary to the lowest point of 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.830
 one of the characters to vote them are 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.900
 these I can not find you fail to 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.330
 this movie but it's not because I can not 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.670
 it's more because I do not want I should not start 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.160
 to disrupt and destroy something so noble and 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.530
 so good but without serious you have no soul 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.570
 one thing who hurt you and two minimum 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.220
 all this is a trip is a cycle of 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.870
 adventures that the characters 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.880
 they are facing each other to overcome each other 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.680
 themselves and maybe not everyone likes it 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.460
 that is, if you liked looking for nemo 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.110
 What is it 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.060
 an odyssey there was also no reason 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.560
 why you would not like intensely 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.570
 but again I say it can not be 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.610
 lose this movie do yourself the favor of 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.050
 your life and go see her with her family 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.000
 Take your son and go to your daughter 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.380
 brother, your father, go, everyone, take 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.330
 the lady who always urinates in the 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.720
 corner of your house that only me waits 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.720
 I have those 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.450
 ok and I want to give honorable mention to 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.220
 one of the moments that most have me 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.510
 shitting I laugh that seriously 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.010
 I felt like an idiot because I think that 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.020
 I was the only one who was laughing 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.239
 I mean the biggest reference that 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.930
 I've seen Chinatown in all my life 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.250
 Now you already saw chinatown you know 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.900
 but you tell me what you thought 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.700
 intensely if something did not please you of the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.260
 movie tell me please 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.760
 know but more important I would like 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.050
 to share with me which is the first 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.639
 that comes to mind that 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.380
 movie that gives them the push that 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.690
 they need the hug they needed 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.970
 in my case it's 'cloud atlas' I know it 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.500
 weird but it's a movie that came in 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.880
 the moment when I needed it most and 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.340
 Well, but I like to see it from time to time 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.580
 when to remind me that everything goes 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.639
 to be fine 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.000
 but for now I'm a dante and there's 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.000
 some glasses 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.430
 Y
