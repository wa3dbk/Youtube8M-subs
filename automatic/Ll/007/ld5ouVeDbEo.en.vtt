00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
marker hub hear it when I spin this

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:00.430 
marker hub hear it when I spin this
wheel<00:02:53.650> that's<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.770> jack<00:02:55.010> handle<00:02:55.390> shush<00:02:59.440> for

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440

wheel that's a jack handle shush for
Jack<00:03:00.620> over<00:03:00.920> here<00:03:01.070> say<00:03:02.830> when<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:03.920> spin<00:03:04.280> my<00:03:04.310> right

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
Jack over here say when I spin my right

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.449 
Jack over here say when I spin my right
wheel<00:03:05.360> which<00:03:05.600> is<00:03:05.720> off<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.019> ground<00:03:09.250> that's<00:03:10.250> my

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459
