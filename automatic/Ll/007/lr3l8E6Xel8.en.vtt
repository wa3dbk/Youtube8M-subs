00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.750
 set up 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.530
 gmail 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.460
 puntocom we made sure that mail 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.330
 has been well written 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.330
 we'll see 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:44.550
 how to set up gmail.com and just 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:47.350
 we can write here a subject photos 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.750
 and if he does not change it 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.640
 Immediately he pulls me this option 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.680
 which asks me with what size 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.690
 I want to send the photos if you send the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.520
 Pictures with very heavy size is very 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.200
 possible that the other side does not receive it 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.240
 that the other person has his mail 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.420
 full and besides that they are being sent 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.360
 photos by data will consume data 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.479
 the ideal would be soon 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.700
 use the small option I would use 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.460
 the small option if it really is a 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.870
 very important file so send a 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.210
 single file and sends it to call in 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.050
 real size in this case let's do it 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:26.290
 with the small option and ready one time and 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.269
 no and keep an eye on the mail 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.790
 of the other person or expect the other 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.879
