your right foot right or to the right to
the<00:01:14.580> left<00:01:14.790> few<00:01:15.570> time<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.830> see<00:01:17.070> how

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the left few time then you can see how

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.300 
the left few time then you can see how
the<00:01:17.369> ball<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.820> moving<00:01:19.220> so

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the ball is moving so

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.399 
the ball is moving so
this<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:20.850> way<00:01:21.149> how<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:22.579> predict<00:01:24.110> where<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
this is one way how to predict where the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.039 
this is one way how to predict where the
serve<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:26.340> go<00:01:28.159> there<00:01:29.159> are<00:01:29.250> four<00:01:29.610> steps<00:01:30.030> for<00:01:30.840> a

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
serve can go there are four steps for a

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.149 
serve can go there are four steps for a
serve<00:01:31.460> step<00:01:32.460> number<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> focus<00:01:34.770> of

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
serve step number one is to focus of

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.219 
serve step number one is to focus of
tossing<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.090> ball<00:01:36.240> correctly

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.039 

after<00:01:40.979> tossing<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.670> ball<00:01:41.820> over<00:01:42.149> our<00:01:42.450> head<00:01:42.780> we

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
after tossing the ball over our head we

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.779 
after tossing the ball over our head we
would<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.469> to<00:01:43.500> heat<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> ball<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
would like to heat the ball and the

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.950 
would like to heat the ball and the
highest<00:01:45.210> point<00:01:46.159> over<00:01:47.159> my<00:01:47.399> head<00:01:47.960> after

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
highest point over my head after

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.340 
highest point over my head after
completing<00:01:49.439> step<00:01:49.950> one<00:01:50.280> at<00:01:50.579> step<00:01:51.329> two<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.899> will

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
completing step one at step two I will

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.880 
completing step one at step two I will
bend<00:01:52.649> down<00:01:52.890> my<00:01:53.250> knees<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:54.390> hit<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.469> ball<00:01:55.649> at

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
bend down my knees and hit the ball at

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.120 
bend down my knees and hit the ball at
the<00:01:56.130> highest<00:01:56.399> point<00:01:59.780> at<00:02:00.780> step<00:02:01.200> three<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.950> will

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
the highest point at step three we will

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.779 
the highest point at step three we will
focus<00:02:02.520> off<00:02:03.090> stepping<00:02:03.990> forward<00:02:04.409> into<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
focus off stepping forward into the

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:12.050 
focus off stepping forward into the
court<00:02:06.090> with<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.140> right<00:02:07.649> foot<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:10.709> step<00:02:11.099> four

I will pronate the wrist in ninety

00:02:17.970 --> 00:03:18.100 
I will pronate the wrist in ninety
degree

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.519
