00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
and to go with it but you can't have one

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.990 
and to go with it but you can't have one
side<00:03:04.060> without<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.209> other<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:07.190> I<00:03:07.400> drew<00:03:07.819> this

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
side without the other so I drew this

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.949
