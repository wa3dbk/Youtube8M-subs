00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.100
 Serve the SPD want the plastic urban hapert it still 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.200
 Occasionally you can see this also those who hunt me 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.920
 and we have been running October for two to three years but we also want to 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.159
 try to know 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:15.759
 and he offers sides or domes you can do 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.759
 So the hard core of us are actually two to four people 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.189
 I say better 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.329
 once again there is no answer to the number of these three to four people 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.489
 and "sinners" create an open mind 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.439
 Dec is bad Trier 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.439
 but lately said a lot 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.330
 in Ostel Doku Thüringen join Ursula says Haupt Bakkur 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.150
 that's good for you Carlsen Parkour simply means for me 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.660
 to have the road between fun 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.120
 primarily 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.270
 Since there are no interfering limitless so many runners represented 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.650
 the MacBook pro 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.440
 nothing for weeks what god what not 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.860
 who do not say this all this sport 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.500
 and a subculture 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.140
 You can't pull that off with often getting many influences together 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.140
 Chambers have been canceled 2 ZPO many is food influences 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.120
 meet 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.920
 SW 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.230
 ever the light 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.030
 though not 90% of philosophy though second to baroque 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.030
 We also do not like to do a few exits 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.580
 Popovich retreat 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.580
 but mainly up 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.740
 now he still trains 90% PQ victim said tournament's centner percent documentary 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.650
 I feel so mixed that I have to say that we have no 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.560
 Concept then do not stand out we mostly want to go out have fun 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.430
 look for new locations and wild boar according to the projections for a 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.230
 Have a job 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.260
 In the talks, distances will be overcome Berlin will be a super 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.450
 Cut on the but you can just as well where we stop the keep 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.750
 Frankfurt 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.740
 Ariel Sun God knows what to taste so we are the future see 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.400
 that's not good either way 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.570
 if I have a job then it will be savored no matter in which direction 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.140
 whether Strache shopping park Ulrich Probst pop culture is too 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.010
 as the chairman 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.979
 the word is reported on the roof of a school and in the south and west 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:16.439
 Pölten is to me that's not just twelve butter the Linden absolutely not 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.089
 true which design became public 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:21.420
 or right on the bowling alley I'm not running 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.840
 Of course I'm not leaving. "I formally Dusseldorf I have two small ones 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.729
 Boats in the usual way for pilots on the way 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:31.589
 So you go to drives already to the spots you are a bit more attractive 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:32.809
 as only and Borna 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:36.039
 So we have not had too many spots yet but you have tried 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.359
 to make the best of it 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.269
 everything clear Pölten 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.939
 even further and better, everything worked Kauder
