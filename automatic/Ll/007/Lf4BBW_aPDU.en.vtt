plantain ashes and the palm oil she has

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.990 
plantain ashes and the palm oil she has
a<00:01:21.659> bunch<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.960> sizes<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.470> range<00:01:23.040> from<00:01:23.460> sample

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
a bunch of sizes that range from sample

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.060 
a bunch of sizes that range from sample
size<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.900> dollar<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.439> Ida<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.710> are<00:01:25.830> dollar

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
size of a dollar and Ida that are dollar

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.399 
size of a dollar and Ida that are dollar
95<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.909> she<00:01:27.330> doesn't<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.900> them<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.259> ounces

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
95 and she doesn't have them in ounces

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.380 
95 and she doesn't have them in ounces
because<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:32.040> water<00:01:32.280> changes<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> amount

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
because the the water changes the amount

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.240 
because the the water changes the amount
of<00:01:33.450> ounces<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.020> are<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.740> believe

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
of ounces that they are so I believe

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.880 
of ounces that they are so I believe
this<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> medium<00:01:36.060> bar<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.720> then<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.650> one

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
this is a medium bar and then this one

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.350 
this is a medium bar and then this one
was<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.210> extra-large<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.540> think<00:01:40.549> so<00:01:41.549> that's<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
was a extra-large I think so that's the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.760 
was a extra-large I think so that's the
one<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.630> use<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.110> while<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.320> would<00:01:43.500> use<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
one that I use for a while I would use a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.240 
one that I use for a while I would use a
tiny<00:01:44.040> chunk<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.630> one<00:01:45.810> right<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
tiny chunk like this one right here and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.770 
tiny chunk like this one right here and
I<00:01:47.460> would<00:01:47.579> ladder<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.939> up<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.299> lather<00:01:48.509> is

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
I would ladder it up and the lather is

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.690 
I would ladder it up and the lather is

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
hair which is really not good so you

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.819 
hair which is really not good so you
just<00:02:03.060> lather<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.540> up<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.930> what<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.229> would<00:02:04.320> do<00:02:04.560> is

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
just lather it up and what I would do is

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.289 
just lather it up and what I would do is
I<00:02:05.040> would<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.189> lather<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.610> little<00:02:05.880> bit<00:02:05.969> put<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
I would just lather a little bit put the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.869 
I would just lather a little bit put the
piece<00:02:06.450> down<00:02:06.630> rub<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.979> because<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> have

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
piece down rub it in and because I have

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.360 
piece down rub it in and because I have
so<00:02:09.060> much<00:02:09.179> Shea<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:10.110> want<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.470> rinse<00:02:11.190> it

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
so much Shea in it you want to rinse it

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.720 
so much Shea in it you want to rinse it
out<00:02:11.459> right<00:02:11.819> after<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.300> lather

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
out right after the lather

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.130 
out right after the lather
is<00:02:12.760> gone<00:02:13.000> or<00:02:13.239> else<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.510> che<00:02:13.690> will<00:02:13.870> start<00:02:14.050> to

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
is gone or else the che will start to

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.009 
is gone or else the che will start to
build<00:02:14.319> up<00:02:14.409> in<00:02:14.530> your<00:02:14.560> hair<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:15.970> would<00:02:16.360> do<00:02:16.540> that

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
build up in your hair so I would do that

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.520 
build up in your hair so I would do that
about<00:02:17.819> two<00:02:18.819> or<00:02:19.239> three<00:02:19.269> times<00:02:19.599> the<00:02:19.989> lot<00:02:20.140> really

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
about two or three times the lot really

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.149 
about two or three times the lot really
is<00:02:20.650> very<00:02:20.769> good

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
is very good

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.600 
is very good
and<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:22.540> would<00:02:22.720> rinse<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.019> out<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.950> definitely

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
and I would rinse it out I definitely

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.789 
and I would rinse it out I definitely
had<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.760> use<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.030> lot<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.420> conditioner<00:02:25.799> because

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
had to use a lot of conditioner because

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.570 
had to use a lot of conditioner because
it<00:02:27.489> makes<00:02:27.730> your<00:02:27.909> hair<00:02:28.090> kind<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.450> tangley<00:02:31.440> so

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
it makes your hair kind of tangley so

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.699 
it makes your hair kind of tangley so
after<00:02:33.580> that<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:34.690> first<00:02:34.930> few<00:02:35.230> times<00:02:35.349> they<00:02:35.560> use

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
after that the first few times they use

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.380 
after that the first few times they use
it<00:02:35.920> my<00:02:36.069> hair<00:02:36.280> felt<00:02:36.519> really<00:02:36.849> really<00:02:37.150> really

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
it my hair felt really really really

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.460 
it my hair felt really really really
soft<00:02:37.829> even<00:02:38.829> when<00:02:39.129> I<00:02:39.160> started<00:02:39.489> having<00:02:39.640> problems

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
soft even when I started having problems

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.080 
soft even when I started having problems
which<00:02:41.470> I'll<00:02:41.620> go<00:02:41.739> into<00:02:41.769> my<00:02:42.280> hair<00:02:42.459> still<00:02:42.790> felt

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
which I'll go into my hair still felt

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.900 
which I'll go into my hair still felt
really<00:02:43.299> soft<00:02:43.690> but<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.980> think<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.519> fact<00:02:45.790> that

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
really soft but I think the fact that

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.300 
really soft but I think the fact that
Angela<00:02:46.660> added<00:02:47.049> extra<00:02:47.560> shea<00:02:47.739> butter<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.190> this

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
Angela added extra shea butter and this

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.309 
Angela added extra shea butter and this
has<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:48.549> lot<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.790> shea<00:02:49.030> butter<00:02:49.269> in<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.599> and<00:02:49.810> my

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
has a lot of shea butter in it and my

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.860 
has a lot of shea butter in it and my
scalp<00:02:50.620> really<00:02:51.040> isn't<00:02:51.370> too<00:02:51.579> dry<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.599> shave

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
scalp really isn't too dry the shave

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.569 
scalp really isn't too dry the shave
started<00:02:53.230> building<00:02:53.410> up<00:02:53.680> in<00:02:53.859> my<00:02:53.950> hair<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.400> it

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579
