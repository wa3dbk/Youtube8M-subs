00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.870
 b 2 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.710
 I 'm getting lag now 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.550
 Harbinger Kana 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.550
 Cut off 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 Pi is the bottom of 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.410
 Time 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.410
 It has already been 10 minutes 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.610
 eh 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:44.160
 Well then here never once done wi-fi cutting 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.160
 I want to find out if I can connect 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.660
 I will explain 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.900
 It is a little shock if I can not connect by voice 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.860
 The 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.420
 U 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.280
 I see 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.280
 I wonder if Nintendo did it 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.480
 I'll do it 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.480
 Well, don't do such a forced disconnect 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.750
 I see 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.760
 Can you go crush guy by little came a little to make sure 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.260
 so 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.790
 It was good 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.790
 I felt like that somehow 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.289
 I see 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.360
 In other words 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.690
 I have to disconnect from wi-fi 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:55.360
 If I'm bad I wonder if there's a thread I can play for a long time 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.360
 Well this is less than a day or something like that 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.170
 This software's wi-fi connection service has ended 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.350
 Hm 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.920
 This is terrible 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.549
 This is awful 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.549
 Well here 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:21.050
 Since the Well Ensei say what Toka's servers are a little set Well well it 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.050
 I would like to try it 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.220
 Operation 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.320
 This set -5 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.360
 This is it 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.620
 Something 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.470
 It seems to be connected to something unique server when you put in Star- chan 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.790
 Eh from that now 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.790
 I think I want to try and 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:19.710
 wi-fi is Noto I mean being chased How so 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:20.460
 I wonder if this is really possible I feel like this kind of setting is something different 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:27.319
 so 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:29.410
 Not to be referred to Well network can no longer be unable to connect Well, in this 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.620
 I do not want you to 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:36.370
 This is kind of because it is a system 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:40.200
 I think that I should throw it by 2 except 2 and try to connect 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.610
 Maybe I can't set it, so I can't do it 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.770
 I can not do it 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.890
 But it is opinion 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.890
 Good people are okay Oh yes I can not connect 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.040
 Yes 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.600
 You may have people who are linked Maybe 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.220
 Oh yeah I 'm from now 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.190
 This is its own 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.730
 It is a little hard to connect to the server 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.730
 Not say that 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.710
 The end of this smasher is 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.030
 me 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.440
 It was that I could not connect if I cut it 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.519
 Something 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.519
 It has fallen 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.220
 Smasher 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.960
 I did not do only one and a half years 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.960
 Thank you for defeating me 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.360
 I think it may be connected 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.800
 Even if you continue 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.240
 Yes 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.710
 Well then 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.710
 I want to finish this time with voice 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.210
 Thank you for your viewing
