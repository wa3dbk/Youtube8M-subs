let's<00:03:13.690> say<00:03:13.840> 40<00:03:14.290> mile<00:03:14.470> an<00:03:14.500> hour

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130

let's say 40 mile an hour
give<00:03:15.700> me<00:03:15.790> some<00:03:15.970> whatever<00:03:16.360> hill<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:17.140> beat<00:03:17.380> slow

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
give me some whatever hill to beat slow

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.920 
give me some whatever hill to beat slow
but<00:03:17.980> then<00:03:18.100> if<00:03:18.220> I<00:03:18.310> give<00:03:19.240> it<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.420> load<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.780> welly

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
but then if I give it a load of welly

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.440 
but then if I give it a load of welly
then<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.770> jumps<00:03:21.160> down<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.460> gearbox<00:03:21.850> just<00:03:22.240> gets

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
then it jumps down the gearbox just gets

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.670 
then it jumps down the gearbox just gets
a<00:03:22.510> bit<00:03:22.660> kind<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:22.900> jerky<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.530> jumpy<00:03:25.380> 460<00:03:26.380> Newton

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
a bit kind of jerky and jumpy 460 Newton

today's<00:03:28.930> standards<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:29.920> you'd<00:03:30.070> expect<00:03:30.490> the

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
today's standards and you'd expect the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.760 
today's standards and you'd expect the
big<00:03:30.790> GT<00:03:31.240> like<00:03:31.480> this<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:32.080> have<00:03:32.170> an<00:03:32.290> engine<00:03:32.620> that

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
big GT like this to have an engine that

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.390 
big GT like this to have an engine that
feels<00:03:33.250> well<00:03:33.550> effortless<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:35.110> suddenly<00:03:35.560> it

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
feels well effortless and suddenly it

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.030 
feels well effortless and suddenly it
doesn't

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.310 

so<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.340> may<00:03:41.670> look<00:03:41.700> fast<00:03:42.330> but<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.930> doesn't

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
so it may look fast but it doesn't

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.720 
so it may look fast but it doesn't
really<00:03:43.560> want<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:43.920> go<00:03:44.100> fast

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
really want to go fast

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.730 
really want to go fast
