00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:12.599
 let's analyze the iPhone 6 this 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.360
 here a 3d model of iphone 6 and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.460
 we can also select the 6 plus 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.470
 well let's analyze obviously 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.930
 we do not have the original copy here with 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.340
 by making us a small channel, help us 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.539
 to grow up maybe by signing up then 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.500
 let's analyze how this is done 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.500
 new iphone 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.120
 ok guys frontally we have a 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.020
 4.7-inch touch ai display 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.960
 well-retina display screen 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.800
 Let's start on the right side button 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 lock release and obviously the sim 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.559
 nice for sim below we find instead 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.260
 headphone jack input microphone 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.309
 lightning and speakers on the left side 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.780
 instead of the silent silent switch yes 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.240
 obviously silent or normal 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.080
 milan gives the volume on this side 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.710
 nothing on the back of this camera 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:18.000
 protruding with noise suppression 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.409
 external flash with a flash but the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.479
 Usually the course we should 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.530
 antennas so criticized but to me 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.430
 like 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.860
 one of the things I don't like about 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.810
 this iphone the size is not because 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.470
 so I think beauty is perfect 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.960
 of this iphone it is so it is done 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.420
 note for example the venue had gods 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.710
 small edges on the glass that I don't 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.060
 love it so much 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.460
 then you have the biggest model 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.210
 aesthetically the same thing however it 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.750
 let's compare with 6 so here is two 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.240
 models that we can notice the sizes 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.840
 I remind you that this is thinner here 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.390
 of the bigger one 6 plus 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.100
 this is also where the two models are 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.380
 this site is called stop link 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.700
 description now appear instead with 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.740
 the 5 s 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.420
 and 6 on 6 normal and 5 s 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.400
 how can we already see the thickness 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.569
 we can also compare it with a card 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.120
 visa contention 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.209
 approaching them a little more cannot be done 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.189
 this is a pity and we don't give it 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.109
 thickness 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:24.900
 I would like to compare it instead 6 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:27.180
 class with the 5 and the differences are 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.650
 abyssal alright guys for this 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.299
 video all left a nice it is understood if 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.159
 you enjoyed signing up to the channel first 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.489
 day on the boxing reviews and a lot 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.489
