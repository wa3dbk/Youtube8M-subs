that when I was actually planning on

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.089 
that when I was actually planning on
making<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:25.019> we<00:00:25.260> didn't<00:00:25.500> actually<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
making it we didn't actually have the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.310 
making it we didn't actually have the
old<00:00:26.220> wilderness<00:00:26.760> back<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.599> what<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.960> terms<00:00:28.199> of

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
old wilderness back so what in terms of

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.169 
old wilderness back so what in terms of
traveling<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.010> kdd<00:00:29.550> layer<00:00:29.820> there<00:00:30.060> was

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
traveling to the kdd layer there was

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.450 
traveling to the kdd layer there was
absolutely<00:00:30.689> no<00:00:30.900> problem<00:00:31.289> unfortunately<00:00:32.219> now

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
absolutely no problem unfortunately now

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.130 
absolutely no problem unfortunately now
there<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.180> problem<00:00:33.690> there<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:33.989> that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
there is that problem there is that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.680 
there is that problem there is that
chance<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.980> our<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.399> route<00:00:35.640> certain<00:00:36.059> level

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
chance that our that route certain level

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.930 
chance that our that route certain level
of<00:00:36.750> risk<00:00:37.020> you're<00:00:37.739> putting<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.190> by<00:00:38.370> having<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
of risk you're putting in by having to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.220 
of risk you're putting in by having to
travel<00:00:39.149> through<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.480> wilderness<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.899> get<00:00:40.140> to

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
travel through the wilderness to get to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.350 
travel through the wilderness to get to
the<00:00:40.320> kbd<00:00:40.770> layer<00:00:41.010> obviously<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> best<00:00:42.120> way<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the kbd layer obviously the best way to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.760 
the kbd layer obviously the best way to
get<00:00:42.629> there<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> way<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.410> i<00:00:43.530> use

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
get there in the way that i use

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.889 
get there in the way that i use
personally<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.610> use<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> lava<00:00:45.149> titan<00:00:45.750> i

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
personally was to use a lava titan i

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.200 
personally was to use a lava titan i
teleported<00:00:46.620> via<00:00:47.100> larva<00:00:47.489> tighten<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.940> takes<00:00:48.090> me

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
teleported via larva tighten it takes me

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.569 
teleported via larva tighten it takes me
south<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> kbd<00:00:49.230> layer<00:00:49.469> only<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.399> walk

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
south of the kbd layer only have to walk

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.340 
south of the kbd layer only have to walk
for<00:00:50.820> maybe<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.120> five<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.660> ten<00:00:51.840> seconds<00:00:52.230> in

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
for maybe like five to ten seconds in

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.900 
for maybe like five to ten seconds in
the<00:00:52.469> wilderness<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.949> get<00:00:53.070> round<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the wilderness to get round the the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.760 
the wilderness to get round the the
greater<00:00:54.149> demon<00:00:54.600> cage<00:00:54.780> rather<00:00:55.379> than<00:00:55.559> lesser

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
greater demon cage rather than lesser

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.160 
greater demon cage rather than lesser
demon<00:00:56.160> cage<00:00:56.340> actually<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.570> then<00:00:57.780> down<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
demon cage actually and then down the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.139 
demon cage actually and then down the
ladder<00:00:58.350> um<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.129> yeah<00:00:59.280> there<00:00:59.489> was<00:00:59.579> still<00:00:59.820> risk

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
ladder um so yeah there was still risk

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.840 
ladder um so yeah there was still risk
though<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.660> personally<00:01:01.410> went<00:01:02.070> into<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> low

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
though I personally went into a low

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.549 
though I personally went into a low
populated<00:01:03.449> world<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.110> actually<00:01:04.500> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
populated world and it was actually a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.109 
populated world and it was actually a
skilling<00:01:04.979> world<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> thousand<00:01:05.939> five

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
skilling world so a thousand five

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300 
skilling world so a thousand five
hundred<00:01:06.150> skill<00:01:06.750> level<00:01:07.049> needed<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.040> into

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
hundred skill level needed to get into

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.190 
hundred skill level needed to get into
the<00:01:08.400> world<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:08.850> yeah<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.210> use<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.420> word<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.080> her

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the world so yeah I use that word to her

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.050 
the world so yeah I use that word to her
to<00:01:10.409> actually<00:01:10.560> get<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> kV<00:01:11.460> dealer<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
to actually get up to the kV dealer and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.170 
to actually get up to the kV dealer and
it<00:01:12.510> was<00:01:12.659> safe<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.080> me<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:14.070> yeah<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.820> terms<00:01:15.060> of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
it was safe for me so yeah in terms of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.030 
it was safe for me so yeah in terms of
using<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.630> method<00:01:16.140> though<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.560> would<00:01:16.860> have

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
using that method though you would have

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.160 
using that method though you would have
to<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.310> using<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.939> steel<00:01:18.330> tight<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.900> as<00:01:18.990> you're

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
to be using a steel tight and as you're

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320 
to be using a steel tight and as you're
familiar<00:01:19.380> because<00:01:20.250> obviously<00:01:20.520> then<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.150> can

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
familiar because obviously then you can

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.820 
familiar because obviously then you can
just<00:01:21.479> kill<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.869> lava<00:01:22.080> titan<00:01:22.530> once<00:01:22.710> you're

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
just kill the lava titan once you're

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.050 
just kill the lava titan once you're
done<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:23.610> bring<00:01:23.790> out<00:01:23.909> your

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
done with it and then bring out your

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.730 
done with it and then bring out your
steel<00:01:24.330> titan<00:01:24.720> obviously<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.590> doesn't

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
steel titan obviously that doesn't

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.160 
steel titan obviously that doesn't
exclude<00:01:26.549> iron<00:01:26.970> titan<00:01:27.509> geezer<00:01:27.750> tighter<00:01:28.049> i

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
exclude iron titan geezer tighter i

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.830 
exclude iron titan geezer tighter i
don't<00:01:28.380> know<00:01:28.470> how<00:01:28.619> well<00:01:28.829> those<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.340> here

don't know how well those do here

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.480 
don't know how well those do here
probably<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.259> good<00:01:31.439> as<00:01:31.619> steel<00:01:32.100> titan

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
probably just as good as steel titan

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.609 
probably just as good as steel titan
does<00:01:32.640> however<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.720> are<00:01:33.750> bringing<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.350> yak

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
does however if you are bringing a yak

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.760 
does however if you are bringing a yak
and<00:01:34.890> yak<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> very<00:01:35.729> sensible<00:01:36.619> familiar<00:01:37.619> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
and yak is a very sensible familiar to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.920 
and yak is a very sensible familiar to
bring<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.540> think<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.869> another

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
bring you will have to think of another

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.810 
bring you will have to think of another
method<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.590> getting<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:41.130> obviously<00:01:41.670> you'll

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
method of getting here obviously you'll

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.850 
method of getting here obviously you'll
probably<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.329> far<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.840> walk<00:01:43.409> all<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.829> way

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
probably have far the walk all the way

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.679 
probably have far the walk all the way
there<00:01:43.979> or<00:01:44.430> maybe<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.540> ancient

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
there or maybe if you have ancient

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.539 
there or maybe if you have ancient
teleports<00:01:46.409> you'll<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.920> use<00:01:47.189> one<00:01:47.520> of

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
teleports you'll have to use one of

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.770 
teleports you'll have to use one of
those<00:01:47.700> injured<00:01:48.090> teleports<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.509> get<00:01:48.689> you

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
those injured teleports to get you

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.899 
those injured teleports to get you
halfway<00:01:48.990> across<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> roses<00:01:49.950> walk<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.729> rest

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
halfway across the roses walk the rest

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.940 
halfway across the roses walk the rest
maybe<00:01:51.270> use<00:01:51.509> those<00:01:51.750> are<00:01:51.990> ancient<00:01:52.229> teleport

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
maybe use those are ancient teleport

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.469 
maybe use those are ancient teleport
things<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.700> they<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> world<00:01:54.299> just

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
things that they have in the world just

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.569 
things that they have in the world just
as<00:01:54.570> well<00:01:54.750> lots<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.680> different<00:01:55.979> methods<00:01:56.369> but

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
as well lots of different methods but

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.399 
as well lots of different methods but
they're<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.390> safe<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:57.810> using<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.200> lava

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
they're not as safe as using a lava

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.399 
they're not as safe as using a lava
titan<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.820> um<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.420> yeah<00:02:00.570> right<00:02:00.750> now<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.140> can

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
titan so um so yeah right now you can

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.480 
titan so um so yeah right now you can
see<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.619> i'm<00:02:01.860> killing<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> king<00:02:02.369> black

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
see that i'm killing the king black

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.280 
see that i'm killing the king black
dragon<00:02:02.850> with<00:02:03.030> my<00:02:03.060> steel<00:02:03.450> titan<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:03.930> i<00:02:03.960> use<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
dragon with my steel titan so i use the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.459 
dragon with my steel titan so i use the
lava<00:02:04.500> titansteel<00:02:04.979> tighten<00:02:05.640> our<00:02:05.939> method<00:02:06.719> and

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
lava titansteel tighten our method and

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.260 
lava titansteel tighten our method and
then<00:02:08.039> yeah<00:02:08.220> having<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.580> look<00:02:08.700> at<00:02:08.819> my<00:02:08.940> gear<00:02:09.239> and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
then yeah having a look at my gear and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.420 
then yeah having a look at my gear and
actually<00:02:09.810> talking<00:02:10.050> about<00:02:10.229> risk<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.890> well<00:02:11.099> so

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
actually talking about risk as well so

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.820 
actually talking about risk as well so
obviously<00:02:12.000> when<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.270> go<00:02:12.360> into<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
obviously when you go into the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.620 
obviously when you go into the
you<00:02:13.130> will<00:02:13.340> be<00:02:13.460> risking<00:02:13.910> quite<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.180> lot<00:02:14.450> and

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
you will be risking quite a lot and

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.390 
you will be risking quite a lot and
least<00:02:15.140> that's<00:02:15.350> what<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.590> thought<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:16.070> this<00:02:16.250> is

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
least that's what I thought that this is

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.490 
least that's what I thought that this is
actually<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.790> best<00:02:16.820> of<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.720> worst<00:02:17.900> time<00:02:18.470> to

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
actually the best of the worst time to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.980 
actually the best of the worst time to
kill<00:02:18.890> abd<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.210> worst<00:02:20.450> time<00:02:20.720> obviously

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
kill abd it is the worst time obviously

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.110 
kill abd it is the worst time obviously
because<00:02:21.530> all<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.100> wilderness<00:02:22.520> is<00:02:22.670> back<00:02:22.880> and

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
because all the wilderness is back and

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.450 
because all the wilderness is back and
there<00:02:23.660> is<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.810> risk<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:24.470> may<00:02:24.620> die<00:02:24.860> but

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
there is a risk that you may die but

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.640 
there is a risk that you may die but
it's<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.880> best<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.390> worst<00:02:26.630> because<00:02:27.110> the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
it's the best of the worst because the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.950 
it's the best of the worst because the
items<00:02:28.160> kept<00:02:28.520> on<00:02:28.700> death<00:02:28.970> system<00:02:29.450> was

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
items kept on death system was

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.260 
items kept on death system was
rearranged<00:02:30.680> yesterday<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.400> update<00:02:32.060> came

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
rearranged yesterday the the update came

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.570 
rearranged yesterday the the update came
out<00:02:32.420> yesterday<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.050> it<00:02:33.560> means<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:33.890> most<00:02:34.310> of

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
out yesterday and it means that most of

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.400 
out yesterday and it means that most of
the<00:02:34.670> things<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:35.060> highly<00:02:35.510> value<00:02:35.930> or<00:02:36.110> saved

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
the things that I highly value or saved

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.310 
the things that I highly value or saved
anyway<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:37.640> for<00:02:37.820> example<00:02:37.910> if<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.990> was<00:02:39.110> only

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
anyway so for example if I was only

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.720 
anyway so for example if I was only
saving<00:02:39.530> through<00:02:39.830> an<00:02:39.890> item's<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.370> would<00:02:40.460> be<00:02:40.610> the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
saving through an item's it would be the

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.060 
saving through an item's it would be the
band<00:02:40.940> or<00:02:41.120> chest<00:02:41.390> plate<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:42.110> band<00:02:42.320> lost<00:02:42.530> assets

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
band or chest plate the band lost assets

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.940 
band or chest plate the band lost assets
and<00:02:43.310> my<00:02:43.610> chaotic<00:02:43.880> rapier<00:02:44.480> if<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.560> would<00:02:45.680> use<00:02:45.830> an

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
and my chaotic rapier if I would use an

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.620 
and my chaotic rapier if I would use an
item<00:02:46.280> protect<00:02:46.610> which<00:02:46.730> obviously<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.180> would<00:02:47.450> do

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
item protect which obviously I would do

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.530 
item protect which obviously I would do
before<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.080> even<00:02:48.230> go<00:02:48.440> into<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.710> wilderness<00:02:49.540> the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
before I even go into the wilderness the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.390 
before I even go into the wilderness the
item<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:51.020> would<00:02:51.140> protect<00:02:51.320> is<00:02:51.650> my<00:02:51.770> fury<00:02:52.160> and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
item that would protect is my fury and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.699 
item that would protect is my fury and
that<00:02:52.610> actually<00:02:52.970> only<00:02:53.209> leaves<00:02:53.600> me<00:02:53.810> with<00:02:53.990> 400<00:02:54.530> k

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
that actually only leaves me with 400 k

that actually only leaves me with 400 k

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
it's not a calculated by jagex because

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.370 
it's not a calculated by jagex because
it's<00:03:10.310> just<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.700> malgam<00:03:11.180> ation<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.570> tons<00:03:12.230> of

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
it's just a malgam ation of tons of

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.130 
it's just a malgam ation of tons of
items<00:03:12.500> there<00:03:12.920> but<00:03:13.610> um<00:03:13.790> but<00:03:14.510> yeah<00:03:14.750> so<00:03:14.959> basically

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
items there but um but yeah so basically

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.440 
items there but um but yeah so basically
you're<00:03:15.920> actually<00:03:16.100> risking<00:03:16.730> realistically

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
you're actually risking realistically

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.300 
you're actually risking realistically
about<00:03:17.690> 1<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.140> 2<00:03:18.170> mil<00:03:18.500> at<00:03:18.650> least<00:03:18.830> that's<00:03:19.040> what<00:03:19.220> I

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
about 1 to 2 mil at least that's what I

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.910 
about 1 to 2 mil at least that's what I
was<00:03:19.489> risking<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.630> game<00:03:20.780> said<00:03:21.019> 400<00:03:21.470> k<00:03:21.650> but<00:03:21.830> I

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
was risking so the game said 400 k but I

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.530 
was risking so the game said 400 k but I
knew<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:22.100> was<00:03:22.220> risking<00:03:22.430> slayer<00:03:22.850> helmet<00:03:22.880> as<00:03:23.330> well

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
knew I was risking slayer helmet as well

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.380 
knew I was risking slayer helmet as well
which<00:03:24.440> costs<00:03:24.830> about<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:25.100> million<00:03:25.430> but<00:03:25.880> a<00:03:25.910> bit

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
which costs about a million but a bit

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.080 
which costs about a million but a bit
yeah<00:03:26.570> all<00:03:26.840> in<00:03:26.989> all<00:03:27.140> HR<00:03:27.860> it's<00:03:28.160> decent<00:03:28.430> at<00:03:28.850> least

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
yeah all in all HR it's decent at least

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.030 
yeah all in all HR it's decent at least
I<00:03:29.239> can<00:03:29.450> keep<00:03:29.750> all<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.230> same<00:03:30.440> gear<00:03:30.650> there<00:03:30.830> would

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
I can keep all the same gear there would

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.910 
I can keep all the same gear there would
normally<00:03:31.550> we're<00:03:31.760> doing<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.570> kbd<00:03:32.930> task<00:03:33.350> despite

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
normally we're doing a kbd task despite

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.560 
normally we're doing a kbd task despite
the<00:03:34.070> older<00:03:34.280> wilderness<00:03:34.580> thing<00:03:34.820> here<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.360> loss

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
the older wilderness thing here the loss

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.050 
the older wilderness thing here the loss
is<00:03:35.870> minimal<00:03:36.230> really<00:03:36.890> at<00:03:37.310> least<00:03:37.489> to<00:03:37.610> this<00:03:37.760> for

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
is minimal really at least to this for

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.449 
is minimal really at least to this for
me<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.390> hopefully<00:03:38.540> for<00:03:38.900> most<00:03:39.080> of<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.380> guys<00:03:39.459> if

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
me and hopefully for most of you guys if

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.370 
me and hopefully for most of you guys if
not<00:03:40.790> obviously<00:03:41.269> you<00:03:41.390> can<00:03:41.600> switch<00:03:41.870> some<00:03:42.080> items

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
not obviously you can switch some items

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.540 
not obviously you can switch some items
around<00:03:42.590> for<00:03:42.800> example<00:03:43.100> you<00:03:43.190> don't<00:03:43.340> have<00:03:43.430> to

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
around for example you don't have to

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.770 
around for example you don't have to
take<00:03:43.730> Barry<00:03:43.940> gloves<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.300> can<00:03:44.360> take<00:03:44.600> green

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
take Barry gloves you can take green

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.229 
take Barry gloves you can take green
gloves<00:03:45.050> they're<00:03:45.650> not<00:03:45.800> too<00:03:46.010> bad<00:03:46.250> obviously<00:03:47.150> you

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
gloves they're not too bad obviously you

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.729 
gloves they're not too bad obviously you
can<00:03:47.360> get<00:03:47.510> rid<00:03:47.630> of<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.870> dragon<00:03:48.350> boots<00:03:48.530> maybe

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
can get rid of the dragon boots maybe

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.110 
can get rid of the dragon boots maybe
wear<00:03:48.980> combat<00:03:49.220> boots<00:03:49.430> or<00:03:49.790> something<00:03:49.970> like<00:03:50.060> that

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
wear combat boots or something like that

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.020 
wear combat boots or something like that
and<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:51.590> slow<00:03:52.070> helmet<00:03:52.430> is<00:03:52.519> probably<00:03:52.820> your

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
and a slow helmet is probably your

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.000 
and a slow helmet is probably your
biggest<00:03:53.239> biggest<00:03:53.900> risk<00:03:54.290> because<00:03:54.860> they're

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
biggest biggest risk because they're

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.830 
biggest biggest risk because they're
really<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:55.400> should<00:03:55.580> be<00:03:55.730> slaying<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.180> kbd<00:03:56.630> and

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
really you should be slaying the kbd and

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.740 
really you should be slaying the kbd and
not<00:03:57.410> just<00:03:57.650> killing<00:03:57.890> it<00:03:58.070> normally<00:03:58.550> so<00:03:59.360> yeah

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
not just killing it normally so yeah

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.410 
not just killing it normally so yeah
that's<00:03:59.959> that's<00:04:00.350> my<00:04:00.530> gear<00:04:00.980> that's<00:04:01.310> my<00:04:01.610> familiar

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.800 
sure but it should still last you a
decent<00:04:48.260> amount<00:04:48.650> of<00:04:48.980> time<00:04:49.160> I<00:04:49.400> will<00:04:50.240> go<00:04:50.510> through

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
decent amount of time I will go through

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.690 
decent amount of time I will go through
other<00:04:51.020> setups<00:04:51.500> in<00:04:51.590> a<00:04:51.710> second<00:04:52.190> in<00:04:52.310> fact<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:52.639> think

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
other setups in a second in fact I think

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.159 
other setups in a second in fact I think
I've<00:04:53.000> said<00:04:53.210> everything<00:04:53.360> that<00:04:53.720> really<00:04:53.870> needs

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
yeah not actually let's talk about

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.290 
yeah not actually let's talk about
alternative<00:04:57.560> setups<00:04:57.919> now<00:04:58.430> I<00:04:58.460> realize<00:04:59.060> what<00:04:59.270> I

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
alternative setups now I realize what I

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.820 
alternative setups now I realize what I
got<00:04:59.540> here<00:04:59.750> that<00:04:59.900> banned<00:05:00.110> us<00:05:00.290> is<00:05:00.440> not<00:05:00.590> actually

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
got here that banned us is not actually

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.469 
got here that banned us is not actually
the<00:05:01.070> best<00:05:01.280> thing<00:05:01.460> you<00:05:01.639> can<00:05:01.729> take<00:05:01.940> you<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.270> best

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
the best thing you can take you the best

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.900 
the best thing you can take you the best
thing<00:05:02.660> to<00:05:02.780> take<00:05:02.960> is<00:05:03.110> actually<00:05:03.440> relax<00:05:03.910> the

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
thing to take is actually relax the

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.580 
thing to take is actually relax the
reason<00:05:05.240> behind<00:05:05.330> that<00:05:05.600> is<00:05:05.690> because<00:05:06.169> instead<00:05:06.530> of

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
reason behind that is because instead of

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.170 
reason behind that is because instead of
the<00:05:06.770> strength<00:05:07.010> bonus<00:05:07.400> you're<00:05:07.550> getting<00:05:07.880> prayer

bonus and prayer bonus when you have a
steel<00:05:10.340> title<00:05:10.790> is<00:05:10.940> much<00:05:11.360> more<00:05:11.570> valuable<00:05:11.990> but

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
steel title is much more valuable but

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.930 
steel title is much more valuable but
who<00:05:12.680> steal<00:05:12.919> title<00:05:13.340> means<00:05:13.520> you<00:05:13.610> don't<00:05:13.790> have<00:05:13.820> a

that you don't have extra pair pops and

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.760 
that you don't have extra pair pops and
you're<00:05:17.479> actually<00:05:17.600> restricting<00:05:18.290> yourself<00:05:18.380> to

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
you're actually restricting yourself to

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.400 
you're actually restricting yourself to
very<00:05:19.010> few<00:05:19.460> so<00:05:19.970> as<00:05:20.240> much<00:05:20.630> prayer<00:05:20.990> points<00:05:21.139> as<00:05:21.380> you

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
very few so as much prayer points as you

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.290 
very few so as much prayer points as you
save<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:21.950> bigger<00:05:22.190> your<00:05:22.370> prayer<00:05:22.610> bonuses<00:05:23.090> the

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
save the bigger your prayer bonuses the

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.980 
save the bigger your prayer bonuses the
better<00:05:23.540> so<00:05:24.320> I<00:05:24.350> would<00:05:25.240> decided<00:05:26.240> on<00:05:26.360> veut<00:05:26.510> axe<00:05:26.720> if

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
better so I would decided on veut axe if

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.659 
better so I would decided on veut axe if
I<00:05:27.139> had<00:05:27.260> thought<00:05:27.440> about<00:05:27.500> it<00:05:27.950> I<00:05:28.070> would<00:05:28.250> also<00:05:28.400> have

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
I had thought about it I would also have

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.310 
I had thought about it I would also have
taken<00:05:29.000> a<00:05:29.060> red<00:05:29.210> cape<00:05:29.419> instead<00:05:29.750> of<00:05:29.810> rd<00:05:30.110> cake

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
taken a red cape instead of rd cake

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.320 
taken a red cape instead of rd cake
those<00:05:30.979> are<00:05:31.160> the<00:05:31.190> only<00:05:31.370> three<00:05:31.640> chains<00:05:31.940> I<00:05:32.090> really

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
those are the only three chains I really

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.659 
those are the only three chains I really
would<00:05:32.479> have<00:05:32.539> made<00:05:32.750> um<00:05:33.020> if<00:05:33.919> I<00:05:34.190> taken<00:05:34.550> an

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
would have made um if I taken an

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.850 
would have made um if I taken an
alternate<00:05:35.240> set<00:05:35.510> up<00:05:35.720> it<00:05:36.260> would<00:05:36.500> have<00:05:36.620> been<00:05:36.710> I

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
alternate set up it would have been I

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.590 
alternate set up it would have been I
would<00:05:37.039> have<00:05:37.130> taken<00:05:37.280> yak<00:05:37.729> instead<00:05:38.180> obviously

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
would have taken yak instead obviously

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.330 
would have taken yak instead obviously
like<00:05:38.780> I<00:05:38.900> said<00:05:39.169> it<00:05:39.320> is<00:05:39.440> more<00:05:39.470> dangerous<00:05:39.860> taking

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
like I said it is more dangerous taking

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.980 
like I said it is more dangerous taking
a<00:05:40.430> yak<00:05:40.640> because<00:05:41.240> you<00:05:41.360> have<00:05:41.450> to<00:05:41.600> think<00:05:41.780> of<00:05:41.900> a

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
a yak because you have to think of a

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.050 
a yak because you have to think of a
different<00:05:42.020> way<00:05:42.410> to<00:05:42.470> get<00:05:42.710> kbd<00:05:43.400> layer<00:05:43.610> but

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
different way to get kbd layer but

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.940 
different way to get kbd layer but
obviously<00:05:44.180> bringing<00:05:44.720> a<00:05:44.870> yak<00:05:45.110> has<00:05:45.350> tons<00:05:45.740> and

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
obviously bringing a yak has tons and

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.650 
obviously bringing a yak has tons and
tons<00:05:46.130> of<00:05:46.310> benefits<00:05:46.729> firstly<00:05:47.180> you<00:05:47.300> have<00:05:47.330> more

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
tons of benefits firstly you have more

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.900 
tons of benefits firstly you have more
room<00:05:47.840> food<00:05:48.410> I'm<00:05:49.280> not<00:05:49.400> saying<00:05:49.669> that<00:05:49.700> you'll

crushed by the bone crusher and and yes

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.560 
crushed by the bone crusher and and yes
I'm<00:06:19.250> not<00:06:19.400> picking<00:06:19.610> anything<00:06:19.940> up<00:06:20.180> and<00:06:20.419> that's

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
I'm not picking anything up and that's

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.600 
I'm not picking anything up and that's
one<00:06:20.870> obvious<00:06:21.320> advantage<00:06:21.860> you<00:06:21.979> get<00:06:22.160> gives<00:06:22.430> you

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
one obvious advantage you get gives you

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.159 
one obvious advantage you get gives you
get<00:06:22.789> to<00:06:22.910> pick<00:06:23.060> those<00:06:23.210> items<00:06:23.450> up<00:06:23.780> send<00:06:24.050> them

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
get to pick those items up send them

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:27.070 
get to pick those items up send them
away<00:06:24.260> and<00:06:24.979> make<00:06:25.639> money<00:06:25.970> off<00:06:26.210> the<00:06:26.389> KBG<00:06:26.750> but

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
away and make money off the KBG but

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.990 
away and make money off the KBG but
ultimately<00:06:27.560> all<00:06:27.620> I<00:06:27.770> really<00:06:28.190> want<00:06:28.400> is<00:06:28.550> a<00:06:28.610> visage

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
ultimately all I really want is a visage

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.930 
ultimately all I really want is a visage
or<00:06:29.389> over<00:06:30.080> an<00:06:30.139> effigy<00:06:30.440> either<00:06:31.430> one<00:06:31.580> would<00:06:31.880> be

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
or over an effigy either one would be

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.529 
or over an effigy either one would be
fine<00:06:32.090> um<00:06:33.190> but<00:06:34.190> yeah<00:06:34.370> and<00:06:34.520> then<00:06:34.669> if<00:06:35.210> I<00:06:35.360> was

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:35.539 
fine um but yeah and then if I was

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:37.600 
fine um but yeah and then if I was
ringing<00:06:35.840> a<00:06:35.930> yak<00:06:36.110> I<00:06:36.380> would<00:06:36.979> probably<00:06:37.159> then

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
ringing a yak I would probably then

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.670 
ringing a yak I would probably then
stick<00:06:37.819> with<00:06:37.969> bandos<00:06:38.719> but<00:06:39.020> if<00:06:39.259> I'm<00:06:39.409> going<00:06:39.560> to<00:06:39.650> be

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
stick with bandos but if I'm going to be

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.439 
stick with bandos but if I'm going to be
using<00:06:39.860> steel<00:06:40.250> Titan<00:06:40.639> I<00:06:40.819> think<00:06:41.060> it<00:06:41.210> would<00:06:41.330> be

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
using steel Titan I think it would be

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:44.170 
using steel Titan I think it would be
best<00:06:41.629> to<00:06:41.900> go<00:06:42.259> with<00:06:42.439> ver<00:06:42.770> axe<00:06:42.949> another<00:06:43.939> option

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
best to go with ver axe another option

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.290 
best to go with ver axe another option
is<00:06:44.419> definitely<00:06:44.870> pros<00:06:45.110> light<00:06:45.469> if<00:06:46.189> you<00:06:47.120> have

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
is definitely pros light if you have

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.969 
is definitely pros light if you have
plenty<00:06:47.539> of<00:06:47.719> food<00:06:48.020> with<00:06:48.259> you<00:06:48.409> which<00:06:48.620> you<00:06:48.650> will

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:48.979 
plenty of food with you which you will

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.830 
plenty of food with you which you will
need<00:06:49.219> it<00:06:49.250> because<00:06:49.580> that<00:06:49.729> Mellie<00:06:50.180> damage<00:06:50.659> the

need it because that Mellie damage the
okay<00:06:51.110> BD<00:06:51.259> does<00:06:51.590> well<00:06:51.830> do<00:06:51.979> slightly<00:06:52.310> more

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 
okay BD does well do slightly more

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.339 
okay BD does well do slightly more
damage<00:06:53.030> if<00:06:53.150> you're<00:06:53.240> wearing<00:06:53.389> pearls<00:06:53.659> like<00:06:53.840> the

damage if you're wearing pearls like the
pro<00:06:54.590> site<00:06:54.800> is<00:06:54.949> actually<00:06:55.280> a<00:06:55.310> very<00:06:55.460> good<00:06:55.669> option

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:55.819 
pro site is actually a very good option

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:58.929 
pro site is actually a very good option
here<00:06:56.210> as<00:06:56.330> well<00:06:57.159> especially<00:06:58.159> seeing<00:06:58.669> is<00:06:58.909> that

00:06:58.929 --> 00:06:58.939 
here as well especially seeing is that

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:01.149 
here as well especially seeing is that
three-quarters<00:06:59.780> of<00:06:59.990> the<00:07:00.169> damage<00:07:00.530> the<00:07:00.680> kbd

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:01.159 
three-quarters of the damage the kbd

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:04.209 
three-quarters of the damage the kbd
does<00:07:01.430> can<00:07:01.669> either<00:07:01.879> be<00:07:02.030> a<00:07:02.060> you<00:07:02.930> know<00:07:03.050> negated<00:07:03.680> so

00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:04.219 
does can either be a you know negated so

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:08.230 
does can either be a you know negated so
for<00:07:04.430> example<00:07:04.460> the<00:07:05.150> fire<00:07:05.710> the<00:07:06.710> fire<00:07:06.740> attack<00:07:07.340> can

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 
for example the fire the fire attack can

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.600 
for example the fire the fire attack can
be<00:07:08.270> negated<00:07:08.629> by<00:07:08.930> the<00:07:08.990> super<00:07:09.379> anti<00:07:09.650> fire<00:07:09.889> but

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.610 
be negated by the super anti fire but

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.390 
be negated by the super anti fire but
I'm<00:07:10.759> but<00:07:11.090> yet<00:07:11.330> the<00:07:11.840> other<00:07:12.020> the<00:07:12.379> other<00:07:12.469> like<00:07:12.830> 75

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 
I'm but yet the other the other like 75

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.519 
I'm but yet the other the other like 75
percent<00:07:13.819> of<00:07:13.969> the<00:07:14.060> attacks<00:07:14.419> cannot<00:07:14.930> be<00:07:15.169> negated

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:15.529 
percent of the attacks cannot be negated

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:18.399 
percent of the attacks cannot be negated
at<00:07:15.919> all<00:07:16.189> for<00:07:17.060> example<00:07:17.569> the<00:07:17.840> people<00:07:18.169> used<00:07:18.349> to

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:18.409 
at all for example the people used to

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:20.140 
at all for example the people used to
think<00:07:18.500> they<00:07:18.770> were<00:07:18.800> range<00:07:19.189> a<00:07:19.400> major<00:07:19.610> tax<00:07:19.969> but

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.150 
think they were range a major tax but

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.360 
think they were range a major tax but
now<00:07:20.360> it's<00:07:20.569> being<00:07:20.900> shown<00:07:21.199> there<00:07:21.919> are<00:07:22.009> certain

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.370 
now it's being shown there are certain

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.429 
now it's being shown there are certain
not<00:07:22.729> major<00:07:23.029> major<00:07:23.330> tax<00:07:23.689> and<00:07:23.840> therefore<00:07:24.110> kirill

00:07:24.429 --> 00:07:24.439 
not major major tax and therefore kirill

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:26.890 
not major major tax and therefore kirill
has<00:07:24.740> no<00:07:24.979> effect<00:07:25.370> so<00:07:25.909> don't<00:07:26.270> bring<00:07:26.509> Kirill's

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 
has no effect so don't bring Kirill's

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.499 
has no effect so don't bring Kirill's
here<00:07:27.259> it's<00:07:27.500> just<00:07:27.620> useless<00:07:28.219> so<00:07:28.969> a<00:07:29.029> different

00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:29.509 
here it's just useless so a different

that's<00:07:33.319> all<00:07:33.560> I<00:07:33.620> really<00:07:33.860> have<00:07:34.009> to<00:07:34.129> say<00:07:34.279> I<00:07:34.759> guess

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479 
that's all I really have to say I guess

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:36.939 
that's all I really have to say I guess
the<00:07:35.659> last<00:07:35.810> thing<00:07:35.900> I'd<00:07:36.080> mention<00:07:36.439> is<00:07:36.560> if<00:07:36.680> I<00:07:36.800> was

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:36.949
