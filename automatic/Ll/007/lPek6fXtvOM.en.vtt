00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.900
 Hi everyone, I'm in the cold 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.910
 for last teams between italy and today i am 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.910
 here to bring you the plÃ©iade view of harry 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.280
 caine tops a player that I think is 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.040
 something fantastic and worthless 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.360
 surely all the credits here cost 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.910
 let's analyze immediately in the 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.950
 detail this card who passes by a 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.469
 68 of basic paper 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.530
 the first silver version of keane at a 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.540
 86 an absolutely fantastic greta app 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.579
 maybe one of the most upgraded cards to you 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.110
 of this to fifa the first 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.450
 feature I would like to talk about is 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.989
 speed is expressed with 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.449
 83 on paper and is divided into 85 of 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.670
 ready to snap and acceleration 79 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.840
 then the profile shot is definitely 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.549
 in fact three tests are good because 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.979
 with the first step or even lengthening 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.439
 the ball almost always went out to overtake 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.509
 defenders and get on them a 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.189
 great advantage so you can 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.929
 position for the best shot and a 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.959
 finalize the shot we will see a little 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:25.689
 next is that its fantastic 

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:27.729
 acceleration instead that would be the 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.770
 speed of the next steps 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.939
 I do not, however, put three against one 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.119
 it's nothing good 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.609
 in fact the famous lament 79 in the game e 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.099
 I must say that after a while it is done 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:40.840
 reach almost always but manages to 

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:44.259
 overcome this both with the advantage 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.630
 which has already obtained both before 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.549
 with that of hacking physical strength 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.509
 film also seems 90 who entered three 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:55.060
 pro and that manages to get him to hold the 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.789
 ball also under the attack of one or two 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.719
 defenders even as far as 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.869
 it's about dribbling 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:04.319
 we have an 86 on the card is an 84 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.639
 intervene pure in game 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.319
 then the tribune of this player 

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:11.590
 it is absolutely not bad though not 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.319
 urban heat lebron and 3 against why 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.109
 yes we have the dribbling that with the 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.139
 90 ball control is fantastic with 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:23.030
 the lever can overcome many times 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:25.639
 defenders though in tight dribbling 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.969
 also for that 82 life and the three 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:31.549
 skill stars both things against not 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:33.290
 many can be very fluid 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.930
 sometimes cumbersome then defenders 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.819
 they often develop ball when tried 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.290
 buy them with regards to the 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.359
 core the biggest as I said with the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.579
 wider ball control instead if the 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.980
 very good quarry 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.719
 let's move on to the shot that is definitely one 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.189
 of the peculiar characteristics of 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:52.280
 this card had no features 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:56.269
 best are the best we have 92 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.449
 on the card with 90 finalization 88 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.699
 of effect and power 97 pull values 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:05.030
 they are totally absurd 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:06.949
 just find it or just see them all 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.659
 the chips and I put you in the review 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.519
 to see how much his shot is 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.500
 devastating from any position and in 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:17.479
 any way even the header 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.030
 we have 99 even in a game with 87 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:22.549
 prominence he jumps very high and takes the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.759
 head ball and mine mines too 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.280
 head and pierce the goalkeeper something 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:30.500
 of totally absurd 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.569
 as regards penalties instead 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.689
 we have 90 paper too 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.939
 excellent and the long shot 92 I scored it 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:41.419
 a fantastic and external one as you will see 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:43.750
 in the clips also those are excellent i 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.379
 passages instead we have only 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.780
 only compared to the others 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.239
 features an 80 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.310
 the passage is a bit discordant indeed 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.459
 we only have a 57 passing through 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.919
 long which is not very good not 88 of 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.750
 cultured passage is a 92 my division 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:02.719
 passing courts as he said this is the 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.120
 feature they are good they are great 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:07.620
 while passages a little less though 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.450
 as I always say in my reviews 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.890
 attackers of these with these 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.870
 features do not have to perform 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.150
 passages but simply position yourself 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.699
 well and receive them precisely on 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.070
 positioning and 92 also those 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.930
 excellent with average wordpress he 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.750
 always manages to fit behind 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.510
 of defenders is always ahead and does 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.470
 let's say his work for how long 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.720
 regards the physical we have instead 90 of 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.979
 it was also that until the end 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.600
 match he manages to stay rested 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.510
 in quotation marks even if it is not the one 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.220
 exact term and in any case will be the least 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.080
 tired of the team also 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.500
 opponents managed to assert his 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.930
 speed that is already mentioned above 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.479
 we also have a balancing 88 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.449
 he always stands up to his shoulders 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.550
 it does not fall so this is also a very good one 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.380
 feature 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.610
 then let's summarize the pros and cons 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.590
 against this player 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.169
 3 pro we find the sprinter shooting 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.360
 I take the physical strength the stamina and the 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.150
 header while 3 against we had to 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.729
 agility and the three stars these skills 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.500
 there were two last features 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.090
 had been a little better 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.880
 they would surely have made a player 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.550
 even more fantastic than it is though 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.039
 in short, as far as with his own 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.039
 definitely worth all the 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.760
 vote that I give it to you which is a 9 because if 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.010
 try it 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.919
 I assure you that he remains amazed 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.599
 how it happened to me then for this 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.370
 review everything if you liked left 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.320
 I like a comment and sign up if 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.099
 you have not already done so free from all 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.639
 to the next 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.639
 Hi everyone
