00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 and I say I'm completely fed up with that 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.240
 this damn brand I want to see the face 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.980
 have two of these discs that I know 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.460
 break down one burned me 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.200
 practically after eight months of use, 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.990
 completely froze I'm going to get them done 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.520
 valid stated that yes in what is the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.650
 page of adata is a data of s 510 and 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.170
 mails sent countless emails the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.689
 gentlemen never answer me on the page 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.269
 from facebook they ignore me completely and 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.009
 I decided to go to the store and of course 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.590
 yes after having stolen a good 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.780
 while the boy with everything and the guarantee is 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.120
 that my aunt of change did it to me and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.489
 it turns out that after six months later 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.590
 this crap again fails me like this 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.840
 I'm tired of us because I 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.030
 want to see the face is a company that 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.059
 the service is very bad 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.489
 technical support you can go to your 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.800
 Facebook page and you are really going to see 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.559
 all complaints there is a dss of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.989
 one is satisfied or is not believing that 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.940
 will have a better performance with your with 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.559
 your computer and they are fast and in fact 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.079
 yes it was very good 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.020
 pretty bad and it's practically 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:12.780
 impossible in less than a year and a half 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.820
 have fucked up two of these do not 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.310
 he even demanded nothing more for me 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.560
 operating system for my games that 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.149
 the claimant has that nothing the source 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.920
 of power is fine everything is fine 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.240
 go for a walk around that page 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.070
 from facebook see how they are doing 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.140
 commenting and I for my part for 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.479
 we for our part will 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.630
 We recommend never buying a product 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.270
 of adata or memories or discs 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.569
 nothing nothing, nothing nothing is 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.920
 really disastrous as they treat us to 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.530
 one and the good thing is that we can 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.539
 do this and to prove my 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.170
 nonconformity and good except that I'm 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:51.000
 because I'm raging with anger 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.280
 so let's make a small or a 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.720
 small home experiment we are not going to 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.400
 see how tough this thing is 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.850
 we are going to 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.440
 to say goodbye to her as I think the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.940
 most of our customers that we 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.120
 has failed we have had some problem 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.540
 they treat us so let's see what 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.540
 happen here 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.790
 Well, really if you can take a city 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.510
 to want to enter more 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.330
 or what if we are what we all did to 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.240
 nothing more common with an east with a 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.460
 clavito let's do it I say my hammer 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.130
 it's not intimidating at all like you 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.370
 they will see is not at all intimidating 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.260
 so see why we do it with the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.260
 little ball what do you think 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.460
 i 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.850
 what brings me to hell with this 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.850
 damn 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.960
 if who carries the scrub 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.830
 so 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.220
 let's see this 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.140
 to see what the inmates keep in the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:27.420
 inner part of this from the apparatus 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.610
 very sensitive truth let's see I think 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.390
 it would be easier to have said 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.769
 removed its screws but I think that 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.640
 I'm feeling like I'm opening 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.640
 a tin 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.680
 of sardines 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.209
 we have to enter another level 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.340
 11 this has to be completely 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.340
 protected to avoid those failures 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.849
 failures 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.060
 how curious I think that is your problem 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.810
 if here is the problem the problem is 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.670
 that you customer the problem is that 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.810
 this client decided to buy a 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.810
 crap of this 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.290
 but 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.740
 not because we do not prepare something like that 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.620
 says that in the kitchen 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.520
 It must have something of 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.520
 of arvor 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.700
 not clear that there must be a 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.060
 extraordinary 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.030
 momentito I'm looking for something must 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.280
 to be or not when it is 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.650
 cooking with the data I had should 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.469
 have this a little taste of all this 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.750
 out must have its purpose that heat 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:56.370
 Latin that one that should not be 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.370
 having always not 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.290
 then to add the little city 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.870
 does not catch anything this stupidity if you see 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.090
 and goodbye to see a little bit 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.660
 muÃ±oz 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.240
 l 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:53.400
 to 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:53.400
 and this is quite interesting 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.120
 it's a catharsis and this is a true 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.570
 catharsis for me I feel very happy 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.570
 in doing it 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:09.210
 and I think it would be very unpleasant for 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:11.340
 the readers so guys if in some 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.229
 moment you have tried it says for 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.620
 this brand because he really has with 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:19.630
 this very cheap prices 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.040
 do not do it, do not really do it because 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.660
 I tell them it's not fair that they mistreat us 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.010
 towards the customers how good that 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.410
 we as customers have the 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.419
 right to decide what we can and what 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.030
 We can not buy with our money and 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.800
 so, good as a client, I'm going to 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.620
 recommend to all possible clients 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.660
 that are seeing this that they do not buy that 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.729
 do not invest my gaze on this in this 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.270
 brand so guys 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:47.270
 It was not so hot without alcohol 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.270
 but 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:53.240
 do not buy anything until you guys 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:55.039
 until then they say goodbye and support and the 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:00.159
 poor thing of gabi that is more nervous 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:07:00.159
 that nobody so see you later 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.870
 Oh
