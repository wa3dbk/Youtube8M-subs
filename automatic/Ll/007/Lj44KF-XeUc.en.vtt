to<00:02:12.489> start<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:12.970> then<00:02:13.060> walks<00:02:13.269> up<00:02:13.480> on<00:02:13.630> the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
to start and then walks up on the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.180 
to start and then walks up on the
approach<00:02:14.019> I<00:02:14.320> don't<00:02:14.560> think<00:02:14.709> his<00:02:14.800> wife<00:02:14.950> Leslie

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
approach I don't think his wife Leslie

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.280 
approach I don't think his wife Leslie
is<00:02:15.430> nervous<00:02:15.730> right<00:02:15.880> now<00:02:15.940> but<00:02:16.300> maybe<00:02:16.810> maybe

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
is nervous right now but maybe maybe

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.900 
is nervous right now but maybe maybe
John<00:02:17.590> still<00:02:17.860> is

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
as we can see this would be the first

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.800 
as we can see this would be the first
shot<00:02:26.890> where<00:02:27.370> he<00:02:27.460> left<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.880> five<00:02:28.150> pin<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.450> just
