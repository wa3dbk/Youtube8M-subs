should go and do that for the X 2010 the
so<00:00:16.949> called<00:00:17.190> slower<00:00:17.550> version<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.180> Red<00:00:18.330> Bull

so called slower version of the Red Bull
car<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.710> video<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.039> show<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.250> how<00:00:20.369> to

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
car and in that video I show you how to

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.390 
car and in that video I show you how to
make<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:21.000> version<00:00:21.359> do<00:00:21.710> 325<00:00:22.710> miles<00:00:23.010> per<00:00:23.279> hour

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
make that version do 325 miles per hour

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
make that version do 325 miles per hour
now<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.539> version<00:00:24.920> I've<00:00:25.920> bought<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.420> 2011

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
now this version I've bought the 2011

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.040 
now this version I've bought the 2011
the<00:00:28.109> export<00:00:28.640> export<00:00:29.640> from<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> Red<00:00:30.269> Bull<00:00:30.510> x1

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the export export from the Red Bull x1

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.620 
the export export from the Red Bull x1
2011<00:00:31.820> which<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.149> faster<00:00:33.690> version<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:35.630> so

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
2011 which is the faster version and so

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.819 
2011 which is the faster version and so
far<00:00:36.960> I've<00:00:37.200> managed<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.559> get<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.860> car<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.280> do

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
far I've managed to get this car to do

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.250 
far I've managed to get this car to do
335<00:00:40.829> miles<00:00:41.160> per<00:00:41.489> hour<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.420> know<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.140> do

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
335 miles per hour now I know it can do

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.030 
335 miles per hour now I know it can do
more<00:00:43.469> than<00:00:43.649> that

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
more than that

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.910 
more than that
I<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.670> haven't<00:00:44.910> tweaked<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.870> enough<00:00:46.170> yet<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
I just haven't tweaked it enough yet to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.869 
I just haven't tweaked it enough yet to
get<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.370> fast<00:00:48.649> but<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.160> video<00:00:50.399> I'll

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
get it that fast but in this video I'll

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.670 
get it that fast but in this video I'll
show<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.180> how<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.570> make<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.590> X<00:00:52.739> 2011<00:00:53.489> do<00:00:54.680> 335

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
show you how to make the X 2011 do 335

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.459 
show you how to make the X 2011 do 335
miles<00:00:55.949> per<00:00:56.250> hour<00:00:56.340> as<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.480> see<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.960> fifth

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
miles per hour as you can see in fifth

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.240 
miles per hour as you can see in fifth
gear<00:01:00.829> this<00:01:02.210> tune<00:01:03.210> setup<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.199> fast<00:01:04.739> enough<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
gear this tune setup is fast enough to

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.120 
gear this tune setup is fast enough to
give<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.909> lot<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.479> special<00:01:07.439> stage<00:01:07.619> root<00:01:07.890> X

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
give you a lot of special stage root X

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.230 
give you a lot of special stage root X
in<00:01:09.380> about<00:01:10.380> 3<00:01:10.619> minutes<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.010> 20<00:01:11.340> seconds<00:01:11.790> so

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
in about 3 minutes and 20 seconds so

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.880 
in about 3 minutes and 20 seconds so
it's<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> best<00:01:12.750> part<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.080> 10<00:01:13.260> seconds<00:01:13.680> quicker

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
it's the best part of 10 seconds quicker

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.200 
it's the best part of 10 seconds quicker
than<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> 2010<00:01:15.119> version<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:20.119> after<00:01:21.119> I've

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
than the 2010 version and after I've

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.140 
than the 2010 version and after I've
just<00:01:21.390> showed<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.430> speed<00:01:23.430> run<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.909> will

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
just showed you this speed run I will

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.570 
just showed you this speed run I will
show<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.420> how<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.659> set<00:01:24.990> up<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.229> car

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.490 

obviously<00:01:30.480> it's<00:01:30.600> slightly<00:01:30.840> quickly<00:01:31.260> going

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
obviously it's slightly quickly going

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.010 
obviously it's slightly quickly going
downhill<00:01:31.730> but<00:01:32.730> on<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.330> straights<00:01:33.690> it

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
downhill but on the straights it

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.140 
downhill but on the straights it
maintains<00:01:35.090> 335<00:01:36.090> quite<00:01:36.420> easily<00:01:36.660> so<00:01:37.940> now<00:01:38.940> I've

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
maintains 335 quite easily so now I've

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.690 
maintains 335 quite easily so now I've
showed<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.080> I'll<00:01:40.560> show<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.010> how<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.400> set

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
showed you that I'll show you how to set

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.450 
showed you that I'll show you how to set
up<00:01:41.730> the<00:01:41.940> car<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.540> make<00:01:42.690> it<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:42.990> that

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.590 

okay<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.230> car<00:01:49.230> settings<00:01:49.670> now<00:01:50.670> I've<00:01:51.030> got<00:01:51.240> racing

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
okay so car settings now I've got racing

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.720 
okay so car settings now I've got racing
soft<00:01:51.840> tires<00:01:52.110> set<00:01:52.410> on<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.160> may<00:01:53.310> not

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
soft tires set on this one you may not

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.260 
soft tires set on this one you may not
want<00:01:53.940> those<00:01:54.120> you<00:01:54.480> know<00:01:54.600> your<00:01:55.320> choice<00:01:56.270> for

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
want those you know your choice for

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.640 
want those you know your choice for
suspension<00:01:59.540> I've<00:02:00.540> done<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> couple<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.350> tweaks

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
suspension I've done a couple of tweaks

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.070 
suspension I've done a couple of tweaks
on<00:02:01.950> mine<00:02:02.190> but<00:02:02.520> nothing<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.570> important

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
on mine but nothing that important

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.790 
on mine but nothing that important
really<00:02:04.380> I've<00:02:04.710> set<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.220> spring<00:02:05.610> rate<00:02:06.800> point

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
really I've set the spring rate point

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.600 
really I've set the spring rate point
zero<00:02:08.100> one<00:02:08.460> higher<00:02:08.730> on<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.060> front<00:02:10.250> my<00:02:11.250> camber

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
zero one higher on the front my camber

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.250 
zero one higher on the front my camber
angles<00:02:11.910> are<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.180> point<00:02:12.360> five<00:02:12.630> front<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.080> rear

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
angles are on point five front and rear

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.840 
angles are on point five front and rear
and<00:02:13.470> I've<00:02:13.530> got<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.740> toe<00:02:13.950> angle<00:02:14.340> completely

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
and I've got the toe angle completely

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.090 
and I've got the toe angle completely
neutral<00:02:15.390> but<00:02:15.840> that's<00:02:16.260> personal<00:02:16.680> choice

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
neutral but that's personal choice

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.450 
neutral but that's personal choice
that's<00:02:17.400> more<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.180> steering<00:02:18.450> than<00:02:18.810> speed<00:02:19.460> now

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
that's more for steering than speed now

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.890 
that's more for steering than speed now
for<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.700> important<00:02:21.060> part<00:02:21.270> for<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.510> gear<00:02:21.720> and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
for the important part for the gear and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.570 
for the important part for the gear and
you<00:02:21.960> want<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.170> set<00:02:22.350> your<00:02:22.500> auto<00:02:22.830> settings<00:02:23.400> on

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
you want to set your auto settings on

that's<00:02:30.090> exactly<00:02:30.930> -<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:32.160> basically<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.330> want

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
that's exactly - and basically you want

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.940 
that's exactly - and basically you want
to<00:02:33.540> put<00:02:33.660> all<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.840> your<00:02:33.989> gears<00:02:34.410> all<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.770> way<00:02:34.890> to

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
to put all of your gears all the way to

to put all of your gears all the way to
the<00:02:35.220> left<00:02:35.459> which<00:02:35.850> makes<00:02:36.090> them<00:02:36.270> as<00:02:36.450> long<00:02:36.630> as

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
possible now I know this is a pretty

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.500 
possible now I know this is a pretty
primitive<00:02:38.670> way<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.150> tuning<00:02:41.150> but<00:02:42.150> there<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.390> go

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
primitive way of tuning but there you go

primitive way of tuning but there you go
it's<00:02:42.690> it's<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.800> best<00:02:44.010> all-around<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.520> I've

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
it's it's the best all-around that I've

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.520 
it's it's the best all-around that I've
found<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.030> far<00:02:45.270> I'm<00:02:45.540> gonna<00:02:45.750> keep<00:02:46.050> trying<00:02:46.260> to

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
found so far I'm gonna keep trying to

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.949 
found so far I'm gonna keep trying to
tweak<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.890> better<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:48.450> will<00:02:48.570> do<00:02:48.720> for<00:02:48.870> the

tweak it better but this will do for the

tweak it better but this will do for the
moment<00:02:53.420> as<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.600> can<00:02:54.750> see<00:02:54.930> mines<00:02:55.230> run<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:56.300> 1634
