00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.990
 show you and across the tap 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.620
 how are you? 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.719
 from the last issue they understood that instead 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.880
 no fig made such a sample first 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.730
 This Kalinowski more precisely half from 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.300
 Kalin's thermostat here is a stub 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.000
 metal with a rubber band 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.630
 it would seem like everything is fine but everything 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.570
 did not show early that the place is too small 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.030
 made from the same Kalinowski cut 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.020
 really wanted to brew but then not 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.090
 the idea was born to make eight take 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:50.610
 eight tee cut stub 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.379
 if you can see brewed crimped that is 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.949
 nothing crush nothing day ooze 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:02.149
 and all here it will all be screwed 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:04.680
 more precisely, that is, as if everything will be fine and 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.040
 About this sensor here many 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.510
 talk about twisting put stubs 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.920
 it also carries other so decided 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.549
 act a little differently 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:19.470
 stubs just hotel sawed off the excess 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:22.820
 old sensor tightened everything is fine and 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.340
 will you still mix in there 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.850
 so the head was collected only 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.610
 put well and now salon 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.580
 going on 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:38.560
 find rot destroying 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:44.360
 could have cut the cavity of the metal 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.790
 rotted under the jack Nick will 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:59.710
 put the tray put one boat on 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:59.710
 bottom and made sweet here did 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.130
 strengthen leave so many were 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.030
 small holes 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.900
 here around the edges of me lovato and decided 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.080
 change has changed with Makar about poison 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.940
 everything should be ok and everything 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.810
 I will clean it to go to the bag 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.709
 gain here here and here it is 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.060
 we over time 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.070
 first I will do the floors and boil it 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.209
 the central beam of what is already there 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.290
 cracks from my pile sideways in the area 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.049
 longitudinal trap 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.170
 here they are crack until 2 found here 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:42.350
 somewhere here is one of that side one 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.220
 crack here in the whole bottom in good 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.200
 condition 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:52.430
 a and steering collected 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:58.340
 Gathered a pretty clear example of what 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:00.530
 I can make my kardanchika system will 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.150
 redid this i don't like it 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:09.019
 kopek column decided to do type under 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.260
 height adjustment but since metal 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.260
 too thin she bends can even 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
 to demonstrate 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:23.080
 what can you generally lower down well this is not 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.420
 the business is unsafe to anyone there for advice 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.820
 what I will bet I don't want to bet 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.420
 through real 9 10 tires and steering 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.730
 speakers 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:38.290
 as they look so let's say I will put 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.470
 the same thing only from the sevens myself 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.459
 the binoculars that is under the drupal there yet 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:49.720
 I will pick up the shaft here 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:53.620
 there is a redistribution system latitude again 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.680
 it will be like too much already 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.720
 corners will take here these people date 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.010
 cross-piece which is liquid but donâ€™t understand 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:06.130
 that which hand bends easily that is 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.790
 cooked in those places extra to 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.959
 bag but I do not know yet sawing or 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.239
 leave so easy to scald well 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.560
 corner to corner and it will be creepy something that is not 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.320
 I would like to do and 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:25.419
 kolkhoz panel mount to this 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:28.180
 everything would not be reliable that is decided 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:32.979
 do everything as possible factory 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.760
 just strengthen these places and yes here with 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.150
 how much effort 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:41.430
 steering with one hand is easy 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.430
 about a friend 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.340
 only beating basket-it 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:54.180
 it should just be entered 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:05:02.090
 make it harder to seal here and there will be 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:02.090
 okay, bye everyone wait for new entries
