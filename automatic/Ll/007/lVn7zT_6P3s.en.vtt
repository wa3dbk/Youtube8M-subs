score<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.740> here<00:01:52.740> kind<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.640> scoring<00:01:54.030> system

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
score is here kind of a scoring system

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.910 
score is here kind of a scoring system
it's<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.600> note<00:01:54.780> one<00:01:54.990> two<00:01:55.200> or<00:01:55.380> three<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.799> these

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it's you note one two or three of these

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.330 
it's you note one two or three of these
the<00:01:56.670> little<00:01:57.030> dots<00:01:57.329> right<00:01:58.170> now<00:01:58.409> there's<00:01:58.860> not

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the little dots right now there's not

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.429 
the little dots right now there's not
integration<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.299> there<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> good<00:02:01.020> planned

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
integration but there is a good planned

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.109 
integration but there is a good planned
update<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.130> integrate<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.520> application

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
update to integrate this application

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.149 
update to integrate this application
into<00:02:03.329> Game<00:02:03.509> Center<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.799> create<00:02:05.009> an

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
into Game Center and to create an

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.459 
into Game Center and to create an
achievement<00:02:05.490> section<00:02:06.090> which<00:02:06.899> will<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.170> really

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
achievement section which will be really

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.979 
achievement section which will be really
convenient<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.160> think<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:09.300> as<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.479> see<00:02:09.660> even<00:02:09.899> in

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
convenient I think so as you see even in

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.710 
convenient I think so as you see even in
the<00:02:10.080> easy<00:02:10.289> section<00:02:10.770> as<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.190> move<00:02:11.400> along<00:02:11.720> these

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the easy section as you move along these

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.900 
the easy section as you move along these
get<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> little<00:02:13.440> more

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
get a little more

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.350 
get a little more
cold<00:02:14.060> now<00:02:14.450> there<00:02:14.630> are<00:02:14.660> these<00:02:15.430> pieces<00:02:16.430> these

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
cold now there are these pieces these

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.750 
cold now there are these pieces these
ones<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.690> have<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.810> red<00:02:18.080> valve<00:02:18.980> on<00:02:19.310> them<00:02:19.550> and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
ones that have the red valve on them and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.940 
ones that have the red valve on them and
the<00:02:19.940> goal<00:02:20.300> with<00:02:20.540> those<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:21.200> that<00:02:21.830> they

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
the goal with those is that they

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.040 
the goal with those is that they
actually<00:02:22.190> close<00:02:22.730> off<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.180> end<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.480> pipes<00:02:23.750> so

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
actually close off the end of pipes so

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.470 
actually close off the end of pipes so
even<00:02:24.320> if<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.590> is<00:02:24.770> their<00:02:25.040> exposed<00:02:25.730> meaning

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
even if that is their exposed meaning

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.240 
even if that is their exposed meaning
it's<00:02:26.570> not<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.780> closed<00:02:27.050> circuit<00:02:27.350> anymore<00:02:27.680> it's

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
it's not a closed circuit anymore it's

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.250 
it's not a closed circuit anymore it's
fine<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:28.970> going<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.210> work<00:02:29.420> just<00:02:29.780> fine<00:02:30.020> and

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
fine it's going to work just fine and

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.380 
fine it's going to work just fine and
that's<00:02:30.410> how<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:30.650> kind<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.160> progress<00:02:31.390> through

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
that's how you kind of progress through

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.470 
that's how you kind of progress through
what<00:02:32.420> you're<00:02:32.810> doing<00:02:33.320> now<00:02:34.090> again<00:02:35.090> does<00:02:35.270> keep

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
what you're doing now again does keep

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.700 
what you're doing now again does keep
track<00:02:35.750> you're<00:02:35.900> going<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.110> have<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> scoring

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
track you're going to have a scoring

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.910 
track you're going to have a scoring
here<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:38.480> game<00:02:38.780> gets<00:02:39.020> super<00:02:39.530> super

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
here and this game gets super super

difficult<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.580> challenging<00:02:40.960> something<00:02:41.960> kind

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
difficult and challenging something kind

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.450 
difficult and challenging something kind
of<00:02:42.140> cool<00:02:42.320> we<00:02:42.470> were<00:02:42.590> reading<00:02:42.740> about<00:02:42.920> this<00:02:43.250> on

of cool we were reading about this on

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.160 
of cool we were reading about this on
the<00:02:43.730> site<00:02:44.120> for<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.420> application<00:02:44.840> the

the site for the application the

the site for the application the
description<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:46.220> developer<00:02:46.580> actually<00:02:47.030> goes

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
description the developer actually goes

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.630 
description the developer actually goes
it<00:02:47.420> in<00:02:47.510> hand<00:02:47.930> makes<00:02:48.500> these<00:02:48.800> he's<00:02:49.070> not<00:02:49.220> using<00:02:49.430> a

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
it in hand makes these he's not using a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.030 
it in hand makes these he's not using a
randomizer<00:02:50.240> or<00:02:51.020> any<00:02:51.230> other<00:02:51.380> kind<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:52.010> know

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
randomizer or any other kind of you know

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.460 
randomizer or any other kind of you know
cheat<00:02:52.490> they're<00:02:53.240> actually<00:02:53.900> going<00:02:54.080> in<00:02:54.320> and

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
cheat they're actually going in and

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.730 
cheat they're actually going in and
creating<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.160> these<00:02:55.310> levels<00:02:56.740> originally

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
creating to these levels originally

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.590 
creating to these levels originally
which<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.040> nice<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:58.670> think<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:58.910> adds<00:02:59.210> a<00:02:59.390> lot<00:02:59.540> to

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
which is nice I think that adds a lot to

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.770 
which is nice I think that adds a lot to
the<00:02:59.870> game<00:03:00.800> play<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:01.790> development<00:03:02.630> because

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
the game play and development because

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.170 
the game play and development because
they're<00:03:02.960> not<00:03:03.170> just<00:03:04.210> you<00:03:05.210> know<00:03:05.270> dealing<00:03:05.990> with

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
they're not just you know dealing with

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.210 
they're not just you know dealing with
randomized<00:03:08.180> kind<00:03:08.570> of<00:03:08.690> stuff<00:03:09.380> let<00:03:09.950> me<00:03:09.980> go<00:03:10.040> ahead

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
randomized kind of stuff let me go ahead

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.280 
randomized kind of stuff let me go ahead
and<00:03:10.310> show<00:03:10.430> you<00:03:10.580> guys<00:03:10.670> in<00:03:11.000> medium<00:03:11.360> one<00:03:11.840> they<00:03:12.110> get

and show you guys in medium one they get
a<00:03:12.320> little<00:03:12.500> bit<00:03:12.650> bigger<00:03:12.940> this<00:03:13.940> is<00:03:14.060> an<00:03:14.150> example

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
a little bit bigger this is an example

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.060 
a little bit bigger this is an example
of<00:03:14.690> ones<00:03:14.900> I've<00:03:15.110> already<00:03:15.260> come<00:03:15.470> in<00:03:15.590> working<00:03:15.920> on

the<00:03:16.250> good<00:03:16.430> thing<00:03:16.640> about<00:03:16.670> these<00:03:17.030> that<00:03:17.330> it<00:03:17.450> saves

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
the good thing about these that it saves

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.890 
the good thing about these that it saves
