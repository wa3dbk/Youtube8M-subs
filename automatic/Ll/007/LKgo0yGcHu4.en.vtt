00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
throw that aside this is a nice charger

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.520 
throw that aside this is a nice charger
let's<00:01:43.780> see<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:46.210> there's<00:01:46.450> no<00:01:46.630> fast<00:01:46.990> charging<00:01:47.320> on

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
let's see so there's no fast charging on

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.719 
let's see so there's no fast charging on
here<00:01:48.150> but<00:01:49.150> it's<00:01:49.510> a<00:01:49.690> 2<00:01:49.960> amp<00:01:50.370> regular<00:01:51.370> charger

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
here but it's a 2 amp regular charger

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.510 
here but it's a 2 amp regular charger
which<00:01:52.479> is<00:01:52.510> nice<00:01:52.870> so<00:01:53.380> it's<00:01:53.530> a<00:01:53.620> regular<00:01:53.770> USB<00:01:54.280> on

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
which is nice so it's a regular USB on

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.719 
which is nice so it's a regular USB on
one<00:01:54.670> side<00:01:54.940> USBC<00:01:55.840> on<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.260> other<00:01:56.410> but<00:01:57.370> it's<00:01:57.460> USB

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
one side USBC on the other but it's USB

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.810 
one side USBC on the other but it's USB
2<00:01:58.240> in<00:01:58.710> actual<00:01:59.710> speeds<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:00.400> this<00:02:00.550> isn't<00:02:00.729> going

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
2 in actual speeds so this isn't going

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.210 
2 in actual speeds so this isn't going
to<00:02:00.910> give<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.120> anything<00:02:01.710> faster<00:02:02.710> than<00:02:02.920> what

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
to give you anything faster than what

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.890 
to give you anything faster than what
you<00:02:03.340> would<00:02:03.430> get<00:02:03.640> on<00:02:03.910> any<00:02:04.240> other<00:02:04.420> phone<00:02:04.660> is<00:02:04.780> just

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
you would get on any other phone is just

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.160 
you would get on any other phone is just
reversible<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.360> reportedly<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.660> bit<00:02:07.930> more

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
reversible and reportedly a bit more

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.620 
reversible and reportedly a bit more
durable<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:09.060> whatever<00:02:10.060> let's<00:02:10.929> check<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.230> out

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
durable so whatever let's check it out

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.390 
durable so whatever let's check it out
the<00:02:13.630> phone<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.700> we<00:02:15.730> have<00:02:16.239> what<00:02:16.630> looks<00:02:16.660> like<00:02:16.959> a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
fingerprint sensor there you go on the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.650 
fingerprint sensor there you go on the
back<00:02:26.709> this<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.580> same<00:02:27.820> sandstone<00:02:28.420> black

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.430 
you remember from the last one the
camera<00:02:42.850> is<00:02:42.880> actually<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.540> little<00:02:43.750> bit<00:02:44.019> south

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
camera is actually a little bit south

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.590 
camera is actually a little bit south
and<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.370> may<00:02:45.550> be<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.940> prevent<00:02:46.269> people<00:02:46.570> from

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
and that may be to prevent people from

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.210 
and that may be to prevent people from
covering<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.260> up<00:02:47.350> when<00:02:47.590> they<00:02:47.680> hold<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.040> from

almost<00:02:56.950> like<00:02:57.130> sandpaper<00:02:59.880> on<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.420> side<00:03:01.690> we

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
almost like sandpaper on the side we

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.280 
almost like sandpaper on the side we
have<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.200> power<00:03:02.680> button<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:05.170> volume

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
button and this mute switch which is

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.310 
button and this mute switch which is
cool<00:03:09.459> because<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.910> actually<00:03:10.570> emulates

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
cool because it actually emulates

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.550 
cool because it actually emulates
lollipops<00:03:12.160> native<00:03:12.670> all<00:03:13.590> priority<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.800> none

where is the back cover there we go

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:43.940 
where is the back cover there we go
let's<00:03:34.530> see<00:03:34.680> how<00:03:34.770> easy<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.310> open<00:03:42.560> well<00:03:43.560> it

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
let's see how easy it is to open well it
