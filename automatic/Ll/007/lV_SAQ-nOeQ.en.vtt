00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.630
 offended by keywords or another 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.229
 he knows that a few small 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.810
 to cut each other 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.900

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.560
 it is not very difficult to live with these two points 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.620
