 provision of all voili voilou so 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.820
 for example 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:04.330
 for example I had not seen a chuck 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:06.009
 norris there is chuck norris here and code 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.770
 is there then you say how do we do 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:12.460
 well listened to everything and marc ela so there 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.689
 with google chrome could translate that 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:24.009
 would give this is actually all 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:26.170
 simply we will already go on me 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.439
 i like ubf 4 here we can customize 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.319
 the emblem here you create a new 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.429
 emblem so just had to add if 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.590
 you are premium you have the right to 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:38.259
 40 layers if you are not you have 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.780
 the right for example to 20 strokes and he 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.310
 is indicated on the site 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.090
 the images that are premium and those 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.700
 who are not for ease 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.600
 there we just have to copy the code and if we 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.920
 is under chrome 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.950
 we had this business control shift j 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.069
 on firefox control figure that opera 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.530
 thing thing and 12 for nothing internet 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.149
 to explore simply that's fine 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.959
 open the console so we will make a 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.959
 small copy 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.250
 now we do a little check 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.660
 shift and j since we are under google 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.870
 chromium 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.900
 we normally arrive here in elements 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.450
 and you go directly to the console 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.230
 on the console you do a lil 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:30.140
 copy paste so I count up and 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.070
 we manage to copy all the code code that 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.400
 is between here and here 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.320
 you press entry alas chuck 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.270

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.800
 say it's magic and you come from 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:51.440
 copy an emblem obviously all 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:54.170

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.850
 diapers and dudes 6 to go hungry 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.640

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.209
