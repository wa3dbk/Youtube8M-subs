11 this is kind of an awkward thing

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.529 
11 this is kind of an awkward thing
because<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.580> know<00:00:29.699> fat<00:00:29.940> people<00:00:30.240> normally

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
because you know fat people normally

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.670 
because you know fat people normally
don't<00:00:30.690> like<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.930> run<00:00:31.110> and<00:00:31.260> play<00:00:31.289> soccer

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
don't like to run and play soccer

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.380 
don't like to run and play soccer
because<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.550> lot<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.910> exercise

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
because it's just a lot of exercise

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.080 
because it's just a lot of exercise
here's<00:00:33.660> they<00:00:33.780> waste<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> ball<00:00:34.670> but<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.730> find

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
here's they waste the ball but I find

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.939 
here's they waste the ball but I find
myself<00:00:36.270> playing<00:00:36.629> fifa<00:00:37.109> 10<00:00:37.260> all<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> time<00:00:37.739> and

I<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:38.789> it<00:00:38.909> is<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.149> because<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.859> fatigue<00:00:40.859> for

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:41.249
