description of the videos to where you
can<00:00:15.870> pick<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.260> up<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.920> before<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:17.820> get<00:00:17.940> started

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
can pick it up and before we get started

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.090 
can pick it up and before we get started
let<00:00:18.510> me<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.600> pop<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.109> on<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.289> scale<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.890> ya

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
let me just pop it on the scale for ya

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.310 
let me just pop it on the scale for ya
we're<00:00:20.670> gonna<00:00:20.760> have<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.240> thing<00:00:21.570> zeroed<00:00:22.109> out

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
we're gonna have this thing zeroed out

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.980 
we're gonna have this thing zeroed out
and<00:00:22.820> popping<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.180> scale<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.869> are

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
and popping it on the scale we are

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.120 
and popping it on the scale we are
talking<00:00:25.470> about<00:00:25.680> about<00:00:26.420> 196<00:00:27.420> grams<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:28.439> it's

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
talking about about 196 grams so it's

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.700 
talking about about 196 grams so it's
gonna<00:00:29.250> add<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> little<00:00:29.699> bit<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.849> weight<00:00:30.560> but<00:00:31.560> it

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
gonna add a little bit of weight but it

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.530 
gonna add a little bit of weight but it
is<00:00:31.830> also<00:00:32.009> going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> protect<00:00:32.489> your<00:00:32.969> mini<00:00:33.210> quite

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
is also going to protect your mini quite

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.990 
is also going to protect your mini quite

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
well opening this up you've got a nice

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.479 
well opening this up you've got a nice
microfiber<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> inside<00:00:37.620> let's<00:00:38.280> go<00:00:38.370> ahead

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
microfiber on the inside let's go ahead

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.850 
microfiber on the inside let's go ahead
and<00:00:38.700> pop<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.000> mini<00:00:39.180> into<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.690> case<00:00:39.989> should

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and pop the mini into this case should

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.160 
and pop the mini into this case should
work<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.370> fine<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.820> screen<00:00:42.090> shields<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.809> do

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
work just fine with screen shields I do

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.380 
work just fine with screen shields I do
not<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:43.860> mine<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:45.149> really

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
not have one on mine but you really

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.420 
not have one on mine but you really
shouldn't<00:00:45.629> run<00:00:45.780> into<00:00:45.809> an<00:00:46.170> issue<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:46.680> let's

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
shouldn't run into an issue there let's

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.979 
shouldn't run into an issue there let's
close<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.850> up<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.149> take<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> look<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.719> close

close it up and take a look up close

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.869 
close it up and take a look up close
there<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.350> some<00:00:49.590> STM<00:00:50.070> branding<00:00:50.610> there<00:00:50.760> of

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
there is some STM branding there of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.430 
there is some STM branding there of
course<00:00:51.090> I've<00:00:51.239> got<00:00:51.420> an<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.719> purple<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.289> there

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
course I've got an in purple but there

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.220 
course I've got an in purple but there
are<00:00:52.590> other<00:00:52.800> colors<00:00:53.280> available<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:54.090> well<00:00:54.449> the

are other colors available as well the
cool<00:00:55.440> thing<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.710> when<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.160> closes<00:00:56.730> up<00:00:57.710> it

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
cool thing is when this closes up it

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.590 
cool thing is when this closes up it
protects<00:00:59.160> those<00:00:59.399> buttons<00:00:59.850> as<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.270> notice

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
protects those buttons as you notice

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.689 
protects those buttons as you notice
here<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.379> other<00:01:01.530> cool<00:01:01.829> thing<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> back

and<00:01:05.369> here<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.570> really<00:01:06.869> stays

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
and here so that it really stays

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.800 
and here so that it really stays
securely<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.189> place<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:09.119> doesn't<00:01:09.540> move<00:01:09.659> around

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
securely in place it doesn't move around

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.929 
securely in place it doesn't move around
in<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.350> bag<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.520> falsely

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
in a bag it's not going to falsely

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.649 
in a bag it's not going to falsely
engage<00:01:12.630> your<00:01:13.409> device<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.310> its<00:01:14.549> wake<00:01:14.909> state<00:01:15.360> so

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
engage your device to its wake state so

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.990 
engage your device to its wake state so
that's<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:16.290> cool<00:01:16.710> there's<00:01:17.340> your<00:01:17.520> STM

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
that's really cool there's your STM

spine as we open this up let me go ahead

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.890 
spine as we open this up let me go ahead
and<00:01:32.189> put<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.400> back<00:01:32.549> into<00:01:32.759> its<00:01:32.880> book<00:01:33.270> mode<00:01:33.509> here

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
and put it back into its book mode here

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.440 
and put it back into its book mode here
it<00:01:34.560> doesn't<00:01:34.829> add<00:01:34.920> too<00:01:35.159> much<00:01:35.340> bulk<00:01:35.700> again<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
it doesn't add too much bulk again you

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.550 
it doesn't add too much bulk again you
already<00:01:36.720> heard<00:01:36.869> about<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.140> weight<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.350> this

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
already heard about the weight of this

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.710 
already heard about the weight of this
one<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> inside<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:39.000> complete

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
one and on the inside here complete

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.810 
one and on the inside here complete
coverage<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.680> no<00:01:40.920> exposure<00:01:41.310> points

coverage so you get no exposure points
there<00:01:42.119> insofar<00:01:42.960> as<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.409> stands<00:01:43.710> go<00:01:44.009> because

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
there insofar as the stands go because

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.190 
there insofar as the stands go because
there's<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.549> magnet<00:01:45.030> here<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.840> stays<00:01:46.170> in

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
there's a magnet here that stays in

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.590 
there's a magnet here that stays in
place<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.119> use<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
place just like this you can use it in a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.990 
place just like this you can use it in a
stand<00:01:48.869> mode<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.590> or<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.700> use<00:01:50.850> it

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
stand mode like this or you can use it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
stand mode like this or you can use it
in<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.180> stand<00:01:51.450> mode<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
in a stand mode like this so you get a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.700 
in a stand mode like this so you get a
couple<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.340> stands<00:01:53.579> typing<00:01:54.270> angles<00:01:54.689> as<00:01:55.470> well

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
couple of stands typing angles as well

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.560 
couple of stands typing angles as well
as<00:01:55.770> viewing<00:01:56.189> angles<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.759> they<00:01:56.939> work<00:01:57.119> really

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
as viewing angles and they work really

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.870 
as viewing angles and they work really
really<00:01:57.719> well<00:01:58.079> I'm<00:01:58.890> quite<00:01:59.250> impressed<00:01:59.460> with

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
this case I like what they've done with

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.380 
this case I like what they've done with
the<00:02:01.979> standoffs<00:02:02.520> here<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.909> here<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.210> make<00:02:03.240> sure

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the standoffs here and here to make sure

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.810 
the standoffs here and here to make sure
that<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.840> doesn't<00:02:04.259> move<00:02:04.409> around<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.100> engage
