00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.240 

um<00:01:10.870> yeah<00:01:11.870> so<00:01:12.320> they're<00:01:12.620> not<00:01:12.740> with<00:01:12.890> each<00:01:12.920> other

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250

anymore<00:01:13.630> so<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.050> point<00:01:15.260> is<00:01:15.500> that

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
anymore so the point is that
