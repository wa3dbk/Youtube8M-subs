00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
the front of the bike here got that

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.780 
the front of the bike here got that

signature Suzuki headlight and front

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.520 
signature Suzuki headlight and front
fender<00:02:48.210> here

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.110 

the<00:02:51.709> anti<00:02:52.100> dive<00:02:52.430> suspension

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.100 

I<00:03:09.310> think<00:03:09.670> we<00:03:09.790> can<00:03:10.000> go<00:03:10.510> ahead<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.840> take<00:03:11.080> a

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
I think we can go ahead and take a

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.920 
I think we can go ahead and take a
little<00:03:11.320> bit<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.590> choke<00:03:12.340> off<00:03:12.610> of<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.600> I'll<00:03:13.750> go

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
little bit of choke off of it so I'll go

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.740 
little bit of choke off of it so I'll go
ahead<00:03:13.960> and<00:03:14.230> reduce<00:03:14.350> that<00:03:14.740> now<00:03:15.450> start<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.540> warm

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
ahead and reduce that now start to warm

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.720 
ahead and reduce that now start to warm
up<00:03:16.990> a<00:03:17.140> little<00:03:17.260> bit<00:03:17.410> get<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.040> down<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.490> about<00:03:18.580> a

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
up a little bit get it down to about a

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.480 
up a little bit get it down to about a
thousand<00:03:19.180> rpm<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:22.830> it's<00:03:23.830> gonna<00:03:23.950> Rev<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:24.430> a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
thousand rpm and it's gonna Rev it a

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.930 
thousand rpm and it's gonna Rev it a
little<00:03:24.760> for<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:27.600> this<00:03:28.600> is<00:03:28.840> stock<00:03:29.310> sounds<00:03:30.310> nice

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
little for you this is stock sounds nice

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.630 
little for you this is stock sounds nice
baritone<00:03:31.920> nice<00:03:32.920> tush<00:03:33.220> down

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.920 

all<00:03:37.970> right<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:38.540> think<00:03:39.380> that's<00:03:39.710> probably<00:03:40.930> enough

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
all right I think that's probably enough
