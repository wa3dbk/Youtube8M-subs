the<00:01:46.290> tension<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> trimming<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.600> it's

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the tension it so the trimming is it's

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.740 
the tension it so the trimming is it's
okay<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.159> puzzle<00:01:50.340> same<00:01:51.090> goes<00:01:51.299> with<00:01:51.479> this

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
okay on this puzzle same goes with this

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.700 
okay on this puzzle same goes with this
this<00:01:54.750> one<00:01:54.899> gives<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> little<00:01:55.229> more<00:01:55.320> tight

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
this one gives a little more tight

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.319 
this one gives a little more tight
little<00:01:56.100> bump<00:01:56.369> here<00:01:58.790> it's<00:01:59.790> not<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.090> smooth

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
little bump here it's not that smooth

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.270 
little bump here it's not that smooth
actually<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.960> blade<00:02:01.619> puzzle<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.130> lot

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
actually this blade puzzle is a lot

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.950 
actually this blade puzzle is a lot
smoother<00:02:02.759> than<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.420> corner-cutting

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
smoother than this and so corner-cutting

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.160 
smoother than this and so corner-cutting
go<00:02:07.920> over<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.479> now<00:02:09.479> as<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.750> see<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.020> is

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
go over that now as you can see this is

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.229 
go over that now as you can see this is
also<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.440> 3x3<00:02:10.950> mod<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.430> there's<00:02:11.849> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
also a 3x3 mod so there's the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.119 
also a 3x3 mod so there's the
cross<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.200> he<00:02:13.260> can<00:02:13.409> figure<00:02:13.859> out<00:02:13.950> what<00:02:14.040> the

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
cross and he can figure out what the

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.690 
cross and he can figure out what the
corners<00:02:14.430> are<00:02:14.549> so<00:02:15.510> corner<00:02:15.989> cutting<00:02:19.010> not<00:02:20.010> really

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
corners are so corner cutting not really

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.360 
corners are so corner cutting not really
at<00:02:21.030> all

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
at all

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.839 
at all
in<00:02:23.370> Reverse<00:02:23.870> not<00:02:24.870> which<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.409> not<00:02:25.439> a<00:02:25.590> chance<00:02:25.890> no

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
in Reverse not which is not a chance no

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.000 
in Reverse not which is not a chance no
reverse<00:02:27.510> corner<00:02:27.780> cutting<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.409> shield

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
reverse corner cutting on the shield

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.649 
reverse corner cutting on the shield
puzzle<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:33.079> blade<00:02:34.079> puzzle<00:02:35.239> same<00:02:36.239> goes

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
puzzle and on the blade puzzle same goes

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.610 
puzzle and on the blade puzzle same goes
for<00:02:36.689> that<00:02:37.370> no<00:02:38.370> corner<00:02:38.609> cutting<00:02:39.620> and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
for that no corner cutting and

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.879 
for that no corner cutting and
absolutely<00:02:41.189> no<00:02:41.730> reverse<00:02:42.120> corner<00:02:42.420> cutting<00:02:42.889> so

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
absolutely no reverse corner cutting so

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.800 
absolutely no reverse corner cutting so
as<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.370> would<00:02:44.489> expect<00:02:44.579> there's<00:02:45.120> no<00:02:45.419> reverse

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
as I would expect there's no reverse

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.879 
as I would expect there's no reverse
corner<00:02:46.019> cutting<00:02:46.109> on<00:02:46.379> either<00:02:46.560> way<00:02:46.769> these

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
corner cutting on either way these

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.649 
corner cutting on either way these
puzzles<00:02:47.310> damaging<00:02:47.760> puzzles<00:02:48.150> aren't<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.480> best

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
puzzles damaging puzzles aren't the best

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.780 
puzzles damaging puzzles aren't the best
pet<00:02:48.870> corner<00:02:49.290> cutting<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:50.340> also<00:02:50.549> wouldn't

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
pet corner cutting and I also wouldn't

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.979 
pet corner cutting and I also wouldn't
expect<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.239> because<00:02:51.359> I<00:02:51.629> wouldn't<00:02:51.900> really

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
expect it because I wouldn't really

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.629 
expect it because I wouldn't really
expect<00:02:52.409> somebody<00:02:52.829> to<00:02:53.010> speed<00:02:53.310> solve<00:02:53.519> these

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
expect somebody to speed solve these

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.280 
expect somebody to speed solve these
puzzles<00:02:53.819> so<00:02:54.299> you<00:02:54.359> all<00:02:54.629> really<00:02:54.780> need<00:02:55.019> corner

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
puzzles so you all really need corner

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.379 
puzzles so you all really need corner
cutting<00:02:55.470> I'd<00:02:55.950> remove<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.489> really<00:02:56.669> slowly<00:02:56.969> when

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
cutting I'd remove it really slowly when

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.959 
cutting I'd remove it really slowly when
I<00:02:57.419> solve<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.079> that's<00:02:58.709> just<00:02:58.889> me<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.219> let's<00:02:59.849> go

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
I solve it that's just me so let's go

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.209 
I solve it that's just me so let's go
over<00:03:00.060> lock<00:03:00.450> up<00:03:00.629> some<00:03:00.750> pops<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.680> these<00:03:01.829> puzzles

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:02.219 
over lock up some pops so these puzzles

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.250 
over lock up some pops so these puzzles
have<00:03:02.370> never<00:03:02.579> popped<00:03:02.879> on<00:03:03.030> me<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.930> problem

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
have never popped on me but the problem

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.619 
have never popped on me but the problem
is<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.889> lemons<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.549> they<00:03:05.700> pop<00:03:06.239> up<00:03:06.389> pretty

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
is the lemons that they pop up pretty

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.059 
is the lemons that they pop up pretty
much<00:03:06.810> every<00:03:07.319> other<00:03:07.439> move<00:03:09.739> so<00:03:10.739> I'm<00:03:10.889> just<00:03:10.980> gonna

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
much every other move so I'm just gonna

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:27.890 
much every other move so I'm just gonna
do<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:11.370> algorithm<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.790> there's<00:03:26.940> one<00:03:27.599> T

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
do this algorithm so there's one T

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.259 
do this algorithm so there's one T
algorithm<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:29.459> guys<00:03:29.639> struggling<00:03:30.150> with

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
algorithm that you guys struggling with

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.349 
algorithm that you guys struggling with
it<00:03:30.439> is<00:03:31.439> one<00:03:31.769> markup<00:03:32.159> so<00:03:32.939> you<00:03:33.030> have<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.209> make

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
it is one markup so you have to make

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.339 
it is one markup so you have to make
sure<00:03:33.449> everything's<00:03:33.720> on<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.900> line<00:03:33.930> that's

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
sure everything's on the line that's

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.559 
sure everything's on the line that's
what<00:03:35.220> really<00:03:35.340> gets<00:03:35.489> annoying<00:03:35.760> cuz<00:03:36.000> everything

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
what really gets annoying cuz everything

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.479 
what really gets annoying cuz everything
gets<00:03:36.689> out<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:36.840> alignment<00:03:37.280> whenever<00:03:38.280> I'm<00:03:38.370> doing

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
gets out of alignment whenever I'm doing

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:49.789 
gets out of alignment whenever I'm doing
this<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:46.009> since<00:03:47.009> that<00:03:47.220> turned<00:03:48.229> that<00:03:49.229> I'm<00:03:49.530> just

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
this and since that turned that I'm just

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.159 
this and since that turned that I'm just
going<00:03:49.949> to<00:03:50.009> take<00:03:50.639> it<00:03:50.669> up<00:03:50.819> turn<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:51.930> want<00:03:52.109> to

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
going to take it up turn it so I want to

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.499 
going to take it up turn it so I want to
do<00:03:52.259> two<00:03:52.439> more<00:03:52.590> times<00:03:52.769> so<00:03:53.099> it<00:03:53.579> locks<00:03:53.790> up<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.120> lot

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:54.509 
do two more times so it locks up a lot

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:56.929 
do two more times so it locks up a lot
and<00:03:54.989> it's<00:03:55.500> kind<00:03:56.099> of<00:03:56.129> hard<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.430> turn<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.759> same

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
and it's kind of hard to turn the same

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.599 
and it's kind of hard to turn the same
goes<00:03:57.150> with<00:03:57.269> this<00:03:57.479> I<00:03:57.689> won't<00:03:58.650> really<00:03:58.829> actually

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
goes with this I won't really actually

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.300 
goes with this I won't really actually
that's<00:03:59.970> just<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.239> like<00:04:00.389> the<00:04:00.509> sexy<00:04:00.840> mint<00:04:01.189> if<00:04:02.189> I

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
that's just you like the sexy mint if I

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.699 
that's just you like the sexy mint if I
could<00:04:02.519> do<00:04:02.639> it<00:04:02.669> you<00:04:02.909> see<00:04:03.180> there's<00:04:03.509> one<00:04:03.599> lock<00:04:03.900> up

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.509 

sometimes<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.769> have<00:04:07.859> to<00:04:07.949> turn<00:04:08.129> it<00:04:08.220> like<00:04:08.280> three

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
sometimes I have to turn it like three

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.890 
sometimes I have to turn it like three
times<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.849> other<00:04:08.939> way<00:04:09.120> instead<00:04:09.329> of<00:04:09.540> one<00:04:09.720> time

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
times the other way instead of one time

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.499 
times the other way instead of one time
one<00:04:10.079> way<00:04:10.199> cuz<00:04:10.439> it<00:04:10.560> locked<00:04:10.769> up<00:04:10.949> so<00:04:11.790> no<00:04:12.060> sexy<00:04:12.359> move

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:12.509 
one way cuz it locked up so no sexy move

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:13.909 
one way cuz it locked up so no sexy move

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
off on that puzzle on that little piece

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.820 
off on that puzzle on that little piece
in<00:05:22.470> that<00:05:23.310> little<00:05:23.550> piece<00:05:23.760> right<00:05:23.940> there<00:05:24.830> but

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
in that little piece right there but

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.960 
in that little piece right there but
other<00:05:26.070> than<00:05:26.250> that<00:05:26.310> they're<00:05:26.550> holding<00:05:26.670> it<00:05:26.850> very

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
other than that they're holding it very

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.410 
other than that they're holding it very
well<00:05:28.010> I'll<00:05:29.010> quickly<00:05:29.520> go<00:05:29.670> over<00:05:30.000> a<00:05:30.030> little<00:05:30.180> size

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
well I'll quickly go over a little size

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.780 
well I'll quickly go over a little size
comparison<00:05:31.190> 357<00:05:32.190> millimeter<00:05:32.610> then<00:05:33.570> G<00:05:33.750> so<00:05:34.790> it

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
comparison 357 millimeter then G so it

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.670 
comparison 357 millimeter then G so it
is<00:05:36.360> about<00:05:36.480> the<00:05:36.600> same<00:05:36.810> size<00:05:37.110> height<00:05:38.010> wise<00:05:38.390> just

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
is about the same size height wise just

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.640 
is about the same size height wise just
you<00:05:40.680> can<00:05:40.800> see<00:05:40.920> it's<00:05:41.040> a<00:05:41.100> lot<00:05:41.250> bigger<00:05:42.500> that<00:05:43.500> way

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
you can see it's a lot bigger that way

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.010 
you can see it's a lot bigger that way
and<00:05:44.010> the<00:05:44.940> blade<00:05:45.770> puzzle<00:05:46.770> is<00:05:47.010> the<00:05:47.400> same<00:05:47.610> height

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
and the blade puzzle is the same height

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.930 
and the blade puzzle is the same height
are<00:05:49.020> weak<00:05:49.200> hard<00:05:49.680> to<00:05:49.770> hold<00:05:49.890> it<00:05:50.040> up<00:05:52.790> let's<00:05:53.790> trust

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
are weak hard to hold it up let's trust

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.740 
are weak hard to hold it up let's trust
me<00:05:54.090> it's<00:05:54.210> the<00:05:54.330> same<00:05:54.510> size<00:05:54.720> and<00:05:56.450> it's<00:05:57.450> just<00:05:57.660> a

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
me it's the same size and it's just a

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.240 
me it's the same size and it's just a
different<00:05:58.140> shape<00:05:58.500> and<00:05:58.710> this<00:05:58.800> is<00:05:59.010> the<00:05:59.070> bigger

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
different shape and this is the bigger

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.980 
different shape and this is the bigger
but<00:05:59.850> the<00:05:59.970> cookies<00:06:00.210> have<00:06:00.330> a<00:06:00.360> little<00:06:00.630> interface

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
but the cookies have a little interface

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.890 
but the cookies have a little interface
manche<00:06:02.000> so<00:06:03.000> now<00:06:03.270> let's<00:06:03.420> just<00:06:03.480> go<00:06:03.690> over<00:06:03.750> my

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
manche so now let's just go over my

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.570 
manche so now let's just go over my
overall<00:06:04.200> thoughts<00:06:04.440> so<00:06:05.340> I<00:06:05.370> would<00:06:05.490> not

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
overall thoughts so I would not

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.010 
overall thoughts so I would not
recommend<00:06:05.760> giving<00:06:06.090> these<00:06:06.270> puzzles<00:06:06.780> unless

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
recommend giving these puzzles unless

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.270 
recommend giving these puzzles unless
you<00:06:07.200> want<00:06:07.440> to<00:06:07.560> just<00:06:07.710> have<00:06:07.920> them<00:06:08.040> for<00:06:08.190> your

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
you want to just have them for your

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.470 
you want to just have them for your
collection<00:06:08.640> because<00:06:08.880> they're<00:06:09.060> horrible

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
collection because they're horrible

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.680 
collection because they're horrible
turning<00:06:09.870> puzzles<00:06:10.500> the<00:06:11.340> don't<00:06:11.820> corners<00:06:12.120> at<00:06:12.480> all

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
turning puzzles the don't corners at all

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.740 
turning puzzles the don't corners at all
the<00:06:13.230> reverse<00:06:13.560> corner<00:06:13.800> turn<00:06:14.010> at<00:06:14.100> all<00:06:14.190> and<00:06:14.750> they

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
the reverse corner turn at all and they

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.120 
the reverse corner turn at all and they
lock<00:06:15.930> up<00:06:16.110> a<00:06:16.200> lot<00:06:16.350> and<00:06:16.620> so<00:06:16.770> they're<00:06:16.920> just<00:06:16.980> a

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
lock up a lot and so they're just a

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.720 
lock up a lot and so they're just a
really<00:06:17.160> annoying<00:06:17.520> to<00:06:17.790> solve<00:06:18.350> and<00:06:19.550> it<00:06:20.550> just

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
really annoying to solve and it just

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.970 
really annoying to solve and it just
takes<00:06:20.910> too<00:06:21.090> long<00:06:21.120> to<00:06:21.270> solve<00:06:21.630> if<00:06:22.380> it<00:06:22.680> was<00:06:22.830> like

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
takes too long to solve if it was like

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.890 
takes too long to solve if it was like
that<00:06:23.250> maybe<00:06:23.640> is<00:06:23.790> an<00:06:24.000> G<00:06:24.180> or<00:06:24.300> something<00:06:24.630> battered

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
that maybe is an G or something battered

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.390 
that maybe is an G or something battered
into<00:06:25.110> this<00:06:25.200> that<00:06:25.440> might<00:06:25.590> be<00:06:25.680> a<00:06:25.710> lot<00:06:25.890> better<00:06:26.040> but

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
into this that might be a lot better but

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.340 
into this that might be a lot better but
the<00:06:26.760> ending<00:06:26.970> puzzles<00:06:27.510> I<00:06:27.600> don't<00:06:28.020> really<00:06:28.140> like

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
the ending puzzles I don't really like

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.490 
the ending puzzles I don't really like
that<00:06:28.380> much<00:06:28.880> so<00:06:29.880> again<00:06:30.690> I<00:06:30.870> would<00:06:31.050> not<00:06:31.380> really

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
that much so again I would not really

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.659 
that much so again I would not really
recommend<00:06:31.620> it<00:06:32.010> unless<00:06:32.130> you<00:06:32.340> just<00:06:32.460> want<00:06:32.520> to

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
recommend it unless you just want to

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.040 
recommend it unless you just want to
have<00:06:32.820> in<00:06:32.910> your<00:06:32.940> collection<00:06:33.180> which<00:06:33.570> is<00:06:33.720> what<00:06:34.020> I

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
have in your collection which is what I

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.280 
have in your collection which is what I
did<00:06:34.320> I<00:06:34.500> kinda<00:06:35.220> just<00:06:35.310> got<00:06:35.490> both<00:06:35.730> of<00:06:35.760> them

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.290 
did I kinda just got both of them

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.810 
did I kinda just got both of them
because<00:06:36.830> I<00:06:36.920> thought<00:06:37.070> they<00:06:37.190> were<00:06:37.250> cool<00:06:37.460> and<00:06:37.760> I

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
because I thought they were cool and I

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.840 
because I thought they were cool and I
think<00:06:38.060> I<00:06:38.150> might<00:06:38.270> have<00:06:38.330> all<00:06:38.720> the<00:06:38.810> DM<00:06:39.020> change

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
think I might have all the DM change

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.960 
think I might have all the DM change
shake<00:06:40.850> mods<00:06:41.060> not<00:06:41.870> really<00:06:42.020> sure<00:06:42.200> but<00:06:42.440> I<00:06:42.740> think<00:06:43.730> I

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
shake mods not really sure but I think I

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.660 
shake mods not really sure but I think I
do<00:06:44.320> so<00:06:45.320> hope<00:06:45.890> you<00:06:46.010> guys<00:06:46.040> enjoyed<00:06:46.400> this<00:06:46.490> review
