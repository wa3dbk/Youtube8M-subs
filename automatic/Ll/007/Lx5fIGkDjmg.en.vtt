00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.049
 lindemann's wildlife takes you in 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.059
 the dog salons naughty dogs in 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.820
 berlin-charlottenburg already since 25 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.099
 years shears and festival in 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.109
 rieti we have small quadrupeds from her 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.240
 today professional and valuable tips 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.240
 to wash and dry them 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.070
 to the skin is not dried up 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.150
 be there when the people are not 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.759
 dry out 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.190
 that is why you have to put value on the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:41.989
 Back of the shampoo I always deserve 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:45.420
 always 1 system thus equal to water 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.700
 it tastes better on the dog 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.710
 advantage 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.460
 and second, the ancient better again 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.489
 skip 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.199
 the whole rhythm should be 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.870
 not dry anymore but already 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.670
 Everything has to be achieved and then comes along 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.630
 shampoo on it will be part of the part 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:09.450
 first the body after that will be 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:16.970
 legs foamed and comes to an end 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:19.920
 the head is so that is indeed much 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.619
 shampoo but you do not want that 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.540
 The eyes were closed before the shampoo 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.060
 therefore, the head-to-circuit 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.840
 foamed and first again 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.500
 rinsed 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.979
 the wound was mostly on it 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.220
 The next to the head down do not look 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.750
 upwards so that the water runs off 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.659
 but look down next to the head 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.390
 down and then inevitably runs 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.210
 the whole look is better with the eyes 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.490
 also that you like me any 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.399
 bracket uses that more roundish 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.409
 and bounce in the bathtub and 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.229
 also can not jump out firstly has 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.200
 to be home the whole pigmy 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.079
 in the waiting room and also can do so 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.549
 the dog if he jumps he has too 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.550
 not really a liability, the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.610
 The legs can break off 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.710
 that's why you're always here in the pet salon 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.410
 secured everywhere the moored 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.820
 Legs should not be neglected 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.340
 because the hair stays in place 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.160
 usually longer than on the body because of it 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.090
 It is also very important legs and feet 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.680
 to wash with 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.960
 We are here now also because the customers 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.380
 have repeatedly said how 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.120
 a shampoo with it's fragrance that smells 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.590
 not so cheesy as the lingering 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.320
 everyone always says that's really nice 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.520
 fresh and that's why we're here now 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.350
 have stayed the shampoo with this 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.010
 to say background after bath 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.130
 I like to join in on these volley customers 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.920
 where the fell easily missed 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.730
 then a rinse in it 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.680
 the same scent the flush becomes one 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.750
 earns one 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.350
 how could I not moderate to ten 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.040
 be quick and good 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:13.120
 once let it go 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:17.560
 then you can knot missing 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.580
 Matting old role much better 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.020
 know and fill in 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.320
 Of course, that had to be done thoroughly 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.230
 they will not be rinsed out again 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.650
 the field sticks and it has him 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.770
 afterwards other apparently the 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.540
 I do not flush myself properly plays 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.709
 of course only applies to these 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.440
 longhaired dogs too 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.150
 short-haired reason is not necessary it 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.660
 is always called dogs should not 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.190
 take 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.280
 that was always the case for so many years 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.300
 he always floated over us dogs 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.680
 you should not wash 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.150
 but now you have a big one 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:02.000
 make a difference between comforting 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.980
 dogs like the poodle is the poodle 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.640
 the maltese the ski to the yorkshire 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.950
 terrier 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.280
 All of these are following the yorkshire 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.200
 terrier had silk and also this one 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.980
 his field 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.459
 is otherwise structured differently than 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:21.880
 that of dogs with a double field that is 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:26.169
 with undercoat &amp; decker as in husky 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.530
 shepherd dog or other breeds that have 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:33.720
 in underfax this is a warming wool 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:37.030
 and and a fat greasy decker that 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.760
 Water repellent is when you 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.639
 Of course, these dogs often wash then 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.400
 If you wash this layer of grease away and 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.639
 then the dog is no longer in 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.580
 quotes weatherproof dogs like 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.470
 poodle maltese and yorkshire terrier 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.290
 do not have that anyway 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.600
 they are not weatherproof and they have 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.270
 a role that you can wash more often 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.700
 must or must wash if 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.220
 you can cut the hair you can 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.990
 Not at all in dirty condition and 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.100
 that 's just the big difference 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:15.430
 Of course you can also have a husky 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.680
 or wash a tv picture if it stinks 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.600
 or if he is dirty but the 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.460
 You should not go every six weeks 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.229
 put in the bath and wash 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.039
 You can do that with the tunnel quiet 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:29.650
 make the coat is woolly and anyway 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.820
 soft and sucked the water for that reason 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.010
 you can do it too and industries 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.960
 Of course, after washing, too 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.330
 dried first, I start as synonymous 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.130
 on the head because of the water from above 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.200
 down it would be me now 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.260
 first dry your legs and catch 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.750
 then here again a run after and 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:50.380
 press a little bit into the water 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:53.440
 into towel should not be too much 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.060
 Scrub because it makes the hair if 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.889
 they are already a little missed 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.889
 still a feast
