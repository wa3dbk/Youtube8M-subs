00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
you special powers so you better use it

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.530

mermaid<00:01:52.009> vinyls<00:01:52.369> before<00:01:52.759> what<00:01:53.149> is<00:01:53.180> wrong<00:01:53.420> with

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
mermaid vinyls before what is wrong with

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.960 
mermaid vinyls before what is wrong with
me<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.259> I<00:01:54.290> just<00:01:54.409> cut<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.920> sides<00:01:55.220> of<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.640> vinyl

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
me so I just cut the sides of the vinyl

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.149 
me so I just cut the sides of the vinyl
because<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.420> helps<00:01:56.750> with<00:01:56.990> pressing<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.800> vinyl

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
because it helps with pressing the vinyl

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.400 
because it helps with pressing the vinyl
evenly<00:01:58.729> down<00:01:58.910> on<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.240> nail<00:01:59.420> because<00:01:59.750> my<00:02:00.200> nail

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
evenly down on the nail because my nail

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.260 
evenly down on the nail because my nail
unlike<00:02:00.890> some<00:02:01.100> other<00:02:01.280> people<00:02:01.670> out<00:02:01.820> there<00:02:01.850> is

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
unlike some other people out there is

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.210 
unlike some other people out there is
quite<00:02:02.600> curved<00:02:02.929> so<00:02:03.320> I<00:02:03.350> kind<00:02:03.649> of<00:02:03.740> need<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:03.920> like

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
quite curved so I kind of need to like

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.310 
quite curved so I kind of need to like
push<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.729> around<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:05.300> sides<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.140> nail

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
push it around the sides of the nail

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.169 
push it around the sides of the nail
then<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.860> just<00:02:07.070> trimmed<00:02:07.280> off<00:02:07.460> some<00:02:07.789> of<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:07.970> top

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
then I just trimmed off some of the top

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.419 
then I just trimmed off some of the top
because<00:02:08.570> it's<00:02:08.929> like<00:02:09.170> kind<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.619> dragging<00:02:10.100> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
because it's like kind of dragging the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.340 
because it's like kind of dragging the

from<00:02:42.680> my<00:02:42.829> nail<00:02:43.010> honestly<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:43.790> did<00:02:44.090> not<00:02:44.420> know

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
from my nail honestly I did not know

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.600 
from my nail honestly I did not know
what<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:44.930> would<00:02:45.110> do<00:02:45.470> any<00:02:45.709> when<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:46.040> first<00:02:46.310> tried

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
what I would do any when I first tried

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.610 
what I would do any when I first tried
this<00:02:46.790> technique<00:02:47.360> which<00:02:47.660> was<00:02:47.870> for<00:02:48.140> this<00:02:48.290> video

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
this technique which was for this video

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.620 
this technique which was for this video
but<00:02:49.070> I<00:02:49.100> found<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:49.579> be<00:02:49.610> more<00:02:49.880> of<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:50.090> trial<00:02:50.420> and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
but I found it to be more of a trial and

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.509 
but I found it to be more of a trial and
error<00:02:50.810> process<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:52.010> by<00:02:52.130> that<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.370> mean

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
error process and by that I mean

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.910 
error process and by that I mean
sometimes<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.480> added<00:02:53.720> more<00:02:53.900> water<00:02:54.110> sometimes<00:02:54.769> I

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
sometimes I added more water sometimes I

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.949 
sometimes I added more water sometimes I
added<00:02:55.160> less<00:02:55.370> sometimes<00:02:55.850> I<00:02:56.150> had<00:02:56.269> bigger<00:02:56.600> blobs

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
added less sometimes I had bigger blobs

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.630 
added less sometimes I had bigger blobs
of<00:02:57.110> paint<00:02:57.260> except<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.890> did<00:02:58.040> not<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:58.400> thick

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
of paint except that I did not so thick

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.340 
of paint except that I did not so thick
globs<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:59.090> paint<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.540> then<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.840> kind<00:03:00.079> of<00:03:00.170> just

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
globs of paint and then you kind of just

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.229 
globs of paint and then you kind of just
keep<00:03:00.560> playing<00:03:00.769> around<00:03:00.980> until<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.820> looks<00:03:02.030> like

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
keep playing around until it looks like

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.569 
keep playing around until it looks like
something<00:03:02.660> that<00:03:02.690> makes<00:03:02.989> sense<00:03:03.200> let's<00:03:04.190> try<00:03:04.519> it

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
something that makes sense let's try it

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.699 
something that makes sense let's try it

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.990 
already and then instead of completely
dragging<00:03:15.290> my<00:03:15.410> second<00:03:15.859> brush<00:03:16.070> I<00:03:16.430> leave<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.910> a

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
dragging my second brush I leave it a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.569 
dragging my second brush I leave it a
little<00:03:17.150> bit<00:03:17.420> wet<00:03:17.690> so<00:03:18.320> you<00:03:18.410> can<00:03:18.650> see<00:03:18.890> actually

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
little bit wet so you can see actually

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.250 
little bit wet so you can see actually
leaving<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.150> wet<00:03:20.359> kind<00:03:20.630> of<00:03:20.810> gives<00:03:21.079> you<00:03:21.230> a

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
leaving it wet kind of gives you a

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.729 
leaving it wet kind of gives you a
little<00:03:21.530> more<00:03:21.680> watercolor<00:03:22.579> look<00:03:23.239> like<00:03:23.959> watery

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
little more watercolor look like watery

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.520 
little more watercolor look like watery
watercolor<00:03:25.730> should<00:03:26.450> look<00:03:26.630> like<00:03:26.660> watercolor

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
watercolor should look like watercolor

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.770 
watercolor should look like watercolor
because<00:03:27.799> it's<00:03:28.130> called<00:03:28.519> watercolor<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:29.390> thought

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
because it's called watercolor I thought

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.170 
because it's called watercolor I thought
it<00:03:29.930> could<00:03:30.079> use<00:03:30.109> some<00:03:30.590> more<00:03:30.920> pinkish<00:03:31.549> color<00:03:31.850> so

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
it could use some more pinkish color so

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.240 
it could use some more pinkish color so
I<00:03:32.239> mix<00:03:32.570> them<00:03:32.750> red<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:32.959> purple<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:33.680> add<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.130> in

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
I mix them red and purple and add it in

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.199 
I mix them red and purple and add it in
some<00:03:34.489> more<00:03:34.669> spots

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
some more spots

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.440 
some more spots
much<00:03:35.720> like<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.169> dry<00:03:36.410> brushing<00:03:36.859> tick

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
much like the dry brushing tick

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.660 
much like the dry brushing tick
a<00:03:37.690> watercolor<00:03:38.410> technique<00:03:39.010> is<00:03:39.190> one<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.520> those

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
a watercolor technique is one of those

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.190 
a watercolor technique is one of those

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
kinds of art where you can make a

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.320 
kinds of art where you can make a
