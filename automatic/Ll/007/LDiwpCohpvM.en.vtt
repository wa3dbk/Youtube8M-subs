starting with champion changes we have a
colleague<00:00:25.920> mark<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.910> SS<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.539> initial

colleague mark of the SS and the initial

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.029 
colleague mark of the SS and the initial
damage<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.619> actually<00:00:28.890> gonna<00:00:28.980> be

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
damage on that is actually gonna be

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.589 
damage on that is actually gonna be
reduced<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:29.820> they're<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> be<00:00:30.390> changing

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
reduced but they're going to be changing

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.749 
reduced but they're going to be changing
the<00:00:30.840> ability<00:00:31.260> power<00:00:31.439> ratio<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the ability power ratio on the

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.330 
the ability power ratio on the
detonation<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.870> up<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.320> little<00:00:34.800> bit<00:00:35.070> so

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
detonation of it up a little bit so

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.430 
detonation of it up a little bit so
basically<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> lot<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> little<00:00:36.630> less<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:37.020> kind

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
basically a lot a little less just kind

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.459 
basically a lot a little less just kind
of<00:00:37.500> face<00:00:37.800> value<00:00:37.920> poke<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.809> consuming

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
of face value poke but it but consuming

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.290 
of face value poke but it but consuming
it<00:00:40.559> now<00:00:40.680> will<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.040> better<00:00:41.280> for<00:00:41.579> her<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.910> then

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
it now will be better for her and then

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.200 
it now will be better for her and then
on<00:00:42.690> Shadow<00:00:43.230> Dance<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.340> charge<00:00:44.700> rate<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.059> that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
on Shadow Dance the charge rate on that

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.369 
on Shadow Dance the charge rate on that
is<00:00:45.390> actually<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> be<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.930> little<00:00:46.200> bit

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
is actually going to be a little bit

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.010 
is actually going to be a little bit
more<00:00:46.620> increased<00:00:47.280> early<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.180> look<00:00:48.840> out<00:00:48.960> for

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
more increased early on so look out for

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.110 
more increased early on so look out for
that<00:00:49.309> not<00:00:50.309> going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> really<00:00:50.610> change<00:00:50.850> her<00:00:50.969> too

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that not going to really change her too

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.729 
that not going to really change her too
much<00:00:51.270> she's<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> strong<00:00:51.780> champion<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.649> you

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
much she's a strong champion so if you

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.350 
much she's a strong champion so if you
know<00:00:52.829> how<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.920> player<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.300> be

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
know how to player this is going to be

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.810 
know how to player this is going to be
fine<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.219> next<00:00:56.219> we're<00:00:56.340> taking<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> look<00:00:56.730> at

whole<00:01:35.009> man<00:01:35.220> aside<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.790> then<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.570> now<00:01:36.780> applies

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
whole man aside and then it now applies

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.480 
whole man aside and then it now applies
the<00:01:37.380> gathering<00:01:37.710> fires<00:01:37.890> effect<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.250> each

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the gathering fires effect on each

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.490 
the gathering fires effect on each
stance<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.090> damage<00:01:39.509> dealt<00:01:39.750> instead<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.229> only

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
stance of damage dealt instead of only

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.340 
stance of damage dealt instead of only
one<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.490> initial<00:01:41.790> application<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.509> that's

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
one on the initial application so that's

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.870 
one on the initial application so that's
going<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:43.619> changing<00:01:43.740> tiny<00:01:44.220> bit<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
going to be changing tiny bit but that

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.249 
going to be changing tiny bit but that
should<00:01:45.000> actually<00:01:45.149> make<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.750> don't<00:01:46.200> know

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
should actually make it I don't know

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.440 
should actually make it I don't know
better<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.799> little<00:01:47.070> bit<00:01:47.189> man<00:01:47.640> reduction<00:01:48.149> that's

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
better a little bit man reduction that's

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.330 
better a little bit man reduction that's
nice<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:49.320> inspire<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
nice and then inspire we have the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.830 
nice and then inspire we have the
movement<00:01:50.729> speed<00:01:50.909> duration<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.780> be

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
movement speed duration is going to be

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.200 
movement speed duration is going to be
increased<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.409> tiny<00:01:52.829> bit<00:01:53.070> longer<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.549> then<00:01:53.610> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
increased so tiny bit longer and then I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.940 
increased so tiny bit longer and then I
fixed<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.570> bug<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.020> tooltip<00:01:55.380> word<00:01:55.590> shade

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
fixed a bug in the tooltip word shade

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.190 
fixed a bug in the tooltip word shade
there<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.430> stated<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.030> shield<00:01:57.299> was<00:01:57.810> giving

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
there it stated the shield was giving

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.330 
there it stated the shield was giving
different<00:01:58.350> amounts<00:01:58.770> than<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.979> actually<00:01:59.100> was

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
different amounts than it actually was

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.800 
different amounts than it actually was
and<00:01:59.759> then<00:02:00.270> mantra<00:02:01.020> bonus<00:02:01.350> defiance<00:02:02.810> movement

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
and then mantra bonus defiance movement

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.709 
and then mantra bonus defiance movement
speed<00:02:04.020> bonus<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.649> now<00:02:05.189> always<00:02:06.000> sixty<00:02:06.570> percent

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
speed bonus is now always sixty percent

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.359 
speed bonus is now always sixty percent
so<00:02:07.170> whenever<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.560> use<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.829> with<00:02:07.920> your<00:02:08.039> mantra

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
so whenever you use it with your mantra

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.490 
so whenever you use it with your mantra
you're<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.670> be<00:02:08.729> faster<00:02:09.239> than<00:02:09.500> it

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
you're going to be faster than it

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.869 
you're going to be faster than it
scaling<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.220> whole<00:02:11.370> game<00:02:11.520> because<00:02:11.730> you'll

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
scaling the whole game because you'll

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.820 
scaling the whole game because you'll
always<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.150> 60

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
always have 60

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.730 
always have 60
now<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.250> then<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.730> Allied<00:02:14.090> shield<00:02:14.720> range<00:02:15.410> on

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
now and then the Allied shield range on

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.950 
now and then the Allied shield range on
that<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.220> actually<00:02:16.670> going<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.850> be<00:02:16.970> now<00:02:17.180> up<00:02:17.420> 100

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
that is actually going to be now up 100

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.450 
that is actually going to be now up 100
as<00:02:18.110> well<00:02:18.410> so<00:02:18.590> it'll<00:02:18.740> be<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.860> little<00:02:18.980> bit<00:02:19.070> easier

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
as well so it'll be a little bit easier

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.310 
as well so it'll be a little bit easier
to<00:02:19.580> put<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:20.030> out<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.180> little<00:02:20.330> bit<00:02:20.600> further<00:02:20.870> so

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
to put that out a little bit further so

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.770 
to put that out a little bit further so
all<00:02:22.070> these<00:02:22.250> changes<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.700> karma<00:02:22.970> actually<00:02:23.450> are

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
all these changes to karma actually are

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.660 
all these changes to karma actually are
going<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.260> be<00:02:24.350> pretty<00:02:24.590> much<00:02:24.770> just<00:02:25.100> I<00:02:25.370> don't

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
going to be pretty much just I don't

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.430 
going to be pretty much just I don't
know<00:02:25.760> just<00:02:26.180> tweaking<00:02:26.510> or<00:02:26.690> for<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.080> most<00:02:27.260> part

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
know just tweaking or for the most part

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.530 
know just tweaking or for the most part
they<00:02:28.370> do<00:02:28.430> sound<00:02:28.670> a<00:02:28.760> little<00:02:28.910> bit<00:02:29.120> better<00:02:29.300> in<00:02:29.450> the

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
they do sound a little bit better in the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.420 
they do sound a little bit better in the
long<00:02:29.660> run<00:02:29.720> though<00:02:30.050> so<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.800> should<00:02:30.920> help<00:02:31.070> Karma

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
long run though so you should help Karma

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.130 
long run though so you should help Karma

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.070 
seconds on it but that's fine if you
build<00:03:04.280> her<00:03:04.430> with<00:03:04.610> forty<00:03:04.910> percent<00:03:05.270> cooldown

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
build her with forty percent cooldown

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.440 
build her with forty percent cooldown
reduction<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:07.130> had<00:03:07.280> like<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.430> 22<00:03:07.940> second<00:03:08.270> alt

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
reduction you had like a 22 second alt

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.560 
reduction you had like a 22 second alt
so<00:03:08.750> it'll<00:03:09.530> be<00:03:09.560> like<00:03:09.830> 28<00:03:10.430> now<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:10.850> still<00:03:11.390> won't

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
so it'll be like 28 now so still won't

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.480 
so it'll be like 28 now so still won't
be<00:03:11.660> bad<00:03:11.840> Luck's<00:03:12.560> needs<00:03:12.800> a<00:03:12.890> little<00:03:13.040> tweak<00:03:13.280> she's

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.360 
bit does seem like tahno life goes
pretty<00:03:44.239> far<00:03:44.480> but<00:03:44.780> that's<00:03:45.440> kind<00:03:45.650> of<00:03:45.709> her<00:03:45.890> bread

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
pretty far but that's kind of her bread

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.830 
pretty far but that's kind of her bread
and<00:03:46.519> butter<00:03:46.700> in<00:03:46.880> our<00:03:47.030> kid<00:03:47.239> that<00:03:47.450> should<00:03:47.660> go

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
and butter in our kid that should go

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.479 
and butter in our kid that should go
really<00:03:48.050> far<00:03:48.320> so<00:03:48.590> kind<00:03:49.070> of<00:03:49.130> glad<00:03:49.280> they're

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
really far so kind of glad they're

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.100 
really far so kind of glad they're
changing<00:03:49.760> her<00:03:49.880> up<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.300> currently<00:03:50.570> think<00:03:50.959> she's

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
changing her up I currently think she's

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.900 
changing her up I currently think she's
a<00:03:51.140> little<00:03:51.440> bit<00:03:51.709> weak<00:03:51.920> unless<00:03:52.250> played<00:03:52.489> very

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
a little bit weak unless played very

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.199 
a little bit weak unless played very
very<00:03:53.030> well<00:03:53.510> so<00:03:54.110> hopefully<00:03:54.860> nami<00:03:55.280> see<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.000> few

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
very well so hopefully nami see a few

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.120 
very well so hopefully nami see a few
more<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.480> those<00:03:56.570> maybe<00:03:56.840> now<00:03:57.050> next<00:03:57.800> we<00:03:57.890> do<00:03:58.010> have

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
more of those maybe now next we do have

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.920 
more of those maybe now next we do have

Titans Roth cooldown is going to be
reduced<00:04:04.130> which<00:04:04.340> should<00:04:04.489> help<00:04:04.670> because<00:04:05.030> at<00:04:05.959> the

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
reduced which should help because at the

reduced which should help because at the

very beginning man that 26 seconds is
pretty<00:04:08.450> long<00:04:08.660> so<00:04:09.260> earlier<00:04:10.100> earlier<00:04:10.489> ranks<00:04:11.120> are

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
pretty long so earlier earlier ranks are

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.550 
pretty long so earlier earlier ranks are
going<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:11.420> see<00:04:11.570> a<00:04:11.600> little<00:04:11.780> bit<00:04:11.930> better<00:04:12.170> play

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560

beginning of the game a lot of people

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.820 
beginning of the game a lot of people
only<00:05:24.599> put<00:05:24.810> one<00:05:24.840> point<00:05:25.169> to<00:05:25.320> it<00:05:25.440> and<00:05:25.530> you<00:05:25.650> already

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
only put one point to it and you already

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.080 
only put one point to it and you already
had<00:05:26.009> your<00:05:26.039> forty<00:05:26.340> five<00:05:26.460> percent<00:05:26.490> movement

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
had your forty five percent movement

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.189 
had your forty five percent movement
speed<00:05:27.240> so<00:05:27.479> as<00:05:27.539> ganks<00:05:27.810> were<00:05:27.900> a<00:05:27.930> little<00:05:28.110> bit

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
speed so as ganks were a little bit

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.379 
speed so as ganks were a little bit
easier<00:05:28.560> this<00:05:29.250> way<00:05:29.430> they're<00:05:29.909> going<00:05:30.030> to<00:05:30.090> make<00:05:30.240> it

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
easier this way they're going to make it

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.689 
easier this way they're going to make it
so<00:05:30.570> you<00:05:31.169> can't<00:05:31.199> quite<00:05:31.680> steamroll<00:05:32.250> on<00:05:32.520> your

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
so you can't quite steamroll on your

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.310 
so you can't quite steamroll on your
ganks<00:05:33.000> early<00:05:33.330> on<00:05:33.419> because<00:05:33.630> volibear<00:05:34.139> is<00:05:34.289> a

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
ganks early on because volibear is a

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.930 
ganks early on because volibear is a
very<00:05:34.560> strong<00:05:34.770> champion<00:05:35.010> as<00:05:35.340> we<00:05:35.460> all<00:05:35.550> know<00:05:35.699> with

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
very strong champion as we all know with

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.000 
very strong champion as we all know with
his<00:05:36.030> passive<00:05:36.510> so<00:05:36.720> this<00:05:37.500> will<00:05:37.620> kind<00:05:37.770> of<00:05:37.889> slow

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
his passive so this will kind of slow

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.110 
his passive so this will kind of slow
him<00:05:38.190> down<00:05:38.220> from<00:05:38.550> getting<00:05:38.820> out<00:05:38.940> of<00:05:39.060> control

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
him down from getting out of control

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.450 
him down from getting out of control
early<00:05:39.510> on<00:05:39.780> in<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:39.990> game<00:05:40.020> just<00:05:40.889> by<00:05:41.070> a<00:05:41.099> little

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
early on in the game just by a little

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.159 
early on in the game just by a little
bit<00:05:41.820> i<00:05:42.030> think<00:05:42.599> that<00:05:42.659> is<00:05:42.900> their<00:05:43.050> main

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
bit i think that is their main

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.350 
bit i think that is their main
intentions<00:05:43.650> with<00:05:43.800> that<00:05:44.010> nurse<00:05:44.520> so<00:05:44.849> shouldn't

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
intentions with that nurse so shouldn't

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.969 
intentions with that nurse so shouldn't
affect<00:05:45.630> him<00:05:45.780> overall<00:05:46.229> he's<00:05:46.530> still<00:05:46.770> a<00:05:46.800> good

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
affect him overall he's still a good

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.680 
affect him overall he's still a good
champion<00:05:47.490> but<00:05:47.729> this<00:05:48.000> is<00:05:48.120> just<00:05:48.150> going<00:05:48.419> to<00:05:48.479> kind
