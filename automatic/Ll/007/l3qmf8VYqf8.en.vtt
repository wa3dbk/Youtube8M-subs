00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.750
 we were presented with the university students and in 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.529
 the pit from tokyo to accommodate she had headphones 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.580
 ferenti to a scientific meeting and when 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.560
 the conference began right at the beginning 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.710
 students prepared traditional 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.859
 sweets and various snacks all sorts of cookies 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.230
 who love to eat japan this sweetness 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.100
 was among them can see here 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.690
 she has enough such packing 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.840
 nondescript in principle that is not something 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.370
 nondescript but not screaming but quite so 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.620
 neat transparent you something 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.280
 written in Japanese if you know what 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.530
 it means 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.289
 anyone building write here it costs 104 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.239
 yen and that is in Russian 50 rubles here 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.170
 which is not expensive at all considering 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.989
 that here are three giant things of something 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.830
 special now you will understand what is going on 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.900
 speech when I say especially and just 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.450
 take it literally because 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.610
 that when you take in your hand for the first time 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.320
 when i opened and took this in my hand i 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.860
 honestly scared i even put 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.540
 back and thought it was generally edible 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.369
 because this thing looks very 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.600
 strange as if you take in hand 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.369
 binder mixed with jellyfish and play then 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.280
 I really do not like for very much 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.960
 Russ here and when I touched him to me 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.630
 absolutely did not want to try it I 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.450
 even I removed but I thought I did something no 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.549
 sure and then all the same I decided to take 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.549
 Well, I did not want to sweetie you nastya 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.860
 there was nothing much but have not bought and 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:50.250
 I brought tea colic please tell me 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.899
 I made tea for tea and realized that I was 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.280
 from sweet there is only left 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.630
 such things I decided to try them 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.540
 may I long be like my fear 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.390
 overcame but the more I brought it 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.369
 to myself this little thing so I understood that 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.409
 like it is edible let's not clothes 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.729
 tell for you take in your hand this one 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.350
 fifteen man round 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.570
 she seems to be a little bit 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.850
 and repent in your hands and you see how 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.340
 she's soft now look how easy she is 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.590
 see bends i mean it's just 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.320
 seriously give out slug active 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.570
 jellyfish here and by the way very 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.000
 look like trouble for such a soft find 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.520
 some kind of slimy but she doesn't 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.820
 slips out of hands due to dusting 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:37.470
 her top is so white sprinkled with something 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:40.950
 similar to but i don't know how under by touch 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.060
 like flour but in fact there is such 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.400
 know vanilla 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.920
 type vanilla sprinkles here is the compartment under 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.270
 delicious very so soft but due to 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.860
 this dusting she is out of your hands 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.990
 slips out and so you probably 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.440
 slipped out here but the most interesting 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.930
 starts when you start this thing 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.800
 just try it, I have tried my 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.560
 I want to pass 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.500
 an expert to see exactly the first 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.630
 impression of nibbling because 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.880
 my biting will not be my first 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.980
 cookies already tried it so I 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.970
 I pass on now the expert we have not 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.610
 only between 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.260
 No, this is just serious. 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.930
 first impression chat and which never 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.800
 did not try take samples please 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.800
 tea to drink 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.150
 that is, and the shutdown that you took in hand 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.340
 that as a child we had such an 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.340
 throw wall like lizun lizun up 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.280
 fuke by the way the flour 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.790
 yes it looks like flour can vanilla answer 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.790
 powder 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:16.930
 let the fruit out of life strange 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:20.260
 thing show here this lasted until nut 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:24.480
 it feels like g will be there 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:29.710
 and on top of something like nafarmil from flour 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.480
 wants to give but it is interesting interesting 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.480
 and tasty is not all that she is not very 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:39.370
 like Cherry metaphysics through 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.930
 guys come back to me and me too 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.040
 I 'll tell you now say a few more words on 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.590
 about these sweets 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.300
 I also know when the feather tasted 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.060
 I think I had a face out than 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.650
 it looks like maybe you 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.080
 frowned more what the first 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.090
 the impression is just what it is what it was 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.830
 fear but as you prescribe here 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.080
 this white thing first and inside 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.660
 some kind of brown appears 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.060
 the substance is strange here is this 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:11.820
 the brown substance reminds me 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:14.820
 something figs mixed with nuts with 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.820
 by some 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.690
 maybe dates 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.860
 more like a date well, that is, it 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:31.540
 very strange so with this one this 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.760
 brown stuff like pasta like that 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.650
 some kind of fasting here and 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.290
 we have sweeter let her give proper 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.410
 the taste here is this white garbage r reconciliation she 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:48.560
 almost tasteless but slightly 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:52.880
 a little taste of her is difficult 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:55.120
 understandable taste of neutral marmalade 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:00.170
 sugar free here before or 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:02.060
 explain it when i seem white by 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.830
 tastes like flour 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.980
 what's in the flour 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:09.740
 Well, here is such a sweet traditional 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:13.880
 Probably Japanese 1 stroller you not she 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.560
 somehow I didn't like it very much but the second one 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.480
 already ate with great pleasure and 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.920
 now i'm already the third one waiting for me 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.260
 I want to eat it very much 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.750
 I liked it once I tried it 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.740
 dumplings

 try will be bound to 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.270

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.910
