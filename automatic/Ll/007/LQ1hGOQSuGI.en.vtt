play<00:02:34.700> just<00:02:35.060> as<00:02:35.239> much<00:02:35.420> as<00:02:35.629> I<00:02:35.750> do<00:02:35.810> when<00:02:36.650> I

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
play just as much as I do when I

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.289 
play just as much as I do when I
actually<00:02:36.980> did<00:02:37.340> get<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.640> gameplay<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.150> that's

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
actually did get the gameplay and that's

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.330 
actually did get the gameplay and that's
the<00:02:38.420> unfortunate<00:02:38.569> thing<00:02:39.140> about<00:02:39.200> titanfall<00:02:39.950> is

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
the unfortunate thing about titanfall is

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.970 
the unfortunate thing about titanfall is
it<00:02:40.909> doesn't<00:02:41.239> really<00:02:41.450> get<00:02:41.690> as<00:02:41.900> much<00:02:42.140> views<00:02:42.709> as

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
it doesn't really get as much views as

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.440 
it doesn't really get as much views as
call<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.430> duty<00:02:43.700> i<00:02:43.730> mean<00:02:44.000> i<00:02:44.120> know<00:02:44.180> that's

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
call of duty i mean i know that's

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.809 
call of duty i mean i know that's
relatable<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.620> fact<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.700> a

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
relatable to the fact that it's a

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.910 
relatable to the fact that it's a
console<00:02:47.269> exclusive<00:02:47.780> at<00:02:47.930> least<00:02:48.079> what<00:02:48.500> on<00:02:48.650> quote

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
console exclusive at least what on quote

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.670 
console exclusive at least what on quote
they<00:02:49.099> call<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.519> console<00:02:49.910> exclusives

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
they call the console exclusives

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.530 
they call the console exclusives
exclusive<00:02:51.680> i<00:02:51.799> can't<00:02:51.980> even<00:02:52.040> talk<00:02:52.400> right<00:02:52.540> saying

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
exclusive i can't even talk right saying

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.869 
exclusive i can't even talk right saying
too<00:02:53.690> many<00:02:53.840> words<00:02:54.019> too<00:02:54.319> fast<00:02:54.590> but<00:02:55.370> they<00:02:55.519> call<00:02:55.849> it

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
too many words too fast but they call it

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.330 
too many words too fast but they call it
that<00:02:56.150> but<00:02:56.329> it<00:02:56.450> still<00:02:56.629> is<00:02:56.780> out<00:02:56.930> for<00:02:57.079> a<00:02:57.109> pc<00:02:57.590> but<00:02:58.250> i

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
that but it still is out for a pc but i

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.949 
that but it still is out for a pc but i
know<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.489> lot<00:02:58.579> of<00:02:58.760> like<00:02:59.030> PlayStation<00:02:59.510> users

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
know a lot of like PlayStation users

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.930 
know a lot of like PlayStation users
don't<00:03:00.140> want<00:03:00.799> to<00:03:00.859> watch<00:03:00.980> titanfall<00:03:01.430> because

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
don't want to watch titanfall because

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.030 
don't want to watch titanfall because
they<00:03:02.180> can't<00:03:02.540> necessarily<00:03:03.079> get<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.859> game

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
they can't necessarily get the game

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.729 
they can't necessarily get the game
which<00:03:04.310> is<00:03:04.340> very<00:03:04.670> unfortunate<00:03:05.030> because

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
which is very unfortunate because

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.780 
which is very unfortunate because
personally<00:03:06.739> I've<00:03:06.950> set<00:03:07.159> it<00:03:07.190> in<00:03:07.400> previous

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
personally I've set it in previous

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.699 
personally I've set it in previous
videos<00:03:07.940> it's<00:03:08.359> a<00:03:08.510> fun<00:03:08.870> game<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.140> play<00:03:09.319> it's

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
videos it's a fun game to play it's

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.280 
videos it's a fun game to play it's
super<00:03:10.310> action<00:03:10.489> packed<00:03:10.909> and<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.209> think<00:03:12.170> it's

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
super action packed and I think it's

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.899 
super action packed and I think it's
more<00:03:12.349> fun<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.739> watch<00:03:12.950> think<00:03:13.370> call<00:03:13.549> of<00:03:13.609> duty<00:03:13.819> but

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
more fun to watch think call of duty but

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.819 
more fun to watch think call of duty but
