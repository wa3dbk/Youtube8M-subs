00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.109
 such a problem spotlight lighting 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.000
 I bought a set no matter what 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:36.809
 so we decided the question as follows 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.390
 took a spotlight worth $ 4 by 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.850

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.899

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.750
 show wreath is usually all that long ago 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.840
 found about 5 dollars 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.630
 this all made such a rack you do not 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.790
 offered to buy a rack for some reason he 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.909
 says manat package newt 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.350
 rummaging through the internet we found out the prices are 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:23.570
 gave 25 3 dollars which is unacceptable took 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.520
 a piece of metal pipe 20 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:32.869

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:46.360

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:49.670
 worn by pipe 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.590
 twist any position then by 10 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.230
 hole 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.440
 all and just as the spotlight above-below 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:01.370
 regulated here already included 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.790
 the switch stands steady fairly in 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.580
 overall we liked you ask why 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.660
 to regulate with you the situation was 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.900
 offer is not worth that joined him 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.120
 definitely height and being shot but 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.780
 this causes such a problem 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.450
 problem with shadows 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.860
 if the spotlight is taller than you 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.010
 a shadow appears above 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.010
 if it is below you will have wanted 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.320

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.840
