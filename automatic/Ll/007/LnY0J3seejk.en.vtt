00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
um your healer level is the main thing

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.680 
um your healer level is the main thing
that<00:02:13.730> decides<00:02:14.540> how<00:02:15.320> much<00:02:15.530> healthier<00:02:15.980> heal

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
that decides how much healthier heal

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.500 
that decides how much healthier heal
level<00:02:17.690> one<00:02:17.840> year<00:02:18.050> heal<00:02:18.260> 100<00:02:18.650> points<00:02:19.330> level<00:02:20.330> two

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
level one year heal 100 points level two

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.560 
level one year heal 100 points level two
is<00:02:20.600> I'm<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:20.990> 50<00:02:21.320> level<00:02:21.650> 3<00:02:21.890> it's<00:02:22.610> 200

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
is I'm in the 50 level 3 it's 200

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.490 
is I'm in the 50 level 3 it's 200
I<00:02:23.600> think<00:02:24.410> level<00:02:25.100> 4<00:02:25.340> it's<00:02:25.460> 250<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:27.020> level<00:02:27.290> 5

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
I think level 4 it's 250 and level 5

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.800 
I think level 4 it's 250 and level 5
it's<00:02:27.770> 350<00:02:28.670> life<00:02:28.850> are<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.450> here

it's 350 life are you here

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.320 
it's 350 life are you here
so<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:30.650> thinking<00:02:31.460> of<00:02:31.550> sticking<00:02:31.850> around<00:02:32.060> at

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
so you thinking of sticking around at

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.820 
so you thinking of sticking around at
bar<00:02:32.480> betting<00:02:32.750> us<00:02:32.840> off<00:02:32.960> for<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.200> long<00:02:33.350> time<00:02:33.560> I

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
bar betting us off for a long time I

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.040 
bar betting us off for a long time I
highly<00:02:34.550> recommend<00:02:34.670> leveling<00:02:35.600> up<00:02:35.720> your<00:02:35.750> heal

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
this one not only if you are much more

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.290 
this one not only if you are much more
desire<00:02:42.140> for<00:02:42.560> another<00:02:43.310> person<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.850> get<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.150> in

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
desire for another person to get you in

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.600 
desire for another person to get you in
their<00:02:44.480> team<00:02:44.720> it'll<00:02:45.680> mean<00:02:45.830> that<00:02:45.860> your<00:02:46.160> job<00:02:46.430> as<00:02:46.580> a

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610

their team it'll mean that your job as a
healer<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:47.180> much<00:02:47.390> easier<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.260> don't<00:02:51.470> forget

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
healer is much easier and I don't forget

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.250 
healer is much easier and I don't forget
to<00:02:51.800> call<00:02:51.950> after<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.280> defender<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.990> healing

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
to call after the defender the healing

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.780 
to call after the defender the healing
if<00:02:54.440> especially<00:02:54.890> if<00:02:54.950> you're<00:02:55.130> alone<00:02:55.340> is<00:02:55.580> quite

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
if especially if you're alone is quite

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.790 
if especially if you're alone is quite
intense<00:02:56.270> because<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:56.720> have<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.930> keep<00:02:57.080> running

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
intense because you have to keep running

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.340 
intense because you have to keep running
around<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.310> killing<00:02:58.850> them<00:02:59.170> poisoning<00:03:00.170> but

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
around and killing them poisoning but

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.500 
around and killing them poisoning but
just<00:03:01.100> take<00:03:01.280> note<00:03:01.460> the<00:03:01.580> defender<00:03:02.120> has<00:03:02.150> still

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
just take note the defender has still

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.090 
just take note the defender has still
has<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.660> job<00:03:02.990> to<00:03:03.110> do<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.470> we<00:03:03.620> can't<00:03:03.860> do<00:03:03.950> his<00:03:04.070> job

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
has a job to do and we can't do his job

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.870 
has a job to do and we can't do his job
if<00:03:04.670> you're<00:03:04.820> not<00:03:05.120> calling<00:03:05.510> out<00:03:05.720> for<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:06.880> I'll

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
if you're not calling out for it I'll

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.130 
if you're not calling out for it I'll
see<00:03:08.030> ya<00:03:08.120> that's<00:03:08.360> pretty<00:03:08.600> much<00:03:08.750> all<00:03:08.900> there<00:03:09.110> is

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
see ya that's pretty much all there is

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.860 
see ya that's pretty much all there is
to<00:03:09.290> healing<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:10.330> probably<00:03:11.330> put<00:03:11.630> a<00:03:11.660> higher

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
to healing I probably put a higher

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.720 
to healing I probably put a higher
priority<00:03:12.200> on<00:03:12.500> healing<00:03:13.190> your<00:03:13.310> teammates

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
priority on healing your teammates

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.610 
priority on healing your teammates
because<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.600> only<00:03:14.780> way<00:03:14.870> to<00:03:14.930> lose<00:03:15.170> by<00:03:15.320> burying

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
because the only way to lose by burying

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.610 
because the only way to lose by burying
a<00:03:15.680> solid<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:16.040> for<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.900> teammate<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:17.930> die<00:03:18.200> or<00:03:18.440> for

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
a solid is for a teammate to die or for

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.890 
a solid is for a teammate to die or for
someone<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:19.010> leave<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:20.239> if<00:03:20.330> you<00:03:20.450> don't<00:03:20.660> heal

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
someone to leave so if you don't heal

someone to leave so if you don't heal
your<00:03:21.230> teammates<00:03:21.590> then<00:03:22.040> they<00:03:22.220> die<00:03:22.430> that's<00:03:23.120> a

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
your teammates then they die that's a

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.449 
your teammates then they die that's a
lot<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.450> never<00:03:23.750> starting<00:03:24.140> here<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:24.560> more

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
lot of never starting here so more

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.490 
lot of never starting here so more
important<00:03:25.880> that<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.720> are<00:03:26.989> ill<00:03:27.320> your

teammates then kill video illness yes so

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.060 
teammates then kill video illness yes so
that's<00:03:34.450> that's<00:03:35.450> healing<00:03:35.600> pretty<00:03:36.470> much<00:03:39.070> its

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
that's that's healing pretty much its

that's that's healing pretty much its
