00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.160
 my name is gerd warrior I am 43 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.690
 years old freelance journalist and author 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.220
 and yes, if not something else 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.800
 then write if I am secretary for 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.200
 the pug's own books 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.180
 creates as our last died 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.320
 we went to the animal shelter had 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.660
 no special at all 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.670
 Imagination does not lie medium in size and 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.620
 Instead, you can see the animals 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.059
 Employees with the six months 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.800
 old amy mob against 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.589
 and somehow there was in the first for me 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.690
 that's it , it was just over 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.860
 at first sight 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.300
 the story is the customer was 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.920
 actually a very spontaneous thing 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.570
 Andy and I will have them at some point 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.230
 always written together every week 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.630
 Friday 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.850
 and that means the swing and meant 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.450
 Pope Column and he shines, however 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.580
 my homepage 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.080
 there is no topic he is in 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.550
 his column does not pick up 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.990
 communicated to the Colombia who turn to 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.300
 example to his adventures with the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.700
 cat but also handles topics like 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.320
 animal lovesickness or how 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.850
 It is incredibly difficult as a pimp 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.380
 day to have safety then 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.540
 a little bit of what's guiding him in so 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.950
 of the week happened so far was 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.420
 Of course, it is also completely clear that it 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.010
 of course football looks and 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.590
 of course the wm witnessed and 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.270
 Two game Netherlands against Argentina 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.650
 is this photo taken at the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.780
 you just so unbelievable 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.570
 sat stretched out and looked 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.090
 A merger has come about that one 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.920
 looks like this column writes that 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.170
 opened just completely different 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.300
 possibilities that has just the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.520
 possibility simply completely free from the 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.650
 liver to say and write something 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.480
 He thinks and I believe that the people 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.070
 the fun is just fun 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.289
 just to look at from his point of view 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.119
 the most beautiful experiences with eddie so 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.920
 are certainly the release of the 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.890
 to mention both books as there has 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.780
 monologues 1 have appeared 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.620
 months later, the second part was 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.000
 Of course, very special moments 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.950
 it but not always real to 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.140
 haut is the giant affirmation of his 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.090
 Readers and fans that starts with that 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.090
 we get an awful lot of mail letters 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.790
 but also presents a sauna reader 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.480
 He has him here even a pullover 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.340
 I always think of self-made knitwear 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.620
 overwhelming and so I was so im 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.700
 never counted on life 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.050
 there are a lot since now 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.900
 on the third part of the moz 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.310
 Monologues wait and I think I'm falling 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.930
 certainly always a something 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.930
 that we can do both together
