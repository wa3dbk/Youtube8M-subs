where<00:01:36.820> you're<00:01:36.940> gonna<00:01:37.090> cut<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:38.110> want<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.320> use

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
where you're gonna cut you want to use

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.740 
where you're gonna cut you want to use
the<00:01:38.619> ruler<00:01:38.979> I<00:01:39.190> didn't<00:01:39.490> have<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.640> ruler<00:01:40.000> so<00:01:40.390> I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
the ruler I didn't have a ruler so I

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.530 
the ruler I didn't have a ruler so I
have<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.080> get<00:01:41.229> crafty<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:41.920> use<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.430> stick<00:01:42.790> but

you<00:01:43.690> just<00:01:43.869> want<00:01:44.050> to<00:01:44.170> go<00:01:44.440> ahead<00:01:44.650> and<00:01:44.800> make<00:01:44.920> two

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
you just want to go ahead and make two

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.580 
you just want to go ahead and make two
lines<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.700> then<00:01:46.240> it's<00:01:46.810> gonna<00:01:46.960> be<00:01:47.170> ready<00:01:47.380> for

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
lines and then it's gonna be ready for

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:56.430 
lines and then it's gonna be ready for
you<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.830> start<00:01:48.160> cutting

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.020 

now<00:01:57.440> this<00:01:57.800> step<00:01:58.070> you<00:01:58.220> actually<00:01:58.580> want<00:01:58.760> to<00:01:58.850> take

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
now this step you actually want to take

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.400 
now this step you actually want to take
your<00:01:59.120> time<00:01:59.390> in<00:01:59.540> the<00:01:59.660> cutting<00:01:59.990> because<00:02:00.140> you

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
your time in the cutting because you

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.620 
your time in the cutting because you
want<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.650> cut<00:02:00.890> right<00:02:01.100> in<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.940> lines<00:02:02.150> you<00:02:02.390> made

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
want to cut right in the lines you made

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.960 
want to cut right in the lines you made
if<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.410> actually<00:02:03.710> messed<00:02:04.130> up<00:02:04.310> on<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:04.640> step

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
if you actually messed up on this step

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.510 
if you actually messed up on this step
your<00:02:05.240> back<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:06.020> gonna<00:02:06.200> be<00:02:06.410> just<00:02:06.650> way<00:02:06.980> too<00:02:07.040> small

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
your back is gonna be just way too small

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.300 
your back is gonna be just way too small
and<00:02:08.000> it's<00:02:08.509> not<00:02:08.840> gonna<00:02:08.990> fit<00:02:09.380> on<00:02:09.649> whatever

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
and it's not gonna fit on whatever

and it's not gonna fit on whatever
you're<00:02:10.640> using<00:02:10.670> as<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.660> brush<00:02:11.960> holder<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:18.290> you

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
you're using as the brush holder so you

have your strip you want to just make
sure<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:20.060> cut<00:02:20.270> around<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.720> edges<00:02:20.930> on<00:02:21.470> just<00:02:21.800> so

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
sure you cut around the edges on just so

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.760 
sure you cut around the edges on just so
you<00:02:22.070> have<00:02:22.310> really<00:02:23.120> nice<00:02:23.300> straight<00:02:23.840> lines<00:02:24.230> and

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
you have really nice straight lines and

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.600 
you have really nice straight lines and
there's<00:02:25.160> no<00:02:26.170> ridges<00:02:27.170> once<00:02:27.590> you're<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.340> put<00:02:28.520> it

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
there's no ridges once you're you put it

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.670 
there's no ridges once you're you put it
together<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.630> here<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.200> just<00:02:30.260> want<00:02:30.560> to

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
together and here you just want to

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.560 
together and here you just want to
measure<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.310> make<00:02:31.430> sure<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.090> length<00:02:32.270> is

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
measure and make sure that the length is

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.280 
measure and make sure that the length is
right<00:02:32.840> before<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:33.500> apply<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.860> glue<00:02:35.020> so<00:02:36.020> with

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
right before you apply the glue so with

right before you apply the glue so with
your<00:02:36.470> sponge<00:02:36.890> brush<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.610> if<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:37.850> can<00:02:38.030> tell

way make up making strokes don't over
glue<00:03:13.580> your<00:03:13.790> thing<00:03:14.120> especially<00:03:14.690> because<00:03:15.200> you

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
glue your thing especially because you

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.530 
glue your thing especially because you
add<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.530> coat<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.220> paper<00:03:16.549> but<00:03:17.269> you<00:03:17.360> just

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
add a coat to the paper but you just

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.150 
add a coat to the paper but you just
want<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.780> go<00:03:17.930> around<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.560> make<00:03:18.650> sure<00:03:19.010> you

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
want to go around and make sure you

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.430 
want to go around and make sure you
don't<00:03:19.310> get<00:03:19.519> it<00:03:19.670> all<00:03:19.700> over<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.269> place<00:03:20.420> if<00:03:21.380> you

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
don't get it all over the place if you

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.120 
don't get it all over the place if you
do<00:03:22.010> get<00:03:22.580> it<00:03:22.760> like<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.180> did<00:03:23.660> you<00:03:24.620> can<00:03:24.650> go<00:03:24.920> back

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
do get it like I did you can go back

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.710 
do get it like I did you can go back
with<00:03:25.160> your<00:03:25.430> finger<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.000> wipe<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.330> off<00:03:26.480> really

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
with your finger and wipe it off really

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.220 
with your finger and wipe it off really
quick<00:03:27.080> because<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.830> glue<00:03:28.040> is<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.850> know<00:03:28.970> not

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
quick because the glue is you know not

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.110 
quick because the glue is you know not
dry<00:03:30.230> yet<00:03:30.440> so<00:03:30.799> it'll<00:03:31.160> be<00:03:31.250> easier<00:03:31.670> for<00:03:31.970> you<00:03:32.090> to

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
dry yet so it'll be easier for you to

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.680 
dry yet so it'll be easier for you to
take<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.720> off<00:03:32.840> now<00:03:33.739> this<00:03:34.070> part<00:03:34.549> is<00:03:34.820> crucial<00:03:35.239> you

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
take it off now this part is crucial you

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.590 
take it off now this part is crucial you
guys<00:03:35.900> out<00:03:36.350> of<00:03:37.340> everything<00:03:37.910> this<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.090> probably

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
guys out of everything this is probably

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.710 
guys out of everything this is probably
what<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:39.230> takes<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.769> longest<00:03:40.160> because<00:03:40.720> you

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
what it takes the longest because you

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.870 
what it takes the longest because you
don't<00:03:41.930> want<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.500> get<00:03:42.680> any<00:03:42.890> air<00:03:43.190> bubbles<00:03:43.670> so

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
don't want to get any air bubbles so

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.390 
don't want to get any air bubbles so
once<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.329> set<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.720> paper<00:03:44.930> like<00:03:45.320> here<00:03:45.920> you

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
once you set the paper like here you

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.830 
once you set the paper like here you
want<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.670> make<00:03:46.850> sure<00:03:46.880> you're<00:03:47.239> pushing<00:03:47.810> down

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
want to make sure you're pushing down

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.650 
want to make sure you're pushing down
you<00:03:48.380> will<00:03:48.590> fill<00:03:48.980> on<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.820> paper<00:03:50.060> move<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.510> little

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
you will fill on the paper move a little

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.330 
you will fill on the paper move a little
bit<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.140> you<00:03:51.260> see<00:03:51.290> how<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:51.680> got<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.920> little<00:03:52.130> bit

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
bit and you see how I got a little bit

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.289 
bit and you see how I got a little bit
of<00:03:52.459> glue<00:03:52.670> there

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
of glue there

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.569 
of glue there
don't<00:03:53.840> worry<00:03:54.079> because<00:03:54.320> Mod<00:03:54.829> Podge<00:03:55.220> is

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
don't worry because Mod Podge is

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.509 
don't worry because Mod Podge is
actually<00:03:56.299> a<00:03:56.810> clear<00:03:57.350> glue<00:03:57.620> so<00:03:58.010> it<00:03:58.040> will<00:03:58.250> dry

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
actually a clear glue so it will dry

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.180 
actually a clear glue so it will dry
clear<00:03:58.940> but<00:03:59.750> you<00:03:59.870> want<00:04:00.079> to<00:04:00.140> make<00:04:00.350> sure<00:04:00.380> as

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
clear but you want to make sure as

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.220 
clear but you want to make sure as
you're<00:04:01.430> putting<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.850> strip<00:04:02.150> around<00:04:02.329> you're

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
you're putting the strip around you're

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.620 
you're putting the strip around you're
pressing<00:04:03.680> down

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
pressing down
