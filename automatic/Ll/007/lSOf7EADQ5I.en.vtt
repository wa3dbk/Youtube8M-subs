00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.320
 I got home in the morning to start the car 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.070
 simply does not handle 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.829
 calling the tg service or 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.100
 assistance since the car was not 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.510
 calling and called towing service and 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.470
 They said it was going to take about 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.390
 one hour and if it was found that the 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.309
 would in fact be entitled to a 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.920
 Taxi up to five kilometers my 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.210
 I work I had to ask if I 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.629
 they had the right to service they did not 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.180
 offered is in the user manual 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:57.159
 of racist beans as it is hard about 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.239
 one hour for the tow truck 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.640
 arrived 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.670
 I just called the port insurance company. 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.070
 safe and request assistance from them and 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.640
 they ended up coming first they end up 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:14.500
 It is faster and then the mechanical them 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.600
 came to hit the key only on time 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.650
 that gave some spikes on the accelerator and 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.439
 car ended up calling and what people 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.110
 he concluded that the problem was in the 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.799
 cold start system 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.049
 also called flex start assembler 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.130
 who does not use the petrol tank 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.170
 when you are fueled with ethanol 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.060
 in the case that must have occurred is that the 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.310
 fuel has grown on the line 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.710
 but it was not injected and then when the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.649
 throttle pressed in the ignition 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.060
 fuel your subtitled 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.850
 ends up being strange because when the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.130
 automaker released this system of 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.109
 dispensing pack abs 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.909
 they did a test where to put a 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:00.939
 vehicle fueled with ethanol 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.460
 a refrigerated truck should have around 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:08.470
 minus 10 and the first vehicle called 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.470
 It's strange, it's my job.
