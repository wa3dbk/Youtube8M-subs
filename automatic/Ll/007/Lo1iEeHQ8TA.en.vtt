00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.230
 This time I'm bringing you 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.330
 some Xbox games van but the illustrious

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.039
 You 're a good team boxer, that's right. 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.590
 the guys are to get it now do it for 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.450
 time I do not say acquired clip that 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.850
 Thanks to a friend of mine I was able to change the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.140
 strength in a game that is cool but 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.809
 naples hilton 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.329
 I changed the right was triumphant 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.700
 quite anxious about him not to open 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.510
 still enjoy here and we will open 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.510
 together with you 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.510
 beautiful beauty very sophos cape 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.240
 available is indifferent think who 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.450
 has the triumph been by media is media 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.360
 because it is the same as 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.740
 disregard let's say a box use it for 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.740
 inside to do with money 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:36.570
 from scratch with the movie screens 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.130
 We took and that here is a person well 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.640
 logical no media 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.070
 it comes what two days of live gold 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.930
 Wow, thank you, I do not know. 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.530
 which I would do without two days off lay off 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.630
 road but this is the tyson fao sure I will 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.580
 try to make some game play it up 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.680
 because I still do not understand how to record 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.360
 with the xbox street but at the time the tire 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.940
 Of course I 'll be bringing anyone 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.310
 between each game said something a 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.899
 little different surface beauty but that's the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.319
 text was to show a little of others 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.200
 games that proex boxe human stock 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:13.230
 another game that is a metal gear solid of 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.019
 five times the ground use it's a game 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.940
 which is somewhat small but he 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.010
 was done with a base in the tutorial for 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.380
 the next metal game says it will leave 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.170
 if it is that year that I defend a 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.760
 Time I did not play, but I know. 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.700
 which is small because of comments 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.950
 It's time for the galactic to do 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.510
 something for you, too, beauty 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.500
 So this is one of the games I'm 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.500
 here on the street webmotors 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:46.620
 another game very cool show is this 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:50.040
 from here several garden ngs sep effect 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.130
 this game guys it is very very very 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.690
 awesome series awesome it's over 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.269
 so let's just say that my expectations 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.730
 because I used to think it was a game 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.040
 well child is well nothing to see but in 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.190
 truth is not a very nice game it 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.920
 style fps this here is logical that he 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.780
 appears girl person asked to fpf because 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.760
 I compare basf with a code that it 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.250
 Who's the motor on the side of the woods kills the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.799
 The staff is very nice and so are 12 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.340
 against two players and it's just the 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.870
 cntl sure does not have campaign is well ford 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.730
 ka although there are some 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.100
 children in chats playing this 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.530
 influences both the shape that was 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.910
 made the game is a fun and 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.230
 take action is very cool 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.960
 sep then this raise several shades o 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.410
 other game teams occurred halfway through 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.240
 oo was aires 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.160
 hardsoft romita person was the most play 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.080
 awesome that I found when they 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.330
 announced the xbox lan 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.160
 but I did not have the opportunity to have 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.260
 I pick up at the beginning and now that I 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.110
 I picked up on this game is very intuitive 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.570
 In fact it was the first one I ended up in already 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.310
 I shut the king's campaign and I found 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.140
 Very impressive 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.990
 I think something is another one that 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.680
 leaves to be desired but not but it is a game 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.040
 good 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.070
 The plot follows not many 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.840
 defects the suggestion of punks what leaves 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.030
 to wish, let's say I wanted 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.700
 are few things right with 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.100
 example the character senses movements 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.230
 repeated does not have much say is 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.720
 choose a lot of freedom but with 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.720
 photography and history the bank inaccuracy 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.000
 excel bellfield 4 right 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:37.780
 the personal movie in the game is nothing 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.420
 world knows and neither did I see that I 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.550
 I thought it was cool, let's say to 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.830
 the new generation is cool I did not play 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.410
 in the portway four clear in the vehicle to pc 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.980
 but for xbox or he's pretty cool 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.860
 let's say the next for the old generation 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.720
 that he even left open there right now that the demo 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.030
 For you to play online he was very 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.070
 bad to know he was rich he did 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.900
 that beto made me not like 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.980
 the game made me do not get it 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:09.010
 for the old generation that was in ours is 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:12.580
 xbox 360 and playstation 4 but already for 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:15.190
 new generation pro xbox one he is very 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.320
 cool graphics so awesome sure the 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.620
 bugs that can not say no 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:24.190
 there are few but the players playing the 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:28.030
 very incredible people are 60 now I am 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:31.240
 64 the right number on each side ers 32 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.830
 So it's a lot of people, even for a 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.680
 game as soon as we had almost no 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.000
 no players are playing this I think 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.930
 that 's cool 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.150
 let's only check if it's really only 66 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.320
 player that he says here in the 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.140
 capital back then 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.900
 the name leaves 20 but that's it 's a game 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.330
 well cool fps and I have always liked it more 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.580
 code style so it's a good match 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.250
 Faster though but also underwood 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.100
 him in the field because it is too 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.080
 Nice people, people, he's fine. 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.940
 It's really cool that the code is 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.530
 can say it right but let's go 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.000
 wait to see the next one that will be the 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.550
 rally can not stay a while 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.240
 better but more this battlefield 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.030
 It's really cool, huh? 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.670
 and here last and not least 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:22.060
 assassin's creed black flag is this 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.980
 game're amazing SMTU Edith some 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.190
 relief in commission and special vessel 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:29.410
 many of you may have already closed 360 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.490
 even the ample that I do not play current tone 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.990
 say so 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.330
 but for me it's being amazing because I 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.400
 I did not play in the old generation, I just 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.080
 I picked up the new one now and he's there. 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.330
 surprising enough because I'm a 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.000
 big fan of the movie pirates of the caribbean by 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.580
 example and in this game is for example that 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.380
 pirate you experience enough thing 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.720
 What would you like to see in the movie he 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.090
 Can you do it then, I found it very cool. 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.490
 It's the crowd and it's a game that I 'm 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.410
 currently playing is not playing near 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.720
 close on nothing because I picked it up 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:03.250
 A short time but we'll see what's going to happen 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:06.310
 the unfolding of this beauty in the most was 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.840
 That's it for folks, it's these games. 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.430
 that I would like to show you, will you? 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.280
 show now why when I made a 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.800
 boxing stoned am not given time 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:17.080
 demonstrate then I worked out together with 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.970
 Telethon boxing miss was simple 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.550
 not a special edition is not just a 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.440
 normal game even then I already looked in the 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.860
 extend a little show these games 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:30.610
 for you serve so that's what I 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:32.980
 I wanted to know who is present leaves

 because we will try good base channel and 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.280
 Back to the galley 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.660
 a hug everyone who continues 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.660
 accompanying and until the next
