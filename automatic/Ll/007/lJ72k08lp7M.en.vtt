00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.710
 control or phone calls but the you 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.670

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.670
 it's really good 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.179

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.240
 kick it drop and coke wake up you 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.329

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.329
 difference 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.300
 so well you saw the fight at 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.310
 rites much longer and you 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.340

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.989
 the mouth now to the ben you then 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.360
 have seen the quickdrop it can really 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.370
 to tell the difference between them but 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.950
 against a person who control the lot 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.900
 which is long but it's really worth you 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.310
 helped to win a lot more fights 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.900
 so here I'm going to show you how that 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.160
 is quick drop that the villain 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.660
 little world rick and it was all but 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.260
 I was able to show how you are going in 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.319
 your controls and for that to drop 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.780
 instead of m 2 q you put one and 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.470
 this way like where are you going to support 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.580
 on two but you're going to eat on 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.019
 your only normal then when you 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.060
 come back on a ca is worth that bay view 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.269
 you pressed a the thing that you 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.680
 hold your ferr dropper and then you 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.090
 go back will be the host was normal 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.769
 except that what you get in your 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.079
 mail after eating a shock so the 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.250
 flight are going to be rhdp so it's like that 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.440
 that it works it's great it's even that 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.880
 would be automatically apart do by 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.579
 example must be careful 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.980
 two times twice his sword otherwise 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:25.239
 26th after one time you missed your 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.769
