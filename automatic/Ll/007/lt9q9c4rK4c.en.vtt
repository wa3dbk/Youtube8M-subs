on the video I did a while ago showing
you<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.520> little<00:00:05.670> hook<00:00:06.000> there<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.390> made<00:00:06.690> for<00:00:07.109> the

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 
you a little hook there I made for the

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.580 
you a little hook there I made for the
dividing<00:00:09.000> head<00:00:09.030> about<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.870> boat<00:00:10.170> circle

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590

layout<00:00:10.920> on<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.280> digital<00:00:11.670> readout<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.320> if<00:00:13.320> you

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
layout on the digital readout and if you

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.470 
layout on the digital readout and if you
like<00:00:13.620> me<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.160> never<00:00:14.340> really<00:00:14.700> fooled<00:00:15.089> with<00:00:15.299> any

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
like me I never really fooled with any

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.769 
like me I never really fooled with any
of<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.630> stuff<00:00:15.870> other<00:00:16.109> than<00:00:16.139> just<00:00:16.410> using<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
of the stuff other than just using the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.939 
of the stuff other than just using the
digital<00:00:18.779> readout<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.410> get<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> certain

digital readout to get to a certain
point<00:00:20.310> or<00:00:20.609> marked<00:00:20.880> 0<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.869> know<00:00:21.990> go<00:00:22.199> out<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
point or marked 0 and you know go out a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.529 
point or marked 0 and you know go out a
certain<00:00:22.680> length<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.760> depth<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.300> kind

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
certain length and depth and that kind

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.150 
certain length and depth and that kind
of<00:00:24.570> stuff<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:25.320> wanted<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.680> show<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.890> how<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
of stuff I wanted to show you how the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.660 
of stuff I wanted to show you how the
boat<00:00:26.910> circle<00:00:27.330> deal<00:00:27.480> works<00:00:27.750> here<00:00:28.369> if<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.490> look

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
boat circle deal works here if you look

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.820 
boat circle deal works here if you look
at<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.119> got<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.300> boat<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:31.199> says<00:00:31.470> boat

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
at it it's got a boat that says boat

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.569 
at it it's got a boat that says boat
death<00:00:33.050> we're<00:00:34.050> gonna<00:00:34.230> hit<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.410> button<00:00:34.800> amount

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
death we're gonna hit that button amount

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.119 
death we're gonna hit that button amount
of<00:00:35.700> holes<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.300> type<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.750> like<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> last<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:38.040> I

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
of holes you type in like the last one I

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.190 
of holes you type in like the last one I
did<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.579> six<00:00:38.910> holes<00:00:40.550> enter<00:00:42.079> centered<00:00:43.079> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
did with six holes enter centered and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.110 
did with six holes enter centered and
now<00:00:43.290> when<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.530> says<00:00:43.739> Center<00:00:44.190> what<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.910> want<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
now when it says Center what you want to

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.240 
now when it says Center what you want to
do<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.360> or<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.350> start<00:00:46.620> Center<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
do is or what I do is start Center the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.500 
do is or what I do is start Center the
part<00:00:47.489> I'm<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.850> drill<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.120> bolt<00:00:48.300> circle

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
part I'm going to drill the bolt circle

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.330 
part I'm going to drill the bolt circle
in<00:00:48.809> we're<00:00:49.770> gonna<00:00:49.920> hit<00:00:50.070> X<00:00:51.829> enter<00:00:52.829> which<00:00:53.309> is

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
in we're gonna hit X enter which is

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.450 
in we're gonna hit X enter which is
Center<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.300> Y<00:00:54.800> enter<00:00:55.800> which<00:00:56.010> centers

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
Center and then Y enter which centers

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:07.880 
Center and then Y enter which centers
that<00:00:59.210> hit<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.300> again<00:01:02.449> except<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.690> inner<00:01:06.890> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that hit it again except the inner you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.300 
that hit it again except the inner you
know<00:01:08.070> we're<00:01:08.369> senator<00:01:09.680> radius<00:01:10.680> that's<00:01:10.979> gonna

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
know we're senator radius that's gonna

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.550 
know we're senator radius that's gonna
be<00:01:11.490> half<00:01:12.000> your<00:01:12.270> circle<00:01:12.659> obviously<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.439> you

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
be half your circle obviously so if you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.520 
be half your circle obviously so if you
got<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> say<00:01:14.580> six<00:01:15.060> inch<00:01:15.299> bolt<00:01:15.630> circle<00:01:15.869> we'll<00:01:16.350> put

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
got a say six inch bolt circle we'll put

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.020 
got a say six inch bolt circle we'll put
in<00:01:16.650> three<00:01:17.070> inches<00:01:17.460> which<00:01:17.640> would<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
in three inches which would be the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.770 
in three inches which would be the
radius<00:01:19.580> enter<00:01:21.350> start<00:01:22.350> angle<00:01:22.850> zero<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.330> my<00:01:24.360> meal

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
radius enter start angle zero on my meal

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.620 
radius enter start angle zero on my meal
is<00:01:25.020> actually<00:01:25.409> three<00:01:25.619> o'clock<00:01:25.979> some<00:01:26.640> l0d<00:01:27.390> gonna

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
is actually three o'clock some l0d gonna

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.530 
is actually three o'clock some l0d gonna
be<00:01:27.720> 12<00:01:27.930> o'clock<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.909> takes<00:01:29.909> I've<00:01:30.119> started<00:01:30.390> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
be 12 o'clock but takes I've started a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.030 
be 12 o'clock but takes I've started a
certain<00:01:30.840> place<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.439> put<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> start

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
certain place you can put in the start

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.499 
certain place you can put in the start
angle<00:01:33.409> enter<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.619> then<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.430> hit<00:01:35.640> boat<00:01:36.119> use

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
angle enter and then we hit boat use

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.340 
angle enter and then we hit boat use
hold<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.290> enter<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.210> now<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.960> zero

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
hold one enter and now all we do is zero

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.370 
hold one enter and now all we do is zero
the<00:01:40.500> X<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.890> y-axis<00:01:41.009> drilled<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.000> hole<00:01:42.170> if<00:01:43.170> we

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the X and y-axis drilled a hole if we

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.690 
the X and y-axis drilled a hole if we
get<00:01:43.530> done<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.890> whole<00:01:44.189> hole<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.210> enter

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
get done with that whole hole to enter

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.210 
get done with that whole hole to enter
same<00:01:47.700> thing<00:01:48.000> again<00:01:48.270> zero<00:01:48.720> X<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.140> y-axis<00:01:49.290> done

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
same thing again zero X and y-axis done

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.260 
same thing again zero X and y-axis done
with<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.520> whole<00:01:50.700> old<00:01:51.570> 3<00:01:52.049> enter<00:01:52.970> same<00:01:53.970> deal

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
with that whole old 3 enter same deal

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.080 
with that whole old 3 enter same deal
zero<00:01:54.720> X<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.110> y-axis<00:01:55.229> drill<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> hole<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.850> so

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
zero X and y-axis drill the hole and so

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.870 
zero X and y-axis drill the hole and so
on<00:01:57.299> before<00:01:57.570> they<00:01:58.469> roll<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.640> wanted

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
on before they roll it so I just wanted

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.289 
on before they roll it so I just wanted
to<00:01:59.969> give<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.119> an<00:02:00.210> idea<00:02:00.740> before<00:02:01.740> I've<00:02:02.299> realized

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
to give you an idea before I've realized

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.179 
to give you an idea before I've realized
my<00:02:03.479> digital<00:02:03.990> readout<00:02:04.229> did<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.649> I'd<00:02:04.890> go<00:02:04.920> to

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
my digital readout did this I'd go to

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.839 
my digital readout did this I'd go to
practical<00:02:05.759> machine<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.180> calm<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.049> type<00:02:07.259> in

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
practical machine is calm and type in

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.940 
practical machine is calm and type in
boat<00:02:08.849> circle<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.750> start<00:02:10.110> angle<00:02:10.500> all<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
boat circle and start angle all that and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.660 
boat circle and start angle all that and
they<00:02:11.009> would<00:02:11.129> actually<00:02:11.220> give<00:02:11.550> me<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
they would actually give me the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.290 
they would actually give me the
coordinates<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.390> come<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.959> like

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
coordinates not come to it like

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.070 
coordinates not come to it like
but<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.740> definitely<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:15.070> lot<00:02:15.190> easier<00:02:15.610> so

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
but this is definitely a lot easier so

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.060 
but this is definitely a lot easier so
just<00:02:17.080> figure<00:02:17.230> something<00:02:17.350> out<00:02:17.650> there<00:02:17.890> might

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
just figure something out there might

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.800 
just figure something out there might
not<00:02:18.250> know<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.820> your<00:02:19.030> digital<00:02:19.330> readout<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.720> do

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
not know that your digital readout to do

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.360 
not know that your digital readout to do
that<00:02:20.020> because<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.410> didn't<00:02:20.680> for<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> while<00:02:21.010> so

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
that because I didn't for a while so

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.090 
that because I didn't for a while so
focus<00:02:22.270> might<00:02:22.480> help<00:02:22.660> somebody<00:02:22.960> thanks<00:02:23.860> from

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
focus might help somebody thanks from

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.230 
focus might help somebody thanks from
ni'mal<00:02:24.670> machine<00:02:25.000> shop<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:25.330> Pensacola
