snowboarding turn techniques for this

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.860 
snowboarding turn techniques for this
you're<00:00:10.650> going<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.920> need<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> snowboard<00:00:11.870> turn

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
you're going to need a snowboard turn

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.690 
you're going to need a snowboard turn
techniques<00:00:13.380> on<00:00:13.590> snowboards<00:00:14.160> can<00:00:14.400> basically

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
techniques on snowboards can basically

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.470 
techniques on snowboards can basically
be<00:00:15.330> addressed<00:00:16.109> by<00:00:16.890> breaking<00:00:17.490> down<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.880> turns

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
be addressed by breaking down the turns

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.570 
be addressed by breaking down the turns
into<00:00:19.430> four<00:00:20.430> groups<00:00:20.910> or<00:00:21.300> families<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:22.170> turns

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
into four groups or families of turns

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.740 
into four groups or families of turns
each<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.910> two<00:00:24.570> types<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.680> turns<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.750> have

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
each of two types of turns you have

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.710 
each of two types of turns you have
skidded<00:00:28.140> turns<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.680> carve<00:00:29.429> turns<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.060> each

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
skidded turns and carve turns and each

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.840 
skidded turns and carve turns and each
of<00:00:31.080> those<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.890> be<00:00:31.920> either<00:00:32.369> basic<00:00:32.940> or<00:00:33.350> dynamic

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
of those can be either basic or dynamic

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.660 
of those can be either basic or dynamic
skidded<00:00:35.850> turns<00:00:36.120> are<00:00:36.420> defined<00:00:37.380> as<00:00:37.710> turns<00:00:38.309> where

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
skidded turns are defined as turns where

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.090 
skidded turns are defined as turns where
the<00:00:38.790> tail<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> board<00:00:39.660> does<00:00:40.379> not<00:00:40.649> follow

to apply dynamic versus basic to each of
those<00:00:57.660> turns<00:00:58.070> you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.309> use<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.969> definitions

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
those turns you can use the definitions

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.560 
those turns you can use the definitions
