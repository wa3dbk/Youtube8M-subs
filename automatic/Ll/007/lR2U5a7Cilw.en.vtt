about me touching their mugs at work
figured<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.899> really<00:00:52.320> quickly<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> needed

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
figured out really quickly that I needed

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.100 
figured out really quickly that I needed
to<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.730> buy<00:00:53.879> my<00:00:54.090> own<00:00:54.270> box<00:00:54.480> people<00:00:54.780> weren't

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
to go and buy my own box people weren't

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.200 
to go and buy my own box people weren't
just<00:00:55.410> having<00:00:55.559> me<00:00:56.039> touching<00:00:56.430> their<00:00:56.640> mug<00:00:57.030> and

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
just having me touching their mug and

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.060 
just having me touching their mug and
drinking<00:00:57.539> out<00:00:57.660> their<00:00:57.899> mugs<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.530> went<00:00:58.980> out

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
drinking out their mugs so I went out

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.470 
drinking out their mugs so I went out
and<00:00:59.219> bought<00:00:59.340> myself<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.910> massive<00:01:00.270> mug

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
and bought myself a massive mug

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.900 
and bought myself a massive mug
theoretically<00:01:01.230> when<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.859> put<00:01:02.190> water<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.670> there

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
theoretically when I put water in there

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.670 
theoretically when I put water in there
I<00:01:03.030> kind<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.420> half<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:04.409> actually

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
I kind of half in it but that's actually

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.130 
I kind of half in it but that's actually
like<00:01:05.040> two<00:01:05.339> cups<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.970> tea<00:01:06.030> because<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.049> a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
like two cups of tea because it's a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.530 
like two cups of tea because it's a
really<00:01:07.470> big<00:01:07.680> mug<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.790> would<00:01:09.000> count<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.330> as

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
really big mug so I would count that as

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.000 
really big mug so I would count that as
two<00:01:09.750> cups<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.200> want<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.830> work

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
two cups that you want to get to work

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.560 
two cups that you want to get to work
and<00:01:11.310> then<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.700> lunch<00:01:11.909> I'll<00:01:12.210> probably<00:01:12.390> have

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
and then at lunch I'll probably have

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.399 
and then at lunch I'll probably have
another<00:01:12.600> cup<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.049> tea

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
another cup of tea

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.410 
another cup of tea
and<00:01:13.500> then<00:01:14.070> maybe<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.460> want<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.640> get<00:01:14.760> home<00:01:15.060> I'll

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and then maybe you want to get home I'll

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.880 
and then maybe you want to get home I'll
like<00:01:15.600> use<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.049> my<00:01:16.200> own<00:01:16.350> mugs<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.799> I'll

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
like use one of my own mugs and I'll

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.450 
like use one of my own mugs and I'll
have<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> different<00:01:17.460> ones<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.090> would<00:01:18.869> say

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
have a different ones so I would say

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.999 
have a different ones so I would say
realistically<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.270> 4<00:01:21.659> maybe<00:01:22.229> 5<00:01:22.409> cups

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
realistically I have like 4 maybe 5 cups

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.179 
realistically I have like 4 maybe 5 cups
of<00:01:23.159> tea<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.330> day<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.930> an<00:01:25.409> eye<00:01:25.560> teeth<00:01:25.920> aren't

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
of tea in a day is an eye teeth aren't

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:26.810 
of tea in a day is an eye teeth aren't
cleaned

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
cleaned

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.429 
cleaned
so<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.210> might<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.780> my<00:01:27.930> teeth<00:01:28.170> look<00:01:28.409> yellow

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
so I might do my teeth look yellow

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.210 
so I might do my teeth look yellow
because<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> lot<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.430> tea<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.939> have

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
because a lot of tea that I have

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.410 
because a lot of tea that I have
everything<00:01:32.220> looks<00:01:32.549> white<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.090> camera

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
everything looks white on camera

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.719 
everything looks white on camera
everything<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:34.020> looks<00:01:34.259> really<00:01:34.560> pasty<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.700> I

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
everything just looks really pasty so I

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.590 
everything just looks really pasty so I
I<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.420> tea<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:37.049> lot<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:39.390> what<00:01:39.570> I

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
I have tea a lot of it and then what I

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.350 
I have tea a lot of it and then what I
will<00:01:39.869> do<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.650> will<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.579> might<00:01:42.180> as<00:01:42.329> well

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
will do is I will just I might as well

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.600 
will do is I will just I might as well
just<00:01:42.780> literally<00:01:43.200> put<00:01:43.500> my<00:01:43.649> tea<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.340> sugar

about<00:03:12.630> what<00:03:12.960> my<00:03:13.140> family<00:03:13.590> say<00:03:13.800> when<00:03:14.070> they<00:03:14.190> come

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
about what my family say when they come

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.070 
about what my family say when they come
around<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:14.730> they<00:03:14.850> go<00:03:14.880> let's<00:03:15.450> do<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:15.810> that's

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
around and they go let's do that that's

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.380 
around and they go let's do that that's
British<00:03:16.530> but<00:03:17.220> normally<00:03:17.820> it's<00:03:17.970> things<00:03:18.270> like

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
British but normally it's things like

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.440 
British but normally it's things like
eating<00:03:18.900> scones<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.620> clotted<00:03:20.430> cream<00:03:20.910> and

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
eating scones and clotted cream and

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.540 
eating scones and clotted cream and
stuff<00:03:21.720> like<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:23.040> would<00:03:23.160> basically

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
stuff like that so I would basically

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.790 
stuff like that so I would basically
have<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:24.030> say<00:03:24.239> my<00:03:24.810> favourite<00:03:25.200> pastime<00:03:25.680> is

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800
